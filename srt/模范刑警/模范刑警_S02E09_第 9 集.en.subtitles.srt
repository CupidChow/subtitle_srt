THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,366
Let's think about this again.

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,952
We are rushing into this.

5
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,663
This is our best option.

6
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,790
Please listen to me this time.

7
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,709
I'll take care of it.

8
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,421
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,256
I can't trust you.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,730
"I'm sorry."

11
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,195
Please listen to me this time.

12
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,447
I'll take care of it.

13
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,076
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,535
I can't--

15
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,539
That's the sound
of a seat belt unbuckling.

16
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,293
Woo Tae-ho's seat belt was unfastened
when the accident happened.

17
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,962
But Cheon Na-na had hers on.

18
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:33,593
Cheon Na-na unfastened Woo Tae-Ho's
seat belt on purpose

19
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,887
so that she doesn't die
in the process of killing her husband?

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,849
Or do you think she was
willing to risk her life to kill him?

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,645
Let's say that's true.

22
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,232
But the only proof we have is

23
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,150
the sound of the seat belt unbuckling.

24
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,988
Do you think that's enough
to claim that someone is a killer?

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,788
The police officially announced

26
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,998
that Woo Tae-ho had died
in a car accident.

27
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,459
We learned that the passenger,
Cheon Na-na,

28
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,878
has come into work today.

29
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,049
What's with all these reporters?

30
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,977
I know one of them.
Don't let him see you, he's a pain.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,270
Try contacting her.

32
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,230
-Let's quickly leave if you can't.
-Okay.

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,774
Come on, she won't answer a phone call.

34
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,860
She's probably too distracted for that.

35
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,075
I'm in your building's lobby.
I checked the dashcam footage.

36
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,536
Do you have a moment to talk?

37
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,164
With Woo Tae-ho's sudden death,

38
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,708
the public is focused on the alimony trial

39
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,043
between TJ group and the bereaved family.

40
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,336
In the upcoming trial,

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,883
the reason for their divorce
is expected to be a major issue.

42
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,760
Did Hui-ju have feelings for you?

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,804
No.

44
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,516
It was me who had feelings for her.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,435
Were you sad

46
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,898
when she died?

47
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,071
The passenger, Cheon Na-na,

48
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,450
has not given any official statements yet.

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,619
Hey. She isn't replying, is she?

50
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,496
No.

51
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,208
Just what exactly did Woo Tae-ho
want to tell us before he died?

52
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,461
He probably told Cheon Na-na first.

53
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:36,466
You're saying he might've told her
who incited Jung Hui-ju's murder?

54
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,595
Yes. I'm sure Cheon Na-na knows
who the culprit is.

55
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,472
Let's go.

56
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,890
Excuse me.

57
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,689
Director Cheon wants to see you,
Detective Oh.

58
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,655
Why is that woman having you do this?

59
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,115
Why do you keep getting caught up
in these affairs?

60
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,117
I'm an employee here.

61
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,578
Weren't you quitting?
Please get out of this place.

62
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,206
That's not your concern.

63
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,752
I won't get in any trouble,
so don't worry too much.

64
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,004
Did Mr. Woo say anything to you

65
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,258
before he died?

66
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,884
Or was there anything suspicious--

67
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,552
I said don't get her involved.

68
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,929
It's fine.

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,556
I didn't hear anything anyway.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,225
That's good then.

71
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,644
Don't worry about it.

72
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,189
It was just a car accident.
That's all you need to know.

73
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,316
Don't get any other ideas, got it?

74
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,698
Can you please
just keep your thoughts to yourself?

75
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,658
Don't run your mouth like that.

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,743
And mark my words.

77
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,455
The person we're about to meet
just lost her husband.

78
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,627
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

79
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,424
Welcome.

80
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,384
Are you a fellow detective?

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,303
Yes, he's my partner.

82
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,055
Hello, I'm so sorry--

83
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,349
Thank you, Ms. Moon. You may leave.

84
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,018
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,979
Have a seat.

86
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,025
My apologies.

87
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,278
I can't even serve you tea
due to my condition.

88
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,574
That's fine, we won't be staying long.

89
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,660
So you checked the dashcam footage?

90
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,703
Yes.

91
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,913
So what? Did you find something strange?

92
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,709
Mr. Woo contacted us
right before the accident.

93
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,545
He wanted to tell us something
about Jung Hui-ju's case.

94
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,797
He said he would meet us at the station.

95
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:45,053
Did your husband mention
something like that to you?

96
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,016
There's no need to tell us now.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,477
Take time to recover. Once you remember--

98
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,436
I'll talk.

99
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,522
I can't keep it to myself forever.

100
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,942
I feel comfortable telling you,
Detective Oh.

101
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,153
Since we have a lot in common.

102
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,660
I was with him when he called you.

103
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,540
We had a little argument.

104
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,543
He said he was doing it for me,

105
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,798
but Cheon Sang-woo is still my brother.

106
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,550
What sister would welcome the idea

107
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,469
of reporting her brother to the police?

108
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,223
Are you saying that Vice-chairman Cheon

109
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,434
incited Jung Hui-ju's murder?

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,062
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,190
The assault case from two years ago.

112
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,736
I meant my husband was planning
to reveal that case he covered up.

113
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,907
He said my brother will
go behind bars if he testifies.

114
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,951
If that case gets revealed,

115
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,287
he would have also been
arrested for fabricating evidence.

116
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,831
So why would he?

117
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,252
He said that was for the best.

118
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,006
You see,

119
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,885
he wanted to make me
the most powerful person in TJ.

120
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,972
He thought if my brother got arrested,

121
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,850
I would take his place.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,854
He told me not to worry about him.

123
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,690
That he'll get probation at most.

124
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,817
He wanted me to stay quiet

125
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,820
and listen to him, the ex-prosecutor.

126
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,368
"I'm sorry."

127
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,287
Hey.

128
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,664
Why did you apologize to him?

129
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,166
Shouldn't you be thanking him?

130
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,588
He was going to sacrifice himself
to make you the best.

131
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,591
Because I can't trust him.

132
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,093
He was despicable.

133
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,180
That man betrayed me.

134
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,807
He wasn't going to
sacrifice himself for me.

135
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,828
This is our best option.

136
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,956
Please listen to me this time.

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll take care of it.

138
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,927
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,930
I can't trust you.

140
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,602
I remember the look on his face.

141
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,979
It looked as if he had given up
on everything.

142
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,198
I'm sure he was shocked.

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,370
That's when he found out
that the reason I announced our divorce

144
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,829
was because of that woman.

145
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,458
So you're saying out of shock,

146
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,337
your husband steered the wrong way?

147
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,090
-Is that what you're saying--
-That's all I have to say.

148
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,008
Okay.

149
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:16,138
Thank you very much for telling us
about a difficult personal matter.

150
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,224
We'll get going then.

151
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,060
Mr. Woo's seatbelt was unfastened.

152
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,271
Who unfastened it?

153
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,149
It might not have been fastened
in the first place.

154
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,360
Then the alarm would've been going off.

155
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,445
But there was no alarm sound
in the footage.

156
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,030
Which means…

157
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,576
that somebody unfastened it at one point.

158
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,289
She was in the accident with him.

159
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,291
How is she supposed to remember that?

160
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,551
I killed him.

161
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,678
I didn't

162
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,973
kill him myself,

163
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,101
but he died because of me.

164
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,522
If I hadn't shown him that picture then

165
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,818
or pushed him to a corner like that,

166
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,820
he wouldn't have died.

167
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,866
I will greatly suffer and be tormented

168
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,870
to the point of death
for the rest of my life.

169
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
My family…

170
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,711
My precious family member died
because of me.

171
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,547
You have yet to answer my question.

172
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,216
Who unfastened it?

173
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,140
If he was trying to kill me,
he would've unfastened my seat belt.

174
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,809
But he let me live.

175
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,854
I believe that was his final way

176
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,358
of showing his true feelings for me

177
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,526
the moment he chose to die.

178
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,157
I beg you, detectives.

179
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,745
Please consider his death
to be a simple accident.

180
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,539
That's…

181
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,294
the last act of kindness I can show

182
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,964
to the man who protected me.

183
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,936
No matter how much I think about it,

184
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,398
I can't find anything suspicious
about Cheon Na-na's story.

185
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,108
Everything makes sense.

186
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,445
Have you ever gotten
a perfect score on a test?

187
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,367
Is this supposed to be a personal attack?
What do you think?

188
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,036
There's one way
that even you can get a perfect score.

189
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,789
I've never even gotten
a perfect score on a spelling quiz.

190
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,834
But what if you gave the questions?

191
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,796
Think about it.

192
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,007
It may seem like we gave the questions
and Cheon Na-na answered them…

193
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,843
I'll talk.

194
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,472
I can't keep it to myself forever.

195
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,183
But she started talking about
what we caught on the dashcam

196
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,104
before we could even ask her about it.

197
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,898
He said that was for the best.

198
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,400
He wanted me to stay quiet

199
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,570
and listen to him, the ex-prosecutor.

200
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,698
Because I can't trust him.

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,868
When I asked her why
Woo Tae-ho's seat belt was unfastened,

202
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,244
instead of answering me…

203
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,413
I killed him.

204
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,875
I didn't

205
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,462
kill him myself,

206
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,214
but he died because of me.

207
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,844
If he was trying to kill me,
he would've unfastened my seat belt.

208
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,264
But he let me live.

209
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,643
She then cleverly changed the question.

210
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,812
She turned it around on us.

211
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,981
"Do you know why Woo Tae-ho

212
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,026
decided to kill himself?"

213
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,279
Then she gave us the answer
she had prepared.

214
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,615
I believe that was his final way

215
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,909
of showing his true feelings for me.

216
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,663
She only gave us answers
to her own questions.

217
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm sorry, I didn't expect you to be here.

218
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,370
What is it?

219
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,248
I figured I should clean out his office.

220
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,749
Just leave it.

221
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,125
Director.

222
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,462
This office has a lot of sensitive files
that can't be leaked.

223
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,838
If we leave it unwatched--

224
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,299
Didn't you hear what I just said?

225
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,344
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

226
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,930
Let's go.

227
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,274
I'll give you directions later.
You can both go home.

228
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,244
I need to talk to you
about Jung Hui-ju's murder.

229
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,831
I will tell you more at the station.
I'll see you soon.

230
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,486
Ms. Moon.

231
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
Can I see you for a moment?

232
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,656
I'll be quick.

233
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,916
A lot of people want to know more
about the recent accident.

234
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,627
Misunderstandings can easily occur.

235
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,672
Not one bit of Mr. Woo's
personal information is to be leaked.

236
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,800
Especially his whereabouts
before the accident.

237
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,803
You must keep your mouth shut.
Do you understand?

238
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,640
Yes, sir. I understand.

239
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,892
Okay then.

240
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,936
Oh, right.

241
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,230
If anything…

242
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,525
If even a single thing is leaked,

243
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,196
the elicitor will be fired

244
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,907
and the company
will file a lawsuit simultaneously.

245
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,662
Then the elicitor
will waste their entire life

246
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,081
paying for the damages.

247
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,669
Get back to work then.

248
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:21,397
LEGAL TEAM DIRECTOR WOO TAE-HO

249
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,244
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

250
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,335
Don't be in too much pain.

251
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,098
MANAGER CHOI YONG-GEUN

252
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,441
-I appreciate your hard work.
-No problem.

253
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,196
DELETE THESE FILES?

254
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,200
COUNTERARGUMENT FOR UNFAIR DISMISSAL,
RESTRAINING ORDER DISPOSITION REQUEST…

255
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,326
DELETE THESE FILES?

256
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,788
JUNG HUI-JU RETIREMENT FUND STATEMENT

257
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,710
DELETE

258
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,629
DELETE THIS FILE?

259
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,299
What brings you here?

260
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,717
Hello.

261
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,845
We'd like to ask you something.

262
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,054
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,056
I really have nothing to tell you.

264
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,225
Please leave.

265
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,813
Mr. Woo came to your salon
the day before he died, right?

266
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,190
We checked the CCTV footage.

267
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,733
What did you talk about?

268
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,734
Please.

269
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,571
I might really die.

270
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,324
Do you feel your safety is threatened?

271
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,326
If I keep meeting with you,

272
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,079
I might die too.

273
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm begging you.
Please don't come here anymore.

274
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,045
I'm really scared.

275
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,216
Ms. Kim. You must trust the police.

276
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,760
We're the only ones who can protect you.

277
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,184
Please call us if there's an emergency.

278
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,020
We won't come here until you call us.

279
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,738
Woo Tae-ho found an important clue
when he met with Kim Min-ji.

280
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,783
We need to find out what it was
to know what he wanted to tell us.

281
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,994
It'll also lead us
to the cause of his death.

282
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:09,082
Does she seem like she's making excuses
because she doesn't want to testify?

283
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,876
She means it.

284
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,961
She truly feels threatened.

285
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,048
That she could end up dying
like Woo Tae-ho.

286
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,552
Mr. Woo visited you recently, right?

287
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,513
What did he say to you?

288
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,228
How did he die?

289
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,023
It was a car accident.

290
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,149
Where?

291
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,818
I'm not sure.

292
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,114
He was a good guy.

293
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,617
How unfortunate.

294
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,662
I asked what he said to you.

295
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,080
I've been thinking a lot

296
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,958
about what to do.

297
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,419
About whom I must cling to

298
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,839
for me to stay alive.

299
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,094
Do you not trust me?

300
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,721
You will be released.

301
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,225
Don't bother.

302
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,353
I'll be dead too if I get out.

303
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,272
From an accident.

304
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,486
Stop imagining things.

305
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,863
Mr. Woo's death was really an accident.

306
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,077
I also know the place

307
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,871
where his accident happened.

308
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,873
I passed by it…

309
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,293
on that day.

310
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,506
Why do you think he got into an accident

311
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,135
around the place I told him about?

312
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,642
Why did you do it?

313
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,478
What was your reason
for telling Mr. Woo that?

314
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,772
I've told so many lies in my life

315
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,109
that I wanted to be honest for once.

316
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,154
But I guess people shouldn't change.

317
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,614
Seeing how awful the outcome is.

318
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,366
What can I do though?

319
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,953
The only thing I can count on right now

320
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,372
is my honesty.

321
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,708
That's all I've got.

322
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,129
Go and tell the man who's backing you,

323
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,215
"That punk may turn on us any moment,

324
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,384
so let's make sure

325
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,138
not to provoke him."

326
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,983
Hello there.

327
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,656
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Do-chang
from Incheon Seobu Station.

328
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,241
Did you follow me?

329
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,743
No way.

330
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,912
We had some business here.

331
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:56,041
He said you were his senior detective,
so I figured we should say hi.

332
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,794
You and Gi Dong-jae must be tight.

333
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,338
He rejected our request to see him.

334
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,257
-Why did you want to see him?
-On the day Mr. Woo died,

335
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,635
there's a record of him
visiting Gi Dong-jae.

336
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,221
We wanted to find out
what they talked about.

337
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,059
That case isn't under your jurisdiction.

338
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,104
I'm sure you know,
but it's common for cases to overlap.

339
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,064
We don't solve cases
by worrying about jurisdiction.

340
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,816
What did Gi Dong-jae tell you?

341
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,152
What did he tell Woo Tae-ho that day?

342
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,783
Shall I tell you the truth?

343
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,245
He wants me to deal with you guys.

344
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,332
He was annoyed about
being tied into a strange case,

345
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,126
so he wanted me to get rid of
those in charge.

346
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,795
Goodness. Someone very powerful
must have your back.

347
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,339
Seeing how he asked for such a favor.

348
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,635
I used to be a cop myself.

349
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,054
I wouldn't do anything of that sort
even if I could.

350
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:55,058
However, I'll have to reconsider it

351
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,728
if you two harm the organization
I'm working for now.

352
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,939
I have to get back to work.

353
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,823
So you want to go up against me?

354
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,909
That punk.

355
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,121
Did he just say
he can get us fired at his will?

356
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,665
-Who is he to do that?
-He has no authority to do that.

357
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,126
Exactly. That talk was all bravado.

358
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,046
I told you. He's the one who forced me
to take leave two years ago.

359
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,923
He'll come for us soon,

360
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,342
attacking our weakest spots.

361
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,602
You boys recently
summoned Woo Tae-ho, right?

362
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,062
Yes, sir. He came in as a witness.

363
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,399
Did you tell him he was being investigated
for inciting murder?

364
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,942
We couldn't tell him directly.

365
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,070
Maybe not directly,
but I'm sure you did indirectly.

366
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,449
You must've pressured him
by shoving photos

367
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,701
of Jung Hui-ju in his face.

368
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,494
Well, that…

369
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,163
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

370
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,165
I just got a call from the prosecutor.

371
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,376
He asked if he was
wrongfully pressured in any way

372
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,215
and if that led to his accident
due to stress from the investigation.

373
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,424
What?

374
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,219
Gosh, that's nonsense.

375
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,347
That's ridiculous.
If anything, he interrogated us.

376
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,767
He even said he'll sue us
for pressuring him to testify.

377
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,686
That's because you were pressuring him!

378
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,064
Don't tell me the prosecutor is saying

379
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,399
Woo Tae-ho died because of us.

380
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,485
Who incited Jung Hui-ju's murder?

381
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,779
Is it Woo Tae-ho or Cheon Sang-woo?

382
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,364
We don't know yet.

383
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,617
Woo Tae-ho called us
the day before his accident.

384
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,870
I think he was going to tell us
who the culprit was.

385
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,874
You're saying Woo Tae-ho
wasn't the abettor?

386
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,669
Yes, that's what we think.

387
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,546
Hey, that makes the problem much worse.

388
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,216
-Pardon?
-I looked into Woo Tae-ho's case.

389
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,677
He didn't drink

390
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,929
and there was nothing
to cause the accident.

391
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,849
It's most likely that
he crashed the car voluntarily.

392
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,310
If they conclude it to be suicide,

393
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,979
they'll blame us for it.

394
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,066
To be exact, it'll be you guys
who they'll come after.

395
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,694
Violent Crimes Unit Team 2,
who pressured an innocent man

396
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,613
by showing pictures of his infidelity.

397
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,451
I also got a call from TJ's lawyer.

398
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,664
They're requesting us to release
the interrogation footage of Woo Tae-ho.

399
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,083
What will his bereaved family think?

400
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:30,005
You two are well aware
of who they are, right?

401
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,762
Threatening a testimony out of someone

402
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,764
can be seen as an illegal act

403
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,100
and a violation of human rights.

404
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:47,188
I want a written form of our conversation
submitted to our legal team.

405
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,568
After discussion, we'll decide whether
to file a lawsuit against the police.

406
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,486
We'll inform you of this later.

407
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,447
Thank you.

408
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,498
Are you making sure Gi Dong-jae
keeps his mouth shut?

409
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,458
Yes, of course.

410
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,335
There are no more issues, right?

411
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,422
Well, we're not completely in the clear.

412
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,050
The guys at Incheon Seobu Station

413
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,635
found evidence that Gi Dong-jae
killed Jung Hui-ju.

414
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,138
They've already handed it over
to the prosecution.

415
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,556
And what did they say?

416
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,516
I think they're still reviewing it.

417
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,019
You can't control the prosecution?

418
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,482
I'm sorry, sir. That's out of my reach.

419
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
Darn it.

420
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,403
Why did Woo Tae-ho die
at such a crucial time?

421
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,241
He had the prosecution
wrapped around his finger.

422
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,287
You must've trusted Mr. Woo a lot.

423
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,914
I didn't trust him,

424
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,875
but he was very helpful.

425
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:50,960
I see.

426
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,506
I'll start by stopping
the police investigation.

427
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,967
The prosecution seems
very reluctant to take on this case.

428
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:02,389
If the police let this go,
the prosecution won't have to pursue it.

429
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,187
Are you confident about this?

430
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,774
Can I trust your abilities, Mr. Choi?

431
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,444
I will do my very best.

432
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,738
I'll get going then.

433
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,038
Tae-ho would've taken care of everything
if he were here.

434
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,625
Oh, there's something
you should be aware of.

435
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,796
A murderer and abettor receive
the same sentencing.

436
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,968
Do you really think I don't know that?

437
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,472
I'm telling you because I thought
Mr. Woo might not have told you.

438
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,433
Goodbye then.

439
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,606
Darn it.

440
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,821
What's the big deal
about that Jung Hui-ju dying?

441
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,871
Yes, Vice-chairman.

442
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,706
Mr. Choi.

443
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,001
I forgot to tell you something.

444
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,419
What is it, sir?

445
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,089
Tae-ho's absence is hard not to notice.

446
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,970
I'd like you to take over
as the new director of the Legal Team.

447
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,056
You'll be a proxy for now,

448
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,977
but I'll make it official
in the next personnel appointment.

449
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,771
I understand, sir.

450
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,731
I'm counting on you.

451
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,940
Yes, sir.

452
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,277
I'll try my best to not disappoint you.
Thank you, sir.

453
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,367
The son-in-law of a conglomerate has died.

454
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,454
Police have announced it as an accident.

455
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,957
But isn't it odd that it happened
directly after his divorce announcement?

456
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:57,003
Why did this happen right before
the trial regarding the large alimony?

457
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,630
It's truly unfortunate.

458
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,340
If he had settled,

459
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,300
he would've received a huge sum of money

460
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,053
that normal people can't even dream about.

461
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,472
Who is this woman?

462
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,099
She was known as a victim
of a recent serial murder case,

463
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,810
but the culprit confessed.

464
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,813
"I did not kill this person."

465
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,983
These photos are evidence obtained
by the police while re-investigating.

466
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,488
This was the reason for the divorce.

467
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,073
The most important thing is

468
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,743
that the deceased son-in-law
was on the verge

469
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,831
of being kicked out penniless
due to these photos.

470
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,041
This case of the death
of a conglomerate's son-in-law

471
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,418
may not be an accident.

472
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,587
It might be the result
of a tragic decision

473
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,465
made by a man who was in enormous pain.

474
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,300
I want to ask the police

475
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,054
who got these photos and conducted
a coercive investigation into this.

476
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,683
Was this case simply a death

477
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,142
caused by an accident?

478
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:57,230
What? Why would he end it like that?
Does he hold a grudge against us?

479
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,648
Don't mind him.

480
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,317
People eat up this kind of drama.

481
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,696
He's just saying anything
to see what sticks.

482
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,030
Just ignore it.

483
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,116
It's gotten over three million views.

484
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,409
It's racking up fast.

485
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,244
Three million? Is that a lot?

486
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,997
It means more people watched it
than the news on TV.

487
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,333
Why did this punk
make up this stupid content?

488
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
What good will he gain from this?

489
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,671
This was planned. He had two agendas.

490
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,592
To turn the public's attention
to infidelity issues of the rich.

491
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,636
Interest in Jung Hui-ju's murder case
will die down.

492
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,681
Secondly, to turn
Woo Tae-ho's death into suicide

493
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,683
and blame it on the detectives in charge.

494
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,351
To obstruct our investigation.

495
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,354
Does that mean TJ was behind all this?

496
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,355
Exactly.

497
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,441
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

498
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,860
-Hello, Captain.
-Yes, hi.

499
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,237
-Can I get a glass of beer too?
-Sure.

500
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,656
I'm going to lose it.

501
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,200
Hey, maybe investigating TJ was a mistake.

502
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,579
Don't mind the show.
It's completely subjective.

503
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,080
Nobody will believe it.

504
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,292
I don't know what you're talking about,
but that's not the issue here.

505
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,002
I told you my brother-in-law

506
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,756
works for TJ's subcontractor, right?

507
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,633
He told me that

508
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,510
the contract went to another company.

509
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,638
TJ switched them out on purpose.

510
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,223
Hey, don't you think
that's a bit of a stretch?

511
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,767
It's just a coincidence.

512
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,769
-No--
-It is a little suspicious though.

513
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,147
The timing seems to coincide with
when the show was released.

514
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,567
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

515
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,903
Regardless, isn't it a serious problem

516
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,698
if all this happened
because I started investigating?

517
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,617
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

518
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,327
How's business?

519
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,788
It's doing all right.

520
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,540
I'm sure it'll take off.
Your fried chicken is delicious.

521
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,378
But apparently, taste isn't everything
when it comes to running a restaurant.

522
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,757
Why not?
The taste is all that matters, isn't it?

523
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,760
They're opening another
fried chicken joint over there,

524
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,136
across from us.

525
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,641
It's a big franchise,
so I can't help but worry.

526
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,934
What's the name?

527
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,937
It's called BK Chicken. I'm sure you know.

528
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,439
Gosh, this is such a tiny strip.

529
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,942
Why did they decide to open a store here?

530
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,194
I saw that name in an article.

531
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,946
My gosh, that's it. I got chills.

532
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,782
That's the company that was in question
because TJ Group

533
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,868
gave them preferential distribution
with every building they built.

534
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,704
Yes, I think I saw that article too.

535
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,205
Don't be ridiculous.

536
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,791
TJ is behind all this.

537
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,003
They even have your restaurant
in the palm of their hands, Do-chang.

538
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,421
What about you guys?

539
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:31,134
Did you notice anything suspicious
happening around you?

540
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:35,013
Stop with your nonsense!
You're acting like a kid.

541
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,472
-Recently,
-Yes?

542
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,475
My landlord suddenly said
he was selling his home

543
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,436
and immigrating to another country.

544
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,273
His reason was related to TJ.

545
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,983
Let me explain.

546
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,986
My landlord was drinking at a hostess bar

547
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,363
when he heard dirt about TJ's family.

548
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,449
He should've kept it to himself,

549
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,743
but he went around
running his mouth everywhere.

550
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,704
Think about it.
Chairman Cheon Seong-dae is behind bars.

551
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,789
He touched their sensitive spot.

552
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,960
One day, he was out having a meal
with his entire family.

553
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,255
But they all ended up
getting food poisoning.

554
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,134
All the other diners were fine
but only his family got it.

555
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,847
Somebody must've poisoned them.

556
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,599
That's what he thinks.

557
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,559
My gosh, poison.

558
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,810
That makes no sense.

559
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,562
Why not?

560
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,483
I don't know what I'd do to my chicken
if someone gave me one billion won.

561
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,568
You've gone mad for money.

562
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,155
What's that other dish
next to the chicken?

563
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,531
-Cheese balls.
-I see.

564
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,742
I'll just have one of those.

565
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,702
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP

566
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,997
OWNER CHEON NA-NA

567
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,751
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

568
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,091
FROM: 45 ASIL-RO
TO: OCHEON-RO

569
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,011
BY CAR

570
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,304
12 MINUTES

571
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:06,896
Goodness.

572
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,483
Hey, why did you do this?

573
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,486
Tell me why you bit off
more than you can chew.

574
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,031
Okay, you showed your uncle.

575
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,741
Now say goodnight and go to bed.

576
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,201
Okay.

577
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,829
Good night, Uncle.

578
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,081
Where do you think you're going?

579
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,792
I'm so happy I can't sleep now.

580
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,544
But you're just going to leave me?

581
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,883
I wonder what you are going to be
when you grow up.

582
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,968
A CEO.

583
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,011
That's a great dream.

584
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,390
You could even become a chairman
if you keep acing your tests.

585
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,642
Let him go to bed.

586
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,395
He stayed up until now
to show you his test results.

587
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,729
It's way past his bedtime.

588
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,232
All right. Go to sleep.

589
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:55,278
And think of what you would like
for me to buy you tomorrow.

590
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,654
I'll buy you anything.

591
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,116
Okay. Good night, Uncle.

592
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,200
All right.

593
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,249
You got yourself a good son.

594
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,792
He dreams to be a CEO.

595
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,546
He wants to make money
to take care of you.

596
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,964
Do-chang.

597
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,510
What if TJ comes after us as revenge
like Captain Woo said?

598
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,639
You actually believed that?
He was just kidding.

599
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,143
You never know.
Jae-ung might end up working for TJ.

600
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,061
I'm worried he'll suffer a disadvantage.

601
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,104
You're going too far.

602
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,232
He's too young
for you to be worried about that.

603
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,401
Did TJ not exist when we were kids?

604
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,986
You know it did.

605
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,696
They were big back then too.

606
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,199
They might become even bigger

607
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,326
by the time Jae-ung is all grown up.

608
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,789
I'm going to head out for a bit.

609
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,458
Where are you going at this hour?

610
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,376
I'm going to go see Mr. Jung.

611
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,669
Mr. Jung?

612
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,548
Yes, I saw the online broadcast show
and it mentioned his granddaughter.

613
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,761
I'm worried he'd be upset if he saw it,
so I want to go check on him.

614
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,181
-I'll come with you.
-Okay.

615
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,600
-Hold on to this.
-Okay.

616
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,311
-Be careful.
-Okay.

617
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,988
JUNGIN SHOES

618
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,907
-Sir?
-The phone is turned off.

619
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,408
-Mr. Jung?
-Please leave a message--

620
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,535
His phone is off.

621
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,454
I think he went home.

622
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,747
I'm sure he did.

623
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,001
He's a wise man. I'm sure he's fine.
Don't you agree?

624
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,836
Yes.

625
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,921
Let's go.

626
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,653
If you don't want it released,
we will keep it to ourselves.

627
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,283
No. Finding the killer is more important.

628
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,704
Don't worry about me.
You can release it if you need to.

629
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,916
Mr. Woo.

630
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,587
I did a terrible thing.

631
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,253
Let's have a cup of tea inside.

632
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,839
Okay.

633
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,761
You must come here often.

634
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,973
I come whenever I miss my mom.

635
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,517
This is where she passed away.

636
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,937
You also came here
on the day of the accident, right?

637
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,231
With your husband.

638
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,817
-Yes.
-What did you talk about?

639
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,907
Let me think.

640
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,078
I think a lot of it was about our divorce.

641
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,416
Don't I look just like my mom?

642
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,878
I've been told I resemble her
much more than my dad.

643
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,546
Even my personality.

644
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,427
Mr. Woo met two people
before the accident.

645
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,681
Kim Min-ji and Gi Dong-jae.

646
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,230
He probably heard something from them.

647
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,314
They're both…

648
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,901
related to Jung Hui-ju's case.

649
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,945
Then he came running…

650
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,240
to this place.

651
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,617
You really are as tenacious as they say.

652
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,079
Mr. Woo was digging into
Jung Hui-ju's case.

653
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,124
He had come to a conclusion.
That's why he called us.

654
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,792
To tell us who the culprit was.

655
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,835
But all of a sudden…

656
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,004
he got into an accident.

657
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,549
Why are you obsessed with this case?

658
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,469
It's as if your life depends on
catching the culprit.

659
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,932
Because it's my job.

660
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,602
You lose sleep thinking about
who the culprit is, right?

661
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,730
Kim Min-ji, Gi Dong-jae,
and then it was you.

662
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,569
Why were you the last one?

663
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,788
Are you suspecting
that I killed Jung Hui-ju?

664
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,374
That I killed Jung Hui-ju,

665
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,127
then my husband found out about it,

666
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:08,132
so I killed him by staging a car accident?

667
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,886
Jung Hui-ju.

668
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,972
I wanted to kill her.

669
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,227
And I wanted to kill Woo Tae-ho
for loving a woman like her.

670
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,315
But they both died.

671
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,151
Does that mean I killed them?

672
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,574
You must be very confident.

673
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,869
"You can't find the evidence
that I killed them."

674
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,664
Is that it?

675
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,541
-Do you think you can?
-Yes.

676
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,253
You can't catch the culprit
if you can't find the evidence, can you?

677
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,048
No, I can't.

678
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,344
Tell me.

679
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,182
Was there ever a case
where you were certain

680
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,519
that you knew who the culprit was,
and you had seen it with your own eyes,

681
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,105
but still failed to catch the culprit?

682
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,154
Isn't that why you became a detective?

683
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,533
You thought you might kill the culprit.

684
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,619
You were scared
you'd end up being a murderer.

685
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,705
That was your reason, right?

686
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,045
I'll see you later. This was fun.

687
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,607
Get rid of everything
that Mr. Woo left behind.

688
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,277
I think it's time for that.

689
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,153
Yes, ma'am.

690
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,057
Mr. Jung.

691
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,892
Were you here all night?

692
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,352
Yes, I slept here.

693
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,979
What a relief.

694
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,149
Are you feeling okay? Did you eat?

695
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,108
Not yet.

696
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,195
Let's go eat something good then.
I haven't had breakfast either.

697
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,906
I'm actually heading out right now.

698
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,659
Where? I'll take you.

699
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,329
-Do you have time for that?
-Yes, I have plenty.

700
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,330
-Is that so?
-Yes.

701
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,082
-Could you accompany me then?
-Of course.

702
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:55,174
Mr. Lee. Can we open this safe?

703
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,135
Not here. We'll have to send it
to a locksmith.

704
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,370
You are an important member of our team.

705
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,582
I can trust you
as much as I trusted Hui-ju.

706
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,211
Please stay.

707
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,426
Whatever.

708
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,637
It's none of my business.

709
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,770
This is Moon Bo-gyeong
from the Legal Team.

710
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,732
-She'll be coming down shortly.
-Okay. Thank you.

711
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,402
She's coming down now.

712
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,529
It's the young lady
who came to see me, right?

713
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,115
Yes. She recognized your name right away.

714
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,075
All right. Thank you.

715
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,620
An old man like me would have never
been able to find her without you.

716
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,665
So why do you need to talk to her?

717
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:15,129
I'm going to ask her
to help me meet Mr. Woo's family.

718
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,506
I need to apologize to them.

719
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,303
Gosh, he must be super important.

720
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,056
-Do you know him?
-No, I don't.

721
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,309
I would assume he's
the Chairman's family member.

722
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,479
Judging by how people are treating him
when he's so young.

723
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,857
The bodyguards are a dead giveaway.

724
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,734
Hold on.

725
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,655
Goodness. Hello.

726
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,991
Yes, what is it?

727
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,786
Are you a member of Mr. Woo's family?

728
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:52,624
I heard he's the Chairman's son-in-law.

729
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,543
I wouldn't say family…

730
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,628
No, I guess I am.

731
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,339
You are? I'm so sorry.

732
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,135
I feel like I have wronged him.

733
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:09,600
Would it be possible to meet his wife?
I want to apologize to her personally.

734
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,185
There's no need for that.

735
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,604
Your apology to me is enough.

736
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,772
I see. Okay.

737
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,401
I will tell Na-na, his wife.

738
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,653
So just leave, okay?

739
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,203
Gosh, those are great shoes.

740
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,456
You won't find anything
as nice as those here.

741
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,374
The leather is completely different.

742
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,252
I'll just take a look around.

743
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,588
If I find something I like, I'll buy it.

744
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,048
All right then.

745
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,512
Is that your granddaughter?

746
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,430
Pardon? Oh, yes.

747
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,016
She goes to a big company.

748
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,685
She works for TJ
on the headquarters' legal team.

749
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,437
I see.

750
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,689
She's a beauty.

751
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,443
She must go around breaking men's hearts.

752
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,904
No, she's not one to do that.

753
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,324
You never know.

754
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,703
Anyway, you should keep her under control.

755
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,748
One man could ruin her life.

756
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,209
Get out.

757
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,878
I have no intention of selling you shoes.

758
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:20,963
Get out of here!

759
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,636
JUNGIN SHOES

760
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,723
That bastard.

761
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,977
What does he know about Hui-ju?
That darn punk.

762
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,729
Wait, excuse me.

763
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,858
You've been to my store, right?

764
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,070
-What?
-Hui-ju was an employee here.

765
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,322
Why did you pretend not to know her?

766
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:52,536
You came to my store
to check out Hui-ju, didn't you?

767
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,373
How would I know
a low-level employee like her?

768
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,084
It was a coincidence.

769
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,754
You knew…

770
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,842
my granddaughter had a relationship
with Woo Tae-ho, right?

771
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,096
That's why you spoke about her that way
at my store, isn't it?

772
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,182
This old man is senile.

773
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,183
-Sir.
-Sir.

774
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,312
-Come on.
-What are you doing? Let me go.

775
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,565
-Stop it, sir.
-Let me go, you punks!

776
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,444
You sent Hui-ju that photo, didn't you?

777
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:30,073
-You used it to threaten her.
-What the hell are you talking about?

778
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,701
-You…
-Are you okay?

779
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,663
You killed my Hui-ju, didn't you?

780
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,334
Why? Tell me why!

781
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,421
Sir, you can't suddenly grab me like that.

782
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,382
Are you okay?

783
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,509
Get up. Come on.

784
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,970
Goodness.

785
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,016
Look, didn't I tell you
to keep her under control?

786
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,896
Your granddaughter was a homewrecker.

787
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,357
She deserved to die. Got it?

788
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,903
She was a parasite who seduced
a rich married man for his money.

789
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,740
It wasn't me who killed her.
The heavens punished her.

790
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,700
Do you understand?

791
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,453
My goodness.

792
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,499
Don't just stand there. Help him up.

793
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,044
Don't you dare touch him.

794
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,837
Move or you'll get hurt.

795
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,506
I told you not to touch him!

796
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,133
You little brat.

797
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,468
Come on then. Hit me.

798
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,679
I'll start frothing at my mouth
and collapse.

799
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,472
What? Are you scared?

800
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:39,017
Just nudge me slightly.
I'll collapse to the floor and croak.

801
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,313
-Hey, you piece of trash.
-Eun-hye.

802
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,400
-Hey, stop.
-You darn piece of trash! You trash!

803
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,026
Let go, darn it!

804
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,823
He just lost his beloved granddaughter.

805
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,868
Yet he came to respectfully apologize

806
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,414
in case his granddaughter might have
caused anyone harm.

807
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,665
Let go!

808
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,627
If you ever insult
his late granddaughter again,

809
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,462
I'm going to kill you!

810
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,174
-Let go! Let go of me!
-Eun-hye!

811
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,509
Eun-hye.

812
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,512
Let's go, Mr. Jung.

813
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,932
I shouldn't have brought you here.

814
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:20,809
I'm sorry.

815
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,895
No, you did nothing wrong.

816
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,814
Let's go. I'll buy you a delicious meal.

817
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,067
Be careful.

818
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,661
Those lunatics.

819
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,593
Hey, just a second!

820
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,679
MYUNG JIN SAFES

821
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,389
MOON BO-GYEONG

822
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,642
I need to take a look at that safe.

823
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,998
Please enter your password.

824
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,254
Unlocked.

825
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,048
Please open the door.

826
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,513
Let me know if you need any more favors.

827
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,432
Okay, good job. Drive safely.

828
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,562
-Thank you.
-No problem.

829
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,488
Ms. Moon.

830
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,241
Ms. Moon!

831
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,493
Moon Bo-gyeong!

832
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,806
The door is closing.

833
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,109
The elicitor will be fired

834
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,362
and the company
will file a lawsuit simultaneously.

835
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:42,576
Then the elicitor
will waste their entire life

836
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,744
paying for the damages.

837
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,836
Mr. Oh.

838
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,214
Mr. Oh In-gyu.

839
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,508
Yes? What is it?

840
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,899
-Mr. Choi.
-Ms. Moon.

841
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,568
You took something out of the safe, right?

842
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,862
-About that…
-What is it?

843
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,033
You had better be honest.

844
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,535
Or you could get in serious trouble.

845
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,622
It's this.

846
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,874
Ms. Moon.

847
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,836
This is it.

848
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,756
Mr. Woo told me that
if anything happened to him,

849
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,259
I should get this from the safe
and give it to you.

850
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,554
What's in it? Did you check?

851
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:48,183
I just got it out of the safe,

852
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,101
so I had no time to check.

853
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,647
Then why did you rush
to have me directly receive it?

854
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,566
I was worried someone might take it

855
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,902
because it's so important.

856
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,529
I'm sorry.

857
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,325
I have a bit of anxiety.

858
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,202
I was mistaken.

859
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,746
Good work.

860
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,462
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

861
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:23,468
Mr. Woo told me to deliver it
to Director Cheon Na-na and no one else.

862
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,513
Please don't get the wrong idea.
I was just doing as told.

863
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,184
Okay. Good work.

864
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,823
Mr. Oh In-gyu. Hey.

865
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,034
Yes?

866
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,830
Can I borrow your tablet one more time?

867
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,957
Why are you doing this now?

868
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,377
All right.

869
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,629
Okay.

870
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,133
You heard what the lawyer said, right?

871
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:06,594
If they file a lawsuit,
you'll be done for.

872
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,264
Don't worry. We'll find a lawyer
and go up against them.

873
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,016
Their claims are clearly ridiculous.

874
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,308
We will win for sure.

875
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,771
Hey, what happened?

876
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,066
Will your friend
who owns a law firm take the case?

877
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,987
He was eager to take it,
but once he heard he'd be against TJ,

878
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,238
he suddenly changed his mind.

879
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,992
You see? I told you.

880
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,618
This is the reality.

881
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,829
That's how scary TJ is.

882
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,289
-Don't worry.
-Why not?

883
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,623
Do you know another lawyer?

884
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,751
We just need to solve
the Jung Hui-ju case.

885
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,628
That would solve the mystery
behind Woo Tae-ho's death.

886
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,173
The lawsuit itself will become invalid.
Simple, right?

887
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,133
I have a simpler way.

888
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,761
We go to the coast
and drown ourselves to death.

889
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,638
We'll hear the truth from Jung Hui-ju
and Woo Tae-ho in the underworld.

890
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,557
Wouldn't that be much faster and easier?

891
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,602
-Bo-gyeong. What brings you here?
-Hey, Bo-gyeong.

892
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,811
Did something happen?

893
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,606
Detective Oh.
I have something to tell you.

894
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,319
Mr. Woo left me a note
before his accident.

895
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,030
It was his safe's passcode.

896
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,117
I found this in it.

897
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,038
I haven't been taking good care of you.

898
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,874
I've been so busy. I'm sorry.

899
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,462
Don't mention it.
I couldn't thank you enough.

900
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,633
Jung Hui-ju talked about you sometimes.

901
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,470
It's a conversation
between Woo Tae-ho and Kim Min-ji.

902
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,682
She said she felt so sorry
about not being able to help you.

903
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,353
You, Jung Hui-ju,
and Vice-chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

904
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,481
Just tell me
what only the three of you know.

905
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,569
Hui-ju showed me the CCTV footage
of my assault from two years ago.

906
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,282
She told me to use it to get my child
back from the Vice-chairman.

907
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,327
She said if he refuses,

908
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,413
she will take it to the police herself.

909
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,584
So did you do exactly

910
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,921
as Jung Hui-ju told you to?

911
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,096
So what did he say?

912
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,639
He got mad.

913
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,475
He asked why I couldn't trust him.

914
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,020
He said Su-yeon is his daughter too
and that he won't hurt her.

915
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,314
He asked why I was trying so hard
to take her from him.

916
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,607
And?

917
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,945
He said he'll never give up Su-yeon.

918
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,448
So I said Hui-ju will take the footage

919
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,950
to the police
and I'll tell them everything.

920
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,291
To which he said…

921
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,711
I'll never get to see my child again.

922
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,130
And that…

923
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,008
he'll make sure Hui-ju never talks…

924
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,512
by sending someone to take care of her.

925
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,184
He said she deserved to die

926
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,187
because she was having an affair with you.

927
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,608
So…

928
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,820
Is that why he killed Jung Hui-ju?

929
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,908
I thought he would only threaten her.

930
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,495
When I heard Hui-ju was
murdered by a serial killer,

931
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,039
I figured it wasn't the Vice-chairman.

932
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:24,501
He wouldn't have ordered
a serial killer to do that.

933
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,545
But then…

934
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,673
the serial killer…

935
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,135
said he didn't kill Hui-ju.

936
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,305
Why are you telling me this now?

937
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,476
Jung Hui-ju wouldn't have died
if you had told me this.

938
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,312
Hui-ju said you can't be trusted either.

939
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,774
She found out you covered for him

940
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,069
with the assault charge two years ago.

941
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,740
She thought you were on the same side

942
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,326
as Vice-chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

943
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,789
That's all I know.

944
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,208
You'll help me…

945
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,295
get Su-yeon back, right?

946
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,052
Who knew I had a niece?

947
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:21,975
Goodness.

948
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,351
Dad.

949
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,354
Gosh, you startled me. Why are you here?

950
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,648
I was waiting to go home with you.

951
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,358
How sweet.

952
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,612
Dad. Can you take me shopping today?

953
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,741
Where does all your paycheck go?

954
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,702
Buy the clothes yourself with your money.

955
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,829
You have no choice.

956
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,708
Because I did something pretty admirable
as your daughter today.

957
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,877
Is that so? What did you do?

958
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,630
Just take your
pretty daughter's word for it.

959
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,049
-Let's hurry before the mall closes.
-My gosh.

960
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,634
What will I do with you?

961
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,097
This clearly links the three.

962
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,684
Cheon Sang-woo ordered Choi Yong-geun
to murder Jung Hui-ju.

963
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,895
Then Choi Yong-geun
had Gi Dong-jae kill Jung Hui-ju.

964
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,356
So this is what he was trying to tell us.

965
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,941
That Cheon Sang-woo abetted it.

966
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:16,195
It means everything Cheon Na-na told us
is somewhat true.

967
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,697
Cheon Sang-woo is the culprit.

968
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,699
There's no need to think about it more.

969
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,536
What's with the chilly atmosphere?

970
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,706
We have come back.
The greatest partners in the universe.

971
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,833
-Ji Man-gu!
-Byun Ji-ung!

972
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,505
You punks are so lame.

973
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,216
Are you feeling okay?

974
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,137
I'm feeling better than before.
I've never been more alert.

975
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,513
Want to see something cool?

976
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,681
-What's five times eight?
-Forty.

977
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,849
-What's seven times eight?
-Fifty-six.

978
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:50,438
All his dormant brain cells
woke up in shock when his head got bashed.

979
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,898
He's gotten really smart.

980
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,524
-What's 12 times 13?
-Shut up.

981
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,902
-It's 156.
-It's impossible to like you.

982
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,363
For Ji-ung to solve
a difficult problem like that,

983
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,406
he'd need his head bashed in
a couple more times.

984
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,283
What about you? No issues?

985
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,743
It worked out for him too.

986
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,870
His irritable bowel syndrome disappeared.

987
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,248
Gosh. That means Gi Dong-jae, that punk,

988
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,710
-treated you both.
-Don't be ridiculous.

989
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,505
We need to make sure
he rots in jail forever.

990
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:20,885
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get him back good for you, okay?

991
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,969
Okay, sure.

992
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:27,433
But it looks like
Gi Dong-jae will be released.

993
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,689
What the hell are you talking about?

994
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,065
The thing is…

995
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,695
Are you sure it was Gi Dong-jae
who stabbed you?

996
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:39,779
Yes, sir.

997
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,282
-Of course.
-You just have to make sure

998
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,493
if we want to charge him
with injuring a detective.

999
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,496
Did you see Gi Dong-jae stab you?

1000
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,039
Gosh, seriously?

1001
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,209
I told you. I was stabbed by Gi Dong-jae.

1002
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,671
That's not what he said.

1003
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,965
Just check his weapon then.

1004
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,592
Weapon? The knife he uses for butchering?

1005
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,677
Yes.

1006
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,846
Well, that's a problem.

1007
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:09,100
More than five guys
held that knife that day.

1008
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,564
It's exactly as you testified.

1009
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,109
I just changed the reason why
you were pursuing Gi Dong-jae.

1010
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:19,777
I'm sure you know,

1011
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,988
Detective Kang had Gu Jae-chun believe

1012
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,741
Gi Dong-jae was the one
who killed their boss.

1013
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,577
The plan was to have Gu Jae-chun
catch Gi Dong-jae,

1014
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,370
so that you could arrest him, right?

1015
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:33,207
That method of investigation is illegal.

1016
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,920
Kang Do-chang may end up getting punished
if you try to go after Gi Dong-jae.

1017
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,381
You want to let Gi Dong-jae go, right?

1018
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,844
You should've arrested him on the spot.

1019
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,055
What kind of Violent Crimes detective

1020
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,391
gets beat up and his head bashed in
by a thug?

1021
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,059
You were overzealous and lost him.

1022
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,729
Then your junior detective
got stabbed in the stomach.

1023
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,440
You have no right to complain.

1024
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,446
Kang Do-chang, that guy.
He's a detective through and through.

1025
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,907
That's the only thing he can do.

1026
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,494
My goal is to have him keep his job

1027
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,663
as a fellow detective. Got it?

1028
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,832
You read everything, right?

1029
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,084
Sign it.

1030
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:20,797
You can't catch all the bad guys.

1031
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,467
There's no shame in losing
a couple of them, okay?

1032
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,641
So?

1033
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,976
Did you sign the statement?

1034
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,770
I had no choice.

1035
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,605
It was all my fault.

1036
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,398
How is it your fault, you punk?

1037
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,904
It's okay that I got hurt,

1038
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,989
but Man-gu got stabbed because of me.

1039
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:51,202
This happened because I didn't listen
to you and went after him ourselves.

1040
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,537
So how…

1041
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,749
How could I let Do-chang…

1042
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,045
get in trouble because of me again?

1043
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,759
Is Jang Gi-jin really a detective?

1044
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,094
How could he side with a thug?

1045
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,388
That bastard.

1046
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,722
-Hey, Do-chang.
-Do-chang.

1047
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,851
Do-chang. Where are you going?

1048
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,269
Do-chang. Wait for me.

1049
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,479
-Where are you going?
-Hey, hold up.

1050
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,690
What? Hey. Stop.

1051
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,401
Come on, Detective Oh. Go stop them.

1052
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,319
I think I would only make things worse.

1053
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,488
REGIONAL INVESTIGATION UNIT
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

1054
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,034
Where's the rest?

1055
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,996
They'll be here after they send
the statement to the prosecutor.

1056
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,540
Let's go without them.
I think it'll take some time.

1057
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:40,126
There's no rush.
Tell them to leave it for now and come.

1058
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,545
That restaurant requires
all parties to be present.

1059
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,088
Yes, okay.

1060
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,214
Hey!

1061
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,550
What is it now?

1062
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,970
You bastard.

1063
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,889
How dare you mess with my guys?

1064
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:57,351
Do we look like losers
you can push around, you piece of shit?

1065
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,061
Why are you releasing Gi Dong-jae?

1066
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,938
That bastard is a murderer. Why?

1067
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,440
Do you want your life to be ruined?

1068
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,608
You little punk.

1069
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,068
Are you mad?
How dare you start a fight here?

1070
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,403
Let go of me.

1071
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,405
You bastards!

1072
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,409
Don't move!

1073
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,537
Don't worry about them!
Keep beating his ass, sir!

1074
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,039
Let me go!

1075
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,081
-Let go.
-Hold still.

1076
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,082
Let go.

1077
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,375
Grab him!

1078
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,336
Let go!

1079
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,588
-Let me go!
-You better stop!

1080
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,797
-Stop.
-I said let go.

1081
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:54,492
Why is there a rumor
that Woo Tae-ho killed himself?

1082
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,453
I told you to bring what he was hiding,
not for you to use it.

1083
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,957
Just say the same thing
you told Woo Tae-ho in court.

1084
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,458
Things keep going awry.

1085
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,628
Wouldn't it be a bit risky,
getting the detectives' families involved?

1086
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,713
You can't do it
without my permission, Sang-woo.

1087
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,174
I think Na-na is trying to
dig up dirt on me.

1088
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,970
I'm saying there's no one left
to protect the Vice-chairman.

1089
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,473
I think he has something
in case he has to take the blame alone.

1090
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,432
We have to find it.

1091
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,770
