THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,488
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,705
Kill Jung Hui-ju.

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,918
I will give you enough
for generations to come.

5
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,920
Kill Jung Hui-ju!

6
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,257
Mr. Choi will take care of the rest.

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,217
All you need to do, Gi Dong-jae,

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,220
is to kill her.

9
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,930
Got it?

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,975
Thank you for saving me.

11
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,311
This is a token of my gratitude.

12
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,697
Hello?

13
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,908
We found Gi Dong-jae’s cell phone.

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,994
He recorded his calls
with Choi Yong-geun as we expected.

15
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,123
It’s from when he was
disposing of Jung Hui-ju’s body.

16
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,460
Even Choi Yong-geun can't wiggle
his way out of this.

17
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,924
All right. I’ll be there soon.

18
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,645
I could’ve been in danger
if you hadn’t sent someone over.

19
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,688
I have an illness.

20
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,234
I need daily shots to keep me alive.

21
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,946
But it seems someone switched out
the contents of my shot.

22
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,531
That’s why I went into shock.

23
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,243
Are you saying
someone did it intentionally?

24
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,661
I’m not sure.

25
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,246
This has never happened before.

26
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,585
I’ll contact you if it ever happens again.

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,379
Thank you for coming.

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,799
Aren't you needed at the station?
You should go.

29
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:17,095
Is the video I just watched on that USB?

30
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,012
Yes.

31
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,265
It’s important evidence
that’ll prove his crime.

32
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,975
You must hand it to the police.

33
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,351
Why?

34
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,145
We need it to catch the culprit.

35
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,522
This was recorded illegally.

36
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,399
Won’t I get in trouble too?

37
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,572
Well, then.

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,534
My job is done.

39
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,120
It’s your turn to do your job now.

40
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,539
Catch the culprit.

41
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,714
It might be impossible without that USB.

42
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,048
But you must.

43
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,594
You clearly saw the culprit for yourself.

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,848
Will you fail due to
a lack of evidence again?

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,018
Could you live with that?

46
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,399
I have faith in you. I’ll be waiting.

47
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,577
Ji-hyeok, think carefully about it.

48
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,747
Did you see the person
who stabbed your dad?

49
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,457
Do you remember his face?

50
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,792
Try to recall it.

51
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,378
You're the only one who saw it.

52
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,622
LEGAL TEAM DIRECTOR CHOI YONG-GEUN

53
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,752
I haven't been taking good care of you.

54
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,463
I've been so busy. I'm sorry.

55
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,147
Intimidating.

56
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,942
The building is but not the person.

57
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,652
Let's go.

58
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,870
What brings you here?

59
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,999
We came to arrest Choi Yong-geun.
Where is that punk?

60
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,750
He went to the Chairman’s office.

61
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,961
All right then. Let's go.

62
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,673
Wait.

63
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,926
Are you sure about arresting Mr. Choi?

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,304
Yes. We have solid evidence.

65
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,555
His crimes are clear.

66
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,516
He can’t get out of this.
Choi Yong-geun is done for.

67
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,851
Gosh, I'm impressed.

68
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,230
How cool.

69
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,774
Why would you say that?

70
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,569
What’s wrong? I simply told the truth.

71
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,739
Look. Were you saying our team was cool

72
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,283
or did you mean Detective Kwon Jae-hong?

73
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,035
Detective Kwon Jae-hong…

74
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,371
Don’t tell me
you were talking about Detective Kwon.

75
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,873
Who is Detective Kwon Jae-hong?

76
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,291
You didn’t even know his name?

77
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,420
We solved the issue regarding Gi Dong-jae.

78
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,423
But it seems like that was
the least of our worries.

79
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,220
If things go south,
I may have to go to the police.

80
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,764
Why?

81
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,474
It’s Kim Min-ji.

82
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,809
Kim Min-ji?

83
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,229
Don’t worry about me, Chairman.
Just go see Kim Min-ji.

84
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,732
You must keep her mouth shut.

85
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,567
Give her money, the kid, or anything.

86
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,736
You must get her on your side.

87
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,405
If you fail to do that…

88
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,824
What in the world are you talking about?

89
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,034
Chairman.

90
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,452
CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,669
Who are you people?

92
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,632
We have an arrest warrant
for Choi Yong-geun.

93
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,843
Mark my words, sir.

94
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,678
-Arrest him.
-I'll do it.

95
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,023
Choi Yong-geun, you are under arrest
for abetting the murder of Jung Hui-ju.

96
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,279
You have the right to an attorney.
You have the right to remain silent.

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,200
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in court.

98
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,827
I clearly read your rights, yes?

99
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,623
You darn bastard.

100
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,417
Hey, be careful with that.
It's a piece of art.

101
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,669
It's not a shot glass.

102
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,007
What’s wrong with him?
Did he not cooperate?

103
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,177
I'm not sure. I went red for a moment.

104
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,972
My mind went blank for a second.

105
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,100
Why didn't you just cooperate, sir?

106
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,186
You're well aware
of how pissed we all are.

107
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,896
Be gentle with him.

108
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,193
Good day then.

109
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,155
I'll see you soon, Chairman.

110
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,341
Are you in love with anyone?

111
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,178
Pardon? No.

112
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,722
Not yet…

113
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,683
So you didn’t love him.

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,232
You shouldn’t have kept the baby then.

115
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,777
Will a child born without love

116
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,447
ever be happy?

117
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,117
I’ve always wanted to ask my mom

118
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,203
why she gave birth to me.

119
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,541
Was it because of her greed?

120
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,043
Or…

121
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,214
if it was truly for my happiness.

122
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,677
What’s your child’s name?

123
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,015
It's Su-yeon.

124
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,934
Su-yeon…

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,898
I hope her life won’t be
as unfortunate as mine.

126
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,152
I’m sorry.

127
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,571
I’m so sorry.

128
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,169
It’s been tough, right?

129
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,464
Su-yeon

130
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,675
and you, her mom.

131
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,096
I will guarantee you both a happy life.

132
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,820
Drive the car you transported her in
for a while then drive it into water.

133
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,072
DNA remains even if you
scrap it or burn it,

134
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,156
so get it underwater.

135
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,368
Check thoroughly for evidence
before you do it.

136
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,706
Burn all your belongings to ashes.

137
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,832
Yes, sir.

138
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,629
If a beautiful woman in her twenties
from a big company goes missing

139
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,630
or her body is found

140
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,507
then you investigate
her acquaintances first.

141
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,676
To ensure that step never happens

142
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,053
and hide the real motive of the murder,

143
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,724
making her the victim of
a serial killer was the surest way.

144
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,811
Your long experience
as a detective came in handy.

145
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,856
You were sure serial killer
Lee Seong-gon would never get caught.

146
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,984
If he does get caught,
he would deny all charges.

147
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,945
The police who caught the serial killer

148
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,240
had no reason to look for
the copycat killer.

149
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,117
They had no way to prove it anyway.

150
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,787
So you obtained pictures
from the serial murder scenes

151
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,248
and sent them to Gi Dong-jae.

152
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,709
Gi Dong-jae, who killed Jung Hui-ju,

153
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,088
did exactly as you ordered him.

154
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,471
Is that what Gi Dong-jae told you?

155
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,057
This was all from a recording
on Gi Dong-jae's phone.

156
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,977
It's been confirmed that it was his phone.

157
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,939
Even without Gi Dong-jae's testimony,
we have enough to prove it was you.

158
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,195
Meaning, it's been revealed that you
ordered Jung Hui-ju to be murdered.

159
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,324
I wonder…

160
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,244
Why in the world would I want to kill her?

161
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,040
She was nothing but
a subordinate employee to me.

162
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,085
Is that enough to be a motive for murder?

163
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,339
You are truly unlucky,

164
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,384
Mr. Choi.

165
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
If you hadn't dragged me into
Kim Min-ji's assault case

166
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,764
from two years ago,

167
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,851
it would've made it very hard for us

168
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,561
to find your motive for this case.

169
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,815
Mr. Woo Tae-ho, Director Cheon Na-na,

170
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,150
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

171
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,820
I came to know
those three people through that case.

172
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,489
I naturally connected the two cases

173
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,659
from the past and now.

174
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,414
It all comes down to your choice now.

175
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,125
Will you choose to be
the abettor of the murder?

176
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,253
Or will you reveal the real culprit

177
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,714
and be charged with only ordering
the disposal of a corpse?

178
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,553
We know the abettor isn't you.

179
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,390
All you did was link the abettor
to Gi Dong-jae.

180
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,978
You're asking me to either
tell who the real culprit is

181
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,980
or take the fall for everything?

182
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,775
This used to be one of my go-to tricks.

183
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,489
The one who falls for it is the naive one,
don't you agree?

184
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,951
That's something for the judge to decide.

185
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,120
It's not up to a detective to ask.

186
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,166
Kudos on getting this far though.

187
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,042
But this is it.

188
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,212
Don't waste your time

189
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,756
and just leave the rest
up to the prosecution.

190
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,758
Choi Yong-geun, that punk.

191
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,594
THE SAFEST REGION, SEOBU

192
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,180
He's saying
he won't cooperate with us anymore.

193
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,223
He's not one to confess either.

194
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,602
This case may not even make it
up to Cheon Sang-woo,

195
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,353
but stop at Choi Yong-geun.

196
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,523
Let's be realistic.

197
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,734
Choi Yong-geun is truly a scumbag.

198
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,487
He's the one who drove my daughter
up the wall too.

199
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,906
The fact that we got him

200
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,534
is already a big win,
considering the tycoon we were up against.

201
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,788
I think it's time we face reality--

202
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,291
We can't do that, sir. I can't allow it.

203
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,588
I clearly saw and heard Cheon Sang-woo
order the crime.

204
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,970
Did you meet Team Director Choi Yong-geun?

205
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,764
-Yes, sir.
-What did he say?

206
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,434
He said there's a file on his computer
that you must see for yourself.

207
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,228
What the hell is this file?

208
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,939
He said the prosecution
most likely has it now.

209
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,525
And that you should see it
and be prepared.

210
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,113
He said I'll never get to see
my child again.

211
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,491
And that

212
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,952
he'll make sure Hui-ju never talks

213
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,871
by sending someone to take care of her.

214
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,542
He said she deserved to die
because you were cheating

215
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,086
on your wife with her.

216
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,590
To reveal Cheon Sang-woo's motive
for abetting murder,

217
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,843
don't we need the video
that you saw, Detective Oh?

218
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,971
There's no way Cheon Na-na
would just give it.

219
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,557
She might get arrested
for illegally filming him.

220
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,184
If she hands it over,
it was filmed illegally.

221
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,937
The court will reject it
as inadmissible evidence.

222
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,524
Why did she even show it to Detective Oh?

223
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,068
It's obvious.
She wants her brother arrested.

224
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,446
If the Chairman is arrested,
who will take his place?

225
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,823
Cheon Seong-dae is in prison

226
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,993
and if her brother follows suit,
she'll be the only option left.

227
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,578
Cheon Na-na had one objective.

228
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,746
"Cheon Sang-woo abetted the murder."

229
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,874
She was trying to make that clear.

230
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,502
We didn't need her help to know that.

231
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,587
Gosh.

232
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,883
How will we arrest Cheon Sang-woo,
now that he's an all-powerful being?

233
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,427
We just need Choi Yong-geun
to mention his name.

234
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,430
That won't be easy.
He'll keep blaming it all on Gi Dong-jae.

235
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,641
Plus, if he says
all he did was coach Gi Dong-jae,

236
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,060
there's no need to mention Cheon Sang-woo.

237
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,978
Anything on Gi?

238
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,647
He's completely off the grid.
Either he went abroad

239
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,191
or Gu Jae-chun killed him
and he's buried somewhere.

240
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,485
So we're back to square one again?

241
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,323
I failed to obtain the video,
but I remember it clearly.

242
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,284
Cheon Sang-woo talked to Jung Hui-ju
before he told Gi Dong-jae

243
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,245
to kill her. His motives are hidden in
that conversation.

244
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,289
We just need to find it and prove it.

245
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,833
To do that, we'll have to investigate him.

246
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,959
It won't be easy.

247
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,796
We arrested Choi right in front of him.
He's probably well prepared now.

248
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,966
Don't investigate Cheon.
Look into Jung Hui-ju and Woo Tae-ho.

249
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,053
The late Woo Tae-ho and Jung Hui-ju?

250
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,598
Isn't it better to scope
Cheon Sang-woo who's still alive?

251
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,936
You remember the passcode
that was written in Jung's diary, right?

252
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,062
Yes, I do.

253
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,064
Cheon Sang-woo said something

254
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,900
to Jung Hui-ju in the video I saw.

255
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,237
I told you to bring
what Woo Tae-ho was hiding,

256
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,656
not for you to use it.

257
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,953
Yes, it's me.

258
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,872
Please put Su-yeon on the phone.

259
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,000
Hi, Su-yeon.

260
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,126
It's her?

261
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,463
Su-yeon.

262
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,631
Mommy!

263
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,634
I'm sorry I can't be there.

264
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,886
-Su-yeon.
-When we have time for it,

265
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,722
-I'll come see you with Mommy.
-Su-yeon.

266
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,266
-Su-yeon.
-Okay, Daddy.

267
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,768
Hang in there, okay?

268
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,854
In the meantime,
listen to your nanny, okay?

269
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,774
-Su-yeon.
-Be a good girl, all right?

270
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,900
Okay.

271
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,360
Su-yeon!

272
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,237
Please give me the phone.

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,281
Please let me see her face one more time.

274
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,327
You saw she's doing fine.

275
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,999
Where is she? Where is Su-yeon right now?

276
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,041
Sit down.

277
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,002
Sit!

278
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,555
I won't ask why you told Woo Tae-ho

279
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,016
all the things you did.

280
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,562
It's fine as long
as you don't testify in court.

281
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
If the police keep prying,

282
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,942
just tell them you made it up

283
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,113
to spite me
because you missed Su-yeon so much.

284
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,906
You didn't tell the police.

285
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,117
It was a private conversation with Tae-ho.

286
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,747
So no harm will come from you saying that.

287
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,000
Wouldn't you like to go to America
to see Su-yeon with me?

288
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,920
You miss her, don't you?

289
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,797
I'm satisfied with knowing she's well.

290
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,301
She called you Daddy just now.

291
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,428
You just admitted it.

292
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,889
Right?

293
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,522
Go and tell your father

294
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,733
that he has a granddaughter.

295
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,527
-What?
-Tell him

296
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,782
to acknowledge her
as an official member of your family.

297
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,203
That would guarantee her well-being
even when I'm gone.

298
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,163
I don't care what happens to me.

299
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,957
That's all I ask from you.

300
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,920
Then I will do everything

301
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,006
you want me to do.

302
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,141
Min-ji.

303
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,143
Did you

304
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,522
come up with this yourself?

305
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,945
I thought about it
from Woo Tae-ho's perspective.

306
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,863
The moment it was revealed that

307
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,450
his beloved Jung Hui-ju
wasn't a victim of a serial killer.

308
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,452
What went through his mind?

309
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,374
As a former prosecutor,
he would've looked for the motive first.

310
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,420
We just need to walk the path
that he walked on.

311
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,386
But will these people
give us what we need?

312
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,398
I thought becoming a father
would change you.

313
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
But you're the same.

314
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,998
Your goal is to bring me down
by whatever means, right?

315
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,000
Right?

316
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,712
Do you think you can take what's mine?

317
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,922
That Father will choose you?

318
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,551
You're the only one
who thinks we're family.

319
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,012
-I know.
-Do you?

320
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,639
Then just stick with the leftovers
he throws at you.

321
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,642
Don't get in over your head
and risk losing everything.

322
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,478
I'm always grateful
for him taking care of me too.

323
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,607
That's why Tae-ho and I
always cleaned up your mess.

324
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,985
But you made another mistake.

325
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,613
I'm simply trying to help you again.

326
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,077
Do you still think
I can't see right through you?

327
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,747
Wipe that smile off.

328
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,292
You just want to avenge your mom.

329
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,628
Since you think
I was the cause of her death.

330
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,838
It was her choice.

331
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,593
She decided death would be better
than the hell she was living in.

332
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,513
That means I killed her.

333
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,642
I'm curious though. What's the reason?

334
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,519
You've been hiding all your life.

335
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,439
Why are you revealing your true self now?

336
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,566
I get it.

337
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,695
Did you find the confidence
to steal what's mine?

338
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,989
I see.

339
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,534
But Na-na,

340
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,162
you're not capable.

341
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,291
Even if I come across the worst case,

342
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,293
I won't allow you to steal from me.

343
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,838
Even if I died,

344
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,383
you still wouldn't get it.

345
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,011
Never.

346
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,191
You're exactly like your mom.

347
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,277
I mean your pathetic lives.

348
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,920
Hello?

349
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,010
All right. Show them whatever they want.

350
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,178
Yes, Director. I understand.

351
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,433
What footage do you need?

352
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,978
Did Mr. Woo request to see
any CCTV footage?

353
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,730
Yes, we have it stored.

354
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,787
This is it.

355
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,082
Woo Tae-ho told Jung Hui-ju
the passcode to this safe

356
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,542
and had her get this laptop.

357
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,256
So it had the information
they had to shield from the prosecution.

358
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,051
I'm sure the CCTV footage

359
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,303
of Cheon Sang-woo's assault case
is in here too.

360
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,805
That's why on that day, she said…

361
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,141
What if I sent that video
to Director Cheon?

362
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,894
Then the Chairman would see it too.

363
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,689
Don't you fear them more than the police?

364
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,149
What is this?

365
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,111
Can you come here for a second?

366
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,497
Who is this man taking photos?

367
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,630
Mr. Park Seong-ok. Over here.

368
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,135
Why did you ask for me?

369
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,137
I'm Oh Ji-hyeok
from Incheon Seobu Station.

370
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,807
This photo. You took it, right?

371
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,185
Who ordered you to take this?

372
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,229
Well…

373
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,607
You told Mr. Woo
it was Chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

374
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,653
The Chairman ordered you

375
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,782
to find evidence of Woo Tae-ho
and Jung Hui-ju's affair, right?

376
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,661
So the Chairman was already
aware of their relationship.

377
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,039
What do you want? Is it money?

378
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,960
Or do you want me to make him
get a divorce for you?

379
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,338
Cheon Sang-woo came by
my store in the past.

380
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,340
I recognized him from his shoes

381
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,843
the last time I saw him.

382
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,804
What did he say to you at the store?

383
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,807
He said preposterous things about Hui-ju.

384
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,601
Now that I think about it,

385
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,355
it seems like he knew about
Hui-ju's relationship with Mr. Woo.

386
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,026
He was the one
who sent Hui-ju the pictures, right?

387
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,319
Yes, he was.

388
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,782
Why did he bother to come here
and ask about Hui-ju though?

389
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,994
What about your shoemaker grandfather?

390
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,373
He seemed pretty frail.

391
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,751
What are you saying?

392
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,630
I'm saying that your grandfather
may see hell before you do.

393
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,843
Hui-ju showed me the CCTV footage
of my assault from two years ago.

394
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,889
She told me to use it to get my child
back from the Vice-chairman.

395
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,850
She said if he refuses,

396
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,270
she will take it to the police herself.

397
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,646
So--

398
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,694
Woo Tae-ho kept the CCTV footage

399
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,696
of Cheon Sang-woo's assault on his laptop.

400
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,990
Jung Hui-ju watched it

401
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,201
and instead of handing it
to Cheon Sang-woo,

402
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,953
she showed it to the victim, Kim Min-ji.

403
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,248
Then she used it
to threaten Cheon Sang-woo?

404
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,835
Maybe that's why he killed Jung Hui-ju?

405
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,004
Is that how it panned out?

406
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:10,217
Plus, Jung Hui-ju knew another one
of Cheon Sang-woo's biggest weaknesses.

407
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,346
Also, if the Chairman finds out
why you assaulted Min-ji,

408
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,766
he will be greatly disappointed.

409
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,561
She learned he had a child
out of wedlock through Kim Min-ji.

410
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,272
He's been eyeing his father's position.

411
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,483
He needed to keep
Jung Hui-ju's mouth shut.

412
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,695
Isn't his motive for murder
clear as day then?

413
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,449
The video Cheon Na-na showed you
turned out to be a big help.

414
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,536
I guess so.

415
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,998
One thing bothers me though.

416
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,251
What? What's bothering you now?

417
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,213
Why did Woo Tae-ho die?

418
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,011
Did you happen to show the video I saw

419
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,597
to Mr. Woo too?

420
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,140
No.

421
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,684
That makes sense.

422
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,937
Since you didn't trust him.

423
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,565
Did the video I showed you come in handy?

424
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:11,278
Yes. I think we can easily find
his motive to murder her.

425
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,029
You're a capable detective, I see.

426
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,536
Although, we would've figured that out
without seeing the video

427
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,496
if Mr. Woo had been alive.

428
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:23,999
Mr. Woo already knew

429
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,544
that Chairman Cheon Sang-woo
ordered Jung Hui-ju to be killed.

430
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,504
But to reveal that truth,

431
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,215
he had to voluntarily admit
to his affair with Jung Hui-ju.

432
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,760
It would've been impossible
to explain Cheon's motive then.

433
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,389
He must've decided to reveal it,

434
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,142
so I'm confused

435
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,437
as to why he chose to die

436
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,857
after you showed the photos in the car.

437
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,448
If he found out my brother was the culprit

438
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,993
and I was aware that he knew,

439
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,332
what reason would I have had
to kill him by unfastening his seatbelt?

440
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,669
If he had told the truth to you people,

441
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,380
I would've taken my brother's spot
as the Chairman instead.

442
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,174
So why kill him?

443
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,595
Right. Thank you for your cooperation.

444
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:22,223
Come by anytime if you're stumped.
Let's solve it together.

445
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,810
Do you have any other videos
besides the one you showed me

446
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,771
that could help with the investigation?

447
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,230
I erased everything.

448
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,567
I'll be back if I'm stumped.

449
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,124
Yes, welcome.

450
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,587
Did you find out
what Woo Tae-ho is hiding?

451
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,799
He's not hiding anything.

452
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,345
VICE-CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

453
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,681
You're mistaken. He's hiding something.

454
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,852
I'm sure he's gathering all the dirt
of each family member

455
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,604
in a secret location.

456
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,482
That's his power source.

457
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,652
Why would he tell that to
a mere employee like me?

458
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,113
Because you're the only one he trusts.

459
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,499
What would happen if your relationship

460
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,502
with Tae-ho comes to light?

461
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,673
You have nothing to lose.

462
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:41,428
But Woo Tae-ho will have to throw
his entire life in the garbage.

463
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,806
You love Woo Tae-ho, don't you?

464
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,900
The door is locked.

465
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,282
CHOI YONG-GEUN, LEGAL TEAM

466
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,119
Wait.

467
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,663
Hold on. What's going on?

468
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,248
Push him back.

469
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,002
Please pause what you're doing
and cooperate.

470
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,336
You two, go that way.

471
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,306
-The door is closing.
-Yes, Director?

472
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,901
TJ TALENT DEVELOPMENT CENTER

473
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,157
Ms. Jung!

474
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,869
Why did you come here?

475
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,371
-I just--
-Hold up.

476
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,791
Is that Mr. Woo's personal laptop

477
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,460
that you're about to burn?

478
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,296
Why do you have that?

479
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,215
Give it to me.

480
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,176
I can't. Mr. Woo ordered me to burn it.

481
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,179
He's just worried
the prosecution might take it.

482
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,223
Give it here. It'll be safe with me.

483
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,683
I'll make sure
you won't get in trouble, okay?

484
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,561
I'm sorry. Mr. Woo's order is my priority.

485
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,313
Could you hand it to me then?

486
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,108
Director?

487
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,117
Give it.

488
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,747
But…

489
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,459
It's me. The Director of the company
you work for.

490
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,878
And the owner of that laptop
is my husband.

491
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,382
Director, the thing is--

492
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,425
I thought I made it clear.

493
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,887
That belongs to the man
I share a bed with.

494
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,407
Mr. Woo will be very disappointed.

495
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,994
-Pardon?
-If it were me,

496
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,580
I would've burned it without hesitation

497
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,374
regardless of who asked for it.

498
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,960
You betrayed him.

499
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,714
Tell him you did as you were told.

500
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,007
I won't tell him either.

501
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,677
I would hate to break the trust
you two share.

502
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,346
-Director, I am--
-Stop.

503
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,932
Shut your mouth.

504
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,324
You did well.

505
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,452
You're done for the day, so go home now.

506
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,913
By the way,

507
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,250
tell Mr. Woo you burned it
as he ordered you to.

508
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,254
Or else the Director might get mad again.

509
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,757
Yes, sir.

510
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,036
What do you think is in that laptop?

511
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,413
I don't think that's any of your business.

512
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,419
I'm just worried
there may be information about me.

513
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,548
Mr. Woo and I share a lot
of secrets you see.

514
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,843
I'll destroy it
before anyone else sees it so don't worry.

515
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,011
If that's the case,

516
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,599
there will be one more person
who knows about my secrets.

517
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,561
What do you want?

518
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,648
For both of us to hold onto the secrets.

519
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,111
That would help me trust you.

520
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,280
Aren't you asking too much?

521
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,533
If you gain my trust,

522
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,204
you would also be gaining a loyal servant.

523
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,248
Does that sound like a bad deal?

524
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,460
It's not too bad.

525
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,547
-You're going to the office, right?
-Yes.

526
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,341
Leave the laptop with me first.

527
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,387
I will have it discreetly delivered
to your office so nobody notices.

528
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,278
You love Woo Tae-ho, don't you?

529
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,960
Why?

530
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
Why did you do it?

531
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,675
Why? Tell me why.

532
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,761
Why?

533
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,099
We have gathered evidence

534
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,518
that identifies former gang member
Gi as the suspect

535
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,145
in Jung Hui-ju's murder case.

536
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,690
We have put out
a nationwide APB to find him.

537
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,526
We've also arrested Choi,

538
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,488
the director of a corporate legal team,

539
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,822
for abetting her murder.

540
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,119
Why was this suspect
identified as the culprit?

541
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,080
In the car that the suspect abandoned,

542
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,792
we found the cap of a lipstick
that was used by the victim.

543
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,087
We also gathered multiple CCTV footage

544
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,172
of the suspect chasing after the victim.

545
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,965
INVESTIGATING SUSPECT
IN JUNG HUI-JU'S CASE

546
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,133
Yes, over there.

547
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,137
What was the evidence you found
of him abetting the murder?

548
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,057
We seized his phone,

549
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,979
and we found solid evidence
that he abetted her murder.

550
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,649
You said he was
a corporate legal team director.

551
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,027
Is it TJ Group? The victim's employer?

552
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:17,698
I'm sorry, but I can't disclose that.

553
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,828
That means the abettor
was the one with the motive.

554
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,871
Do you have any leads on that?

555
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,040
We're still investigating.

556
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,544
Woo Tae-ho,
the Director of TJ's legal team

557
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,546
was in a fatal car accident recently.

558
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,716
Is it related to Jung Hui-ju's case?

559
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,512
I can't disclose that matter either.

560
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,014
Regardless, we're looking into it.

561
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,603
The police have identified Choi,
an executive-level employee of TJ

562
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,566
as the suspect
who abetted Jung Hui-ju's murder.

563
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,278
But there are still doubts
and skepticism about the case,

564
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,282
as it may all end
with an employee taking the fall for it,

565
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,952
as it is often the case
with investigations on conglomerates.

566
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:07,498
Which powerful person is behind all this?

567
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,292
The public's attention is focused on

568
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,919
the results that
the investigation will bear.

569
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,257
Why are they blowing things up

570
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,385
by making up stories
that we didn't even announce?

571
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,309
Hello?

572
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,478
Yes, Mr. Cha.

573
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,107
What do you want me to do?
It's already been aired.

574
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,902
Why are you bringing your sister up?

575
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,237
Her husband has nothing to do
with this case.

576
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,824
The subcontractor deal fell through
because he's incompetent.

577
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,579
Listen. I had to do
what the Chief was too scared to do.

578
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,831
Hello? Honey?

579
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,666
Darn it.

580
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,461
Is your wife really upset?

581
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,587
Weren't you listening?

582
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,963
She told me not to come home.

583
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,090
Fine by me.

584
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,176
I'm tired of being nagged anyway.

585
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,178
I'm more at peace not seeing her.

586
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,390
I will miss my daughter though.

587
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,226
Gosh.

588
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,774
Yes, Chief.

589
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:16,943
The prosecutor?

590
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,112
I'll be taking over this case.
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

591
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,781
Sure.

592
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,200
When did you come back to Incheon though?

593
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,869
Did we work on a case together?

594
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,456
-Remember Oh Chung-sik's case--
-I don't recall.

595
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,458
Gi Dong-jae and Choi Yong-geun.

596
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:36,295
We have enough to uphold their charges.

597
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,881
Good job.

598
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,216
Let's wrap this up quickly.

599
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,510
There's still a lot to investigate.

600
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,303
Like?

601
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,013
Choi Yong-geun isn't the abettor.

602
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,390
Then who?

603
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,351
All he did was aid Gi Dong-jae
in disposing of the body.

604
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,853
The real abettor is Cheon Sang-woo.

605
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,317
-Do you have proof?
-We don't have physical evidence.

606
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,860
But his motive is clear.

607
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,365
So it's just circumstantial evidence.

608
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,326
I'll be honest with you.

609
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,954
Detectives should dig into a murder
until the very end.

610
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,707
But what if you lose the trial
after all that digging?

611
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,751
If the suspect was your average citizen,

612
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,878
you can drink away your anger.

613
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,756
But say the opponent is
the chairman of a conglomerate.

614
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,176
How will you handle the aftermath?

615
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,095
It won't stop at me and you two.

616
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,889
Every single one
of your acquaintances will be…

617
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,851
They'll all be wiped out.

618
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,519
-Got it?
-I'm confident we'll win the trial--

619
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,979
You're not the prosecutor!

620
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm the one going to trial, man!

621
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,153
The Chairman has ordered me
to form a team of attorneys.

622
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,240
We're reaching out to attorneys

623
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,243
who were former District Directors
and Superintendent Generals.

624
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,455
The trial will play
to your utmost advantage.

625
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,917
It's all up to me not to mess up then.

626
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,627
Yes, that's right.

627
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,296
Okay.

628
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:07,053
A gangster I know
recently said something to me.

629
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,515
How the only weapon he has
is honesty or something.

630
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,729
It seems like I might be in his shoes now.

631
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,443
Relay this message to the Chairman.

632
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,364
"Choi Yong-geun may use his weapon,
so you should be careful."

633
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,200
"Don't do anything to provoke him."

634
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,788
I heard you paid Mr. Cha a visit.

635
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,873
-What did he say?
-Well…

636
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,124
I guess it's obvious.

637
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,293
"Let's wrap it up
with Choi as the culprit."

638
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,670
Isn't that right?

639
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,839
Prosecutor Cha Mun-ho.

640
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,551
He has failed to make Chief Prosecutor
countless times.

641
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,969
His career is at an end.

642
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:53,641
So why do you think they appointed
a prosecutor like him to this case?

643
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,518
They gave him a chance.

644
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,189
They're saying his next career move
should be to go work for TJ.

645
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:05,111
He'll earn billions if he works for them.

646
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,656
If you were the prosecutor,
would you indict Cheon Sang-woo?

647
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,076
What's the point of us
working our butts off?

648
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,744
The prosecutor won't indict him.

649
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,875
The director position of our legal team
is currently vacant.

650
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:24,296
As you know,
it was Mr. Woo Tae-ho's position.

651
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,969
Go straight into working for TJ
after I wrap up a case involving them?

652
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,639
Wouldn't that arouse suspicion?

653
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:39,145
In that case, you should go abroad
for a one to two-year-long vacation.

654
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,313
We will cover all the expenses.

655
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,315
You know, recently my wife's been going on

656
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,444
about moving to Gangnam
for the children's education.

657
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,613
You must go then.
You've struggled long enough.

658
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,825
My first son is dumb as a rock.

659
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,035
I think he may have to study abroad.

660
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,457
If that's the goal,
we'll support it the best we can.

661
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,503
Gosh, I don't know how to say this.

662
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,255
I've been very lonely these days.

663
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,300
I want you to find me a girlfriend.

664
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:15,931
Sure.

665
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,391
What's so funny?

666
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,103
I've been a public prosecutor
for 20 years.

667
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,814
I can't move up any further.

668
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,067
This is the perfect time for me to quit.

669
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,363
I just want to earn a little more
than I am now.

670
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,584
Will that be easy to do?

671
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,085
So I have to choose?

672
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,880
Go big or go home?

673
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,883
If that's a problem
then just pull out of the case.

674
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,178
We have many prosecutors
who will gladly take this case.

675
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,723
Gosh, what a conundrum.

676
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,975
Goodness.

677
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,811
Let's move forward.

678
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,649
I don't want to end my career
in the gutters.

679
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,611
Yes, you've had a rough ride.
It's time you fly first class now.

680
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,407
All right. First class it is.

681
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,044
POLICE PROVE LEE DAE-CHEOL'S INNOCENCE

682
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,588
INCHEON SEOBU STATION
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE

683
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,092
Did we work on a case together?

684
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,719
Remember Oh Chung-sik's case--

685
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,347
Did the police use any wrongful force?

686
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,933
Or did they violate any human rights?

687
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,560
No.

688
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,603
All right.

689
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,772
Let's go.

690
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,774
Hey.

691
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,986
I got--

692
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,114
Goodness. Hello, Mr. Cha.

693
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,241
-Hello.
-You caught Oh Chung-sik.

694
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,285
Yes, it wasn't easy.

695
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,619
Take him.

696
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:03,998
Nice work.

697
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,417
Where did you catch him? Why the tuxedo?

698
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,335
At the wedding hall.

699
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,046
For your wedding?

700
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,841
I had no choice.
He got caught on my radar.

701
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,142
How can I deal with
this lunatic detective?

702
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,562
Nothing will faze this guy.

703
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,442
Let's figure out how to ride first class.

704
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,365
What? Why would Bong-sik's wife
give this to me?

705
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,826
She's pleading with you
to not take it too far.

706
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,620
No good comes from attacking TJ.

707
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,165
She's begging you
to save her brother-in-law.

708
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,626
He's close to being booted in his field

709
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,004
thanks to Captain Woo briefing on TV.

710
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,798
She can't mix business
with private matters.

711
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,760
But I understand where she's coming from.

712
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,430
Her sister's family's well-being is
on the line. I would do the same.

713
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:05,934
So, please. Direct the investigation

714
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,646
in a way that won't cause others harm.

715
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,731
Do-chang.

716
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,441
It's a murder case.

717
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,318
We have a dead victim

718
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,528
and a bereaved family in pain.

719
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,865
How can I steer the investigation
according to my liking?

720
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,242
That can't and should never happen.

721
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,496
I heard you and Detective Oh
are the only ones not budging.

722
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,957
She said this can end somewhat amicably
so long as you change your mind.

723
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,876
Is that what Bong-sik told her?

724
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,837
Do-chang. I don't disagree
with how you live your life.

725
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,841
But don't force others to live as you do.

726
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,678
Can you fend
for all your colleagues' families?

727
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,805
Are you capable of doing that?

728
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,473
Darn it.

729
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,142
She must be at her wit's end.

730
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,938
Seeing how she resorted to pleading
with her husband's subordinate.

731
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,066
What is it?

732
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,959
I'm sorry, Dong-uk.

733
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,212
I know I've only made your life hard
as your useless older brother.

734
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,715
I won't cause you any more trouble.

735
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,260
Live a good life. Be happy, okay?

736
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,140
-This was his last message?
-Yes.

737
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,226
Any updates? We must hurry
and find him before something happens.

738
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,310
Hold on, sir.

739
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,896
There's no need to try so hard.

740
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,357
He has hit rock bottom.

741
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,693
That punk doesn't deserve to live.

742
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:41,738
Don't say that, you little punk.
He's your brother.

743
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,407
I'm better off without him.

744
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,576
His brother is a cop,

745
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,787
yet he chose to steal.
Why the hell would I want him around?

746
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,039
Hey, your brother is a victim.

747
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,083
Choi Yong-geun is the scumbag
for using him.

748
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:58,088
He almost ruined Bo-gyeong's life.

749
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,342
She's the daughter of the Chief
that I work for at the station.

750
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,721
He did that fully knowing that fact.

751
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,139
Why should I save him?

752
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,391
It's best to leave him to die.

753
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,936
We found his location.

754
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,023
Gilsang-myeon, Choiha-ri 45.

755
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,123
Over here!

756
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,885
Please don't tell my brother Sim Dong-uk

757
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,804
even if my body floats to the surface.

758
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,473
-Dong-uk.
-I beg you.

759
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,767
-Label me as unclaimed.
-Hurry up and find him!

760
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,233
-Do you see him?
-Sir!

761
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,026
-Get out!
-No!

762
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,904
-Hey, stop!
-Run!

763
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,948
Hey! Come back!

764
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,408
-Hey!
-Over here!

765
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,035
Come back!

766
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,788
-Come back!
-Don't do it!

767
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,748
-Please!
-Come here.

768
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,042
-Stop.
-Hey!

769
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,461
Hey, stop right there!

770
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,463
You punk!

771
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,674
-Hey!
-Come on!

772
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,676
-Hey!
-Get him!

773
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,886
-I'm serious!
-Dong-uk is here!

774
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,847
-Dong-uk is here!
-Over there!

775
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,809
Get him!

776
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,144
Don't do this.

777
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,608
Let go!

778
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,574
-They got him. We have him.
-Let go of me!

779
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,872
Hey, I'll ride with you.

780
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,877
It's okay. Give us some privacy.

781
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:02,963
That's what you want?

782
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,549
Don't scold him too much.

783
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,467
He even wrote a will.

784
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,720
Okay.

785
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,432
I'll call you at the hospital.
You should all go now.

786
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,311
Hey, guys.

787
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,479
I'm sorry.

788
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,024
-No, it's okay. Get going.
-It's fine.

789
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,191
We'll get going.

790
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,576
If you write something like this,

791
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,621
who do you think they'll contact

792
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,499
when your body is found?

793
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,212
Your brother Sim Dong-uk, you idiot.

794
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,592
You've never used your brain.

795
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,969
Were you planning on dying that way too?

796
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:52,721
I'm sorry.

797
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,015
Darn it.

798
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,810
Were you serious about dying?

799
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,772
Tell me.

800
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,114
Let's just say you died this time.

801
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,284
You'll start again
from the very beginning.

802
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,204
Let's live a new life, okay?

803
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,957
I am begging you.

804
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,675
Okay.

805
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,721
I'll do that, Dong-uk.

806
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,099
Thank you.

807
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,644
Thank you…

808
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,074
Have you been digging for clams?

809
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,247
Gosh, you could've washed up
at a sauna before you came.

810
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,375
We can't go to a sauna like this.
That would be rude.

811
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,376
We're sorry.

812
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,671
We'll clean up the dirt we brought in.

813
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,631
Hurry up and bring our chicken.

814
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,300
Everyone gets a whole chicken.

815
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,845
-I pre-ordered for us.
-Okay.

816
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,181
Who calls ten minutes before arriving?

817
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,475
My gosh. What is this?

818
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,399
It's a little sour.

819
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,777
The sauce is delicious.
It helps cut the grease.

820
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,821
-Really?
-Eun-hui.

821
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,906
We're missing two pints of beer.

822
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,825
You two can't be drinking.

823
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,870
You were just discharged
from the hospital.

824
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,373
Drink this instead of beer.

825
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,919
We're okay now.
The doctor said we can have a glass--

826
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,796
Just drink up, Ji-ung.

827
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,591
She prepared it
for the sake of our health.

828
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,967
I just want a cold glass--

829
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,598
She got vitamins just for us.

830
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,435
-I will always be your fan. Really.
-It's not from me.

831
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:07,147
A gift from Captain Woo's wife.
She trusts you'll make the right choice.

832
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:14,196
Bong-sik. Earlier, your wife--

833
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,865
I know already. She told me everything.

834
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,744
She's just venting to Eun-hui
because she has no one else to go to.

835
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,204
Don't let it bother you.

836
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:29,085
Dong-uk's brother almost died today.

837
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,837
If he actually ended his life,

838
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,131
Dong-uk's would have been over too.

839
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,511
Those guys almost killed my boy

840
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,554
and his brother.

841
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,389
Look, I…

842
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,935
I know I've been a pushover all my life.

843
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,021
But I can't let this slide. Never.

844
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:51,107
I agree. We have to crush them.

845
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,776
We can't let them off the hook.

846
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,779
We might drop to our death
from climbing too high.

847
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:00,408
But screw it. Let's shoot for the stars.

848
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,577
Come on.

849
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,251
A star in the sky? Let's shoot it down.

850
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,670
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

851
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,591
HAMBAK SUNDAEGUK

852
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,265
I'm sure you're busy.
Why did you want to see me?

853
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,725
I'll be honest.

854
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,729
The company doesn't have
the best image right now.

855
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,400
So we plan to make
a big investment in public projects

856
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,277
in hopes to improve our image.

857
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,113
That's good. We welcome that plan.

858
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,489
But you see,

859
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,284
now that I'm the Chairman,

860
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,912
I have a lot of things on my plate.

861
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,960
So if you're willing to help,
Chief Secretary,

862
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,214
I feel like I would be able to
focus on public projects better.

863
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,429
I don't think
I can help you on this matter.

864
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,181
I was hoping it wouldn't be
a personal request.

865
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,394
It is what it is.
I'll have to end the conversation here.

866
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,608
Is your father-in-law's business
doing well?

867
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,657
When we changed our subcontractor,

868
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,869
it was too big of a decision
for Woo Tae-ho to make alone.

869
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,997
The problem was there was too much risk.

870
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,459
It was clearly a quid pro quo business

871
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,461
to benefit one particular family.

872
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,766
Do you know the difference between
you and Mr. Woo?

873
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,023
You immediately stab
your opponent's weakest spot.

874
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:58,193
But Woo Tae-ho informed the opponent
of his weakness and treated it.

875
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,279
You turn your opponent into your enemy,

876
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,865
but Woo Tae-ho would befriend them.

877
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,201
Mr. Chairman.

878
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,371
You have just made me your enemy.

879
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:31,142
Gosh, why are you congratulating me?

880
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,520
I was handed a controversial case.

881
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,146
Are you nuts?

882
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,857
Why would you ask me
to hook you up as TJ's lawyer?

883
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,818
Excuse me, old man.

884
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,112
The only person from TJ
that I met recently was

885
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,990
the service guy who came to fix my fridge.

886
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,075
Yes, Deputy Chief.

887
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,745
This case is more complicated than
I thought. I'll wrap it up by--

888
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,248
Yes, sir.

889
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,835
I'll try my best, sir. Goodbye.

890
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:04,342
Why is the deputy chief of prosecution
butting in on an Incheon case?

891
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,471
Did he think I'd automatically bend over
because it's TJ?

892
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,223
Come in.

893
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,355
Hello.

894
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,027
-What is it?
-We found some new information.

895
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,447
These are the call records
from Gi Dong-jae's phone we seized.

896
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,492
And these are the call records
from the burner cell

897
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,702
that Chairman Cheon used.

898
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,954
It's proof that shows

899
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,749
he talked to Gi Dong-jae
before Jung Hui-ju was murdered.

900
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,001
It's evidence that proves

901
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,003
Cheon Sang-woo ordered Gi to murder her.

902
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,880
Was the conversation recorded?

903
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,257
No, it wasn't.

904
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,052
It's all just circumstantial again.

905
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,511
Forget it.

906
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,389
Where's proof that Cheon
used that burner cell?

907
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,224
It was thrown away in a park.

908
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,477
We have CCTV footage
of Chairman Cheon leaving

909
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,562
that park when the cell was disposed of.

910
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,564
That's also circumstantial.

911
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,234
Did you find any fingerprints
on the burner cell?

912
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,486
Or saliva?

913
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,322
Bring me direct evidence that's ironclad.

914
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,450
But isn't this enough
to request an arrest warrant?

915
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,244
I can request it but it won't be granted.

916
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,955
But the moment I request one,

917
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,166
I'll be replaced by another prosecutor.

918
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,381
I didn't expect this to be easy,
but it's worse than I thought.

919
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,217
I don't think he'll budge.

920
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,845
If we can't get an arrest warrant,
we'll summon him.

921
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,097
You think he'd come?

922
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,182
If he doesn't, we can arrest him.

923
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,768
We need to cross-examine him
with Choi Yong-geun

924
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,353
before the prosecution takes him.

925
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,940
That's the only way Choi
will mention Cheon Sang-woo's name.

926
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,026
That's even harder to do.
They won't agree to it.

927
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,444
We can do it remotely.

928
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,113
Remotely?

929
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,451
Why did you meet Chief Secretary Heo?

930
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,122
The press won't stop talking.

931
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,999
So I asked him to help
get it under control.

932
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,543
Did you think

933
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:06,297
that rash method of yours
would work on him?

934
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,009
He's the Chief Secretary
of the Blue House. He holds the power.

935
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,303
Woo Tae-ho was barely able to rein him in.

936
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,305
But you just set him free. Do you hear me?

937
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,100
Wait,

938
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,979
why are you bringing up that punk,
Tae-ho again?

939
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,692
His connection to TJ
only made him look capable.

940
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,903
He would've been nothing
if he wasn't your son-in-law.

941
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,157
Would you be in this mess
if Tae-ho were alive?

942
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,577
It's no big deal that you killed a girl.

943
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,079
-Father.
-This has nothing to do

944
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,416
with you being guilty or not.
My pride is on the line.

945
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,461
Tae-ho's absence shouldn't have had

946
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,504
such a big impact on TJ like this.

947
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,007
I'm sorry.

948
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,802
Things won't get any worse.

949
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:57,015
Now's no time to worry about outsiders.
You should be worried about Na-na.

950
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,478
From this moment on,
don't consider her your sister anymore.

951
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,024
That's the only way you can destroy her.

952
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:16,493
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

953
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:31,841
Na-na.

954
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,011
Na-na.

955
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,681
Na-na!

956
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,269
Why was this in the trash?

957
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,897
I'm sick of it.

958
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,316
Na-na, please.

959
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,779
No! I'd rather die. Let me die!

960
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,280
What's the point in life?

961
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,950
It will only lead me
to be abandoned like you.

962
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,285
I'll end up dying here
where nobody ever visits.

963
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:01,913
I never…

964
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,958
I never want to live like you.

965
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,961
That's not what you want?

966
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,547
Then take it.

967
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,551
Survive until the very end and take it.

968
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,596
If you can't, then you're better off dead.

969
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,215
Na-na.

970
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,677
Did you finally find the reason?

971
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,930
The reason to survive?

972
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,087
Hello?

973
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,590
The police have summoned you.

974
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:39,886
So what?

975
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,889
They'll arrest you without a warrant
if you continue to refuse.

976
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,850
If that happens, the press will find out.

977
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,187
You're saying I can't avoid it?

978
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,229
Yes, sir.

979
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,025
I think you'll have to step in once--

980
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,944
All right. I'll think about it.

981
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,159
In the case that

982
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,537
you are defeated by Na-na.

983
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,331
I will choose her

984
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,334
instead of you.

985
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,629
You can't beat me, Cheon Na-na.

986
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,007
Never.

987
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,892
We checked the press room. It's empty.

988
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,936
There are only detectives in there.

989
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,104
-You're certain?
-Yes.

990
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,945
We found no issues. It's clear to enter.

991
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,615
Make sure you carefully look around
the station too.

992
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,992
Let me know once you've cleared it.

993
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,119
Yes, sir.

994
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:51,332
I'll take you in
once we're sure the coast is clear.

995
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,210
How much evidence

996
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,296
has the police gathered on me?

997
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,425
They found a good amount.
But it's all circumstantial so far.

998
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,884
They have no direct evidence.

999
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,596
What about Team Director Choi?

1000
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,057
Gi Dong-jae
and Choi Yong-geun's charges are clear.

1001
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,017
They have plenty of direct evidence.

1002
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,769
I doubt Choi can get out of this.

1003
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:17,942
Hello?

1004
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,819
Okay.

1005
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,697
I'll head over now.

1006
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,800
Way to keep it on the down-low.

1007
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,096
Let's go give the Chairman a warm welcome.

1008
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,481
Welcome.

1009
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,066
I'm Kang Do-chang.
Incheon Seobu, Violent Crimes.

1010
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,401
Thank you for coming.

1011
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,409
We refuse to be recorded.

1012
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,371
Don't worry. We're not recording.

1013
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,707
You and Mr. Choi go way back, right?

1014
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,045
You gave him a job in the legal team

1015
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,298
in return for him covering up
your assault case from two years ago.

1016
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,677
Choi Yong-geun is a former detective.

1017
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,638
He's great at covering up crimes.

1018
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:32,892
We already found out
how Choi Yong-geun covered up

1019
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,520
Jung Hui-ju's murder.

1020
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:39,565
If he doesn't confess
who gave him the order,

1021
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,360
he will be identified as the abettor.

1022
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,075
I am also greatly disturbed

1023
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,162
by the fact that my employees were

1024
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,332
involved in a murder case.

1025
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,375
Were you ever

1026
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:02,129
threatened by Jung Hui-ju?

1027
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,511
She knew a lot of your secrets.

1028
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:12,849
Things about your assault case
from two years ago,

1029
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,768
information about the victim Kim Min-ji…

1030
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,103
She used those things…

1031
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,939
to threaten you, right?

1032
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:21,983
That case is--

1033
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,735
Are you sure you want
your lawyer to intervene?

1034
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:29,198
It can be used against you in court.
Are you okay with that?

1035
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,042
To be honest,

1036
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,545
Jung Hui-ju didn't tell me directly,

1037
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,632
but I had an inkling that she knew.

1038
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,385
So she did say something to you.

1039
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,304
Then what?

1040
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,766
How did you respond to her demand?

1041
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,810
What countermeasures did you take?

1042
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,740
I discussed it with Mr. Choi.

1043
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,536
I said one of his subordinates
was making absurd demands.

1044
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:19,290
And told him to reason with her
and make sure it never happens again.

1045
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,627
That is all

1046
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,212
I said to Mr. Choi.

1047
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,173
So when Jung Hui-ju was murdered,

1048
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,092
you must have known
that Choi was behind it.

1049
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,346
I didn't know at first.
I found out much later.

1050
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:39,101
After it was revealed she wasn't
the victim of a serial killer,

1051
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,979
I became slightly suspicious.

1052
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:44,649
However,

1053
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,818
I never imagined that he would…

1054
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,156
That he would actually kill her.

1055
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,660
So you're saying that Choi Yong-geun,

1056
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:01,123
without your orders,
murdered someone out of his own volition.

1057
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,918
Is that what you mean?

1058
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,382
Choi Yong-geun hired Gi Dong-jae,

1059
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,717
an acquaintance from his detective days,

1060
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,303
and had her brutally murdered.

1061
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:19,183
Are you saying he did all that
because you told him to reason with her?

1062
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,403
Jung Hui-ju

1063
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,489
was truly a lowlife.

1064
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,075
Not to mention promiscuous.

1065
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:41,205
She was even sleeping with Choi,
who was her boss.

1066
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,460
But he got jealous
when Jung Hui-ju's heart swayed

1067
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,920
towards Woo Tae-ho.

1068
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,631
It seems like my orders

1069
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:55,678
gave him an excuse to murder her.

1070
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,396
This footage is from the dashcam

1071
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,774
in the murder suspect Gi Dong-jae's car.

1072
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,693
He got into a car accident,

1073
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:13,612
so the traffic department
happened to have it.

1074
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,907
The woman you see is
Gi Dong-jae's girlfriend.

1075
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,660
Gi was in the passenger seat at that time.

1076
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:25,332
Pardon? Jung Hui-ju?

1077
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,795
That's kind of a big job
for you to suddenly…

1078
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,630
Yes, I understand.

1079
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,010
I'll discuss it with Mr. Choi
and call you back.

1080
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,726
Someone ordered him to murder her.

1081
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,272
"Kill Jung Hui-ju."

1082
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:53,277
"I will give you enough
for generations to come."

1083
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,738
"Just kill her."

1084
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:03,996
"Mr. Choi will take care of the rest."

1085
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,832
"All you need to do, Gi Dong-jae,"

1086
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,169
"is to kill her."

1087
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:13,923
"Got it?"

1088
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,708
How was meeting my brother in person?

1089
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,086
He was a bigger jerk than I thought.

1090
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,088
There has to be a bug
or a hidden camera in here.

1091
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,548
Search thoroughly.

1092
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,675
You can never beat me.

1093
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,176
Never!

1094
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,594
We have a warrant for Cheon Sang-woo.

1095
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:02,555
It all points to one person.

1096
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,597
Woo Tae-ho?

1097
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,350
Are you saying that Woo Tae-ho
could be the culprit like they argued?

1098
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:09,270
I heard there is a good chance
Cheon Sang-woo will walk.

1099
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,480
There is no way to prove that now.

1100
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,023
You can't beat me.

1101
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:14,650
Die!

1102
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:26,704
