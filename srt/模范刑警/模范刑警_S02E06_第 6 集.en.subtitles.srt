THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,447
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,472
1 MISSED CALL

4
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,697
What is it?

5
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,282
Let's eat.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,159
Okay.

7
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,828
I have something to wrap up.
I'll call you after I'm done.

8
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,371
Okay. Call me.

9
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,105
The phone is turned off.

10
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,235
-Wasn't it on a few minutes ago?
-Yes.

11
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,363
Can you track its location?

12
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,299
Hi.

13
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,677
Yes.

14
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,721
I know the location.

15
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,807
Then I'll see you there in an hour.

16
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,892
Okay.

17
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,086
Chief.

18
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,590
Chief?

19
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,051
Yes.

20
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,178
Is something wrong?

21
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,310
Is Do-chang at his desk?

22
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,938
Yes. Should I tell him to come?

23
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,691
The three of us. Let's grab a drink.

24
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,527
This is toro.

25
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,825
This is awabi.

26
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,412
I talked to Michael.

27
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,123
He admitted
that he leaked it to the producers.

28
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,046
He was impressed by Tae-ho.
He said I found a good one.

29
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,052
Michael is impressive too.

30
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,387
Only a handful of people know

31
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,556
that I got swindled in Japan.

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,770
A CEO of a major company once said,

33
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,064
"change everything except for family."

34
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,193
But can't we change family members too?

35
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,612
Are you talking about Tae-ho?

36
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,076
I can't lose him.

37
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,496
If he turns against us,
he will become our worst enemy.

38
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,084
He knows every weakness of our family.

39
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,256
Also, I want to keep him.

40
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,426
He is the only one
who can inject me with insulin.

41
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,816
You must be sick of me.

42
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,945
-What?
-I pester you all the time.

43
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,699
-You can't stand the sight of me.
-It's not like I have a choice.

44
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,951
It's not like I can fire the chief.

45
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,537
Chief, are you going somewhere?

46
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,539
Did you get a promotion?

47
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,791
I thought my chances of promotion
was at three percent.

48
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,294
I can't recover from that.

49
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,713
You guys chipped away at my 97 percent.

50
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,590
There's no hope for me,

51
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,884
but Do-Chang needs a promotion.

52
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,721
How long are you going to serve
under your classmate?

53
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,972
Isn't it embarrassing?

54
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,807
Is Do-chang getting a promotion?

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,350
Not immediately.

56
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,687
Choose between the Information Division
and the Public Safety Division

57
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,105
of the Gyeonggi Main Office.

58
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,733
You will get the captain position.

59
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,900
That's great.

60
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,695
That's definitely a promotion track.

61
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,447
Congratulations, Do-chang.

62
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,449
Why all of a sudden?

63
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,242
You guys caught Lee Seong-gon.

64
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,704
The commissioner gave the order.

65
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,666
He said everyone on Team 2
can move anywhere they wish.

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,044
Bong-sik, ask the guys
where they want to go.

67
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,381
Tell them they can go to Seoul
or even to the main office.

68
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,760
That's great.

69
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,929
The guys will be so happy.

70
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,809
There's no reason for the commissioner
to think so highly of us.

71
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,936
We wreaked havoc
with Lee Dae-cheol's case.

72
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,148
We are accused of over-investigating
Kim Hyeong-bok.

73
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,859
What is the real reason?

74
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,071
They want to split us up.

75
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,573
It's a scheme
to sabotage the investigation.

76
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,741
Sure.

77
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,451
You may think like that.

78
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,870
Even if you are,

79
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,457
I can object to them punishing you,
but not awarding you.

80
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,292
That's because

81
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,461
the guys accepting it
have the right to choose.

82
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,676
Do-chang,

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,678
where are you going?

84
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,181
I'm leaving because I want to.

85
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,350
I don't have to kiss up to you anymore.

86
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,060
-Do-chang, stop.
-Let go.

87
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,187
Let him go and sit down.

88
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,234
Like me, this is his hometown.

89
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,069
I'm sure he's unhappy.

90
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,696
But this is a good thing.

91
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,076
Do you think Do-chang
considers this a good thing?

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,203
No.

93
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,955
Mr. Choi,

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,251
if you were still with the force

95
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,169
investigating Jung Hui-ju's murder,

96
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,756
how would you approach it?

97
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,554
I would first ask for the help
of the Cyber Crime Investigation Unit.

98
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,391
If the killer was crazy enough
to commit a copycat crime,

99
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,520
the culprit
would have left a trace online.

100
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,022
If the motive was to copy the murder,
then yes.

101
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,608
But what if someone with a clear motive

102
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,694
was found among Jung Hui-ju's contacts?

103
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,280
Would you have to change
the focus of the investigation?

104
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,490
I'm not sure.

105
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,870
Jung Hui-ju was not someone
who would have grudges against others.

106
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,414
She was also an employee
of a major corporation.

107
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,459
It's unlikely that she would engage
in criminal activities.

108
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,670
A sexual assault would be
the most probable cause.

109
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,214
You don't think there would be
another motive for her murder?

110
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,257
No.

111
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,761
Then why are Incheon Seobu detectives

112
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,639
still sniffing around Jung Hui-ju?

113
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,729
It's because of Oh Ji-hyeok.

114
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,024
He might connect Jung Hui-ju's case
to the case two years ago.

115
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,400
Yes.

116
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,863
It's possible for him to think
that the culprit of Jung Hui-ju's murder

117
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,865
and the incident two years ago
is the same.

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,409
But at the end of the day,

119
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,704
he's just a lieutenant of the police.

120
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,374
Do I have to worry about him?

121
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,178
They offered him a plum spot.

122
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,182
They even offered his team members
good positions.

123
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,351
Why the hell is he upset?

124
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,938
He's just frustrated, not upset.

125
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,191
Being frustrated is being upset.

126
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,072
How dare he leave before his chief?

127
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,574
His rank is way below mine.

128
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,577
You said to let him go.

129
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,038
What did you say?

130
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,623
You're being weird these days.

131
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,000
You often talk back at me.

132
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,590
If the offer is for a job well done,
we would be happy about it.

133
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,260
But you already know their intention.

134
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,888
-Their intention is so obvious.
-Hey.

135
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,349
Is solving Jung Hui-ju's murder
that important?

136
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,852
He's not the only detective in Korea.

137
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,104
There are others.

138
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,855
But the others can't solve it.

139
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,774
Why not?

140
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
Is Jung Hui-ju his daughter or something?

141
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,948
Then why did you pick Kang Do-chang
to become a cop?

142
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,159
You should've chosen someone
obsessed with promotions like you,

143
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,579
or a brown noser like me

144
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,539
to become a cop.

145
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,292
Why did you pick someone like
Kang Do-chang to be a cop?

146
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,085
Why are you yelling at me?

147
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,921
I didn't pick him.

148
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,512
Thank you for choosing the hard path.

149
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,821
Hey,

150
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,990
I can't even pay
the lawyer retainer with this.

151
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,159
Don't you think she needs a good lawyer?

152
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,911
Yu-na is your friend.
Are you going to let her rot in jail?

153
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,414
That's all I have for now.
I'll give you more later.

154
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,541
Now that we see each other often,

155
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,710
you're growing on me.

156
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,714
Look at you.

157
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,840
Hey.

158
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,010
Who the hell are you?

159
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,803
-Mr. Kang!
-You bastard!

160
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,096
-Mr. Kang!
-Stop right there!

161
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,436
-What did you do to Eun-hye?
-I didn't do anything.

162
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,901
You took money from her, you bastard!

163
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,569
Eun-hye stole this money!

164
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,155
How dare you call her a thief,
you bastard.

165
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,283
What are you doing?

166
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,119
Hang on.

167
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,329
Let me finish what I was doing.

168
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,126
-Detective Kang!
-Yes?

169
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,169
Hey,

170
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,467
My back hurts!

171
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,760
Your back?

172
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,764
Shut it.

173
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,807
Officer,

174
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,309
I think my back is broken.
Let me go to the hospital.

175
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,978
-Shut up, you--
-Detective Kang.

176
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,106
I think you need to tell me what happened.

177
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,399
I caught him in the act.

178
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,817
I saw him ripping off a girl.

179
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,527
Look at this.

180
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,321
He took this money from her.

181
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,323
-Is that true?
-No.

182
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,200
She was paying me back.

183
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,286
You said Eun-hye stole this money.

184
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,706
Mr. Kang!

185
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,209
This bastard.

186
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,045
He didn't rip me off. I gave it to him.

187
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,298
Did he threaten you to?

188
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,674
No. I just…

189
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,677
I wanted to help a friend.

190
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,472
Fine.

191
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,056
Go home.

192
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,516
I will take care of this.

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,685
Nothing bad will happen to you?

194
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,271
I've been a cop for 20 years.

195
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,439
This is nothing.

196
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,815
Don't worry and go home.

197
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,983
Trust me.

198
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,238
I want you to do as Ji-hyeok says.

199
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,073
Promise me that, then I'll go.

200
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,284
What?

201
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,828
Thank you. Have a good evening.

202
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,746
Hey,

203
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,373
-Say, "Thank you and have a good evening."
-Thank you and have a good evening.

204
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,376
-Louder, you punk.
-Thank you and have a good evening.

205
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,337
-Thank you.
-What?

206
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,548
You're fine.

207
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,510
How dare you try to pull one over on me.

208
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,678
-Do you know who I am?
-Do-chang.

209
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,638
Let go.

210
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,556
-Just go.
-What?

211
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,558
That punk. Let go.

212
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,435
-Do-chang.
-Let me go.

213
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,187
Hey,

214
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,398
did you give him money?

215
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,360
Let's not complicate things.

216
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,238
How dare you show off your money,
you son of--

217
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,828
What are you doing?

218
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,040
Why?

219
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,125
Play along.

220
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,795
Please.

221
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,881
Trust me and fall over.

222
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,008
I'll explain later.

223
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,681
Come here.

224
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,558
Who are you to Eun-hye?

225
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,310
Why does she care about you over me?

226
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,478
You bastard!

227
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,817
You saw what he did to me.

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,944
-I'm going to get him.
-Take this!

229
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,071
Stop!

230
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,907
-Please stop!
-Let go.

231
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,701
-Sergeant Kang.
-"Sergeant Kang"?

232
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,869
I'm a lieutenant!

233
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,620
Okay. That's it.

234
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,497
-Are you--
-Take this!

235
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,499
Damn it.

236
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,085
-Darn.
-Did he hit you or something?

237
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,087
What are you doing?

238
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,839
-Get up here.
-What did you say?

239
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,841
Get up here.

240
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,009
-Get up here.
-Please!

241
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,343
-I'm going up, you bastard.
-Come.

242
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,178
-Come on!
-You punk.

243
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,014
-Hit me. Go ahead.
-What are you doing?

244
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,099
-What are you doing at our station?
-Hit me, punk!

245
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,060
-Get up here.
-Let me at him.

246
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,980
-Come on.
-I'll get you.

247
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,066
-I'll mess you up.
-I'd like to see you try.

248
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,118
The video got
over 100,000 views in one day.

249
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,787
You could say it went viral.

250
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,081
I know what you're trying to do.

251
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,461
You did this on purpose
and uploaded the video yourself.

252
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,630
I can see right through you.

253
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,549
The guys up there picked the fight first.

254
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,550
Look.

255
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,220
That doesn't mean
you had to react in such a childish way.

256
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,265
Are you a teenager going through puberty?

257
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,975
You're right.

258
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,063
I want to throw a fit for no reason.

259
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,190
Tell the commissioner's office

260
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,691
to leave me alone.

261
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,819
Tell them they'll regret it
if they mess with me.

262
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,742
By the end of this week,

263
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,787
I want you to tell me
where you would like to be transferred.

264
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,790
Can we go wherever we want?

265
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,916
Yes.

266
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,835
It's the commissioner's order,
so it will happen.

267
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,838
Can I go to Gangnam Station in Seoul?

268
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,798
You can.

269
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:10,219
But you should consider
each of your capabilities and situation.

270
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,722
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

271
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,604
Maybe I should sign up
to go to the main office in Seoul.

272
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,066
They will work you to death there.

273
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,652
Let's go to Gangnam together.
They have the best-looking women.

274
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,654
-Gangnam?
-You fools.

275
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
Do you even have money
to get a house in Seoul?

276
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,574
Are you going to sleep in the open
at Seoul Station?

277
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,701
I forgot about that.

278
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,953
Isn't it fishy?

279
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,413
Why are they being so nice,

280
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,915
all of a sudden?

281
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,002
In my opinion,
it's the chief, not the commissioner.

282
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,629
Why would the chief screw us?
We've been getting along lately.

283
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,256
Isn't it obvious?

284
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,759
He's sending me away
to separate me and Bo-gyeong.

285
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,015
It looks bad to just kick me out,
so he's sending the whole team away.

286
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,227
I will be returning to the States today.

287
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,314
They will probably talk about TJ Group
at the board of directors meeting.

288
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,150
What do you think will happen?

289
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,738
They will release
the consulting firm's report.

290
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,115
That report will carry a lot of weight.

291
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,911
I want to know what you think.

292
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,915
The CEO of McQueen Korea
will carry a lot of weight.

293
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,918
I want to hear your thoughts.

294
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,389
It's bigger than I thought.

295
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,100
And…

296
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,395
I don't call the shots.

297
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,855
Sure.

298
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,608
I know that.

299
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,612
I just thought I could be honest with you.

300
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,621
This is to show appreciation
for the artwork you bought.

301
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,206
No other reason.

302
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,428
I have to get to the airport.

303
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,985
We're not in the habit
of exchanging favors.

304
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,722
I was looking at my cell phone
and didn't see the light.

305
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,641
It's completely my fault.

306
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,435
I'll call my insurance company
and take care of it.

307
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,603
Okay.

308
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,202
My insurance will be in touch with you.

309
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,164
You can follow their instructions.
Once again, I apologize.

310
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,874
I understand.

311
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,295
Wait a minute.

312
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,425
She said you forgot to take this.

313
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,094
"You should not refuse. Never."

314
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,263
She also told me to tell you that.

315
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,442
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV 1

316
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,950
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

317
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,911
I misjudged you.

318
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,037
I apologize.

319
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,414
I will report to you as soon as I arrive.

320
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,925
You really won't come with me?

321
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,510
Aren't you sick of me?

322
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,804
It's time to go our separate ways.

323
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,350
Do-chang, Jae-hong, Dong-uk,

324
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,436
and even Detective Oh have grown on me.
What a bummer.

325
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,190
Bong-sik is a good guy too.

326
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,776
Do you think we'll meet
people like them in the new place?

327
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,110
I forgot Eun-hui.

328
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,948
I will miss her fried chicken.

329
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,535
But it's not good to stay here forever.

330
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,704
You'll get promoted faster
after the main office.

331
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,124
I thought
you wanted to live like Do-chang.

332
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,086
That's how I feel in my heart,
but in reality--

333
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,796
That punk…

334
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,631
Why the little…wait.

335
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,049
Two, three, nine, five?

336
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,345
That punk!

337
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,514
Isn't he the one we arrested before?

338
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,974
The one we sent to Narcotics.

339
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,309
Let's follow him.

340
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,494
How did he get out?

341
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,790
He must have someone looking out for him.

342
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,919
It looks like
he's making deliveries again.

343
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,133
If we raid that house,
we might get something big.

344
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,095
Let's wait for a while.

345
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,104
Hey.

346
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,231
-Get up.
-What are you doing?

347
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,026
Hold still, you bastard.

348
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,235
Let's see.

349
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,034
You little brat.
You were making a delivery.

350
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,286
Darn.

351
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,913
The more I think about it,
something doesn't feel right.

352
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,832
I think we have to refuse as a group.

353
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:21,381
This kind of opportunity
will never come again in your career.

354
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,718
Go where you want to go.

355
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,887
What about you?

356
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,849
I want to go to Jeju Island.

357
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,476
Jeju? That's out of the blue.

358
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:37,022
If I move my post to Jeju Island,

359
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,357
Bo-gyeong would follow me, right?

360
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,318
Then we can move in together.

361
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,903
Just the two of us.

362
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:46,615
Why would she follow you to Jeju?
You're not Oh Ji-hyeok.

363
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,326
Wait and see who she will follow.

364
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,912
You don't know women at all.

365
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,125
-You are…
-Hello?

366
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,300
Did you bring the bodycam?

367
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,928
-Let's raid.
-Jae-hong.

368
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,388
I think we should be prudent.

369
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,598
Why?

370
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,350
He confessed to delivering to that house.

371
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,644
We arrested him before
and sent him to Narcotics,

372
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,063
but he was released right away.

373
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,524
Somebody among his clients
is a powerful person.

374
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,651
Let's tell the captain before we raid.

375
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,944
Forget about it. Let's go.

376
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,781
Let's nab a big one
before we leave Incheon.

377
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,909
I'll go to Jeju Island on a high note.

378
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,453
-What? Jeju?
-He wants to go to Jeju Island.

379
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,580
Why Jeju Island?

380
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,833
He'll wait for someone that'll never come

381
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,294
and live a lonely, solitary life,
but that's what he wants.

382
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,587
What do you know?

383
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,797
Let's go.

384
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,031
It's the police!

385
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,242
You are arrested

386
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,119
for habitual use of illegal drugs.

387
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,996
-Take them out.
-You over there.

388
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,247
Arrest all of them.

389
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,291
Put that down.

390
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,500
Let go!

391
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,003
-Let's go, punk.
-Are you guys crazy?

392
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,255
Don't push me!

393
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,923
Come out this way.

394
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,217
Let's go, punk.

395
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,760
WARNING: GRATUITOUS DRUG PARTY
OF RICH KIDS

396
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,054
Come here, punks.

397
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,143
This one has all kinds of characters.

398
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,769
We have a politician's son

399
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,315
and the child
of a high-ranking law official.

400
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,442
This has twice as many views
as the last one.

401
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,277
Who took this video?

402
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,403
With a bodycam, sir.

403
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,531
Did you put it online, too?

404
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,783
That was me, sir.

405
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,160
It was you again.

406
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,913
The other guys are not savvy
with social media.

407
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,623
Oh Ji-hyeok is an expert on it.

408
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,336
He would have made it big
with an online business if he pursued it.

409
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,179
My phone is ringing off the hook.

410
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,975
including the commissioner.

411
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,233
All of these calls are
from high-ranking officials.

412
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,194
-Bong-sik,
-Yes, sir.

413
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,280
You said I had a three percent chance
of getting a promotion.

414
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,199
What about now?

415
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,079
In this situation, where I have to lock up
the children of high-level officials.

416
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,040
Zero percent, sir.

417
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:46,211
What is the percentage of me waitlisting
all of these idiots here?

418
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,382
It would be 100 percent.

419
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,675
Make it so.

420
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,280
This chicken reminds me
of the ones my parents used to buy me.

421
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,739
It's delicious.

422
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,158
See?

423
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,619
I told you we should be prudent.

424
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,207
I had a place in Gangnam all lined up.

425
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,043
I didn't know Chief would go that far.

426
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,964
Does that mean he wants me by his side?

427
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,758
We should have sent him to Jeju Island.

428
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,512
I'm sure some of you are disappointed,
but let's move on.

429
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,681
The boat has sailed.

430
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,393
That was your last chance.
You won't get another one.

431
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,228
I'm sorry, guys.

432
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,773
I feel like I took away your chances.
I'm really sorry.

433
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,858
Instead,

434
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,361
the chicken is on me from now on.

435
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,991
You are finally out of your mind.
You're bleeding me dry.

436
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,618
Don't worry. We wouldn't actually do that.

437
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,872
I never go back on my word.

438
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,665
Eat all you want.

439
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,584
I will wire you the money.

440
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,794
From where?

441
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,589
From your account that empties
on the day you get paid?

442
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,841
Just put it on my tab.

443
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,801
Hey.

444
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,929
Just don't order chicken.
Order expensive dishes too.

445
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,974
And drink something
other than soju and beer.

446
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,019
I should stock up on whiskey and scotch.

447
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,189
She's so materialistic.

448
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,275
Anyway, it's on me tonight.

449
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,485
Don't worry about it.

450
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,030
Any news
from the National Forensic Service?

451
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,700
The substance of the lipstick
was different from

452
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,452
the one Lee Seong-gon used.

453
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,080
I think we're close to finding out.

454
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,289
Really?

455
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,376
Do you guys have anything?

456
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,003
We checked her spending
on the day of the accident,

457
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,505
and she paid the hospital bill.

458
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,257
Her grandfather was
in the hospital for about a month.

459
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,052
We asked for the CCTV footage
at the hospital just in case.

460
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,095
Nice work.

461
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,474
Her phone records showed
a number to a burner phone.

462
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,809
We don't know who the owner is.

463
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,852
-But we know its last location.
-Where was it?

464
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,687
It was at the TJ Group headquarters.

465
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,855
Really?

466
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:17,028
That means one of her colleagues
could be a suspect.

467
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,321
If that's the case,

468
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,075
I want you guys to keep investigating
people around Jung Hui-ju at TJ.

469
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,701
-Jae-hong.
-Yes.

470
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,413
Look further into the lipstick
and identify the product.

471
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,622
Of course not.

472
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,083
I understand, commissioner.

473
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,546
Please forget that I asked you.

474
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,382
Goodbye.

475
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,685
He's just a lieutenant of the police.

476
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,646
Do I have to worry about him?

477
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,690
If the other side has only Oh Ji-hyeok,

478
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,775
you shouldn't have to worry.

479
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,780
But if he works as a team,
that's another story.

480
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,116
Let's do our best.

481
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,661
Even a miserly pack of wolves

482
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,497
can hunt a bear if they work together.

483
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,057
JUNGIN SHOES

484
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,861
Welcome.

485
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,281
Hello.

486
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,201
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,078
Who are you?

488
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,040
I am the legal team director
of the company Hui-ju worked at.

489
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,666
What brings you here?

490
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,338
I heard Hui-ju only had a grandfather.

491
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,758
Did Hui-ju tell you that?

492
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,262
I would like to help in any way.

493
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,350
The company is willing to help,

494
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,727
so please don't hesitate to call.

495
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,021
Okay.

496
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,487
Hui-ju was…

497
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,032
a pure and good person.

498
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:32,205
She made everyone
in the office happy and bright.

499
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:39,712
The investigation may
defame her reputation.

500
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,259
If you think that will happen,
please give me a call.

501
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,222
Our lawyers will protect her name.

502
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,271
What kind of person…

503
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,192
was Hui-ju to you?

504
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,741
She was…

505
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,828
a capable employee.

506
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,823
-Do you see it over there?
-Yes.

507
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,660
That is the hair salon
owned by Kim Min-ji.

508
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,496
-Let's go.
-You have to talk to Kim Min-ji alone.

509
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,914
Why?

510
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,999
She put a restraining order against me.

511
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,542
Why?

512
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,546
I had to take a two-year leave of absence
from the investigation division

513
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,340
because of Kim Min-ji.

514
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,260
That's hot! What are you doing?

515
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,681
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit under the weather today.

516
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,476
Can I ask another hairdresser
to finish instead?

517
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,560
Sure.

518
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,064
Ye-rim, when will you be done?

519
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,024
I'm almost done.

520
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,026
-Can you take care of her too?
-Sure.

521
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,988
I sincerely apologize.

522
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,290
Do you know where Kim Min-ji…

523
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,715
You wouldn't answer my calls,

524
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,717
so I had to come in person.

525
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,427
Did I disturb you at work?

526
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,804
I have to finish something,

527
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,432
so I don't have much time.

528
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,474
Very well.

529
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,395
We reopened Jung Hui-ju's case.

530
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,981
And your number is frequently listed

531
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,109
on her phone records.

532
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,571
I was her friend.

533
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,114
What kind of friend?

534
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,699
She helped me

535
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,493
when I was struggling.

536
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,787
Then you must have been close.

537
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,206
We occasionally had a drink together.

538
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,584
But I don't know much about Hui-ju.

539
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,920
She rarely talked about herself.

540
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,882
How did you two become friends?

541
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,596
Detective Oh told me
about the assault two years ago.

542
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,223
The witness at the time was Woo Tae-ho,

543
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,435
the director of the legal team
at TJ Group.

544
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,395
Jung Hui-ju, who was killed,

545
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,356
worked on the same legal team.

546
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,983
You were the victim.

547
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,943
Is this a coincidence?

548
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,904
I was very clear to Detective Oh

549
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,364
that I don't wish to talk about it again.

550
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,743
The lawyer who filed
the restraining order against Ji-hyeok

551
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,662
is also from TJ Group's legal team.

552
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,164
Is this a coincidence too?

553
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,833
I don't know anything about that.

554
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,336
Please…

555
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,922
stop tormenting me.

556
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,634
I'm not investigating
your assault two years ago.

557
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,011
I'm investigating
the murder of Jung Hui-ju.

558
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,347
It's not an assault case.

559
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,890
It's a murder case.

560
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,479
Your name shows up often
on her phone records.

561
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:10,024
You are one of the key suspects.

562
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,580
She didn't say much, did she?

563
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,416
She sang like a bird.

564
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,127
What are the basics of a detective?

565
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,670
An insight into a person's psyche,

566
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,630
the piercing stare that makes them talk,

567
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,216
which you have none of.

568
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,178
That's why you got a restraining order.

569
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,765
I have much to learn from you.

570
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,434
Did you find anything out?

571
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,563
She admitted that they were friends.

572
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,900
But I don't think that fact
will help solve the case.

573
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,071
The one who assaulted Kim Min-ji…

574
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,031
-Cheon Sang-woo?
-Yes, him.

575
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,953
Are we sure he was the attacker?

576
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,790
If that is the case, Cheon Sang-woo
could have committed the same crime

577
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,959
against Jung Hui-ju.

578
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,881
And Woo Tae-ho, an ex-prosecutor
would have taken care of it.

579
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,135
So Kim Min-ji and Woo Tae-ho

580
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,471
hold the key to solving
Jung Hui-ju's murder.

581
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,639
That's right.

582
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,770
"An insight into a person's psyche,
the piercing stare that makes them talk."

583
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,274
-I'll just watch you do your thing.
-What?

584
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,692
Why?

585
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,069
You just said, the "insight, the "stare."

586
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,572
That doesn't sound like me at all.

587
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:42,992
I'm hungry.

588
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,286
Let's get something to eat.

589
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,227
VICE-CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

590
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,607
Hello.

591
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,983
It's me.

592
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,114
Go home early. I'll stop by today.

593
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,953
I want to have a drink with you.

594
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,871
Okay.

595
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,581
I will.

596
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,002
VICE-CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

597
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,557
You have a child.

598
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,101
She just turned one.

599
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,645
Why?

600
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,439
What about Su-yeon?

601
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,693
You will go to the States to get treated.

602
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,487
The child will be left by herself.

603
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,117
We can send her with you to the States.

604
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,036
All you have to do is keep quiet.

605
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,163
Please, my baby…

606
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,792
My Su-yeon…

607
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,087
Su-yeon…

608
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,158
Let's hurry.

609
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,287
-Are you looking for someone?
-Yes.

610
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm here to see Detective Kang Do-chang.

611
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,334
-Detective Kang Do-chang?
-Yes.

612
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,503
Do-chang, someone is here for you.

613
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,800
It's Woo Tae-ho.

614
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,678
He's the director of the legal team
at TJ Group.

615
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,265
Where did you get these photos?

616
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,894
This was mailed to Hui-ju a while ago.

617
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,606
I'm glad you're here.

618
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,984
This is for you.

619
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,444
-For me?
-Yes.

620
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,447
-Watch the store for me.
-Okay.

621
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,451
-Another thing.
-What?

622
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,411
Is something wrong?

623
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,747
No.

624
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,792
If a customer comes looking for
their shoes,

625
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,377
-they are ready to go here.
-Okay.

626
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,421
JUNGIN SHOES

627
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,317
Is Woo Tae-ho married?

628
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,111
Yes.

629
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,783
Do you have to show this photo

630
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,830
to others to solve her case?

631
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,166
If you don't want it released,
we will keep it to ourselves.

632
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,880
No.

633
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,967
Finding the killer is more important.

634
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,261
Don't worry about me.

635
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,054
You can release it if you need to.

636
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,184
Were you aware that
this was going on between them?

637
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,728
I still can't believe it.

638
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,314
These photos could've been edited.

639
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,358
Don't believe what you see.

640
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:51,115
I raised Hui-ju
since she was a newborn baby.

641
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,992
So I knew what she was thinking

642
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,327
just by looking at her face.

643
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,499
She was devastated
when she first saw this photo.

644
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,003
If it was fake,
she wouldn't have reacted that way.

645
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,048
It's true.

646
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,886
Hui-ju had messed up.

647
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,766
It must have been a hard decision.
Thank you.

648
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,603
This will be a great help.

649
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,272
I'm glad to know that.

650
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,070
-Did you find out?
-Yes.

651
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,406
I asked my dad.

652
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,660
I don't think he's a decent person.

653
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,245
Some people say

654
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,207
he took bribes and got kicked out
of the investigation division.

655
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,335
He was flaunting his money
when I first met him.

656
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,753
I had a hunch then.

657
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,591
This guy is such a snob.

658
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,387
I'm curious, though.

659
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,099
Why are you so interested in Detective Oh?

660
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,315
In my opinion,
he's not worthy of your attention.

661
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,817
He's handsome.

662
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,199
This was on the hospital CCTV
from the day of the incident.

663
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,160
She brings Jung In-beom out of the room.

664
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,456
Then there is footage of them
getting in a taxi.

665
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,708
Wait a minute.

666
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,052
Do you know him?

667
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,804
-You also have them getting in a taxi?
-Yes.

668
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,721
Can I see that?

669
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,104
They got in the taxi.

670
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,440
Stop.

671
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,944
It's that same guy.

672
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,073
He's following them.

673
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,450
Gi Dong-jae is a member of
Gangnam East Gang.

674
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,202
Do you know him?

675
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,163
He's a gangster I was after
until I left the investigation division.

676
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,293
-We're back.
-Hey.

677
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,170
-Did you find anything?
-Yes.

678
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,298
Out of the white gowns
used in the murders,

679
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,466
Jung Hui-ju's gown
was the only one with a tag.

680
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,510
That means we can find the manufacturer.

681
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,304
We've already gone there.

682
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:22,099
The employee there said
that they don't sell to the stores.

683
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,644
They take orders from big hospitals
and send the gowns to them.

684
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,812
Which hospitals?

685
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,607
Seogun University, Omun,
and Seojung University Hospital--

686
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,233
-Seojung University Hospital?
-Yes.

687
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,485
This is Seojung University Hospital.

688
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,695
What?

689
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,779
What?

690
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,157
-That's the one.
-Everyone, go to this hospital.

691
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,325
Okay.

692
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,243
-Trace Gi Dong-jae's movement.
-Text me the location.

693
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,661
-And get all the CCTV footage.
-Okay.

694
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,331
Check if a gown went missing
with the person in charge.

695
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,665
-Okay.
-Do-chang.

696
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,334
I have to go to an important meeting.

697
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,210
-Go ahead.
-I'll be back.

698
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,963
What are you guys doing?

699
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,423
Get going before they all go home.

700
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,466
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

701
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,925
-We'll get the CCTV footage.
-Okay.

702
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,135
Let's go.

703
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,097
What are you doing?

704
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,684
Why did you let Ji-hyeok
go on a personal errand?

705
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,436
He said it was important.

706
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,898
What's more important
than an investigation to a detective?

707
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:11,857
Damn it.

708
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,531
-What did you tell her about me?
-Just as you told me to.

709
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,368
That you were a materialistic,
philandering piece of garbage.

710
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,869
That you are not as you seem,

711
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,205
and have sociopathic tendencies.

712
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,458
You didn't have to go that far.

713
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,960
I thought you wanted
to seem like a bad guy.

714
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,170
Thanks. Good job.

715
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,131
By the way,

716
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:41,303
why does Ms. Cheon want to see you?

717
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,640
She probably wants to talk about the case.

718
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,183
That's a relief.

719
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,770
Do you think maybe
she has ulterior motives for you?

720
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,566
That's possible
since I'm materialistic and philandering.

721
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,152
That's possible…

722
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,743
-Should we come back?
-No, come in.

723
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,503
Please have a seat here.

724
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,588
-Okay.
-Bo-gyeong, you can go now.

725
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,840
Yes?

726
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,716
Good work. I'll see you at the office.

727
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,970
Okay.

728
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,105
What in the world?

729
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,108
Why did she take a bath now?

730
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,528
How annoying.

731
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,907
Why do they have to meet at a hotel
when there's her office?

732
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,786
Why is she sending me away?

733
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,707
This sucks.

734
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,105
I'm going to wait for you in the car.

735
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,065
Come down as soon as you're done talking.

736
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,026
I don't have money for a taxi.

737
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,652
Taxi?

738
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,529
My credit card got denied.

739
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,324
OKAY

740
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,661
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

741
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,829
It's fine.

742
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,874
I wanted to call you myself,

743
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,293
but I didn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

744
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,003
So I asked Bo-gyeong to bring you.

745
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,838
I hope that's okay.

746
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,341
She is the daughter of my boss.

747
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,177
So it was hard for me to refuse.

748
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,970
I'm sure that's what you intended.

749
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,724
You remember me, don't you?

750
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,226
I do.

751
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,061
And you remember the case two years ago?

752
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,521
I do.

753
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,690
Did you find the culprit?

754
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,193
Probably.

755
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,071
-Did the victim tell you?
-No.

756
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,531
Then how?

757
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,450
It was hard.

758
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,912
The culprit mostly uses cash,

759
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,956
so I couldn't check the credit card bill.

760
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,625
And the interior CCTV cameras
were all removed,

761
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,710
so we had no video of the incident.

762
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,217
But there was someone
suspicious under the circumstances.

763
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,928
So we asked the person's driver.

764
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,596
"This is the secretary's office."

765
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,558
"I heard the person left the cell phone
in that place."

766
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,059
"Where is the location of that place?"

767
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,937
The driver told us right away.

768
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,483
The driver directed us to the same place
where Kim Min-ji was assaulted.

769
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,778
Then why didn't you catch the assailant?

770
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,032
We didn't have evidence.

771
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,785
The person is too powerful.

772
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,288
We needed solid evidence
for an indictment.

773
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,082
What a shame.

774
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,919
I was willing to make a deal
if you had conclusive evidence,

775
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,963
Detective Oh.

776
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:07,050
I happened to be working
on a related case.

777
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,927
By working on this new case,

778
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,680
I think I may find something
for the assault case too.

779
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,515
So you're willing to reopen the case?

780
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,018
About the deal you mentioned earlier,

781
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,437
what did you mean?

782
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,564
Let's talk when you have something good.

783
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,899
I will name my price then.

784
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,153
Okay.

785
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,822
I will hope for the best.

786
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:39,374
Don't you think we're going to have
an interesting relationship?

787
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,712
Let's cheer to that.

788
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,757
Why not?

789
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,468
Bo-gyeong said that you love drinking.

790
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,011
I do.

791
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,318
Aren't they done talking yet?

792
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,908
Detective Oh.

793
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,910
What took you so long?

794
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,036
By any chance…

795
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,665
Did you tell Cheon Na-na
that I love to drink?

796
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,917
I told her that you love
money, women, and alcohol.

797
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,085
I see.

798
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,341
Why…

799
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,677
did you say that?

800
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,975
SEOBU POLICE STATION

801
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,603
FAITHFUL WARM AND TRUSTY POLICE

802
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,814
Bo-gyeong.

803
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,194
Goodness.

804
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,363
Did you two drink together?

805
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,574
No, he drank alone and passed out.

806
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,411
Can I leave him here?

807
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,913
We will take care of him.

808
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,498
Then I'll be off.

809
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,583
Please wait here.

810
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,795
I will take him upstairs
and then take you home.

811
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,715
No, that's okay.
I'll be in trouble if my dad finds out.

812
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,841
Goodbye.

813
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,551
-Goodbye.
-See you.

814
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,638
You saw it with your eyes, right?
Give up now.

815
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,267
She said they didn't drink together.
He drank alone and passed out.

816
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,310
Just give up already.

817
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,688
She even has a pretty walk.

818
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,106
Come on.

819
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,695
I'll carry him if you're tired.

820
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,697
I'm fine.

821
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,825
I'll put him in the break room.

822
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,828
Go back and look over
Gi Dong-jae's CCTV footage.

823
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,580
I will.

824
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,791
Remember to put a blanket over him.

825
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,377
You shouldn't sleep
on a cold surface when you're drunk.

826
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,088
I know!

827
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,298
Okay.

828
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,093
Real men can sleep anywhere.

829
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,899
Eye contact would be nice.

830
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,944
What's wrong?

831
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,071
Do you hate me again?

832
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,747
Forget the old me.

833
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,751
I'm good to you these days.

834
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,549
The detectives have started
to come to see me.

835
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,847
Let them come.

836
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,185
If they come to see you, meet them.

837
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,523
Just tell them you don't know anything.

838
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,651
They will get suspicious
if you avoid them.

839
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,363
Hui-ju…

840
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,533
Who killed her?

841
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,750
How should I know?

842
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,961
She died because of me, right?

843
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,964
Because I told her about you?

844
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,341
So…

845
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,887
Did you tell that to the cops?

846
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,471
Not yet.

847
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,723
Go ahead.

848
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,767
Tell them that if you can handle it.

849
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,731
Bastard.

850
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,567
-Do you want me to kill you?
-Go ahead.

851
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,153
You will regret not killing me now.

852
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,288
Someone must be looking out for you now.

853
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,206
Who is it?

854
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,959
I want Su-yeon back.

855
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,837
You are not fit to raise her,
and you have no right.

856
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,298
Su-yeon is my daughter.

857
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,393
Min-ji…

858
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,271
I can't tell you…

859
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,900
that I love you.

860
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,319
But I do feel some moral responsibility.

861
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,905
You should know
that I normally don't feel such a thing.

862
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,241
Even that is fleeing fast.

863
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,995
Don't let me lose it.

864
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,800
You shouldn't drink alone.

865
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,346
Your imagination runs wild
when you drink alone.

866
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,101
Don't imagine bad things.

867
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,562
It's not good for the mother or the child.

868
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,210
You need to check something for me.

869
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,336
Yes.

870
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,258
Send me the address and the passcode.

871
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,593
I'll call you when I find something.

872
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,395
He's a butcher.

873
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,732
Two years ago, the boss of
Gangnam East Gang was murdered.

874
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,693
Gi Dong-jae, known as the butcher,
was a prime suspect.

875
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,779
But he was cleared
because someone else was arrested.

876
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,698
-But he did it.
-Yes.

877
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,868
The detective in charge
framed another one and let him go.

878
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,579
Did he steal the hospital gown for sure?

879
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,538
Yes.

880
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,958
We saw the video of him
sneaking into the doctor's lounge.

881
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,836
But the doctors are
careless about their gowns.

882
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,005
They couldn't tell if a gown was stolen.

883
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,382
What does he do now?

884
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,301
He owns a meat processing
wholesale business.

885
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:50,555
He provides meat
to TJ Group's company cafeteria.

886
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,640
What should we do? Should we raid it now?

887
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,977
But isn't it more important
to get who's behind him?

888
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,353
There he is.

889
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,940
Let's follow him.

890
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,539
Michael Cha went back to the States.

891
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,002
I think they'll talk about TJ Group
at the board of directors meeting.

892
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,256
Then send Na-na to the States.

893
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,928
McQueen's headquarter closed
all channels of communication.

894
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,013
They won't meet with Na-na.

895
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,848
I don't mean to send her temporarily.

896
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,227
Appoint her at our office in the States.

897
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:39,896
But,

898
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,981
if we send her away in this situation--

899
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,650
She's better off gone.

900
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,370
Yes.

901
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,747
It's an apartment in downtown Seoul.

902
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,541
Gi Dong-jae went inside.

903
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,584
Yes.

904
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,629
I doubt he would do anything
in broad daylight.

905
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,422
I think he's there to see his lover.

906
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,549
Okay.

907
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,009
We will join you, just in case.

908
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,719
Text me the address.

909
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,679
Okay.

910
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,098
Where did he go?

911
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,518
It's an apartment building
in downtown Seoul.

912
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,730
But I don't think it's nice enough
for the TJ Group family to live in.

913
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,567
It is in the Gangnam district.

914
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,360
Where in Gangnam?

915
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,389
I forgot a few documents
because I was rushing out.

916
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,099
What did you need?

917
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,395
Let me check and call you back.

918
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,314
Yes.

919
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,949
-He's not out yet?
-No.

920
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,117
-His car?
-It's over there.

921
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,453
He went in there.

922
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,913
Is that the only entrance?

923
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,915
There's one
in the underground parking lot.

924
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,458
But his car is here.

925
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,126
This is Kim Min-ji's place.

926
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,086
Kim Min-ji?

927
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,922
I checked because
her hair salon is near here.

928
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,674
Her address is registered as this place.

929
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,008
We should go in and check.

930
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,593
-Let's go.
-Okay.

931
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,303
-Call her.
-Okay.

932
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,392
-The person you have called…
-She's on the phone.

933
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,187
I called the salon in the States already.

934
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,147
I told them to mail the documents.

935
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,318
Is that all I need
for the work visa interview?

936
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,279
Okay.

937
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,447
I'll see you then.

938
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,543
Why are you detectives here?

939
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,919
Is everything fine?

940
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,841
Could you open the door?
We need to check something.

941
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:55,758
Sure.

942
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,302
One moment.

943
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,395
Send them away.

944
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,356
Do it now if you want to live.

945
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,713
What's the matter?

946
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,923
Did anyone come by?

947
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,718
No.

948
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,845
Nobody came.

949
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,806
Is that so?

950
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,976
We are in pursuit of a suspect.

951
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,228
We saw the suspect come this way.

952
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,690
I'm fine. Please go.

953
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,276
We would like to check.

954
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,486
I told you I'm fine.

955
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,946
My parents are here.

956
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,532
I don't want to alarm them.

957
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,992
If something happens…

958
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,662
I will call you.

959
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,538
Very well then.

960
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,296
Why do I feel like it's Gi Dong-jae
in there and not her parents?

961
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,423
Right.

962
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,384
Gi Dong-jae came to see Kim Min-ji.

963
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,554
What is their relationship?

964
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,389
-Do-chang.
-Why?

965
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,474
I need to go to the bathroom.

966
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,768
Hurry up.

967
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,603
I think I saw a bathroom there.

968
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,024
Can you please take him to see a doctor?

969
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,317
Do-chang,

970
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,654
Man-gu doesn't just poop anywhere.

971
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,324
He only does this at a crime scene
or a potential crime scene.

972
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,537
I feel like something is about to happen.

973
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,206
Are you saying his butthole predicts--

974
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,250
-Do-chang!
-Is it a boar again?

975
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,128
Gi Dong-jae left the parking lot
with a car.

976
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,756
-Did you see him?
-Let's go.

977
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,382
Damn it.

978
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,863
This is the car.

979
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,997
Search for him.
Arrest him when you find him.

980
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,499
Yes, sir. Let's go.

981
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,376
Do-chang.

982
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,796
This is Kim Min-ji's car.

VEHICLE REGISTRATION
OWNER: KIM MIN-JI

984
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,859
Call the ambulance, hurry.

985
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,515
Do-chang, come take a look.

986
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,183
Why?

987
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,105
What is this?

988
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,817
It's the CCTV footage
from Kim Min-ji's assault two years ago.

989
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,663
Do you want to reveal or hide the culprit?

990
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,416
You have to reveal the culprit
to hide them.

991
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,084
Why do you have that?

992
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,338
She gave Cheon Sang-woo's
incriminating evidence to us on purpose.

993
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,672
I will give you a chance.

994
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,215
If you tell me the truth now,

995
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,217
I will protect you with my life.

996
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,053
Are you the one who killed Hui-ju?

997
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,262
Hui-ju died because of you.

998
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,014
Why are you telling me this now?

999
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,349
How can you keep that from me?

1000
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,018
You were trying to stab me in the back.

1001
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,771
If we don't destroy him completely,
we will be in danger.

1002
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,774
We will build it again.
You and me, together.

1003
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:51,739
