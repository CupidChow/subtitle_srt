1
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,956
All eyes will be on you.

2
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,249
You should be prepared.

3
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,127
Yes, I was expecting this.

4
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,129
But how should I handle this?

5
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,631
Just hang in there.

6
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,549
It won't last long.

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,472
I won't have to go to court, right?

8
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,600
I'll make sure you don't.

9
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,435
I'll be counting on the two of you.

10
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,714
JEONGHAN DAILY

11
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,975
Let's not go.

12
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,227
-Why not?
-I think he's caught on.

13
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,233
Call the rest of the team
and tell them to come to the office

14
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,402
instead of going home.

15
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,407
I'll be there around 11:00 p.m.

16
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,160
Yes. Okay, bye.

17
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,624
I heard her dad is a death-row convict
who killed two people.

18
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,918
So what? It's not like she killed them.

19
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,254
Still, she gives me the creeps.

20
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,965
What would she have learned
from a father like that?

21
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,884
And I don't like her eyes.

22
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,470
You're just prejudiced against her.
She grew up in a difficult environment.

23
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,515
Do you owe her something?

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,976
What? Why would I owe her anything?

25
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,271
Then why are you being so nice to her?
You're never like this.

26
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,815
Because I'm running low on testosterone.

27
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,901
Because of you, I'm losing all my hair,

28
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,195
my testosterone levels have gone down,
and I always find myself crying.

29
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,948
It's all your fault, you darn brat.

30
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,369
My gosh, what's wrong with him?

31
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,467
Come in.

32
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,517
Do you like your room?

33
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,480
Here.

34
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,440
I just peeled them.

35
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,955
This bed is quite old.

36
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,458
But it'll be better than the ones
in the hospital.

37
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,505
The mattress is still okay.

38
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,798
You can save my dad, right?

39
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,551
He didn't kill anyone.

40
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,553
You know that.

41
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,347
I'll try my best

42
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,141
and do everything I can.

43
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,893
What if my dad

44
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,940
ends up getting executed?

45
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,736
Who can I blame when that happens?

46
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,074
My dad told me

47
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,703
to forget about him
as if he never existed in my life.

48
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,163
But how can I do that?

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,625
He gave birth to me and raised me.

50
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,253
He's still my dad.

51
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,256
Your dad is still alive.

52
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,592
I was the one

53
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,262
who arrested him.

54
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,849
And I'm the one

55
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,436
who can undo that.

56
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,369
You have something to tell me
about Lee Dae-cheol?

57
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,083
Lee Dae-cheol was sentenced to death
for having murdered

58
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,003
a female college student
and a police detective.

59
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,257
The student's name was Yoon Ji-seon.
She was an art student.

60
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,136
It turns out she drew a portrait
for someone before she died.

61
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:50,725
And I have circumstantial evidence
that the person might've killed her.

62
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,143
Who's that?

63
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,103
The president
of Incheon Jeil Investment Trust.

64
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,897
Oh Jong-tae.

65
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,820
-Do you have evidence?
-Oh Jong-tae's alibi was fabricated.

66
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,323
-And?
-And there's evidence

67
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,242
that Lee Dae-cheol was somewhere else
when the victim was murdered.

68
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,079
They're both indirect evidence.
They won't be admitted.

69
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,332
Both the case and trial were carried out
based on the wrong evidence.

70
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,793
I think it's more than enough
to ask for a retrial.

71
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,129
A retrial? Do you think that will be easy?

72
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,714
No, it will be hard.

73
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,801
More so if Oh Jong-tae
turns out to be the real culprit.

74
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,097
He's one of the wealthiest men in Incheon.

75
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,849
He'll use all his connections
in the legal and political circles,

76
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,726
and the police force to stop the retrial.

77
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,852
And even

78
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,064
the press.

79
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,067
Someone once told me

80
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,445
that the best way to cover up a case

81
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,698
is to get rid of the victim forever.

82
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,828
Lee Dae-cheol almost got murdered in jail.

83
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,539
But that plan failed,
and not too long after that,

84
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,500
the government gave an execution order
for the first time in 20 years.

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,796
What if the purpose of that execution
is to get rid of Lee Dae-cheol?

86
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,341
And what if the actual culprit
is behind all this?

87
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,469
It'd be impossible for an ordinary person.

88
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,515
But it's possible if it's Oh Jong-tae.

89
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,480
I also know Oh Jong-tae.

90
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,691
He's a very powerful man.

91
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,278
He also helped my brother get elected.

92
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,782
But he's just someone
who has a little power in the suburbs.

93
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,954
An execution order is an important issue
that requires the President's approval.

94
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,958
Do you think he's powerful enough
to have influence over the President?

95
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,754
If your speculation is right,
Oh Jong-tae wouldn't be the culprit.

96
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,426
It's someone
who's more powerful than he is.

97
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,604
Hey, Detective Oh.

98
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,773
Right now?

99
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,361
Okay.

100
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,116
Yoo Jeong-seok,

101
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,410
the head of the Current Affairs Team
at Jeonghan Daily.

102
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,412
And his older brother is

103
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,290
Assemblyman Yoo Jeong-ryeol.

104
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,168
He might become
the next Minister of Justice.

105
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,137
I won't have to go to court, right?

106
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,972
I'll be counting on the two of you.

107
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,188
The head of the Current Affairs Team
at Jeonghan Daily

108
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,607
and the next Minister of Justice
are both watching his back?

109
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,275
My goodness.

110
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,154
-This is giving me a headache.
-He met him on purpose to prove a point.

111
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,492
He wanted to show us that he's friends
with someone very powerful.

112
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,080
Do-chang.

113
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,750
Why are you still keeping
the guys at work?

114
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,631
Do-chang, this is wrong.

115
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,384
Let's be honest.
You're doing this for personal reasons.

116
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,219
-Am I wrong?
-What?

117
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,680
-What's wrong with you?
-Move.

118
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,098
You know I'm right.

119
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,849
Do-chang.

120
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,147
Just focus on catching Joo Dong-pal.
That's our job.

121
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,902
Why do you have to keep the boys here
for something personal?

122
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,903
Jae-hong.

123
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,697
We want to do this.

124
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,075
Oh, come on. Stop being funny.

125
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,119
You all need to wake up.

126
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,997
Your career will get messed up
regardless of how this case turns out.

127
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,373
Do-chang, look at me.

128
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,166
Let me ask you a favor.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,088
If you still have
at least a little bit of conscience left,

130
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,756
let the boys go home

131
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,801
instead of ruining their lives!

132
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,929
Jae-hong, what's wrong with you?

133
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,140
Did you say we represent the police?

134
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,729
Just be honest
and say you need suicide bombers.

135
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,772
-Darn it!
-Jae-hong.

136
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,651
My gosh.

137
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,902
What's with him?

138
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,534
Jae-hong is right.
You guys can decide what to do.

139
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,579
-Ji-hyeok.
-Yes?

140
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,207
Can I see that evidence you told me about
regarding the fabricated video footage?

141
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,751
Okay.

142
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,336
The rest of you can leave.

143
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,630
Thanks for your help.

144
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,715
Why is everything so complicated?

145
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,175
It's simple.

146
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,345
It means we're going to get fired
if we keep helping Do-chang.

147
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,807
How will they fire us?
We're public officials.

148
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:46,312
They might not fire us,
but they'll send us to the countryside.

149
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,689
We'll still get paid.

150
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,067
But we won't be able to have
a successful career.

151
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,862
If I cared about that, I wouldn't have
applied for the violent crimes unit.

152
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,448
-You have a point.
-Isn't that Jae-hong?

153
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,741
Where?

154
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,205
Is that fool going to drive
after drinking that much?

155
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:09,293
How many times do I need to tell you
that Do-chang is after Joo Dong-pal?

156
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,544
Think about it.

157
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,464
What would he gain
from digging up Lee Dae-cheol's case?

158
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,175
My gosh. Hey.

159
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,095
Do you think I'm your minion?

160
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,847
Forget it. Just do whatever you want.
Do whatever you want!

161
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,063
Darn this.

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,609
This is so humiliating.

163
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,738
How did I end up in such a big mess?

164
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,242
Gosh, I'm still paying for this.

165
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,326
This is driving me crazy.

166
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,288
LIEUTENANT YOON SANG-MI

167
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,129
You're getting a call from Yoon Sang-mi.

168
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,340
Yoon Sang-mi
from the Civil Petition Division.

169
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,926
Gosh, I can't believe this.

170
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,232
We should apply for a retrial

171
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,608
before it's too late.

172
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,027
We should, considering the situation.

173
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,405
But we don't have enough time.

174
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,783
It's hard to win a retrial
even if you prepare it for years.

175
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,036
We'll just have to do what we can.
There's no other way.

176
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,997
Detective Kwon said earlier

177
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,417
that your career will get messed up
regardless of how this case turns out.

178
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,626
He's right, you know.

179
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,545
Are you guys okay with that?

180
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,465
The worst thing that can happen to me
is getting fired.

181
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,968
But if things go wrong,
Lee Dae-cheol will die.

182
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,721
What do you think I should do?

183
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,522
Be honest with us.

184
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,192
Yoon Sang-mi has you by the balls, right?

185
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,990
Jae-hong, by any chance…

186
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,201
What? By any chance what?

187
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,412
Dong-uk, what in the world
are you thinking?

188
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,165
You all heard what he said over the phone.

189
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,167
Why do you think he mentioned Do-chang?

190
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,419
She must've asked him to keep an eye on…

191
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,464
Hey, you punk.
What do you know about Jae-hong?

192
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,801
Do you have any idea
how much he actually respects Do-chang?

193
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,888
What if Dong-uk is right?

194
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,143
What if he's right, you punks?

195
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,645
What's wrong with you?

196
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,730
What are you saying?

197
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,692
Think about it, guys.

198
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,196
Who do you think will last longer
in this team?

199
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,033
Me or Do-chang?

200
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,661
Damn it.

201
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,715
Thank you.

202
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,095
-Did you report this to your superiors?
-This case?

203
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
Yes, I did.

204
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,226
Did you also tell Mr. Yoo
who met up with Oh Jong-tae earlier?

205
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,646
Of course. He's my direct supervisor.

206
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,273
They looked pretty close.

207
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,150
He won't be glad to hear
that we're after Oh Jong-tae.

208
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,905
It won't be good for you
to get on his bad side.

209
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,119
Right. You have a point.

210
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,251
Why go against him
when I just got a job at the head office?

211
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,338
Plus, this case will have to butt heads
with the cops, prosecution, and judiciary.

212
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,467
If I do anything to cross them,
they'll never give me any information.

213
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,761
And that will be the end of my career.

214
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,765
Why would I risk my entire career
just to write this one article?

215
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,726
Don't you think I'm out of my mind?

216
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,186
Gosh, this is seriously crazy.

217
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,776
I want you to check
if Jo Seong-dae got orders from Kim Gi-tae

218
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,614
and if Kim Gi-tae knew about Oh Jong-tae.

219
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,116
Are you kidding me?

220
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,411
Like I just said, this is completely nuts.

221
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,539
-Make sure you check it for me.
-Detective Oh.

222
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,624
Detective Oh!

223
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,503
Like you said,
Lee Dae-cheol really seems to be innocent.

224
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,883
But the case happened too long ago,
so we don't have conclusive evidence.

225
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,054
Things would become a lot easier
if someone confesses the truth.

226
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,849
Why don't you help me, sir?

227
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,392
What do I need to help you with?

228
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,518
Jo Seong-dae.

229
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,731
I know you guys are close.
Didn't he tell you anything?

230
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,275
He must not have told you

231
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,195
that he killed Park Gun-ho
and that he tried to kill me, too.

232
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,907
The cops are trying to find out
who's behind him.

233
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,743
And I got to meet him

234
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,204
because of you.

235
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,581
-Jo Seong-dae?
-Yes, Jo Seong-dae.

236
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,833
Who is that person?

237
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,794
You sent him to pick me up.

238
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, I asked my nephew to pick you up.

239
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,302
But I guess he sent that guy instead
because he was busy.

240
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,307
I'll ask my nephew
what kind of person he is.

241
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,019
-Sir.
-I didn't have any ulterior motives

242
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,938
when I told you about
Lee Dae-cheol's innocence.

243
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,483
No, I'll be honest.
There's a reason why I told you.

244
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,821
Once my trial begins,
you'll be asked to speak as a witness.

245
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,950
And I wanted to make sure my witness
had a positive image of me.

246
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,410
That's all.

247
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,208
If you figured out the culprit,

248
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,211
shouldn't you have told me about it first?

249
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,297
I still need to investigate it a bit more.

250
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,508
Who exactly are you investigating?

251
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,679
It's not the person you thought it was.

252
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,059
But your ultimate goal
is the person I'm thinking about, right?

253
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,064
If you want,

254
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,483
I can stop here.

255
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,118
Detective Kang, I've never been

256
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,704
in charge of a retrial before,
and to be honest,

257
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,165
I don't think I can do it.

258
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,251
On top of that,
he's going to get executed soon.

259
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,463
The judiciary won't accept
such a sensitive issue.

260
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,634
Plus, I'm too cowardly
to take on big cases like this.

261
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,595
Mr. So.

262
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,640
I arrested Lee Dae-cheol myself.

263
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,479
The detective who arrested the culprit
is asking for a retrial

264
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,522
to prove the culprit's innocence.

265
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,278
Right now,
I'm practically cutting my own throat.

266
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,697
It's crazy.

267
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,035
-So why are you doing this?
-Nothing will happen

268
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,454
if I stay quiet. I know that.

269
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,248
But if I don't do anything,

270
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,627
no one will speak the truth.

271
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,262
Drawings are very different from photos.

272
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,890
Drawings hold emotions.

273
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,893
That's because one person draws the other.

274
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,604
What do you see in me?

275
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,357
Anger?

276
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,860
You seem very angry at something.

277
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,822
Anyway, you look a bit sad.

278
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,769
I'll put the lawyer on the phone.
You can talk to him.

279
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,020
Just a second.

280
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,606
-It's Ko Jun-seop.
-Oh, okay.

281
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,403
Hello. I'm So Jae-seop, a lawyer.

282
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,034
Yoon Ji-seon's friend told us that.

283
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,580
How many witnesses do we have?

284
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,333
-Ko Jun-seop.
-Yoon Ji-seon's friend.

285
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,157
NOVEMBER 3, 2015, 9:18:27 P.M.
MAN LEAVES ROOM

286
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,035
NOVEMBER 3, 2015, 1:12:44 A.M.
UNKNOWN OBJECT APPEARS

287
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,708
No matter how hard I try,
the result doesn't change.

288
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,380
There's no evidence to prove
that Oh Jong-tae is the culprit.

289
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,342
And there's no evidence to prove
that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

290
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:24,097
Retrials require a lot trickier
than ordinary trials.

291
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,975
This won't work.

292
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,352
We have a witness.

293
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,895
Ko Jun-seop?

294
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:33,440
But he didn't witness the murder.

295
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,942
-What about a cop?
-A cop?

296
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:41,031
The witness that judges trust the most
is the detective who was in charge.

297
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,283
What if that detective testifies in court?

298
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,748
You want me to jump into the fiery pit
with a gasoline tank?

299
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
Okay, sure.

300
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,759
Do-chang is busy
chasing after Joo Dong-pal now.

301
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,261
That's just for show.

302
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,681
From what I know,
he's reinvestigating Lee Dae-cheol's case.

303
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,600
-Why?
-You know him.

304
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,811
Once he believes something is right,

305
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,146
he pushes forward
without thinking about the consequences.

306
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,066
He's changed a lot.
He's not like how he was in the past.

307
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,905
You know I'm currently
inspecting Detective Kang, right?

308
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,700
He recently came to see me.

309
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,452
"I wonder why that happened
to that person back then.

310
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,329
I thought it was a coincidence.

311
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,083
But now, why does it seem like
that person had an ulterior motive?"

312
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,712
Sooner or later, I might have to do my job

313
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,172
and do something unfortunate
to a good friend of mine.

314
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:43,343
What does he mean by "back then"?

315
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,512
He's talking about that time
when I lost the weapon

316
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,224
and you found it
and brought it back for me.

317
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,935
And he said he might have to do
something unfortunate

318
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,229
because he knows he'll have to open up
about what happened

319
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,150
once he begins
reinvestigating Lee Dae-cheol's case.

320
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,652
If my mistake goes public,

321
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,447
it'll taint my career.

322
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,867
And people will also question you

323
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,578
for having found the weapon.

324
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,586
What do cops normally do
if they retire early?

325
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,087
Illegal detectives?

326
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,465
That job is too messy.

327
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,008
Private bodyguards?

328
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,886
But that requires a lot of stamina.

329
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,680
You're too old for that.

330
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,974
My gosh.

331
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,727
Age doesn't matter.

332
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,272
I'll hire someone young
and make him work for me instead.

333
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,024
-Who?
-There's this guy.

334
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,692
He threw me into the fiery pit.

335
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:45,530
But rest assured.
I'll take him with me no matter what.

336
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,721
Yoon Sang-mi?

337
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,848
At this hour? Why?

338
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,727
She came by herself? For what?
Whom did she meet?

339
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,030
Don't answer the phone.
Just hold it for me.

340
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,703
CHIEF MOON SANG-BEOM

341
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,591
Give me that.

342
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:55,058
I'm… I'm chasing a culprit right now.

343
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,185
Why did you have to call me now?

344
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,106
Hey! Stop right there! You darn punk!

345
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,403
Let's go catch Joo Dong-pal.

346
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,280
It's time to arrest him now.
Start the car.

347
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,325
Who is it?

348
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,703
Hey, Yu-na. It's me.

349
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,583
What's wrong?
Couldn't you find a place to sleep again?

350
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,210
You can pay first.

351
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,587
Crazy bitch.

352
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,426
You told the cops about me, didn't you?

353
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,307
Hey!

354
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,104
-What's up?
-Hong-du is going to kill me.

355
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,940
-Why would he kill you?
-Because I fell for that cop

356
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,775
and gave him Hong-du's number.

357
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,278
Eun-hye, please help me.

358
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,613
Where are you right now?

359
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,199
You know that place where… That place…

360
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,326
Oh, the empty house
where I held my birthday party.

361
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,411
Hong-du will find me soon.

362
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,622
Can you stay with me until he comes

363
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,707
and convince him to forgive me?

364
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,960
If I'm here all by myself,
he'll beat me to death.

365
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,671
I was only trying to help you.
That's why this happened.

366
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,548
Eun-hye, please.

367
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,884
Okay, wait there.

368
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,390
Where are you going?

369
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,103
Detective Kang told me
not to let you leave at night.

370
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,772
I'm not locked up in jail.

371
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,233
Do you plan not to come back?

372
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,407
Let's say you secretly ran away.

373
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,993
That will work best for both of us.

374
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,110
-Did you guys eat?
-Yes.

375
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,319
Let's do this.

376
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,738
Where is Joo Dong-pal?

377
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,282
He'll show up soon.

378
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,367
He's crazy about women.

379
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,621
He probably had a few drinks.
He'll show up in front of her house soon.

380
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,374
If it's so easy to catch him,
why did you have to call us here?

381
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,836
Are you nuts? Why would I catch him alone?
I can't stand seeing you guys slack off.

382
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,339
-He's here.
-There he is.

383
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,303
Let's get going. Go.

384
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,561
Who are those guys?

385
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,063
I think they're from Gwangju.

386
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,231
Damn it.

387
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,150
Joo Dong-pal!

388
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,861
-Run.
-Darn it.

389
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,738
-You punk!
-Hey!

390
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,780
Stop right there!

391
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,948
Damn it.

392
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,993
-Come here, you punk!
-Get over here!

393
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,995
-Move!
-Hey, don't push!

394
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,830
-Get out of my way!
-Hey!

395
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,832
Let me through!

396
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,751
-Hey!
-Go get him!

397
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,003
-Get over here!
-Hey!

398
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,339
-Go!
-Catch him!

399
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,351
You punk!

400
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,894
Get over here!

401
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,520
My gosh, move!

402
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,689
Where do you think you're going?

403
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,698
Ji-hyeok!

404
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,242
Ji-hyeok!

405
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,830
Ji-hyeok!

406
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,291
Catch him for me!

407
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,626
Come here!

408
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,252
-Stop!
-You punk!

409
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,838
-Get out of my way!
-Let go of me!

410
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,673
-Move!
-Go!

411
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,636
-Hey, move!
-Darn you!

412
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,054
Catch him!

413
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,306
-Get over here!
-Go!

414
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,783
-Darn it!
-Go get him!

415
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,660
My gosh.

416
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,703
-Hey!
-Come here, you punk!

417
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,793
-Go!
-I got him!

418
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,675
Get out of my way!

419
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,803
Get off me!

420
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,264
-Move!
-My gosh!

421
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,182
-Darn it!
-Where is he?

422
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,268
-He's not here!
-Get him!

423
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,436
Stop right there!

424
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,521
My gosh!

425
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,189
Hey, you darn punk!

426
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,524
Come here!

427
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,608
My gosh!

428
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,153
Come over here!

429
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,029
Damn it!

430
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,323
I caught him.

431
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,867
My goodness.

432
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,578
My gosh.

433
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,788
Where did it go?

434
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,624
-Move.
-Wait.

435
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,043
-Okay, wait.
-Jae-hong!

436
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,047
-Damn it!
-There we go!

437
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,132
I got him.

438
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,554
Have a safe trip back.

439
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,639
That's enough.

440
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,184
Come on. Get up.

441
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,686
-We caught him.
-My gosh.

442
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,568
Gosh, you guys came from so far away.

443
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,322
Anyway, thank you so much
for your cooperation.

444
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,240
My goodness, this is great.

445
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,036
-Let's go.
-Great work, guys.

446
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,662
You guys should eat.

447
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,747
Damn it.

448
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,293
Great job.

449
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,628
Nice job, Jae-hong!

450
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,021
What are you doing here?

451
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,774
Did you call her?

452
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,780
Listen. I hate that brat.
She attracts cops.

453
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,159
What were you trying to do with her?

454
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,911
-Aren't you going to answer me?
-Stop.

455
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,792
Hey, I get angry just by looking at you.

456
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,877
Just get lost.

457
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,504
I asked her to do everything.
Hit me instead.

458
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,382
You have an amazing friend.

459
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,551
You're very loyal.

460
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,096
Hey, you two.
Take her somewhere and teach her a lesson.

461
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,515
She gave me this scar on my nose.

462
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,350
Make sure you beat her to a pulp.

463
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,310
Eun-hye.

464
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,936
-Stop it.
-Please.

465
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,772
Get her out of my sight.

466
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,940
I said stop it!

467
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,609
Take her out, you punks!

468
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,985
Let me go!

469
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,820
This is all because of you!

470
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,586
Hey, let her go.

471
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,963
I said let her go.

472
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,200
I want you to take
four more guys with you.

473
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,285
It'll be lonely
if you go to jail all alone.

474
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,831
Just pick four people
who aren't that close to you.

475
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,501
Teams One and Two! Attention!

476
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,835
At ease, guys.

477
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,965
Good work.

478
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,636
Which one of you cuffed this guy?

479
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,930
It was Jae-hong.

480
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,767
Gosh, I had no idea he could be so fast.
He was as fast as lightning.

481
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,102
You should've seen him, sir.

482
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:03,022
He's normally very slow.
But whenever he sees a culprit,

483
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,440
he turns into Usain Bolt.

484
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,734
He was born to be a detective.

485
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,403
What's wrong with you guys?

486
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,613
Don't be too humble.

487
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,824
You know my two principles, right?

488
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,451
No matter what happens,

489
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,662
I will pick out those who blame others
for their faults.

490
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,455
And I will always make sure

491
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,834
to reward people
who contributed to doing the right thing.

492
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,006
I didn't catch him by myself.

493
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,925
You're right.
Catching culprits requires teamwork.

494
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,721
You guys really did well this time.

495
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,306
I can really count on Team Two.

496
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,142
Team Two!

497
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,604
Good job.

498
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,070
What if she dies?

499
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,239
Don't worry. She'll wake up soon.

500
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,158
Hong-du, what about me?

501
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,660
You're a great actress.

502
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,538
I know, right? Does this mean we're even?

503
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,501
You'd better not lie to me. I'll kill you.

504
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,713
Of course, I won't.
Why would you even say that?

505
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,381
Let's say you secretly ran away.

506
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,383
That will work best for both of us.

507
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,072
-Raise your glasses.
-Okay.

508
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,407
Cheers to Violent Crimes Unit Team Two!

509
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,743
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

510
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,423
Did you finish writing the case report?

511
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,551
-Yes.
-You did great. Let's go inside.

512
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,344
Hey.

513
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,596
Here.

514
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,808
Thank you.

515
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,435
Gosh, come on.

516
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,939
Our hero is here!

517
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,023
Hello.

518
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,748
Incheon Seobu Police Station!

519
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,000
The fastest runner!

520
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,085
Kwon Jae-hong!

521
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,922
My goodness. Come here, my baby.

522
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,261
Jae-hong will drink now!

523
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,056
-Hong!
-Hong!

524
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,644
-Hong!
-Hong!

525
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,647
Try this.

526
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,732
It's a snack.

527
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,824
Jae-hong, come here.

528
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,451
Jae-hong, sit in the center.

529
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,952
Come on.

530
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,662
He won't come.

531
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:11,687
CHANGSUNG CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

532
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,876
REQUEST FOR RETRIAL

533
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,172
I…

534
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,134
I never asked for a retrial.
Who did this for me?

535
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,137
Detective Kang Do-chang
from Incheon Seobu Police Station

536
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,056
asked me to do this.

537
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,015
Why…

538
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,976
Why would he do this?

539
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,232
He seems to acknowledge that there was
a mistake with the investigation.

540
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,985
Really?

541
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,820
Yes.

542
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,241
Will you give it a go?

543
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,036
Do you think it'll be possible for me
to get a retrial?

544
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,580
Do you think the judge will approve?

545
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,041
Be honest with me.

546
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,254
I've seen a lot of inmates
filing requests for retrials,

547
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,966
but not a single one was approved.

548
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,094
It's not entirely impossible

549
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:29,432
because the detective who was in charge
of your case back then

550
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,267
is already admitting that he was wrong.

551
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,977
He admits that now?

552
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,981
He didn't believe a single word I said
when I told him I was innocent.

553
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,067
But he admits it now
when I'm about to get executed?

554
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,902
Does he want to save me all of a sudden?

555
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,946
It's all bullshit.

556
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,532
Once I die, he'll tell himself

557
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,785
that he doesn't need to feel guilty
because he did his best.

558
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,705
He's just doing this
to feel better about himself.

559
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,708
I will never forgive him.

560
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,376
Never.

561
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,717
-You should sign it.
-No, I won't.

562
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,843
You should take revenge.

563
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,387
If the court approves of the retrial,

564
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,891
Detective Kang will no longer be
able to work as a detective.

565
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,228
The police and prosecution
won't forgive him for humiliating them.

566
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,773
And he knows that.

567
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,692
But he's willing to do it regardless.
Like you said,

568
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,403
maybe he really just wants to feel better
about himself.

569
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,696
That's all I can think of.

570
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,450
So just sign the document.

571
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,081
And tell the world what he did to you

572
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,833
in court.

573
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,139
APPLICANT: LEE DAE-CHEOL
LAWYER: SO JAE-SEOP

574
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,859
I know I'm a lawyer,
but I don't trust the law wholeheartedly.

575
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,407
If you end up getting executed,
it'll make me distrust the law even more.

576
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,328
Eun-hye

577
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,831
has nowhere to go, and she has no money.

578
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,749
Eun-hye is sick.

579
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,126
How could you kick her out?

580
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,546
I didn't kick her out.
She just left on her own.

581
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,423
I'm sure you made her feel uncomfortable.

582
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,258
What was I supposed to do?

583
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,926
Was I supposed to beg her to stay?

584
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,469
She's still a little kid!

585
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,263
Weren't you worried

586
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,932
that she didn't come home?
You're a mother with a child!

587
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,309
I'm already heartbroken
because I can't see my own child.

588
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,186
I have no energy to worry about her.

589
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,855
Then you should've at least called me.

590
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,983
She told me
that she's not locked up in prison.

591
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,570
Do you really think
you can take care of her?

592
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,782
Every time she looks at you,
she'll be reminded of her father in jail.

593
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,454
The victims' families
might think of you as their savior,

594
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,291
but you're just a darn bastard
to the culprits' families.

595
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:14,638
KOREAN JUDICIAL RESEARCH
AND TRAINING INSTITUE

596
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,774
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

597
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,694
She won't answer my calls.

598
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,030
You should try calling Eun-hye.

599
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,407
I'll try calling her later.

600
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,743
Why did you take her home?

601
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,369
Well…

602
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,747
I had some extra rooms at home.

603
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,042
What if Lee Dae-cheol gets executed?

604
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,668
What do you plan to do then?

605
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,879
Are you going to let her
live at your place?

606
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,589
Well…

607
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,300
I haven't thought that far yet.

608
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,678
You'll have to see her every day
and suffer from nightmares

609
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,722
every time you go to bed.

610
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,807
Hell doesn't actually exist.

611
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,309
People create it for themselves.

612
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,066
Hey, why do you keep lecturing me?

613
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,152
Stop worrying about me
and just live a better life yourself.

614
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,072
-Okay.
-I think it's the judge.

615
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,118
Yes, I'll look into it
and send you additional information.

616
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,495
Okay, bye.

617
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,789
Jae-seop, what did the judge say?

618
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,750
He doesn't get why we're doing this
right before the execution.

619
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,044
He asked me if there's an ulterior motive.

620
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,756
What ulterior motive?
We're just asking for a retrial

621
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,509
because Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

622
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,428
I think he just called as a formality.

623
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,472
It's a very sensitive issue.

624
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,142
So he's just showing he did his best
before he rejects it.

625
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,061
Does that mean
he wishes to reject the request?

626
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,356
If the judge rejects it,
there can't be a retrial.

627
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,651
Damn it.

628
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,696
I told him I'll revise the files
and give him additional information.

629
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,531
So let's try our best.

630
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,661
By the way, is there anything else

631
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,914
we can use to make this work?

632
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,629
Well, there's something
really embarrassing.

633
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,965
It's hard to even say it out loud

634
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,343
as a detective.

635
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,220
But during the investigation,

636
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,057
we lost the murder weapon
that was found at the scene.

637
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,894
We managed to find it again.

638
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,481
But it was missing for about an hour.

639
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,611
Was that weapon submitted as evidence
during the trial?

640
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,825
That means someone could've
fabricated the evidence.

641
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,495
Why didn't you think of that?

642
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,417
Back then, I was very convinced
that Lee Dae-cheol was guilty.

643
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:56,091
Gosh, this is such a difficult situation.

644
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,677
We really don't have much time.

645
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,679
It's the same for them.

646
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,641
Once Lee Dae-cheol's retrial
becomes an issue,

647
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,768
the guys who decided
to proceed with the execution

648
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,687
will want to deal with it
before they execute him.

649
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,607
So they might actually agree
on holding a retrial.

650
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,941
You're right.

651
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,611
The President makes the final decision.

652
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,572
So why don't you eat with him
and talk to him about it?

653
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,200
You really need to stop
talking nonsense, you punk.

654
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,370
Yes, what's up? Already?

655
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,497
I bet the chief called them.

656
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,667
Gosh, he really loves the press.

657
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,668
Okay.

658
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,004
Organize the evidence we confiscated.

659
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,090
But make sure you show them
to the chief first.

660
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,758
He might complain later.

661
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,553
LAWYER SO JAE-SEOP

662
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,522
You don't need to worry about money.

663
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,441
I know you guys can't afford to pay me.

664
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,820
Once we win the trial,
he'll receive compensation.

665
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,405
I'll ask him to pay me with that.

666
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,531
Someone might

667
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,410
try to approach you one day.

668
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,579
If anyone offers you money,
let me know how much.

669
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,373
I'll pay you twice their offer.

670
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,376
Okay.

671
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,045
Sometimes,

672
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,174
lawyers find out
that their client is guilty.

673
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,634
But they still defend them

674
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,469
because it pays well.

675
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,722
But sometimes,

676
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,016
there are cases

677
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,270
that make us want to dig into them
regardless of the money.

678
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,397
Probably for self-satisfaction

679
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,567
or self-comfort.

680
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,653
Good luck.

681
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,906
EVIDENCE NUMBER 1

682
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,451
EVIDENCE NUMBER 5

683
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,458
YEONAN GANG ORGANIZATION CHART

684
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:54,793
Attention, everybody.

685
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,129
At ease.

686
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,520
-Captain Woo.
-Yes?

687
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,773
They didn't commit a financial crime.

688
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,776
They're the biggest gang in Incheon.

689
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,404
Doesn't this look a bit too weak?

690
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,455
Why did you have a gang fight
in broad daylight?

691
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,291
Were you trying to take revenge
on the gangs in Gwangju?

692
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,001
No, it wasn't for revenge.

693
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,503
We apologize.

694
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,172
Do you know that our citizens
are very frightened?

695
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,798
We're very sorry.

696
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,634
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

697
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,302
Did your team catch him?

698
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,221
-Yes.
-How…

699
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,390
When did you have the time to catch him?

700
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,267
This is a secret.

701
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,853
I have two bodies.

702
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,396
I actually have a twin.

703
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,233
He's investigating another case right now.

704
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,776
Ms. Jin.

705
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,861
Ms. Jin, can we talk?

706
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,946
Okay.

707
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,493
Is it true that you tried to flee abroad?

708
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,704
-I'm sorry.
-Good work.

709
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,997
Did you start the fight?

710
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,584
You did great, but you really need
to do something about Sang-mi.

711
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,922
She's not someone
who takes orders from us anymore.

712
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,007
-Okay, sir.
-Is that what caused the fight?

713
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,220
I have nothing to say.

714
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,721
Please tell us something.

715
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,725
Have you met Kim Gi-tae?

716
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
He's so cunning.

717
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,313
I don't think we can get him to help us.

718
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,526
-What about the retrial?
-The lawyer sent a request.

719
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,154
But the judge isn't very cooperative.

720
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,072
Yes, obviously.

721
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,535
If that judge is in his right mind,
he won't budge.

722
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,330
Then why don't you sway him a little?

723
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,002
Good work.

724
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,086
You too.

725
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,463
-Good work.
-You too.

726
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,174
My goodness.

727
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,259
Mr. Jung.

728
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,760
Hey.

729
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,930
Are you going to write about today's case
on the main news section?

730
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,640
I'm not sure.

731
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,602
It looks like the cops tried
their best to make it sound impressive,

732
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,395
but it's not big enough
to become an issue.

733
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,065
There's actually another case.

734
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,152
And it's totally big enough
to make it to the main news section.

735
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,864
Do you want it? Are you interested?

736
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,159
It's true

737
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,287
that Do-chang is reinvestigating
Lee Dae-cheol's case.

738
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,457
He pretended to focus on Joo Dong-pal
to fool the chief.

739
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,670
But what he's really investigating
is Lee Dae-cheol's case.

740
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,799
How far is he with the reinvestigation?

741
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,719
Did he find new evidence?

742
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,137
I'm not sure.

743
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,307
Why don't you ask him yourself?

744
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,488
You guys have amazing teamwork.

745
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,365
-You can go now.
-Okay.

746
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,786
We're brothers for life. I'm sorry.

747
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,546
We requested for a retrial
regarding Lee Dae-cheol's case.

748
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,050
Who are you doing this for?

749
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,178
Once there's a retrial,
I plan to testify in court.

750
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,307
I'll have no choice but to talk about
the weapon you lost back then.

751
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,559
You leave me with no choice.

752
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,521
It looks like
you're going to drag me down with you.

753
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,398
There's nothing I can do to stop that.

754
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:48,026
I'm going to tell the judge
that I lost that weapon.

755
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,824
Sang-mi, you just need to stay quiet
just like you always have.

756
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,703
How touching.

757
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,831
Our team members gathered money yesterday

758
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,751
and returned the money Jae-hong received
for those gift certificates.

759
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,884
I just need to keep my mouth shut, right?

760
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,405
Okay.

761
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,866
I'll let you know once we fix a location.

762
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,952
Okay, bring the broadcasting team there.

763
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,245
Okay, bye.

764
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,123
-Broadcasting team?
-Yes.

765
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,753
You're going to be on TV, Do-chang.

766
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,425
A death-row convict is raising an issue
for having filed for a retrial.

767
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,678
Let's hear about the details
from the reporter in charge.

768
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,347
Prior to the execution
that hasn't been carried out in 20 years,

769
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,726
I heard one of the death-row convicts
filed for a retrial. Who is that?

770
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,104
He's Lee Dae-cheol, a death-row convict
who killed a female college student

771
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,523
and a police detective five years ago.

772
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,193
Why is he asking for a retrial?

773
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:15,030
Because he thinks the investigation
was carried out poorly and coercively.

774
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,241
I went to Incheon Seobu Police Station
and met the detective

775
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,368
who investigated the case
and arrested Lee Dae-cheol.

776
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,579
He was extremely agitated.

777
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:25,207
Let's take a look at the footage
before I go into further detail.

778
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,171
Detective Kang Do-chang.

779
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,341
Are you the detective who was in charge
of Lee Dae-cheol's case five years ago?

780
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,092
Yes, what do you want?

781
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,594
-Is that you?
-Do you know that…

782
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,179
-Sir, wait.
-Yes.

783
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,890
Did you know
that Lee Dae-cheol filed for a retrial?

784
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:45,060
There's nothing he can't do
now that he's about to get executed.

785
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,312
He's just fighting for his life.

786
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,481
Wait, sir.

787
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,484
Did you also know that the evangelist
who recently committed suicide

788
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,194
claimed that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent?

789
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,947
That happened before
the order of execution was made.

790
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,616
So he might not be doing this
to avoid getting executed.

791
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,828
What matters is that he put on a show.
Where are you from?

792
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,664
Detective Kang, does that mean

793
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:09,167
you don't believe
what Lee Dae-cheol is saying?

794
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:13,213
What kind of detective would think
the guy he arrested is actually innocent?

795
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,548
I heard he filed for a retrial

796
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,716
because the investigation
was carried out poorly.

797
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,301
What do you think about that?

798
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,554
Let's say the police did a poor job.

799
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,598
But then, what about the judge
and prosecution?

800
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:28,019
They gave him a death sentence
because the evidence was loud and clear.

801
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:31,356
I'm busy, okay? Why the fuck are you here?

802
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,526
-Detective Kang.
-That asshole is just fucking around.

803
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,027
That damn bastard.

804
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,362
Stop filming me, you asshole!

805
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:41,992
Hey, why would you swear
in front of the camera?

806
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,995
That reporter got me all riled up.
Do you know what he said…

807
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:49,040
-My gosh.
-It looks like there's another reason.

808
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,334
The detective reacted
very sensitively to the issue.

809
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,962
Yes, you'll understand why

810
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,548
-once you watch the next interview.
-Okay.

811
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:00,719
It was very difficult, but we managed
to meet an acquaintance of the victim.

812
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,012
Let's take a look.

813
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:07,350
You were dating Yoon Ji-seon
five years ago before she died?

814
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,935
-Yes.
-After the incident,

815
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,478
did the cops investigate you?

816
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,647
No, not at all.

817
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,524
Didn't they even summon you
for a statement?

818
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,987
If you were the victim's boyfriend,
that would make you the key suspect.

819
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,530
Why didn't they investigate you?

820
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:24,576
I don't know. I'm sure they had a reason.
But it's still hard for me to understand.

821
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,913
Whatever the case,
do you think there was a problem

822
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,539
with the police investigation?

823
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:34,252
Yes, that's right.
I honestly don't trust the police.

824
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,503
As you can see,

825
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,048
-Who is that guy?
-he thinks the primary investigation…

826
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,800
-I don't know.
-Why don't you know?

827
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,678
I wasn't in charge
of carrying out the primary investigation

828
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,931
regarding Yoon Ji-seon's death.

829
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,476
The late Detective Jang Jin-su
and Captain Nam Guk-hyeon were in charge.

830
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,645
He even asked the reporter

831
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,689
to ask the police and prosecution
for a proper investigation

832
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,109
so that Yoon Ji-seon will be able
to rest in peace.

833
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,778
Will this change the judge's mind?

834
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,782
I looked into the judge who's in charge.
He won't be easy to convince.

835
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,118
His bar score and training institute
test results were in the top ten percent.

836
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:11,039
Judges live with their reputation
throughout their entire career.

837
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,000
He's too perfect. He won't listen to us.

838
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,628
I'm sure he'll listen to God.

839
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,507
The members of the Justice
and Peace Committee

840
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,258
of the Catholic Church

841
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,637
have gathered in front
of the Supreme Court

842
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,349
to hold a silent protest
for the abolishment of the death penalty

843
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,226
and the approval
of Lee Dae-cheol's retrial.

844
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,244
Hello, Chief Administrative Officer.
It's me.

845
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,623
I have a favor to ask.

846
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,334
Here's breaking news.

847
00:54:56,418 --> 00:55:00,171
Today at noon, the Supreme Court accepted
Lee Dae-cheol's request for a retrial

848
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,758
and asked the Seoul High Court
to carry out the procedure.

849
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,804
Many people are curious to see
how the first retrial will turn out

850
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,141
before the execution takes place
for the first time in 20 years.

851
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,729
Did you hear the news?

852
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,272
We just did the impossible.

853
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,983
Getting approval for a retrial isn't easy

854
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,776
especially when he's waiting
to get executed.

855
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,029
Detective Kang, you'd make a great actor.

856
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,281
Your acting wasn't awkward at all.

857
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,784
We're actually going to get a job
at a movie production company

858
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,286
once we're done with this.

859
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,495
Why me?

860
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,458
I noticed this time around
that you're great when it comes to fraud.

861
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,376
You can write scripts, and I'll act.

862
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,295
Don't you think it'll do great?

863
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,964
You can be the villain.
A villain who swears very well.

864
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,717
No, I won't be a good villain.
I'm fit to play a detective.

865
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,510
Many detectives are like villains.

866
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,222
Is that how you think of me?

867
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,809
No, I'm just talking about your looks.

868
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,520
What's wrong with how I look?

869
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,647
You're the one
who looks like a troublemaker.

870
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,566
You totally look like a con-artist.

871
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,443
Don't smile, you punk.

872
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:08,073
My gosh. We didn't win the trial yet.

873
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,365
This is just the beginning.

874
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,369
At least it's something.
Plus, the public seems to support us.

875
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,871
Isn't this a decent start?

876
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,248
If I were the judge in charge,

877
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,251
I wouldn't have accepted the retrial.

878
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,005
He just agreed to do it
due to the public sentiment.

879
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,509
The evidence we handed in isn't enough
even in my point of view.

880
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,511
We'll slowly--

881
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,221
You know we don't have time.

882
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,141
First, we need to decide
how we're going to prepare for the trial.

883
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:40,814
Instead of focusing on Detective Jang,
I'm going to focus more on Yoon Ji-seon.

884
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,274
If we can prove that he didn't kill her,

885
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,985
we can stop him from getting executed.

886
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,612
And most importantly,

887
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:51,783
we need to prove that the investigation
wasn't carried out properly back then.

888
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,953
We need to check everything the cops hid,
their irregularities, coercion,

889
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,288
and how that led to a poor investigation.

890
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,584
You're in full charge of that.

891
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,669
You know that, right?

892
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,421
I'll do everything I can.

893
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,965
We must win this case no matter what.

894
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,097
Did you also agree to this retrial?

895
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,516
They will announce
how the cabinet will be reshuffled soon.

896
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,727
I don't want to risk anything
as soon as my term begins.

897
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,688
I should get it over with before that.

898
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,525
The opposition party is already
getting ready for a hearing.

899
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,320
It's obvious that they'll raise an issue
about my relationship with Jong-tae.

900
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:35,535
You should meet him one more time
and make him promise to keep quiet.

901
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,580
To be honest,

902
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,623
I don't trust him.

903
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,376
Okay, I'll take care of it.

904
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,337
Just let me know what you want.

905
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,548
You just want me to stay quiet, right?

906
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,426
If you need me to do anything,

907
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,428
give me a script.

908
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,516
I'll memorize every single word
and say exactly what you ask me to say.

909
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,394
I'll let you know once there's a hearing.

910
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,190
By any chance, did Assemblyman Yoo

911
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,776
take part in making a decision
for the retrial?

912
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,362
Why do you want to know?

913
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,239
I'm just curious.

914
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,367
The justice department made that decision
due to the public sentiment.

915
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,458
I feel like someone powerful
must've given some advice.

916
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,670
The current Minister of Justice
doesn't have a lot of power left.

917
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:32,592
Assemblyman Yoo Jeong-ryeol
probably has a lot more power right now.

918
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,512
So the person who had enough power
to make that decision would be…

919
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,184
I don't understand
why you're so curious about that.

920
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,853
But I know one thing for sure.

921
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:49,234
The person must be closed by the one
who opened it.

922
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,324
Anyway, let's do what we can
for each other

923
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,494
and make sure we don't cause any harm.

924
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,335
I don't get it.

925
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,922
How could they accept
his request for a retrial?

926
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,176
Who's behind Lee Dae-cheol?

927
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,053
I don't know.

928
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,889
I'm quite curious myself.

929
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,892
That guy has absolutely nothing.

930
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,438
It looks like he wrote letters
to lots of different people in jail.

931
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,316
That's probably why the Catholic Church
is holding a protest.

932
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,237
Now that the court has decided
to hold a retrial,

933
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,823
there's nothing we can do to turn it back.

934
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:41,578
Us three are the only ones
who were involved in Lee Dae-cheol's case.

935
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,163
I can take care of myself.

936
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,042
Meanwhile, I want you guys
to make sure you keep your mouths shut.

937
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,546
No matter how much a reporter follows you,
don't let them interview you.

938
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:56,718
If the lawyer asks you for evidence,
don't give them anything.

939
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,636
There's nothing left anyway.

940
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,557
The court might summon you.
Don't even think of going there.

941
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,476
You won't be breaking any laws
by not going. Do you understand?

942
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,103
Yes, sir.

943
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,439
If

944
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,567
the retrial doesn't go well,

945
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:17,155
everyone who was involved in the case
will get destroyed like dominos.

946
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,616
We'll all go down. All of us.

947
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,867
Right.

948
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,077
I know.

949
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,295
What a headache.

950
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,215
But of course,
I'm sure it's worse for you.

951
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,801
Why don't we go for a drink?

952
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,512
No, I'm not in the mood for a drink.

953
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,016
Have you visited Lee Dae-cheol recently?

954
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,519
-Why would I go there?
-You're close with Lee Eun-hye.

955
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,314
Has she ever asked you

956
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,650
to save her dad saying he's innocent?

957
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,989
You punk. Why are you asking me that?

958
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,534
Why are you so agitated?

959
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,205
What's going on?
Did she really ask you for help?

960
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:17,590
Captain Nam, I joined the force
earlier than you.

961
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,427
But you're a lot more successful
than I am.

962
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,974
Don't be bothered by a guy like me.

963
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,353
Once the retrial begins,
you'll get pulled into a mess

964
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,731
regardless of the result.

965
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,525
Just have pity on the kid

966
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,153
and stay quiet.

967
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,489
You're good at that.

968
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,741
And one more thing.

969
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,994
If you mess with a guy like me
who has nothing to lose…

970
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,415
You should watch how you behave.

971
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,917
You have no idea what I might do.

972
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,306
Gosh, how scary.

973
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,357
Why are you guys still at the office?

974
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,862
Do-chang, what did Chief Moon say?

975
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,698
Does he know you're behind all this?

976
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,117
Pretend you know nothing.
Don't show that you know anything.

977
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,994
If I ever need your help,

978
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,246
I'll let you know.

979
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,999
So if the chief asks,
tell him you don't know anything.

980
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,877
You guys should go home. I'll leave later.

981
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,421
You should also go home.
I need to do something on my own.

982
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,506
Okay.

983
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:53,060
Lee Dae-cheol's retrial was possible
thanks to Do-chang and Ji-hyeok, right?

984
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,896
Yes.

985
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,815
I'm so impressed by Do-chang.

986
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,567
What's there to be impressed about?

987
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,404
What good will it do for him
if Lee Dae-cheol wins the trial?

988
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,198
He'll just get hated by his superiors.

989
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,617
Do-chang feels embarrassed. That's why.

990
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,994
If he doesn't do anything,
he'll feel embarrassed forever.

991
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,164
That's why he's doing this.
I know how he feels.

992
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,876
I was very close
to humiliating myself as well,

993
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,669
but Do-chang helped me come to my senses.

994
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,214
And for the first time in my life,

995
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,633
I realized why I need to be a detective.

996
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:27,929
Don't you think this is Do-chang's way
of sending us a message?

997
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,472
"This is what it means to be a cop.

998
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:32,600
This is how you should live."

999
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,562
I think I said something
really cool just now.

1000
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,981
Don't you agree?

1001
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,149
-Yes.
-Yes.

1002
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,901
I'm impressed.

1003
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,112
You little… Come here.

1004
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:04,382
MURDER OF YOON JI-SEON AND JANG JIN-SU
LEE DAE-CHEOL'S INTERROGATION REPORT

1005
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,178
KANG DO-CHANG

1006
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,529
Sir.

1007
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,657
Detective Kang.

1008
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,097
Just kill me.

1009
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,850
Why did you get my daughter involved? Why?

1010
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,476
Tell me what you did wrong in detail.

1011
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,062
I'll tell you at the police station.

1012
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,607
Why would we go there?
This is a crime scene.

1013
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,151
Did you find anything else
to prove that Oh Jong-tae is the culprit?

1014
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,904
-Did Mr. Yoo ask you to find out?
-He's not that kind of a guy.

1015
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,157
Have they found any evidence
that would make them suspect you?

1016
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,742
You must've been in a hurry.

1017
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,577
I admit that I crossed the centerline!

1018
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,204
But I won't ever be going to court.

1019
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,874
So what he's a detective?
Is it that important?

1020
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,169
Your brother is a detective, okay?

1021
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,879
Look at yourself.

1022
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,673
Who do you think is
living in a mess right now?

1023
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,508
Eun-hye asked me for help.

1024
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,344
You must stay alive, Lee Dae-cheol.

1025
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:37,516
