00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,505
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,488
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,076
"Kill Jung Hui-ju."

4
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,165
"I will give you enough
for generations to come."

5
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,584
"Just kill her."

6
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,967
"Mr. Choi will take care of the rest."

7
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,636
"All you need to do, Gi Dong-jae,

8
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,098
is to kill her."

9
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,810
"Got it?"

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,285
So who said that?

11
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,790
Don't you remember?

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,916
Me?

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,210
I said that?

14
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,713
Do you remember
talking to Gi Dong-jae over the phone…

15
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,383
after you talked to
Jung Hui-ju in your office?

16
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,471
Gi Dong-jae's call history

17
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,725
and the call history
of your burner phone match up.

18
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,312
At that time,
you and Gi Dong-jae talked on the phone.

19
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,442
The world is a scary place.

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,779
If all of you gang up on me,

21
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:57,450
it's so easy to frame
a person as the killer.

22
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,828
But I'm curious.

23
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:06,292
Why show such an important card now,
in front of me?

24
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,844
They usually confess
when presented with so much evidence.

25
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,221
If the killer…

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,225
feels even an ounce of guilt.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,812
Do I seem that easy to you?

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,523
Do I?

29
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,650
Because…

30
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,823
I answer each and every question
you ask without resistance,

31
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,537
do I seem like the gangsters
that you usually deal with?

32
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,831
You're no different from those gangsters.

33
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,667
You're the same.

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,170
You must understand.

35
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,381
He can't stand young pricks

36
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,967
being disrespectful to him.

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,440
JUSTICE IN KOREA

38
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,612
Can't you even control those detectives?

39
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,531
Why do I have to be humiliated by them?

40
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,782
I am very sorry.

41
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,869
I didn't expect them to be like that.

42
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,746
"Didn't expect" my ass.

43
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,257
Those detectives…

44
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,677
I think they pissed me off on purpose.

45
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,601
They're hiding something.

46
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,395
-Find out what that is.
-Yes, sir.

47
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,023
-Close it.
-Yes, sir.

48
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,543
I will give you enough
for generations to come.

49
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,628
Kill that bitch!

50
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,631
"I will give you enough
for generations to come."

51
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,925
"Kill that bitch."

52
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,053
That asshole heard it.

53
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,309
Yes, Chairman.

54
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,019
Contact the security team.

55
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,397
Tell all of them to come
to my office right away.

56
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,375
You must hate us.

57
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,004
You wouldn't be here if it weren't for us.

58
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,841
When you're transferred to Prosecution
tomorrow, tell the prosecutor.

59
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,052
Tell him not to believe a word
of Violent Crimes Unit Team 2 lunatics.

60
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,014
Tell him what Cheon Sang-woo
said today is all true.

61
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,016
The prosecutor will love that.

62
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,476
He is very savvy about the world.

63
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,939
If you keep denying
your relationship with Cheon Sang-woo,

64
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,692
we have to give up Cheon Sang-woo.

65
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,237
We are the only ones you can trust.

66
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,199
Oh Ji-hyeok,
about that conversation you heard

67
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,369
between the Chairman and Gi Dong-jae,

68
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,955
has it really been recorded?

69
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,083
-Yes.
-Yeah?

70
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,838
If that is used
at the trial for evidence,…

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,635
Then I guess I will have to admit it.

72
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,681
But you will keep
your mouth shut until then?

73
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,727
I'm sure you know
as a long-time detective,

74
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,189
No matter how much evidence
the detectives find and present,

75
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,775
if the prosecutor doesn't accept
it, it's useless.

76
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,235
As you said, would a savvy prosecutor

77
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,904
accept that?

78
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,740
You know what the prosecutor would say.

79
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,451
There is…

80
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,245
insufficient evidence.

81
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,877
There has to be a bug
or a hidden camera in here.

82
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,504
Search thoroughly.

83
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,671
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,590
Thoroughly.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,467
You should have kept him longer.
There wasn't enough time.

86
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,803
Did you remove the hidden camera?

87
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,680
It's a shame.

88
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,807
It was great for passing the time.

89
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,308
I got a lot out of it.

90
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,145
It's illegal.
You're lucky I didn't call it in.

91
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,984
Are you going to eat by yourself?

92
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,205
Cheon Na-na. It's you, isn't it?

93
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,127
It's you, isn't it? You bitch!

94
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,718
I already told you.

95
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,097
It will never be you.

96
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,433
You can never beat me.

97
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,729
Never.

98
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,442
Never!

99
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,113
I'm so full.

100
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,617
How was meeting my brother in person?

101
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,951
Is he easy to deal with?

102
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,121
He was a bigger jerk than I thought.

103
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,293
That's a good attitude to have
to deal with him.

104
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,839
Give me the video.

105
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,092
It won't be useful in court anyway.
I will make sure not to leak it.

106
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,263
We have to bring
the prosecutor onto our side.

107
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,725
He will only come to our side
if he sees the video with his own eyes.

108
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,686
What video are you talking about?

109
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,732
We don't have much time.

110
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,318
If we don't end it swiftly,
we don't have a chance to win this game.

111
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,987
That video will be the shortcut.

112
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,490
Detective Oh, you can do it.

113
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,495
I should go to convenience stores
and have instant cup noodles.

114
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,622
It tastes so much better here.

115
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,165
I will go.

116
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,151
You retired after serving as the leader
of Seoul Criminal Investigation Division

117
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,278
Yes.

118
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,115
Then I won't have to explain.
Take a look at it yourself.

119
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,118
Tell me if you see
anything missing as you read it over.

120
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,706
It seems to me that all the evidence
necessary for the trial is there.

121
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,501
The only flaw is the missing interrogation
report of the killer, Gi Dong-jae.

122
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,088
But you can't interrogate a person
who is already dead.

123
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,718
Yes. I think you can
go ahead with the trial as is.

124
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,388
Do you have anything
you would like to add?

125
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,472
I have none.

126
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,061
So we will say that you admit conspiring
to murder Jung Hui-ju.

127
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,105
Will that be okay?

128
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,024
Prosecutor Cha…

129
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,153
Have you met with a lawyer from TJ?

130
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,073
I'm sure you got
a lot of calls from here and there.

131
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,327
I think there was a lot of discussion
about your future as well.

132
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,997
In my opinion,

133
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,999
the most important thing will be

134
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,544
what kind of agreement
you and I can make about this trial.

135
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,258
Agreement? What kind of agreement?

136
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,595
Cutting off the tail.
Yes, I will admit it.

137
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,015
But don't lock away
that tail for too long.

138
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,600
If we can agree on the duration,

139
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,228
I will keep my mouth shut
about the main body.

140
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,274
You must have done a lot
of backdoor deals as a detective.

141
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,693
You are an expert at it.

142
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,155
I can take stuff out
without making it obvious.

143
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,159
Okay.

144
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,663
I will take care of it without shaming
myself as a prosecutor.

145
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,125
You are the only family
of the deceased, Jung Hui-ju.

146
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,877
Yes.

147
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,130
She was…

148
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,759
I raised her since she was young.

149
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,094
No…

150
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,391
I didn't raise her. She raised me.

151
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,143
She gave me a reason to breathe

152
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,937
and eat.

153
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,858
This case was
completely turned around in the middle.

154
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,945
The families must have suffered greatly.
Is that right?

155
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,656
Yes.

156
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,283
I think we're almost at the end now.

157
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:48,707
I am grateful to everyone
who worked so hard until now.

158
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,129
Your granddaughter's killer
has been found. His name is Gi Dong-jae.

159
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,256
He is currently missing.

160
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,842
We believe he may have been killed.

161
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,679
You can say
he's been punished for his deeds.

162
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,638
Yes.

163
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,392
There is a co-conspirator of the murder.

164
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,310
His name is Choi Yong-geun.

165
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,771
We found out
that he ordered Gi Dong-jae to kill.

166
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,731
Yes, I know that.

167
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,111
Choi Yong-geun will be put on trial
and punished by law.

168
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,866
I hope that avenges
your granddaughter's untimely death.

169
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,995
I hope you can let go of the frustration
you have been feeling up to now.

170
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,123
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. Thank you.

171
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,087
So, if the bereaved family
will accept this situation,

172
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,590
we'll go to trial
with Gi Dong-jae and Choi Yong-geun

173
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,300
as the principal offenders.

174
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,802
Do you have any complaints?

175
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,637
Well…

176
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,515
Does Detective Kang Do-chang

177
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,728
agree with you?

178
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,482
Well, I guess so.

179
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,902
Then what you're saying is true.

180
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,947
I guess you trust
Detective Kang Do-chang a lot.

181
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,616
Yes.

182
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,453
Who else would listen
to an old man like me?

183
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,871
Everybody looked away.

184
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:14,335
But Detective Kang listened to me.

185
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:19,423
Even when he was busy, he took the time
to console and comfort me.

186
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:26,597
If Detective Kang trusts you,
I will trust and follow you as well.

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,183
I see.

188
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,105
I heard the great TJ Group's Chairman

189
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,857
visited our police station.

190
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,569
You should've immediately reported
such an occasion to me.

191
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,739
Yes, I was about to tell you…

192
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,823
How did you know?

193
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,409
We controlled his visit
so the media wouldn't find out.

194
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,577
Let's say,

195
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,665
a patrol officer on a lonely island
in the Yellow Sea pees into the ocean.

196
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,835
The police at the Seoul main office
will hold a meeting the very next day,

197
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,214
Saying an officer on a lonely island
committed a misdemeanor.

198
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,882
That's how it works around here.

199
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,175
Then…

200
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,302
do they know already up there?

201
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,554
Of course they know.

202
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,643
Chief,

203
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,021
you will get calls from above
pressuring you anyway.

204
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,815
Isn't it obvious?

205
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,026
They want us to stop
investigating Cheon Sang-woo.

206
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,613
It's best to avoid them for now.

207
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,246
-You did well.
-These are loan company calls.

208
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,915
Aren't they amazing?

209
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,168
They know that I'll be fired already.

210
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,171
They are trying to secure a customer.

211
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,425
They are practically psychic.

212
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,053
I wish the higher officials would call me.

213
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,472
But I only get these calls all day long.

214
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,974
Do you know why?

215
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,310
I went to a class reunion yesterday.

216
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,687
But they treated me like I was invisible.

217
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,275
Nobody filled my glass when it was empty.

218
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,195
There were fifteen guys at the reunion.

219
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,906
But I drank alone.

220
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,532
Do you know why?

221
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,702
Come in.

222
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,748
Chief, the main office called.

223
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,460
The commissioner's inspection
this week is postponed indefinitely.

224
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,838
I see. Okay.

225
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,721
Kwon Jae-hong, the fastest
and the most quick-witted at our station,

226
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,643
why don't you summarize
my current situation?

227
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,939
-You are ostracized.
-A sign of being ostracized.

228
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,401
Even if you get beat up
and crack open your skull,

229
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,863
nobody cares.

230
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,992
The organization of police
that you had so much faith in,

231
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,495
seems to have abandoned you.

232
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,121
Even me.

233
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,512
You have to see the star to pluck it.

234
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,722
It just keeps getting darker.

235
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,644
Young police officer!

236
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,187
Damn.

237
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,397
What is this?

238
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,359
The country needs…

239
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,195
Hello?

240
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,697
Yes.

241
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,199
Okay, thank you. I will be right there.

242
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,325
Bye.

243
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,953
I just got a call from the accountant.

244
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,330
He found suspicious funds
coming into Gi's company.

245
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,415
Let's go.

246
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,209
-I told you we would find something there.
-Yes, good job.

247
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,753
We'll visit the accountant
to verify the document.

248
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,422
Ji-ung and Man-gu,

249
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,756
Go to Gi Dong-jae's company

250
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,967
and confiscate all documents, okay?

251
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,884
We're off.

252
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,845
We don't even have a warrant.

253
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,972
What do you expect?
The police abandoned us.

254
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,057
We have no choice but to push through.

255
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,475
We'll be back.

256
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,227
Who needs a warrant for gangsters?

257
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,647
I think we might be getting
too intimate with them.

258
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,649
-Yes, Prosecutor Cha.
-We get physical with them too often.

259
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,650
What?

260
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,610
I see. Okay.

261
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,864
Prosecutor Cha wants to see us.

262
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,240
-Let's hurry.
-Why?

263
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,202
-He wants to have a drink.
-All of a sudden?

264
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,912
He wants to meet us man-to-man.

265
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,875
Don't you get a feeling
that things will work out well?

266
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,126
Bye.

267
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,003
Salute.

268
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,555
There it is.

269
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,473
A star.

270
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,975
It's a little dim, but…

271
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,603
You wait right there.

272
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,452
Eun-hui.

273
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,954
Mr. Jung wants
another chicken delivered later.

274
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,040
He says he's having a drink
with his friends.

275
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,250
Really? What's come over him?

276
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,419
He ate the one I brought all by himself.

277
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,588
That is so great.

278
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,423
He must be getting his appetite back.

279
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,219
-Let's fry one up right away.
-He is very excited.

280
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,387
I'm so happy, too.

281
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,890
But why all of a sudden?
What happened today?

282
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,600
He met a prosecutor today,

283
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,478
and he said that he'll
bring Hui-ju's killer to justice.

284
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,564
That's so great.
That prosecutor must be a decent man.

285
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,942
Apparently, he's an incredibly nice guy.

286
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,194
Isn't that great?

287
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,989
How did you get here so early?

288
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,324
Hello, Prosecutor Cha.

289
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,826
Have a seat.

290
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,077
Is soju with beer okay?

291
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,287
-Yes, I will pour it for you.
-No, it's okay.

292
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,330
I can do it well.

293
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,542
The only skill I gained as a prosecutor
was mixing soju and beer.

294
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,001
Did you order the chicken?

295
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,837
-Not yet.
-Eun-hui.

296
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,506
Give us the pepper mayonnaise, boneless.

297
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,133
And we don't know what sauce he likes,

298
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,844
So spicy mustard,
pepper mayonnaise, pepper hot sauce…

299
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,095
Give us all of them.

300
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,221
Okay.

301
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,224
You must be a regular.
You know the menu by heart.

302
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,976
It's my sister's shop.

303
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,352
No wonder.

304
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,604
It's your family's restaurant.

305
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,523
Who is the employee?

306
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,734
She's not an employee.

307
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
She's my daughter.

308
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,114
-We seem to be out of beer.
-I will bring more.

309
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,532
Would two bottles be enough?

310
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,286
And there's something special
that I only eat when I have ramyeon.

311
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,745
I'll bring you some of it.

312
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,461
Earlier, I saw the girl call
the owner by her name.

313
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,338
Shouldn't she call her "Aunt"?

314
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,593
She's not his actual daughter,
but he's raising her like his own.

315
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,306
Is that so? Why would a bachelor do that?

316
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,558
Well, that's…

317
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,353
He's not raising
a victim's daughter, is he?

318
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,356
Is he doing that out of pity?

319
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,858
Yes, he is.

320
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,737
He thinks her dad died because of him.

321
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,781
Is she the daughter
of Lee Dae-cheol, who was executed?

322
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,830
My goodness.

323
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,833
Eun-hye,

324
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,294
Why are you doing deliveries?

325
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,837
It's not a delivery. It's for Mr. Jung.

326
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,298
Is that right? Okay. Be careful.

327
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,383
Tell Mr. Jung I said hello.

328
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,093
Okay. I'll be back.

329
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,388
There.

330
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,598
While I was at it,

331
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,976
I grabbed one more bottle of soju.

332
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,896
I saw the ratio of soju and beer
you were making before

333
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,814
and thought we would go through it fast.

334
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,399
And here it is.

335
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,152
The special mustard leaf kimchi
for when I eat ramyeon.

336
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,240
It's not ripe yet, but its pungent taste
is rather addicting.

337
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,407
Yes.

338
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,327
It's pungent…

339
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,290
You're driving me insane.

340
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,423
-I thought you were having soju and beer.
-A detective…

341
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,260
should keep a distance
from the victim's family.

342
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,637
So you can conduct
an objective investigation.

343
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,721
Am I wrong?

344
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,432
-No, you're right.
-Then why?

345
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,520
Then why are you personally
accommodating Jung Hui-ju's grandfather?

346
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,731
Why are you sending
free chicken to the old man?

347
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,319
You're causing the victim's family
to develop a stereotype about detectives!

348
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,780
How can you conduct
a fair investigation like that?

349
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,742
Yes, that's my bad.

350
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,703
-But…
-You don't even get paid that much.

351
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,748
And you are raising a victim's daughter.

352
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,751
You ran out on your own wedding
to catch a perp

353
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,838
and got your wedding called off.

354
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,047
For what?

355
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,925
You should stick to doing your job.

356
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,344
Why are you stirring things up?

357
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,523
Damn it.

358
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,816
"Damn it"?

359
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,736
-Is that how you talk to a prosecutor?
-Please understand.

360
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:05,615
He hates it when young pricks
are disrespectful to him.

361
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,617
-What?
-Hey.

362
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,911
Do you think I want to live like this?

363
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,330
I was a thug, too.

364
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,458
I used to be a thug
who beats up innocent people.

365
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,961
But what can I do? Life has changed me.

366
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
I don't want to live like this either!

367
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,257
It's not too late!

368
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,344
-Live like I do.
-What?

369
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,472
Get on the side of the rich.

370
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,475
Just switch sides.

371
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,936
Buy a house in Gangnam.

372
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,482
Send your kids to study abroad,
and get yourself a pretty girlfriend!

373
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,068
Why are you dragging
an innocent person like me

374
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,905
into your dingy life?

375
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,455
You have nothing to show for yourself.

376
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,878
Prosecutor Cha,

377
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,298
the reason you wanted to see us…

378
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,553
I forgot because you pissed me off.

379
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,805
Good night.

380
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,645
What's wrong with him?
Did I do something wrong?

381
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,523
-No, not at all.
-Then why did he lose his shit?

382
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,735
As you said, something feels right.
Things will turn out well.

383
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,779
What are you talking about?
It's even worse.

384
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,574
Hey, are the kids asleep?

385
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,994
Okay, I'm done here.

386
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,996
I'll be in soon.

387
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,914
Bye.

388
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,500
-Would you like some coffee?
-Sure.

389
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,087
Your face looks bright these days.

390
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,673
Do you have a new man?

391
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,550
Asshole.

392
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,442
What do you think will happen to
Team Leader Choi Yong-geun?

393
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,112
That's giving me a headache.
Now that you mention it,

394
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,865
can you get him out of it?

395
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,783
I don't have that kind of power.

396
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,786
Are you okay?

397
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,664
The media seems to want to make
a bigger deal out of it.

398
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,293
It won't affect me,
as long as you stay quiet.

399
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,464
But you must be disappointed.

400
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,842
If Woo Tae-ho were alive and by our side,

401
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,261
you two would have ruled the world.

402
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,554
Right?

403
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,560
I guess you were really afraid of Tae-ho.

404
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:23,855
A bit.

405
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,108
But that was your intention.

406
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,152
What was the reason you brought Tae-ho?

407
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,404
Wasn't it so that I would be afraid?

408
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,115
Okay, a bit more.

409
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:42,332
I thought you wouldn't love…

410
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,252
wouldn't love Tae-ho.

411
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,128
Because…

412
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,258
He was just a means to achieve your goals.

413
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,636
Then what happened?

414
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,848
How could you get jealous
when you didn't love him?

415
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,142
I thought you knew me well.

416
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,479
Do you think I am capable
of feeling things like that?

417
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,564
You never had feelings?

418
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,649
I see.

419
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,651
So you developed feelings you didn't have?

420
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,533
Did seeing him fool around
with another bitch in the office

421
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,327
make you burn inside?

422
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,162
That can happen.

423
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,957
Shoot.

424
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,043
Why couldn't I be clever like Tae-ho?

425
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,674
For me…if someone stabs me,

426
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,176
I stab them back.

427
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,345
I'm such a loser.

428
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,600
I should drink some.

429
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,148
Thanks for the coffee.

430
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,617
Na-na.

431
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,497
You killed Woo Tae-ho, didn't you?

432
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,094
CONTENTS OF CHEON SANG-WOO VIDEO

433
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,389
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHOEMAKER GRANDFATHER?
HE SEEMED PRETTY FRAIL

434
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,559
Yes.

435
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,104
Hello.

436
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,275
-Prosecutor Cha, how are you?
-Yes, have a seat.

437
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,120
I read the report Detective Oh emailed me.

438
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,079
Yes.

439
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,456
You have a great memory.

440
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,041
You saw it just once.
How did you memorize it?

441
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,795
He failed all other subjects
on the police academy exam,

442
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,839
but he scored perfectly on memorization.

443
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,342
He went to the police academy
with his memorization skills.

444
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,469
You have a killer memory.

445
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,554
The entrance exam

446
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,515
-doesn't have many memorization questions.
-Is that right?

447
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,768
There's no other reason.
It's because my job is being a detective.

448
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:53,273
Any detective would have remembered
everything if they saw a video like that.

449
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,400
That's right. I would have done the same.

450
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,901
Because we're detectives.

451
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,695
You said there's no recorded footage.

452
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:02,198
No. It was recorded illegally
so it will be difficult to get it.

453
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,288
Let's arrest Cheon Sang-woo
for conspiring to murder.

454
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,165
What?

455
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,792
It aligns with the murder motive
you submitted earlier.

456
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,421
The phone call with Gi Dong-jae
has already been verified.

457
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,382
In the document you sent earlier,

458
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,969
there is enough to prove that there was
an exchange of favor and money.

459
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,306
I think we can at least get a warrant.

460
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,142
If it's an ordinary person, it's possible.

461
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,311
But a chairman of a major conglomerate…

462
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,688
And the moment you claim a warrant,

463
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,399
isn't a new prosecutor coming
instead of you?

464
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,152
So…

465
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,071
I have two sons.

466
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:46,117
They have no idea
what a great prosecutor I am.

467
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:51,164
I want to take this opportunity
to show them how great their dad is.

468
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,585
Here he comes!

469
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,130
Did you request an arrest warrant
for Cheon Sang-woo?

470
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,340
Yes, I did.

471
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,218
-Is the charge conspiracy to murder?
-Yes, it is.

472
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,596
Some say it is just theatrics
to cut off the tail.

473
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,722
Is it true?

474
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,683
No, it's not.

475
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,143
Has the arrest warrant been issued?

476
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,020
I believe it is still in review.

477
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,105
Was it your decision to request a warrant?

478
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,775
Or is it a decision
of the entire Prosecution Service?

479
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,737
Requesting an arrest warrant
is a decision of the prosecutor.

480
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,281
If the Prosecution
has a different view than your own,

481
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,243
isn't it possible
for a new prosecutor to be appointed?

482
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:35,291
The Prosecution Service does not
cave in so easily to external pressure.

483
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,045
We won't be swayed by such nonsense.

484
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,965
Are you saying there was
no external pressure or interference?

485
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,717
It seems like you are prejudiced.

486
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,719
Let me be clear today.

487
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,223
There was no external pressure
regarding this case.

488
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,934
Nobody will exclude
investigators from the investigation

489
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,437
and replace prosecutors
for not listening to them.

490
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,233
Who would stoop so low
in this day and age?

491
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,442
Let's wrap it up.

492
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,695
-Excuse me.
-Are you sure there's no pressure?

493
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,488
-How do you feel?
-What will come next?

494
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,375
SEVEN UNREAD MESSAGES

495
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,502
PROSECUTOR CHA, CHEON SANG-WOO'S
ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED

496
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,297
Yes!

497
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,561
This is Cha Mun-ho of the Incheon District
Prosecution Service Criminal Department.

498
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,271
It's me, the Prosecutor General.

499
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,608
-Yes, Prosecutor General.
-What's your intention?

500
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,029
I don't have a specific intention.

501
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,239
Do you have political ambitions?

502
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,201
Do you want to cause an uproar
and play with the big boys?

503
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,996
I didn't think that far.

504
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,748
You don't deny it, though.

505
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,750
That's not bad.

506
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,753
Sometimes we need
a bullheaded person like you.

507
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,047
Yes, we do.

508
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,007
Do your best.

509
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,301
If you win, I'll support you
as our star player.

510
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,679
If you lose,
you will leave without regret.

511
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,724
Yes, sir. I will do my absolute best.

512
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,559
Goodbye.

513
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,612
It's Cha Mun-ho.

514
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,823
We have a warrant for Cheon Sang-woo.

515
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,241
Go arrest him!

516
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,415
Do you admit to the charges?

517
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,542
The police say they have evidence.
What kind of evidence is it?

518
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,504
You denied the allegations to the police.
Do you still deny it?

519
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,132
How do you think it will affect
the TJ group if you are found guilty?

520
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,342
Chairman, please go inside. Security!

521
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,927
The former Chairman Cheon Seong-dae
is also in custody.

522
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,012
Now you are
also being subjected to a trial.

523
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,514
How do you feel about that?

524
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:58,351
-Please keep your distance.
-What is your response?

525
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,229
-Do you admit to the charges?
-Please give us an answer.

526
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,189
Do you agree with the charges?

527
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,280
I'm scared.

528
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,827
What if the truth is not revealed again?

529
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,079
What if…

530
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:22,291
the reason for Hui-ju's murder
is never revealed until the day I die?

531
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,629
You have to survive until it does.

532
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,922
I'm too exhausted.

533
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,634
Maybe I'm holding on for no reason.

534
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,805
Nothing matters if I die.

535
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,436
Right before he died,

536
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,753
my dad looked at me and smiled.

537
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,798
If I get to see my dad again,
I will smile for him, too.

538
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,802
When you meet Hui-ju, smile for her.

539
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,430
Tell her that everything was made right

540
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,058
so she can stop being sad.

541
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,438
Yes, I should smile.

542
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,941
I have to smile when I see Hui-ju again.

543
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,112
I lived my whole life smiling
because of Hui-ju.

544
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,785
You reminded this old man
of the reason I should live on.

545
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,704
Thank you, Eun-hye.

546
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,214
DEFENDANT

547
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:55,176
Defendant.
Did you order Gi Dong-jae to kill?

548
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:01,766
You sent Gi Dong-jae
pictures of the serial murder scenes.

549
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,851
When disposing of Jung Hui-ju's body,

550
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,645
you provided advice over the phone.

551
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,063
Do you admit that?

552
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,524
Yes.

553
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,401
Does that mean you admit
the charge of abetting murder?

554
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,655
Or are you saying it was someone else,

555
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,408
and you only aided the disposal
of the body?

556
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,161
If that is the case,

557
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,208
do you know who ordered the murder

558
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,001
to Gi Dong-jae?

559
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,796
Gi Dong-jae never told me
anything about it.

560
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:36,509
I think he told me
that he killed someone by mistake.

561
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,470
So there is no other conspirator,

562
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,305
and Gi Dong-jae acted alone?

563
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,016
Yes, as far as I know.

564
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,604
When you spoke with
Gi Dong-jae on the phone,

565
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,439
he said,
"What about Jung Hui-ju's corpse?"

566
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,900
and asked specifically by her name.

567
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,989
Jung Hui-ju worked
on the same team as the defendant.

568
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,490
When Jung Hui-ju was murdered,

569
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,035
he never asked why she was killed.

570
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,997
He believed Gi Dong-jae
when he claimed he killed her by accident.

571
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,209
Yes. I just thought it was a coincidence.

572
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,256
After Gi Dong-jae killed Jung Hui-ju,

573
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,385
a subcontract payment of two billion won
was paid to Gi Dong-jae's company.

574
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,723
But there is no evidence
of any product being delivered to TJ.

575
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:28,227
It is speculated that the two billion won
was the price of the contract murder.

576
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,606
Defendant.

577
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,944
If Gi Dong-jae asked for your advice,

578
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,781
shouldn't Gi Dong-jae pay you instead?

579
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,327
I worked for the legal team.

580
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,871
Such a transaction had
nothing to do with me.

581
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,456
Nothing to do with you?

582
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:55,087
That means one of your bosses
made the decision to pay him.

583
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,717
Someone higher than the defendant
gave the money to Gi Dong-jae.

584
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,928
-Isn't that true?
-Your Honor.

585
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,512
The prosecution is pressing him

586
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,724
to testify by making
the contract murder a standard fact.

587
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,060
The contract murder is just an assumption.

588
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,981
The prosecution's argument
that it was a contract murder

589
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,485
makes more sense than the claim
that the murder was accidental.

590
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,280
The prosecution may continue
to examine the defendant.

591
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,245
If you continue…

592
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,624
to deny the existence
of the co-conspirator,

593
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,962
you will be the sole abettor
of Jung Hui-ju's murder.

594
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,464
No further questions.

595
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,133
Defendant Choi Yong-geun,

596
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,388
can it be accepted that there is
no objection to the prosecutor's argument?

597
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,807
Your Honor…

598
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,142
I am not the conspirator.

599
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,728
Then say there is another conspirator!

600
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,188
I wish I knew.

601
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,857
Then my charges will be dropped.

602
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,067
Then Defendant,

603
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:04,740
do you agree that this case
is a contract murder?

604
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,668
Yes, it seems it is.

605
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,670
DEFENSE COUNSEL

606
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,181
Witness.

607
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,228
Have you seen either one of them before?

608
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,897
Yes, I have.

609
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,733
Who is it?

610
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,863
It's that man.

611
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,242
You said you saw him before
your granddaughter was murdered.

612
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,287
For what reason did you see him?

613
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,913
He came to my shop.

614
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,751
At first, I thought he came to buy shoes.

615
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:02,298
But he knew who Hui-ju was
and pretended not to know her.

616
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,134
What did he say?

617
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,722
He said she should watch out for men
because she was too beautiful.

618
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,850
You said you saw
the defendant again after that occasion,

619
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,727
at the TJ Group's main office building.

620
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,104
What did the defendant tell you then?

621
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,316
That Hui-ju…

622
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,153
latched herself onto a rich married man

623
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,782
and called her a parasite.

624
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,243
He said the heavens punished her.

625
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,002
Defendant Cheon Sang-woo said
in his testimony,

626
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,671
that he hardly knew Jung Hui-ju

627
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,925
and only remembered her
as an employee of the legal team.

628
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,219
No further questions.

629
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,139
The defense counsel may
cross-examine the witness.

630
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,601
The defense has no questions.

631
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,777
Don't we have the lead to some extent?

632
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,153
We haven't taken the lead.

633
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,781
They are pretending to be losing.

634
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:13,119
Their legal team comprises
all-star lawyers.

635
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,996
They're holding their cards close.
They don't want to give us enough time.

636
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,333
They will reveal everything
during the second and third hearings.

637
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,210
So we have to prepare thoroughly.

638
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,466
Can we call Kim Min-ji to the trial?

639
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,386
Don't we have the recorded file?

640
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,388
-We can play that in--
-No.

641
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,808
She has to come in person and explain
the circumstances of the recording.

642
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,103
That way the evidence
has strong admissibility.

643
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,690
She is the critical witness
who can verify Cheon Sang-woo's motive.

644
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,443
We must bring her in.

645
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,864
Will Kim Min-ji do it?

646
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,073
I will call her and try.

647
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,118
But don't get your hopes up.

648
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,165
As you said, the police pushed you
during the interrogation for a reason.

649
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,835
I verified that Choi Yong-geun

650
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,838
was released for interrogation
when you visited the police.

651
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:10,634
They let Choi Yong-geun
directly observe your testimony.

652
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,306
That is why Choi Yong-geun showed
an ambiguous attitude at the trial.

653
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,602
He will continue to play the observer.

654
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,272
We should disregard
Team Leader Choi Yong-geun as an ally.

655
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,946
Starting from the second hearing,
we have to turn the trial in our favor.

656
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,199
That way,
Choi Yong-geun will also come around.

657
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,409
What is the opinion of the legal team?

658
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,579
There are still many variables
so there isn't a final opinion yet.

659
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,247
The most important variable will be…

660
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,792
whether Kim Min-ji appears
in court or not.

661
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,630
You have to stop her.

662
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,939
Hey.

663
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,069
Why aren't you answering my calls?

664
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,403
Daddy!

665
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,365
Su-yeon…

666
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,534
Daddy.

667
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,869
Now…

668
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,330
I no longer have a reason
to take your calls.

669
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,960
How did you…

670
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,176
Cheon Na-na, you…

671
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,222
I'm just an aunt who missed her niece.

672
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,933
She looks a lot like her dad.

673
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,034
It turned out well today. I like it.

674
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,290
Kim Min-ji is now
on the prosecution's side.

675
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,460
It is an unfavorable situation.

676
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,797
We need something definitive
to turn the situation around.

677
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,215
Get moving.

678
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,301
-That's not good.
-Where should we look?

679
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,428
CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

680
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:26,895
What happened?

681
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,772
-Do you have a decision?
-Yes.

682
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,609
What is it?

683
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,402
It all points to one person.

684
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,112
Woo Tae-ho.

685
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,823
Woo Tae-ho?

686
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,950
So…

687
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,580
Is that why he killed Jung Hui-ju?

688
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,375
I thought he would only threaten her.

689
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,754
When I heard Hui-ju
was murdered by a serial killer,

690
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,048
I figured Vice-chairman Cheon
didn't kill her.

691
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,968
He wouldn't have ordered
a serial killer to kill Hui-ju.

692
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,929
But…

693
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,099
the serial killer

694
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,936
said he didn't kill Hui-ju.

695
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,315
This conversation

696
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,235
is an important clue to revealing
the defendant's motive.

697
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,491
Can you verify
that the recorded voice is yours?

698
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,034
Yes.

699
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,702
Is what you said true as well?

700
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,870
Yes.

701
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,996
WITNESS

702
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,914
No further questions.

703
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,416
The defense may cross-examine.

704
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,171
Please play the last part
of the recording again.

705
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,841
Hui-ju said you can't be trusted either.

706
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:43,138
She found out
you covered for him two years ago.

707
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,395
She thought you were on the same side
as Vice-chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

708
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,604
Okay, that's enough.

709
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,441
Was that your voice as well?

710
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,734
Yes,

711
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,487
Did you know this conversation
was being recorded?

712
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,241
-No.
-No further questions.

713
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,679
Did the defendant order
an employee to take this picture

714
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,182
and send it to Jung Hui-ju?

715
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,017
DEFENDANT

716
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,687
Yes.

717
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,147
What was the reason?

718
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,189
I…

719
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,777
found out that Woo Tae-ho was hiding
the CCTV footage of the assault case,

720
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,156
So I told Jung Hui-ju
to bring me the evidence,

721
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,492
using the fact that Woo Tae-ho
and Jung Hui-ju had an affair.

722
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,123
Two years ago at the time of the assault,
you were the head

723
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,959
of the Seoul Criminal Investigation
Division handling the case.

724
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,128
And as it was mentioned in the recording,

725
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,423
didn't Woo Tae-ho ask you for help
to cover up the incident?

726
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,549
In return,

727
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:04,386
did Woo Tae-ho hire the defendant
as the manager of the legal team?

728
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,517
-Yes.
-Then let me ask.

729
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,895
Would you say you were closer
with Woo Tae-ho than Cheon Sang-woo

730
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,189
because you knew each other's weaknesses?

731
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,192
Yes, I would say that.

732
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,778
Didn't Woo Tae-ho know
the killer Gi Dong-jae too?

733
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,283
Gi Dong-jae was a subcontractor for TJ.

734
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,702
But the legal team manager didn't have
enough authority to pick a subcontractor.

735
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,579
It was only possible with the permission

736
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,582
of Woo Tae-ho, the head of the legal team,

737
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,959
who was at the director level, wasn't it?

738
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,336
Yes, in reality.

739
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,260
Woo Tae-ho rose from
a public prosecutor to a director of TJ.

740
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,889
It was possible because he was
the son-in-law of a wealthy family.

741
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,267
If the affair
with Jung Hui-ju was found out,

742
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,270
it would have caused
an irreversible crisis for him.

743
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,231
So he asked Gi Dong-jae for a favor,

744
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,692
to make Jung Hui-ju look like
a victim of serial murder.

745
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,736
Only then will he be removed
from the list of suspects.

746
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,530
Objection, your Honor!

747
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,658
Woo Tae-ho is already dead.

748
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,910
With a story that can't be proven,

749
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,204
the defense is steering the discussion
in an unrelated direction.

750
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,040
Defendant Cheon Sang-woo.

751
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,376
Yes.

752
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,878
If the defense's allegations are
proven to be true,

753
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:24,883
you may receive a separate trial
for the case of assault.

754
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,053
Do you accept
the defense counsel's claims?

755
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,931
Yes, I do.

756
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,600
Objection overruled.

757
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,769
The defense may continue.

758
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,565
Against Woo Tae-ho's intentions,

759
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,985
Jung Hui-ju's murder is revealed to be
not the work of a serial killer.

760
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,987
And his wife finds out
about the affair and files for divorce.

761
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,531
He is forced to use his last resort.

762
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,034
He uses the anger of Kim Min-ji,
the assault victim, toward the defendant

763
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,997
and frames him
as the conspirator of the murder.

764
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:01,253
He recorded his conversation
with Kim Min-ji to use as evidence.

765
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:05,841
Let's listen to his voice recorded
on the car's black box before he died.

766
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,844
This is our best option.

767
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,681
Please listen to me this time.

768
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,560
According to the police report,

769
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:20,272
Woo Tae-ho called the detective
in charge right before his death

770
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:24,484
and said that he had something to tell
about Jung Hui-ju's case.

771
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:29,323
The reason Woo Tae-ho said
"This was our best option,"

772
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,950
was that he thought
he could kill two birds with one stone.

773
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,828
He would go to the police
and cover up his crimes

774
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,331
by framing defendant Cheon Sang-woo
as the conspirator.

775
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,459
And convince his wife, Cheon Na-na,

776
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,836
who was competing with the defendant
for management rights,

777
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,798
to call off the divorce.

778
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,225
The defendant was
mostly aware of these facts.

779
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:05,192
But why didn't you tell the police
during the investigation process?

780
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,574
Woo Tae-ho was my sister's husband.

781
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,453
And he had contributed
much to the TJ Group.

782
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,917
I thought it was the way to pay
my last respect to the deceased.

783
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,711
No further comments.

784
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,720
No.

785
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:38,850
Woo Tae-ho is
not the kind of person to kill Hui-ju.

786
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,144
No.

787
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:48,568
I heard there is a good chance
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo will walk.

788
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,986
Would that happen?

789
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,072
We will have to wait and see.

790
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,449
What about you?

791
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,369
I will probably get a few years.

792
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,873
But Cheon Sang-woo, Cheon Na-na,
neither one of them can betray me.

793
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,501
They will work hard behind the scenes.
I'll just rest and come out.

794
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,003
That's a relief.

795
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,466
-Have you met Director Cheon Na-na?
-Yes.

796
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,551
What did she say?

797
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,469
To withdraw money from
a borrowed-name account,

798
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,389
you need the consent of the people
who lent the name to the account.

799
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:21,476
It's hard to convince everyone,
but she said she talked to a few of them.

800
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,692
Did you tell her it must be resolved
before the trial is over?

801
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,318
Yes.

802
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,239
She said to create an account
and tell the account number.

803
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,325
Check the account and let me know
when the money appears.

804
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,455
But if Chairman Cheon Sang-woo
is released,

805
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,416
wouldn't he try to get the money back?

806
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,335
Even if he's released,
he won't be able to ask for it.

807
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:51,423
I still have a weapon called "Honesty."

808
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:57,471
When Director Cheon told me the amount,
it was beyond my imagination.

809
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,222
She said that was just a fraction of it.

810
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,976
If it gets too big,

811
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,520
isn't there a risk
to be exposed in the future?

812
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,563
Gi-jin,

813
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,734
Do you know what the easiest
money in the world is?

814
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,446
Money stolen and hidden by thieves.

815
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,325
All we have to do is say the magic words.

816
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,453
Open sesame.

817
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:30,128
Did we have anything to counter
the defense counsel's argument?

818
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,049
Most of them were based on the truth.

819
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,262
But it doesn't make sense
that Tae-Ho Woo ordered the hit.

820
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,306
They just put it all on Woo Tae-ho.

821
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,141
There is no way to prove that now.

822
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,143
As you said, the only way is

823
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,146
to go to the underworld
and ask Woo Tae-ho and Jung Hui-ju.

824
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,568
What did Woo Tae-ho mean
when he said it was the best option?

825
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,154
Did you meet Cheon Na-na?

826
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,200
He said it to her. She would know
what her husband meant.

827
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:04,412
She said he was going to expose
Cheon Sang-woo's assault two years ago.

828
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,248
That won't help.

829
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,043
I think it could mean
he was going to turn himself in.

830
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,005
Do you mean Woo Tae-ho
could be the culprit like they argued?

831
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,590
I'm not agreeing with them.

832
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,427
Try to make some sense.
You told me you saw the video.

833
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,012
You saw the video.

834
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,432
You told me you saw
Cheon Sang-woo order the kill.

835
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,519
Why are you talking nonsense
in front of the prosecutor?

836
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,187
You're confusing him.

837
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,606
There is no way.

838
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,359
I will bring the video to the trial.

839
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,444
I thought the owner of the video
didn't wish to present it.

840
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,696
I will try somehow.

841
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,031
It was recorded illegally without consent.

842
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,743
If the process of obtaining is
also potentially illegal,

843
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,913
there is zero possibility
to secure admissibility.

844
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,709
Evidence without admissibility
cannot enter the court.

845
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:55,171
If it doesn't have admissibility,
we have to make it admissible.

846
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,512
DEPOSIT 30,000,000 WON

847
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,763
BALANCE 30,001,000 WON

848
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,434
BALANCE 150,001,000 WON

849
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,812
BALANCE 350,001,000 WON

850
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,397
Opened…

851
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,733
Sesame.

852
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,531
Don't you want some kimchi?

853
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,950
Do convenience stores sell kimchi?

854
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,410
Yes.

855
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,747
Why didn't you tell me before?
Bring me some.

856
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,130
It's good.

857
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:43,261
The video you showed me.
You didn't show Mr. Woo, did you?

858
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,181
-No.
-But I don't have to believe that, right?

859
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,310
Honestly, illegal recording
is not that big of a crime.

860
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:55,482
As long as it wasn't used
for sexual intent, you would pay a fine.

861
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,069
-That doesn't change my mind.
-Probably not.

862
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:04,115
If they find out you filmed it
and handed it over to the police,

863
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,912
you would be an immoral sister
who turned in her brother as the killer.

864
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:14,376
You would be disowned by your family
and get kicked out of the company.

865
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,878
-Am I right?
-So what?

866
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,675
The defense lawyers

867
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:27,138
summoned the late Mr. Woo out of nowhere.

868
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,017
So we are trying to do
something out of nowhere, too.

869
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,936
We need your permission.

870
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,188
My permission? For what?

871
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,024
Open your doors.

872
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,156
What are you here for?

873
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,534
We have a search and seizure warrant

874
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,661
for the suspect of Jung Hui-ju's murder.

875
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,704
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

876
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,382
Jae-hong and Man-gu, go this way.

877
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,509
-Ji-ung, take Dong-uk and go that way.
-Okay.

878
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,969
-We're going upstairs.
-Okay.

879
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,851
My husband's library is
on the second floor.

880
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,019
Yes, I see.

881
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,239
Please play the evidence video.

882
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,786
Why are you tormenting me?

883
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,457
What did I do to you?

884
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,709
What?

885
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,586
Objection, your Honor.
Please turn off the video.

886
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,379
Turn it off for now.

887
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,381
This video was filmed illegally.

888
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,966
This is unfit to be evidence.

889
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,384
There is no issue with its admissibility.

890
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,887
I checked in advance.

891
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,138
On what grounds?

892
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,806
Let me tell you.

893
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,975
At the second hearing,

894
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,812
the defense argued that Woo Tae-ho
conspired to murder Jung Hui-ju.

895
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,024
As a prosecutor, I had to verify
the defense counsel's allegation.

896
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:05,403
To find the evidence, I started
an investigation on Woo Tae-ho again.

897
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:09,532
This evidence video was found
in the library of Woo Tae-ho's house.

898
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,368
It was found
during the search of his house.

899
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,288
It can be assumed that
Woo Tae-ho secretly recorded it.

900
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,539
No.

901
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,667
Woo Tae-ho didn't record that.

902
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,424
Then who did it?

903
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,136
At the second hearing,
the defense counsel said

904
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,933
that Woo Tae-ho was trying to frame
defendant Cheon Sang-woo as the culprit.

905
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,852
If that's true, is there a doubt
it wasn't taken by Woo Tae-ho?

906
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,398
It was the defense that pointed
to Woo Tae-ho as the suspect.

907
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,360
This was found at the suspect's house.

908
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,738
Do you still think this is inadmissible?

909
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,701
Please continue with the evidence video.

910
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,206
Kill Jung Hui-ju.

911
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,710
I will give you enough
for generations to come.

912
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,046
Kill Jung Hui-ju!

913
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,508
Mr. Choi will take care of the rest.

914
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,385
All you have to do, Gi Dong-jae,

915
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,012
is to kill her.

916
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,223
Got it?

917
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,225
This is the next video.

918
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,811
It is the reaction of Gi Dong-jae,
who killed Jung Hui-ju and disappeared.

919
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,646
Pardon?

920
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,565
Jung Hui-ju?

921
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,485
That's kind of a big job
for you to suddenly…

922
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,737
Yes, I understand.

923
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,033
I'll discuss it with Mr. Choi
and call you again.

924
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,455
-He ordered the murder.
-There's a video.

925
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,415
Defendant Choi Yong-geun.

926
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,751
Yes.

927
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,003
In this video,

928
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,006
are you, Choi Yong-geun,

929
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,759
the "Mr. Choi" that they're
referring to in the video?

930
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,345
Yes.

931
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,763
I will ask for the last time.

932
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,724
Who ordered…

933
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,644
the murder
of Jung Hui-ju's to Gi Dong-jae?

934
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,417
It was Chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

935
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,462
-I can't believe it.
-It was Cheon Sang-woo.

936
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,215
-Is he even human?
-Why would he do such a thing?

937
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,342
-How can he do this?
-He ordered a murder.

938
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,094
No further questions.

939
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,729
Yes.

940
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,190
Yes, it went well.

941
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,401
I will tell you in detail when I get back.

942
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,572
We're going to win for sure.

943
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,951
Don't worry. We're coming straight back.

944
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,703
He's coming out.

945
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,664
Are you satisfied with the result?

946
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,708
What do you think
about the evidence presented today?

947
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,378
-Move back!
-How do you feel waiting for the verdict?

948
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,630
-Please say something.
-You need to back away.

949
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,131
-What do you think about the evidence?
-Chairman Cheon!

950
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,508
Please tell us how you feel.

951
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:19,013
What if he runs away
before the sentencing hearing?

952
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,350
-He's making me nervous.
-I'll follow him.

953
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,186
-I'll meet you at the station.
-What about me?

954
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,437
Get a taxi.

955
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,940
Damn it.

956
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:41,744
CHEON SANG-WOO

957
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:03,850
Die!

958
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,477
Die!

959
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,783
Hey!

960
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:22,994
You bitch!

961
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,295
You can't beat me.

962
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,589
Just lose.

963
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,591
Don't make yourself more pathetic.

964
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,219
Just back off now. That will do.

965
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,140
Why would I lose to you? Why?

966
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,519
Die!

967
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,813
Die!

968
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,374
Gosh.

969
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:15,004
I almost killed my only sister
in front of a detective.

970
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,716
Na-na.

971
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:22,428
Don't ever pull a stunt like this again.

972
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,138
You can't beat me even if you die.

973
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,975
It would be a pointless death,
just like your mom's.

974
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,186
Do you understand me?

975
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,159
Are you okay?

976
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,664
My family sucks, doesn't it?

977
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,334
Yes, it does.

978
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,730
If you want, we will put somebody on you.

979
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,733
This is nothing new.

980
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,818
I've been dealing with it
since I was little.

981
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,944
Don't worry about it.

982
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,323
The trial will end in the way you wanted.

983
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,034
But to me, it won't be the end.

984
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,578
Is there something left?

985
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,413
I want to know

986
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,207
what Woo Tae-ho was thinking
before he died.

987
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,377
The end will come
after I learn what that was.

988
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,671
I'm glad. I was going to be disappointed.

989
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:42,884
Let's keep in touch
until the end is in sight.

990
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,764
Thanks for saving me today.

991
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,702
Welcome.

992
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,496
Are you feeling okay?

993
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,372
Yes, thanks for your concern.

994
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,540
Please have a seat.

995
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,766
I raised my son poorly.

996
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,768
I'm sorry.

997
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,311
You must be worried.

998
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,565
But the trial was conducted fairly.

999
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,818
I think you need to accept it.

1000
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:45,988
I'm not trying to raise an issue
about that at this point.

1001
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:51,160
It's more about TJ than my son.

1002
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,081
It's not because TJ is my company,

1003
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,875
but if it falls, the impact
on the country's economy

1004
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,711
will be greater than expected.

1005
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,256
McQueen's influence will only grow.

1006
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,802
We realize the situation is serious.

1007
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:11,764
The reason McQueen wants TJ

1008
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,810
is not to save the dying TJ Group.

1009
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,439
It wants to kill it completely
and sell off its parts.

1010
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,652
A while ago,

1011
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:29,949
McQueen had chosen Woo Tae-ho as the CEO.

1012
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,326
It's a shame.

1013
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,955
It was the only chance to save TJ.

1014
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:41,836
It was foolish of me to lose that chance.

1015
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,630
I knew about that.

1016
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:49,552
I personally thought it was
a good chance to change the course.

1017
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:54,432
If I get out, I will find
another Woo Tae-ho.

1018
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,353
Can you promise that?

1019
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,780
Then, do you have someone in mind?

1020
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,617
Yes, I do.

1021
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:18,080
This is an unprecedented case in which
the head of Korea's major conglomerate

1022
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:23,127
was brought to trial for the charges
of conspiracy to murder.

1023
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:28,966
The eyes of the people
are focused on this trial.

1024
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:33,679
The economic implications of imprisoning

1025
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,767
the head of a large corporation
had to be considered.

1026
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:44,231
However, this court wants
to reiterate the one value

1027
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,485
we should never forsake.

1028
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:51,572
The law is equal for all.

1029
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,368
I will read the sentence.

1030
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,745
Defendant Choi Yong-geun

1031
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,665
is found guilty of conspiring
corpse abandonment

1032
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,375
and is sentenced to five years in prison.

1033
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,961
-What kind of sentencing is that?
-Only five years?

1034
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,548
Defendant Cheon Sang-woo…

1035
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,512
-This is ridiculous.
-Why is this happening?

1036
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,390
Please be quiet.

1037
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,684
Defendant Cheon Sang-woo

1038
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,269
is found guilty of conspiracy to murder.

1039
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:25,189
He is sentenced to 15 years in prison.

1040
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,109
-That is unbelievable.
-Fifteen years?

1041
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,194
That is so unfair.

1042
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,166
Here.

1043
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,960
-Nice work everyone.
-Yes.

1044
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,128
Good work.

1045
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,507
You worked so hard.

1046
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,803
It was successful
because you led the trial so well.

1047
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:56,762
Thank you.

1048
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,056
I didn't do anything. I was roped in.

1049
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,142
By a detective… How embarrassing
as a prosecutor.

1050
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,269
Why do you say things like that?

1051
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,396
You finished a big case well.

1052
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,481
Let me ask you something.

1053
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,150
Why do you live like this?

1054
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,987
Is it for the glory? Or justice?
What is the reason?

1055
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,905
It's nothing like that.

1056
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,907
You came along with us.

1057
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:21,287
I fell into the pit because you guys
were pulling me down relentlessly.

1058
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,123
Why in the world do you live like that?

1059
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,292
Because I'm a detective.

1060
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,961
-There's no other reason.
-You are living beyond your means.

1061
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,005
Don't live like that anymore.

1062
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:34,133
Why are you interfering with my life?

1063
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,845
-Are you talking back to a prosecutor?
-You are the one who insulted me first.

1064
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,972
Do you still think a prosecutor
outranks a detective?

1065
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,808
I didn't know you were so old-fashioned.

1066
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,852
I'm not talking about rank.

1067
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:47,188
When a detective goes astray,
the prosecutor has to bring him back.

1068
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,898
-That's why I'm saying that.
-Bring back to where?

1069
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,567
You are chained to your desk
signing documents.

1070
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,152
What do you know about a crime scene?

1071
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,362
You don't have an eye
for the whole picture.

1072
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,615
How many cases do you handle a day?

1073
01:07:57,698 --> 01:08:01,118
I handle as many cases in a day
as you would handle in a year.

1074
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,788
Why are you arguing? Do-chang,
don't talk like that to the prosecutor.

1075
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,039
-Stay out of it.
-Do-chang!

1076
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,540
It's nothing.

1077
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,336
Have you ever seen
a corpse that was murdered?

1078
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,671
A corpse that you couldn't bear
to look at?

1079
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:17,009
Have you ever suffered all night
after sentencing the death penalty?

1080
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,803
After you handcuff
and send them away, it's over for you.

1081
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,304
Your problem is
that you look down on detectives.

1082
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,724
The one I look down on is you,
not the detectives.

1083
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,727
It's the same. Wait, what? It's the same.

1084
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,729
-How old are you?
-How old?

1085
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,817
The Chairman is coming out.

1086
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,615
Chairman, how does it feel
to be acquitted?

1087
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,243
Current Chairman Cheon Sang-woo
has been sentenced to 15 years in jail.

1088
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:44,203
Do you think your acquittal is related?

1089
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,831
What do you think
the future of TJ will be?

1090
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,958
What do you think is the reason
for your acquittal?

1091
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,376
I would like your comments.

1092
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,502
Enough questions, please.

1093
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,921
-Please tell us what you think!
-Can I get a comment?

1094
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,256
Tell us what you are thinking.

1095
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,758
-We would like your comments.
-What are your plans?

1096
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,094
-Chairman!
-What is the reason for your acquittal?

1097
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:01,929
Please give us a comment.

1098
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,483
You endured a lot.

1099
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,833
Did you wait long?

1100
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,421
I'm sorry. Things kept coming up.

1101
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,714
No, it's okay.

1102
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,132
-Please sit down.
-Yes.

1103
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,262
Mr. Jung,

1104
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,640
on behalf of my family and the company,

1105
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,225
I sincerely apologize.

1106
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,643
No, it's okay.

1107
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,646
It's us, who should be sorry.

1108
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,482
You must have been shocked
by the result of the trial.

1109
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,776
I am really sorry.

1110
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:04,158
You must have been sad because of Hui-ju.

1111
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:06,911
I think…

1112
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,956
Your husband passing away

1113
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,294
was because of Hui-ju's fault.

1114
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:18,505
You don't have to think that.

1115
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,012
Please forgive Hui-ju.

1116
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:30,434
I'm sure Hui-ju is asking
for your forgiveness from the beyond.

1117
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,355
Director Cheon,

1118
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,814
which tea shall I prepare?

1119
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,275
I will serve him myself.
He's an important guest.

1120
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,528
Is coffee okay?

1121
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,530
Yes.

1122
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,407
Please wait a moment.

1123
01:10:58,837 --> 01:10:59,964
Yes, Mr. Woo.

1124
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:05,427
It was Mr. Woo's number so…

1125
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,388
I'm sorry.

1126
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,601
Yes, it's okay. Go ahead, Director Cheon.

1127
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,443
Yes, I will be there soon.

1128
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,994
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I think I have to go.

1129
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:33,622
Go to the shop without me.
I'll be back by the evening.

1130
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,999
Let's have dinner together.

1131
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,084
-Okay, go ahead.
-Okay.

1132
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:40,838
Bye.

1133
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,674
-Bye.
-See you.

1134
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:44,633
Bye.

1135
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,688
JUNGIN SHOES

1136
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:58,939
Gosh, Hui-ju…

1137
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,986
Why aren't you answering your phone?
Is something wrong?

1138
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,878
Director Cheon?

1139
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:23,630
Yes?

1140
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,844
Are you Director Cheon?

1141
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,965
Gi Dong-jae died because he told
Woo Tae-ho about the killer.

1142
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,677
If your theory that Gi Dong-jae
didn't kill Jung Hui-ju is true

1143
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,013
and we find proof of it,

1144
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,848
that makes Cheon Sang-woo innocent.

1145
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,767
Dong-jae didn't leave anything with me.

1146
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,770
I found what he was hiding
while cleaning out his stuff.

1147
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:22,940
Get rid of that evidence.
Don't leave a single trace behind.

1148
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,317
Do you think I'm oblivious
to what you did?

1149
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,946
As soon as you covet something else,
you lose the right to be my daughter.

1150
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,115
Protect me.

1151
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,492
We are both murderers.

1152
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:42,084
