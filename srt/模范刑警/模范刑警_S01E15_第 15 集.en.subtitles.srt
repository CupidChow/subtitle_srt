00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,878
NOVEMBER 9, 2015, 11 P.M.

2
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,342
GAWOL CHURCH

3
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,355
Could you get out of the car for a moment?

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,648
What is this about?

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,400
Are you the pastor of Gawol Church?

6
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,401
Yes. And?

7
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,237
Please get out and
have a quick chat with me.

8
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,866
Hang on.

9
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,052
So who are you?
I don't think we've met before.

10
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,929
Jo Seong-gi.

11
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,058
-You're Jo Seong-gi.
-No, I'm not.

12
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,811
I've never forgotten about you,
even for a second.

13
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,853
Your name.

14
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,022
Your face.

15
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,775
-Who are you?
-Yoo Jeong-seon.

16
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,195
-You remember her, right?
-Who is she?

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,864
I don't know who she is.

18
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,700
Who is Yoo Jeong-seon?

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,452
Go to the police and turn yourself in.

20
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,372
Tell them that you're Jo Seong-gi

21
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,042
and that you've made Yoo Jeong-seon die

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,295
after sexually torturing her.

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,382
You have nowhere else to go.

24
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,884
Please.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,095
Well,

26
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,014
I told you I'm not him.

27
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,808
Turn yourself in!

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,227
If you don't, I really don't know
what I'll do to you.

29
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,607
You jerk. Who are you?

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,028
How dare you threaten me?

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,781
You killed my sister. I know you did it!

32
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,199
Keep your voice down.

33
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,909
Why did you do that?

34
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,329
Why did you do such a thing
to my sister, you bastard?

35
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,082
Are you that girl's younger brother?

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,584
I will never forgive you.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,796
-Never!
-I told you to keep it down.

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,882
You'll wake everyone up.

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,852
Hey, I didn't kill her.

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,648
She hung herself to death.
Why are you blaming me?

41
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,652
She died because of you.

42
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,905
Because of you!

43
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,956
I didn't do anything.

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,335
She pulled her skirt up herself

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,046
and asked me to let her go.

46
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,841
Darn, I'm in trouble.

47
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,678
I thought I could finally settle down
and live a quiet life.

48
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,534
You are worse than a brute.

49
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,876
Excuse me.

50
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,588
I think I heard
some people fighting over here.

51
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,174
Did you not hear anything?

52
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,972
Well, I was talking on the phone.

53
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,601
I got upset and raised my voice a little.

54
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,811
Is this your car?

55
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,855
Yes.

56
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,235
Did something happen?

57
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,237
No, nothing happened.

58
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,076
I'm Detective Jang Jin-su from the Violent
Crimes Unit at Seobu Police Station.

59
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,496
Could you open the trunk for a moment?

60
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,292
Sure.

61
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,733
Jin-su.

62
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,194
Jin-su.

63
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,739
Where are you?

64
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,076
Jin-su.

65
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,874
Jin-su.

66
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,003
Jin-su.

67
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,176
What exactly do I need to explain?

68
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,178
The truth.

69
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,097
"The truth"?

70
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,601
All I did was kill someone
who deserved to die.

71
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,021
-It must be true.
-He killed someone?

72
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,356
A person who deserved to die?

73
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,733
-How could he say that?
-I can't believe this.

74
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,151
Mr. Yoo.

75
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,904
Do you seriously mean what you say?

76
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,614
Things have come this far.

77
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,242
Isn't this what you were assuming?

78
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,953
-Mr. Yoo.
-Until I give you further instructions,

79
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,455
just remain calm and focus on your work.

80
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,959
What?

81
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,836
-Mr. Yoo.
-What are we supposed to do?

82
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,800
You did a good job coming this far.

83
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,947
JIN SEO-KYUNG

84
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,909
POWER OFF

85
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,168
What should we do? The choice is yours.

86
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,880
-What are you talking about?
-You can confess what happened

87
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,381
and get punished for what you did.

88
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,343
But if not, keep saying you didn't do it.

89
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,680
I'll do everything I can to cover for you.

90
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,277
If Mr. Yoo contacts anyone,
it will be you.

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,448
He will have to tell the truth through
our paper before the police do.

92
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,660
That's the only way to save
our company and our team.

93
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,706
If you talk to Mr. Yoo
and fail to convince him,

94
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,583
we will have to print it first.

95
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,419
If the police announce it first,

96
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,296
there will be no way for us to handle it.

97
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,715
But we should give Mr. Yoo some time.

98
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,011
We also need to find out
what made him kill a person.

99
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,722
And more importantly, he's our boss.

100
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,391
That's only before he told us
that he's a murderer.

101
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,644
He's not our boss anymore.

102
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,731
If he didn't bring you to our team,

103
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,734
he would still be our boss,

104
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,819
and he would have continued to be so.

105
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,822
Listen up!

106
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,325
From now on, send your reports to me
instead of Mr. Yoo.

107
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,369
And keep silent about the search

108
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,621
until I bring it up first.

109
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,039
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

110
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,794
You did a good job coming this far.

111
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,344
This is the data forensics recovered
from Yoo Jeong-seok's computer.

112
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,722
He had a separate file
on Lee Dae-cheol's case.

113
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,309
It includes all the articles
from other press companies,

114
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,854
news clips, videos,
and even the records of his trials.

115
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,815
I guess that would be

116
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,694
circumstantial evidence that
Yoo Jeong-seok is involved in this case.

117
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:35,616
The fact that he deleted the file
means he has something to hide.

118
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,202
Exactly. And he deleted the file

119
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,621
the day Jo Seong-gi's remains
were discovered.

120
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,333
That means Yoo Jeong-seok
killed Jo Seong-gi.

121
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,004
Is there anything else to check?

122
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,298
He also had the recording
of Chief Moon Sang-beom

123
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,593
and Prosecutor Jung Sang-il
from the Civil Petition Division.

124
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,513
And there was the video of Cho Byeong-gil
who was executed with Lee Dae-cheol.

125
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,724
Yoo Jeong-seok uploaded
the video of him going berserk

126
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,892
on his social media,
which spread through the Internet.

127
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,563
So it's confirmed that he spread the video

128
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,607
to create public opinion
for the death penalty.

129
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,443
So he supported the death penalty
just to kill Lee Dae-cheol?

130
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,487
Smart people can be more vicious.

131
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,699
This must be worth search and seizure.

132
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,910
Is there any file on Jang Jin-su?

133
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,872
There's nothing special
other than the records of his trial.

134
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,459
But he seems to have been quite
interested in Captain Nam Guk-hyeon.

135
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,879
He had all the data
on Captain Nam's personal information,

136
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,756
the cases he took, and his recent events.

137
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,550
But why?

138
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,969
Why would Yoo Jeong-seok
be interested in Nam Guk-hyeon?

139
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,224
I think I've done
everything I could for my part.

140
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,144
There's nothing more I can do for you.

141
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,104
Why are you being like this, Captain Nam?

142
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,983
Nothing good will come out of
cornering me.

143
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,736
Are you saying you'll drag me in?

144
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,698
You are part of the story of my life.

145
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,992
We should work things out together.

146
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,621
Let me give you a piece of advice.

147
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,290
Yoo Jeong-ryeol pulled out of this.

148
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,917
You have no one to turn to anymore.

149
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,586
It'll be best for you to go to jail

150
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,922
-for instigating murder.
-Me?

151
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,258
I have to go to jail?

152
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,805
Why would I go to such a place
full of rotten parasites?

153
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,641
Why would I?

154
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,768
Why?

155
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,231
Hey. Mr. Oh.

156
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,613
Let go of me!

157
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,073
Let go!

158
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,992
Get off me!

159
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,511
I don't get it.

160
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,932
Why is it that guys like you
are never grateful?

161
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,645
You wagged your tail like a stray dog
when I was feeding you.

162
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,107
But why would you stab me in the back
the second I turn around?

163
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,734
Both my father and I helped you out.

164
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,156
Then you should at least pretend
to kill yourself when I tell you to die.

165
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,240
Mr. Oh.

166
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,910
-Mr. Oh. I just…
-You did as much as you could?

167
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,996
I did everything I could.

168
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,915
I can't say you didn't.

169
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,084
I get it.

170
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,297
I'll go to jail for instigating murder
as you advised.

171
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,010
But I need you
to shut that mouth of yours.

172
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,306
If you start talking,
things will get too complicated.

173
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,603
I won't say anything.
I have no reason to talk about it.

174
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,147
I also did things to cover for you.

175
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,899
That's right.

176
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,653
But you can talk to at least one person.

177
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,990
Lee Dae-cheol.

178
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,658
Tell him when you meet him.

179
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,661
That he should be honored
to have died instead of me.

180
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,163
Wait.

181
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,752
The person who killed Jang Jin-su

182
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,630
is Yoo Jeong-seok.

183
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,965
I already know that.

184
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,135
-Why are you saying that to me?
-I saw it.

185
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,556
I have evidence to prove
that Yoo Jeong-seok

186
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,683
killed both Jo Seong-gi and Jang Jin-su.

187
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,692
Why are you telling me all that now?

188
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,278
I'll hand the evidence over to you.

189
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,032
You can threaten Yoo Jeong-seok with it.

190
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,953
Then you'll see what to do
to get away with all this.

191
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,287
Like what?

192
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,998
It's the dashcam footage of the murder.

193
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,463
Why have you

194
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,966
been hiding it all this time?

195
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,592
In case

196
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,387
I get framed for Jang Jin-su's murder.

197
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,722
I was going to use it then.

198
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,271
I missed.

199
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,899
But I won't make any mistakes next time.

200
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,236
Get rid of this.

201
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,454
He hasn't used his credit card
for a whole month.

202
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,874
And there's no call history.

203
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,917
I guess he's using a burner phone.

204
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,172
Hey, how did it go?
Did anyone see Nam Guk-hyeon?

205
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,634
Gosh, I guess he didn't even
come near his house.

206
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,178
He didn't even pick up his clothes
from the dry cleaner's.

207
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,763
Did you meet his family?

208
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,349
His mother, but she said
she hasn't seen him for over a month.

209
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,685
-What about her phone?
-I asked her to check her phone,

210
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,105
but she got furious. I don't think
we will find anything there.

211
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,024
So you have no idea where he is now?

212
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,402
He knows better than anyone
about how we track down a suspect.

213
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,112
He wouldn't leave a trace.

214
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,241
What do we do then?
We can't put him on the wanted list

215
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,576
since we can't prove his crime.

216
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,832
There's someone
who recently met Nam Guk-hyeon.

217
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,125
What?

218
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,127
Eun-hye.

219
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,298
He got in the car here and drove this way.

220
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,177
SECURITY CCTV CAMERA

221
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,054
Do you remember what kind of car it was?

222
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,516
I think it was black.
I don't remember what kind though.

223
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,935
That's enough.

224
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,439
Check the CCTVs around here
and track down the plate number.

225
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,440
Okay.

226
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,825
Case 2020 Criminal Case 1134.

227
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,828
Acceptance of bribes and violation
of the Public Servant's Ethics.

228
00:15:55,704 --> 00:16:00,125
I declare the accused,
Kim Gi-tae, not guilty.

229
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,922
Thank you.

230
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,427
Hey.

231
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,221
All right, then.

232
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,435
-Are you the only one here?
-I guess so.

233
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,813
When I was arrested,
they packed into the court.

234
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,856
But no one's interested
in my second trial.

235
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,609
I need you to write about this.

236
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,696
With the big headline
that says "Kim Gi-tae Found Not Guilty".

237
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,740
I talked to the prosecutor,
and they are not planning to appeal.

238
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,368
-Congratulations.
-I'll buy you a drink later.

239
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,287
It's all thanks to your hard work.

240
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,086
Are you in touch with Minister Yoo?

241
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,591
-You'll get back to work soon.
-Stop paying attention to me now.

242
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,677
It won't make any news.

243
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,022
FORENSIC ANALYSIS
OF SEIZED DATA FROM YOO JEONG-SEOK

244
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,484
DATA ON LEE DAE-CHEOL WAS DELETED

245
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,945
ON THE DAY JO SEONG-GI'S REMAINS
WERE DISCOVERED

246
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,249
Gather in the meeting room.

247
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,467
Why did you not send in
the afternoon reports?

248
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,052
I told them to report to me.

249
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,847
-Is there anything special?
-Not really.

250
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,642
We just filled the pages with some special
articles and a few incidents.

251
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,648
I'll be away for a while.
I told the director about it.

252
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,319
Baek Jun-seok will take my place
until they find my replacement.

253
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,653
Okay. I'll do that.

254
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,281
-Mr. Yoo.
-Oh, right, Ms. Jin.

255
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,700
Form a special report team
with two other junior reporters.

256
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,203
Collect as many items as you can.

257
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,248
Then the new editor won't be able
to mess with you and your team.

258
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,337
While I'm away, don't let
other teams walk all over you.

259
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,840
If they ask for backup
or shift their work on you,

260
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,384
you should step forward
and complain to the director.

261
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,514
Stick to your own identities
so other teams can't look down on you.

262
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,473
Okay?

263
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,362
YOO JEONG-SEOK, JEONGHAN DAILY

264
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,665
Well…

265
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,545
Jeonghan Daily will be the first
to release the articles about me.

266
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,132
Trust me and wait
until I give you further instructions.

267
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,092
Okay. I will.

268
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,983
Thank you all for your hard work so far.

269
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,164
Tell me.

270
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,587
Why you did it.

271
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,174
Why you had to do such a thing.

272
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,719
You once told me

273
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,138
that the truth can differ
depending on your perspective.

274
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,516
What's the truth that you're hiding?

275
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,812
I have

276
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,274
searched for him for over 20 years.

277
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,905
If he had apologized to me,
I would have held myself back.

278
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,909
But he didn't, so I killed him.

279
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,247
That's the truth in my eye.

280
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,047
-What about Detective Jang Jin-su?
-I killed him too.

281
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,793
You said, once this case is over,

282
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,545
we'll have something to look back
on and feel proud of.

283
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,673
But that's not the case for me.

284
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,885
It will hurt me for the rest of my life.

285
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,431
You just sent your boss

286
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,976
all the way down there.

287
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,520
How did it feel? Did you feel thrilled?

288
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,942
My boss turns out to be a real jerk.

289
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,612
He killed two people.

290
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
That bastard.

291
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,617
Did Mr. Yoo Jeong-seok

292
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,912
tell you all that?

293
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes. Because I found out the whole thing.

294
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,336
All the bad things he did in the past.

295
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,880
Did you tell the Violent Crimes Unit?

296
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,215
-No.
-Why not?

297
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,805
I just can't accept it yet.

298
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,433
It's hard to believe.

299
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,229
If I hadn't acted up like that,

300
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,273
it would've stayed hidden.

301
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,402
The whole thing was revealed
because of me.

302
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,279
All because of me.

303
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,615
But Mr. Yoo is the one
who got me where I am now.

304
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
During Lee Dae-cheol's retrial,

305
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,664
I perjured myself.

306
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,459
Do you think

307
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,046
I could sleep at ease since then?

308
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,969
But even if I were put in the situation
again, I would do the same thing.

309
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,389
-Why?
-Because that's who I am.

310
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,646
And the same applies to you.

311
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,400
You may be a little less selfish than me,

312
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,403
but you made a choice
that's best for you after all.

313
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,491
That's who Jin Seo-kyung is.

314
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,786
Suffering is optional.

315
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,039
Once you admit how selfish you are,

316
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,832
you will suffer a lot less.

317
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,631
You're right. That's who I am.

318
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,889
Don't tell the detectives
that I'm having a hard time

319
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,974
because of the statements
I made at the retrial.

320
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,518
It's embarrassing.

321
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,524
I'm still

322
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,902
Are you okay? Do you
want me to walk you home?

323
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,864
Of course I am. I'm a reporter
of the Current Affairs Team.

324
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,325
If I got drunk so easily,
I wouldn't have become a reporter.

325
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,452
Don't worry. I can go home by myself.

326
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,079
I can go.

327
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,248
-There's a taxi.
-Wait.

328
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,625
-Taxi.
-Seo-kyung.

329
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,380
Tell the detectives before it's too late.

330
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,216
You must know this already,
but he might destroy the evidence.

331
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,687
Sang-mi.

332
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,532
I guess

333
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,578
I'm not as strong as you are.

334
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,583
I feel sorry.

335
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,421
I feel really bad for him.

336
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,053
He's really not a bad person.

337
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,391
He really is not.

338
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,483
I feel really bad.

339
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,030
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,158
I'm so sorry.

341
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,009
I think this is it.

342
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,178
This is where
the CCTV footage got cut off.

343
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,395
Damn it.

344
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:25,982
Darn.

345
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,276
Hey, check every single car.

346
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,779
He might have had it repainted,

347
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,572
so make sure to check the plate numbers.

348
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,911
-What are you waiting for?
-Damn it.

349
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,040
Come on. Let's go.

350
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,780
I saw it.

351
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,200
Why have you kept this treasure
to yourself the whole time?

352
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,495
If you had shown this to Yoo Jeong-seok,

353
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,205
you would've gotten a bigger reward.

354
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,666
He's too much to deal with.

355
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,044
You should also use it in due degree.

356
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,255
If you overuse it,
you'll end up in big trouble.

357
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,550
Anyway, I appreciate your hard work.

358
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,219
We will have to see if it works though.

359
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,013
I'll stay in touch.

360
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,690
You murderer.

361
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:50,942
45 RA 1336

362
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,740
-Is this it?
-Yes.

363
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,993
This is the car with the plate number,
car model, and color in the footage.

364
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,956
He must be somewhere here.

365
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,375
Let's wait here.

366
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,341
You found his car? What about him?

367
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,844
Okay. Text me the address.

368
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,513
Yes. I'll call Do-chang
and bring him with me.

369
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,931
-What are you doing?
-Bye.

370
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,434
-Hello.
-You can't catch criminals sitting here.

371
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,319
Sit here.

372
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,367
You're old enough to know better.

373
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,911
-Why did you commit theft?
-I'm sorry.

374
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,329
You don't have to apologize to me.

375
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,626
Oh, dear. You have a lot of
criminal records. How many are they?

376
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,254
What is this? You once even got
investigated on a murder charge.

377
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,091
That was a long time ago.

378
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,677
And I was found not guilty.

379
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,848
All right. Let me start
drawing up the report then.

380
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,645
Hang on.

381
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,178
Ji-hyeok, please.

382
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,597
He's the one
who stabbed your father, right?

383
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,517
Ji-hyeok, I'm sure it was him.

384
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,479
You were too shocked then,
so you probably don't remember.

385
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,107
Just tell me it was him.

386
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,151
I'm sure it's him.

387
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,624
Park Chun-seong.

388
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:46,910
Do-chang, I looked up some
child custody cases on the Internet.

389
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,453
-Eun-hui.
-Yes?

390
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,456
I'm really tired now.
Can we do this tomorrow--

391
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,665
You're too tired for this?

392
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,043
This is about my life and Jae-ung's.

393
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,003
Sure. You're right.

394
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:01,674
Look. There's no way we can win
from a financial perspective.

395
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,176
But there's one thing we can do.

396
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,678
If I find evidence that Jae-ung's dad
had an affair

397
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,348
or cheated on me before the divorce,
we can be at an advantage.

398
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,060
But how are you going to find
such evidence after all these years?

399
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,647
You know, my older brother is a detective.

400
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,566
I've already found some clues.

401
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,903
These are his credit card statements
from before the divorce.

402
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,366
If we go through all the statements

403
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,702
and check the CCTV footage
from each place, we will find something.

404
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,331
My gosh. Go through
all the statements here?

405
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,251
-Yes.
-Like the sky lounge?

406
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,961
-All of these?
-Yes.

407
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,384
Hey.

408
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,137
Really? I'll be right there. Okay.

409
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,266
It's an emergency. I have to go.

410
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,226
Do-chang, come home
as soon as you're done, okay?

411
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,894
Do-chang, I need you…

412
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,730
I need my detective brother to help me.

413
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,816
Yes.

414
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,193
Okay.

415
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,697
We can prove that Nam Guk-hyeon destroyed

416
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,615
and manipulated the evidence.

417
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,659
Yes.

418
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,495
If he shows up,

419
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,707
tell him what he's charged with
and make an emergency arrest.

420
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,584
-You got the address, right?
-Yes.

421
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,543
Let's go.

422
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,758
Earlier today,

423
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,761
Team One caught some guy for theft.

424
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,848
What about it? Do you know him?

425
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,726
He was one of the suspects
of my dad's murder case.

426
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,102
Do you remember him?

427
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,439
Do you finally remember
the murderer's face?

428
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,940
No.

429
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,569
I still don't remember it.

430
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,488
I just have a suspicion
that he might be the culprit.

431
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,658
The statute of limitations for the case
has already expired.

432
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,162
Even if you recognize him now,
you can't get him punished.

433
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,164
Just forget about it.

434
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,625
I already gave up on it
in my head long ago.

435
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,294
but I just can't let it go

436
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,839
in my heart.

437
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,342
Then what will you do about it?

438
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:13,514
You should hold onto
your police badge no matter what.

439
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,309
If you quit,

440
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,395
you will either get killed
or kill someone.

441
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,023
It will be one of the two.

442
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,159
45 RA 1336

443
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,213
What are you guys doing here?
Are you here to see me?

444
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,255
Nam Guk-hyeon.

445
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,426
You're under arrest for manipulation
and destruction of evidence.

446
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,888
-Sure. Whatever.
-Go cuff him.

447
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,432
Handcuffs are not necessary though.

448
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,477
-We used to be colleagues.
-Give me your hands.

449
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,105
You punk.

450
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,820
Hey!

451
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,114
-Catch him!
-Hey.

452
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,949
-Nam Guk-hyeon!
-Find him.

453
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,953
-Catch him!
-That idiot.

454
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,125
Over here.

455
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,919
-Go this way.
-You idiot!

456
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,629
He's going over there.

457
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,880
Run! Go catch him.

458
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,133
-You jerk.
-There he is.

459
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,970
Hey.

460
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,809
-He's coming this way.
-You punk.

461
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,154
You jerk.

462
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,239
Scumbag.

463
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,957
You punk.

464
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,627
-You son of…
-You idiot!

465
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,171
Don't come near me.

466
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,298
Stay away.

467
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,134
Don't move. You get up.

468
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,844
Get up.

469
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,563
Let me just leave quietly, okay?

470
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,857
I don't want to hurt him.

471
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,362
Drop the gun.

472
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,699
This is my second warning.

473
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,243
-Drop the gun.
-Damn it.

474
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,083
This is the final warning.

475
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,293
Drop

476
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,170
the gun.

477
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,058
This idiot didn't keep
his gun in the right way,

478
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,726
so I tried to teach him a lesson. Okay?

479
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,395
Don't get me wrong. It was a prank.

480
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,904
Hey, go easy on me. It was a prank.

481
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,203
Hey.

482
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,956
You were going to shoot him, weren't you?

483
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,543
Do you remember the guidelines
on how to use a gun?

484
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,669
Be sure to follow them.

485
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,965
You almost gave me a heart attack,
you punk.

486
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,890
Hey.

487
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,104
Hey, Jae-hong.

488
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,524
Don't tell Captain about this
until we're done interrogating him.

489
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,151
I'll tell him once we're done.

490
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,527
-Okay?
-Okay.

491
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,242
-Wait, Do-chang.
-What?

492
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,872
About the fact that Nam Guk-hyeon
took my gun and held me hostage.

493
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,707
Please make sure to mention it.

494
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,794
I'm okay with it,
so please add it to his charges.

495
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,588
Did he lose his gun?

496
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,465
-I didn't see it. Did you see it?
-No, I didn't.

497
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,635
Gosh, that can't be right.
You know what Dong-uk is like.

498
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,429
Why would he lose his gun?

499
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,764
I guess you got carried away
and saw things.

500
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,016
Don't worry about it.

501
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,933
Right?

502
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:30,271
Detective Oh, you go by the rules.
You'll do as I said, right?

503
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,606
What are you talking about?

504
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,816
-Sorry?
-Ji-hyeok, we don't have time.

505
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,693
No, Do-chang. You can't do this.

506
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,612
Will you just stay still?

507
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,615
If you receive a reprimand,
who will replace you?

508
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,325
We've worked really hard to teach you.

509
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,243
-How dare you…
-Gosh.

510
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,204
You ungrateful rascal.

511
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,080
-You punk.
-Stop hitting him.

512
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,093
Manipulation of evidence

513
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,679
and destruction of evidence?

514
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,057
And murder of Jang Jin-su.

515
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,102
We found information on you
on Yoo Jeong-seok's computer.

516
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,690
He was afraid he'd be framed for Jang
Jin-su's murder after killing Jo Seong-gi,

517
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,025
so he's kept his eye on you.

518
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,571
Okay.

519
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,116
Manipulation and destruction of evidence?

520
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,035
I admit to all that.

521
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,663
Are you saying
you didn't kill Jang Jin-su?

522
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,293
Oh Jong-tae killed Yoon Ji-seon.
And I fabricated the evidence.

523
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,672
Yoo Jeong-seok killed Jo Seong-gi.
Then he killed Jang Jin-su

524
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,839
who witnessed the murder.

525
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,550
I'm not involved in this case.

526
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,345
I've just kept quiet.

527
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,056
Not to get caught framing
Lee Dae-cheol for murder?

528
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,017
All I did was stay quiet.

529
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,894
And it's not wrong.

530
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,565
How did you find out that Yoo Jeong-seok
killed both Jo Seong-gi and Jang Jin-su?

531
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,360
-Didn't he come clean?
-He didn't.

532
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,153
He just raised a question.

533
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,574
If he killed them both, why would
he have buried them separately?

534
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,910
That doesn't prove
that he didn't kill them.

535
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,161
That's why I'm asking.

536
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,083
How can you be so sure
that Yoo Jeong-seok killed Jang Jin-su?

537
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,501
Tell me the reason.

538
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,086
-How dare you--
-Detective Kang.

539
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,675
What you want to do is prove that Lee
Dae-cheol was wrongfully executed, right?

540
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,387
I'll say it at the trial.

541
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,139
That Lee Dae-cheol
wasn't the real culprit.

542
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,434
Why don't you just leave it at that?

543
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,519
Before I change my mind.

544
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,610
You won't be able to find evidence anyway.

545
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,613
There's only one thing you can do.

546
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,534
Appeal to Yoo Jeong-seok's conscience.

547
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,583
What's the statute of limitations
for manipulation of evidence?

548
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,294
For Lee Dae-cheol's case,
it's already expired.

549
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,714
What we have left is
his charge for Park Gun-ho's case.

550
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,342
He will probably
be put on probation for that.

551
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,135
He's acting like that because he knows it.

552
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,889
But Nam Guk-hyeon might be right.

553
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,391
The only thing we can trust

554
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,435
is Yoo Jeong-seok's conscience.

555
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,202
You're more aggressive than I thought.

556
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,954
I understand.

557
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:39,251
All people have a brutal instinct
inside of them.

558
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,505
So we've had many complications.

559
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,049
When things were about to be over,
they started again.

560
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,677
I guess we are destined to work together.

561
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,850
To be frank with you, I've been
able to boss you around.

562
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,728
But the tables have turned.

563
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,440
I'll try to do something to help you.

564
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,652
Now that you take a low profile,

565
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,278
I don't know what to say.

566
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,698
As you were saying,
we are now in the same boat.

567
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,535
One of us can't go down without the other.

568
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,786
If one dies,

569
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,038
the other will die together.

570
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,582
You mean I still can't
overpower you completely.

571
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,006
Just wait a little more.

572
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,301
I have a big gift for you, Mr. Oh.

573
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,472
I'll look forward to seeing what it is.

574
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,689
JEONGHAN DAILY
SEARCH AND SEIZURE REPORT

575
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,190
What do you think?

576
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,027
-This is ambiguous.
-What do you mean?

577
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:51,073
Will they presume he's guilty
only with the circumstantial evidence?

578
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,577
Or will they drag it out as a case
with no conclusive evidence

579
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,870
to let it blow over?

580
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,330
They can go either way with this.

581
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,751
That means it depends on
how the prosecution handles the case.

582
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,548
Did you file for the nullity
of your dismissal?

583
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,091
Yes.

584
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,011
I'll have them give the ruling
as soon as possible.

585
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,472
And you will be reinstated soon.

586
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,767
-Thank you.
-But the problem is

587
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,147
that you…

588
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,401
There's something I realized
a little too late after I got in all this.

589
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,698
Even though the whole thing is a mess,
there's one clear principle.

590
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,951
What goes around comes around.

591
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,288
Once Jeong-seok

592
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,666
gets through this, he will
rise even higher than you.

593
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,504
I will have him repay me
for what I did to you then.

594
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,599
YOO JEONG-SEOK

595
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,398
Jeong-ryeol.

596
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,029
Why did you not take my calls?

597
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,824
I'm sorry. I had something
to take care of by myself.

598
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,161
It's not something
you can take care of by yourself.

599
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,288
Have a drink.

600
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:28,045
When I was a police reporter,
we drank here a lot.

601
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,424
When I lost my scoop
and you lost your case.

602
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,842
I remember us being like that.

603
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,221
I wondered when we'd ever be successful.

604
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,099
But I became an editor
and you became a minister.

605
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,518
Isn't the world a funny place?

606
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,277
Everything will be all right. Don't worry.

607
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,736
I'll have Gi-tae reinstated

608
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,281
as the Chief Prosecutor
of Incheon District Prosecutors' Office.

609
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,117
But it will take some time.

610
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,160
Hang in there until then.

611
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,663
Can you stay

612
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,207
out of it this once?

613
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,335
I've never disappointed you before.

614
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:14,091
I'll take care of it myself.
Just trust me and stay still.

615
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,176
What will you do by yourself?

616
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,847
Are you doing this for my sake?

617
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,558
Yes, I am.

618
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,729
I'm always worried about you
as if you're my child.

619
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:31,483
Mom always told me
not to let you get your own way

620
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,736
because you think you're always right.

621
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,156
But you listen to me, so I should
stick around you and nag at you.

622
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,282
That's just…

623
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,412
That's when I was involved
in student movements.

624
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,832
Now, I'm supposed to take care of you.

625
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,626
You're right.

626
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,046
You don't need me around anymore.

627
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,091
You've already become
a great person without me.

628
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,969
Jeong-seok, are you…

629
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,639
Jeong-ryeol. You trust me, don't you?

630
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,185
I've always had plans.

631
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,483
Hey, how could you make a joke right now?

632
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,776
It's not done yet.

633
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,029
When I'm done planning,
I'll brief you right away.

634
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,864
I'm sure you'll accept it.

635
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,493
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Sure.

636
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,535
Can I trust you?

637
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,413
Once this is over,

638
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,042
I might be looking down at you
from way up there.

639
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,001
Just brace yourself.

640
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,340
All right. I hope that happens.

641
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,884
Let's drink to me today.

642
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,095
Cheers.

643
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,474
You'll be all right, Jeong-seok.

644
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:57,444
Ma'am, my younger brother
loves stir-fried spicy pork.

645
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,905
-We will have one more.
-Okay.

646
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,409
SEOBU POLICE STATION

647
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,997
The prosecutor says it's too soon to issue
an arrest warrant for Yoo Jeong-seok.

648
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,752
It means the circumstantial evidence
from the search is not enough.

649
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,629
Nam Guk-hyeon said

650
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:19,258
Yoo Jeong-seok killed
both Jo Seong-gi and Jang Jin-su.

651
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,468
But we can't believe
Nam Guk-hyeon's statement yet.

652
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,721
There's a chance
that he killed Jang Jin-su

653
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,974
and is trying to frame
Yoo Jeong-seok for that.

654
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,394
Anyway, we can be sure
that Yoo Jeong-seok killed Jo Seong-gi.

655
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,229
If we pounce on that,

656
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,815
we may be able to get him
to talk about Jang Jin-su's case.

657
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,277
If the case is transferred
to the prosecution like this,

658
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,611
it's obvious what will happen.

659
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,823
Yoo Jeong-ryeol said he wouldn't be
involved in the police investigation,

660
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,408
but the prosecution will have to

661
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,452
walk on eggshells
around the Minister of Justice.

662
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,871
And I'm sure Yoo Jeong-seok knows that.

663
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,374
He knows dragging it out will
give him an advantage.

664
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,128
Gosh, we are almost there,
but we're in a stalemate.

665
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,298
If we fail to catch Yoo Jeong-seok,
we might miss Oh Jong-tae as well.

666
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,594
I heard we will have a new chief soon.

667
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,721
He will try
to walk all over us right away.

668
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,141
He wouldn't want to do anything to get
on the wrong side of the higher-ups.

669
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,437
We've already issued a summons
for Yoo Jeong-seok, so let's wait.

670
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,523
Will he come?

671
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,654
Yes, Ms. Jin.

672
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,408
I'm still hungover,
so I can't think straight.

673
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,538
Maybe this is the alcohol talking.

674
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,081
And I might regret telling you this.

675
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:37,753
Once I sober up, I might say
it was all just a lie.

676
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,590
But I have to tell you this now.

677
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,302
Mr. Yoo told me everything.

678
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,598
I see.

679
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,225
Okay.

680
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:58,357
Yoo Jeong-seok confessed to his crimes
to Reporter Jin Seo-kyung.

681
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,696
He killed both Jo Seong-gi
and Jang Jin-su.

682
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,328
62 RU 9513

683
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,251
SEOBU POLICE STATION

684
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,386
Yoo Jeong-seok speaking.

685
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,555
Where should I go?

686
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,519
Thank you for complying with the summons.

687
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,648
If you have anything to say
before the interrogation, say it.

688
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,400
Just so you know,

689
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,404
we heard that you admitted to your crimes.

690
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,493
Do you want me to confess
to my crimes now?

691
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,955
Detectives should let the evidence speak.

692
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,459
You can't force me to confess
to my crimes with no clear evidence.

693
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,044
It's dereliction of duties.

694
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,297
What?

695
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,843
We will ask you questions then.

696
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,096
A reporter's job is
to reveal hidden truths.

697
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,892
What happened when you met
Jo Seong-gi that night?

698
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,437
And what happened to Jang Jin-su

699
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,564
who was killed in the same place
at the same time?

700
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,109
Reveal the truth that you witnessed
that day as a reporter.

701
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,112
If you hide the truth about that day,

702
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,115
it will also be dereliction of duties.

703
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,202
It's not like reporters can
reveal all the truths.

704
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,164
But I can assure you

705
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,875
that I've never lied with my articles
my whole life.

706
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,006
I will write about my story
in the paper tomorrow morning.

707
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,094
Are you saying you will confess
to your crimes with your article?

708
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,512
It's not just about me.

709
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,141
I will also talk about the truth
I know about Lee Dae-cheol's case.

710
00:48:56,933 --> 00:49:00,103
It will also include Oh Jong-tae
whom you've been dying to catch.

711
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,815
Why do you have to do all that?

712
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:09,196
I've done many things that I'm ashamed of
as a person.

713
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,073
But as a reporter,

714
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,576
I don't want to be ashamed of anything.

715
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,914
Is he saying he will admit to his crimes?

716
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,542
I don't know. I think he's just bluffing.

717
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:29,466
Then can we request
an arrest warrant and wait?

718
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,843
I'm not going to run away.

719
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,721
I'll be where you can find me.

720
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,392
Then I will

721
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,439
trust your conscience
as a reporter and wait.

722
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,336
MR. YOO JEONG-SEOK

723
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,759
-Yes, Mr. Yoo.
-Where are you?

724
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,387
-Home.
-Did you not go to work today?

725
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,055
I've been on leave since yesterday.

726
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,560
Come to the office for a moment.
I have one last task to give you.

727
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,687
Mr. Yoo.

728
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,859
I told the police
about what you said to me.

729
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,445
Just come. I'll wait.

730
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:32,946
Mr. Yoo.

731
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,142
I'm sorry to disturb your leave.

732
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:07,147
As I said earlier,
I told the police about you.

733
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,315
Don't worry about it.

734
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,401
If I were you, I would have done the same.

735
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,946
You just did your job as a reporter.

736
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,366
If you tell me it wasn't true…

737
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,120
If you say that you made that up
because you were upset with me,

738
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,164
I will believe you.

739
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,794
Will you be all right?
I need you to write an article now.

740
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,629
What article in this situation?

741
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,880
About Lee Dae-cheol's case.

742
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,759
Lee Dae-cheol was wrongfully executed,

743
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,179
and Oh Jong-tae is the real culprit
of Yoon Ji-seon's case.

744
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,264
Write an article stating it's a fact.

745
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,101
And I will write
an article myself as well.

746
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,605
About the real culprit of Jo Seong-gi
and Jang Jin-su's murder case.

747
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,233
It's Yoo Jeong-seok.

748
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,277
-Mr. Yoo.
-You know

749
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,280
that Oh Jong-tae used me
to get away with his murder charge, right?

750
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,241
You can include it in the article.

751
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,910
If you need my comments, just tell me.

752
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,912
Why are you telling me
to write this article?

753
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,664
Why?

754
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,834
If you really need a reason,

755
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,295
I'd say I want to show one thing for sure.

756
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,299
That Jeonghan Daily
only reports the truth.

757
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,473
Okay. I'll work on it.

758
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,869
POLICE FINALLY PROVED
LEE DAE-CHEOL INNOCENT

759
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,711
I AM A MURDERER

760
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,675
We can publish it with no revision.

761
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,052
-Well done.
-What are you going to do now?

762
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,847
I feel somewhat relieved.

763
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,766
It's been weighing on my mind
the whole time.

764
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,352
Thank you.

765
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,731
Thanks to you, I can at least
keep my conscience as a reporter.

766
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,818
I just don't understand why you wrote…

767
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:20,864
Why? Do you think this is my suicide note?

768
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,408
Killing a person is obviously wrong.

769
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:28,038
But there aren't many people who have
the courage to admit to their crimes.

770
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,165
Please don't get the wrong idea.

771
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,502
One of my senior reporters
once told me this.

772
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,674
If he's ever found dead, it's murder,
so I have to report the case.

773
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,094
I'd like to say the same thing to you.

774
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,805
Why would you say such a thing?

775
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,517
I'm just saying I'm not so irresponsible
as to kill myself.

776
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,774
I believe I still have
something left to do.

777
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,692
Okay.

778
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,111
I'll get going then.

779
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:02,989
Seo-kyung.

780
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,493
During your job interview,

781
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,705
you said you applied for the job
to become a reporter like me.

782
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,334
I'm sorry

783
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,628
that I didn't set

784
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,214
an example for you.

785
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,468
What you did today as a reporter.

786
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,097
I will remember it
until the end of my career.

787
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,079
POLICE FINALLY PROVED
LEE DAE-CHEOL INNOCENT

788
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,249
It says Incheon Seobu Police Station here.

789
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,918
My gosh.

790
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,088
I told you to buy one paper
and share it all together.

791
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,172
Do-chang.

792
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,093
Isn't the last paragraph
of Ms. Jin's article so touching?

793
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,220
"The police and judicial authorities say

794
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,931
what made it possible for them
to prove Lee Dae-cheol's innocence

795
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,766
is the firm determination

796
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,519
of Defective Kang Do-chang
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

797
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,440
Sergeant Kang attended
Lee Dae-cheol's retrial

798
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,150
and admitted to the faulty investigation.

799
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,652
Even after Lee Dae-cheol's execution,

800
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,613
despite the ongoing pressure
from the police organization,

801
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,866
he didn't give up on the reinvestigation.

802
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,119
The police believe the exemplary case
of Sergeant Kang

803
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,121
who pursued the truth until the end

804
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,707
as a homicide detective

805
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,585
will restore the public image
of the police

806
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,839
who have been under criticism
for its unfair investigation practices."

807
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:50,221
Gosh, why did Reporter Jin
write only about me?

808
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,475
It's not like I did all the work.
I wasn't the only one.

809
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,643
Well, we are okay with that,

810
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,772
but Detective Oh must be
quite disappointed.

811
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,025
-It also talks about Detective Oh.
-It does?

812
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:05,487
"The police who have been under criticism
for its unfair investigation practices."

813
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,489
Isn't this about Detective Oh?

814
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,823
-Hey.
-Right.

815
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,493
I guess you're right. That's about me.

816
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:17,248
Hey, it's not about Detective Oh.
It's about you.

817
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,708
-Gosh.
-Hello.

818
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,168
-Hello, sir.
-Oh, gosh.

819
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,544
-Hello, sir.
-Are you doing fine?

820
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,797
What are you doing here,
Former Chief Moon?

821
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,092
-Hey, Kang Do-chang.
-Yes?

822
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,261
Why does it say nothing about me?

823
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,931
I'm the one who supported you
the whole time.

824
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,141
But why does the article say
nothing about me?

825
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,185
Well, that's because…

826
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,561
I'm saying it's good.

827
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,985
What good can come
from being mentioned in the article?

828
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,197
Anyway, you lunatics
from the Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.

829
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,533
You guys finally scored big.

830
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,288
Five years ago, I killed
Detective Jo Seong-gi

831
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:01,084
and Sergeant Jang Jin-su
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

832
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,838
This is the last article I'm writing
as a reporter of Jeonghan Daily

833
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,299
to reveal the truth for our readers.

834
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,553
I was considering turning myself in,

835
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,764
but the police had already spotted

836
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,559
Lee Dae-cheol as the culprit
for Jang Jin-su's case.

837
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,436
And no one cared about Jo Seong-gi

838
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,104
who had been living under a fake name.

839
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,859
Had I remained silent,
it would've been a perfect crime.

840
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,610
LATE YOO JEONG-SEON

841
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,529
Now, through this article,

842
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,283
I'd like to ask my colleagues in the press
and our readers

843
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,535
for their forgiveness.

844
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,673
LATE LEE DAE-CHEOL

845
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,889
And to Lee Dae-cheol
who was wrongfully executed,

846
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,433
I did something
that can never be forgiven.

847
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,352
Lee Dae-cheol…

848
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,229
LATE LEE DAE-CHEOL

849
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,772
died because of me.

850
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,288
JEONGHAN DAILY

851
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,676
Hello, Mr. Yoo.

852
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,514
How am I supposed to take this?

853
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,642
I said I'd get you a big gift.
Do you remember that?

854
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,937
I see. So the gift was
a ticket to damnation?

855
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,106
No. I still have another gift for you.

856
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,484
Let's meet.

857
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,153
I'd like to give it to you in person.

858
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,531
What more do you have left
after revealing the whole thing?

859
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,201
Did you know that Jo Seong-dae,
whom you had hired for the murder,

860
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,704
was the younger brother of Jo Seong-gi
whom I murdered?

861
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,250
Jo Seong-dae knew
that I killed his brother,

862
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,085
so he threatened me.

863
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,419
And I have the recording.

864
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,006
What kind of gift is that?

865
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:17,178
Don't you think it might prove
that I ordered him to kill Park Gun-ho

866
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,597
to cover up Lee Dae-cheol's case?

867
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,308
I don't understand

868
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,728
why you'd get me a gift like that.

869
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,274
I don't want you to reveal
the video file you have.

870
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,360
I don't want my family to watch it.

871
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,904
With an additional charge
for instigating murder,

872
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,865
my sentence won't change that much.

873
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,409
I get it.

874
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,953
I need to listen to the file
before making any decision.

875
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,538
Where can I

876
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,040
get that gift?

877
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,792
That's just what you read in the article.

878
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,836
We can't reach him at the moment.

879
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:53,172
There's nothing more I can tell you.

880
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,550
You should go ask the police, not us.

881
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,595
-Yes.
-I'll call you back right away.

882
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,555
Yes.

883
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,267
My article is already fact-checked.

884
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,562
Yes. I take full responsibility
for what I wrote.

885
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,565
-Okay.
-You can't ask us about it.

886
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,071
Yes, Mr. Yoo.

887
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,574
Seo-kyung, I need you
to call the police for me.

888
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,075
About what?

889
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,620
I'm meeting with Oh Jong-tae,
but it doesn't feel good.

890
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,580
Ask the police for my personal protection.

891
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,498
Why? What did Oh Jong-tae do?

892
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,459
I've texted you the address.

893
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,960
Send some cops there first.

894
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,713
Why would you meet with Oh Jong-tae
when it doesn't feel good?

895
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,759
Because I have to deal with him.

896
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,802
Why would you deal with him?

897
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,389
Oh Jong-tae and I made Lee Dae-cheol die.

898
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,309
I have to make him admit to it
no matter what.

899
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,810
That's the last thing I have to do.

900
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,146
That's what the police have to do.

901
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,898
Don't do anything dangerous.

902
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,399
I guess my phone battery is dying.

903
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,235
-I'll call you later.
-Mr. Yoo.

904
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,548
Detective Oh, did you get
the address I texted you?

905
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,966
Go there right away.

906
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,844
Mr. Yoo is meeting with Oh Jong-tae there.
He's in danger.

907
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,638
Hurry.

908
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:49,038
One of my senior reporters
once told me this.

909
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:52,875
If he's ever found dead, it's murder,
so I have to report the case.

910
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,255
I'd like to say the same thing to you.

911
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,239
First,

912
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,451
let me listen to the recording.

913
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,330
There's no such recording.

914
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,961
I am your gift.

915
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,672
I'm the gift I prepared for you.

916
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,728
-Was it you?
-What about me?

917
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,229
Did I push him off?

918
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,648
He did it.

919
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,693
Forget it.

920
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:08,613
You won't believe me
no matter what I say now.

921
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:12,408
What are you waiting for?
Go check up on him.

922
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,119
Jae-hong, call the ambulance and KCSI.

923
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:17,038
-Okay.
-Take him to the police station.

924
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,753
How did you manage
to show up right at that moment?

925
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,589
Is this how you framed
Lee Dae-cheol for murder?

926
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,717
How dare you say Lee Dae-cheol's name?

927
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,344
Is he the suspect of this case?

928
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:17,306
Should I be glad that you're back
as the Chief Prosecutor?

929
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,432
It's not bad.

930
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,352
If you know the truth,
you should write an article about it.

931
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,436
I just realized

932
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,690
that the truth might end up
ruining my life.

933
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,274
There's one thing I want to know.

934
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,528
So he did it all by himself.
Let's catch him again.

935
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,446
Only then will it be over.

936
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,908
You'll never get away with it
unless I die. Ever.

937
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:41,747
