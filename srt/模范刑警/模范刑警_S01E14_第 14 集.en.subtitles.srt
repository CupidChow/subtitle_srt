1
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,251
SEOBU POLICE STATION

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,300
You made Jo Seong-dae

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,886
kill Park Gun-ho, right?

4
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,929
Just admit it already.

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,682
Stop acting like you're innocent.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,393
We found clear evidence
that proves you killed Yoon Ji-seon.

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,107
You told Park Gun-ho
to kill Lee Dae-cheol in prison.

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,234
But instead of doing what he was asked,

9
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,904
he went around
claiming Lee Dae-cheol's innocence,

10
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,238
so I bet you got nervous.

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,992
That's why you made Jo Seong-dae kill him.
Isn't that right?

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,328
Why are you looking for the evidence now?

13
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,455
You should've done so then.

14
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,374
You and Guk-hyeon fabricated the evidence.

15
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,292
"Fabricate"?

16
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,003
"Fabricate"?

17
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,297
Even if that's true,

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,924
you should've figured that out back then.

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,928
And what was his name again? Park Gun-ho?

20
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,807
The police already announced
that he took his own life.

21
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,601
You already told the press that.

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,187
Why are you going back on what you said?

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,148
-And Nam Guk-hyeon…
-Nam Guk-hyeon.

24
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,401
Isn't he also a cop?

25
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,864
In the end, this proves that the police
are incompetent and corrupt.

26
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,202
And you're pretty much
admitting that right now. Do you disagree?

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,206
If you go ahead and admit
that you and Nam Guk-hyeon

28
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,126
worked together to fabricate the case,

29
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,089
we'll go ahead and admit that
the police are incompetent and corrupt.

30
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,887
There's also another way
to make a fool of the police force.

31
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,222
Do you want to know what it is?

32
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,933
It's by confessing
that you killed Yoon Ji-seon.

33
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,020
The retrial for that case
has already ended.

34
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,689
So we can no longer punish you for that.

35
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,693
It'll be a really good chance for you

36
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,820
to humiliate the police.

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,575
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

38
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,286
I'll think about it.

39
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:46,583
Your arrest warrant wasn't issued
for Yoon Ji-seon's murder.

40
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,543
It's for instigating Park Gun-ho's murder.

41
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,503
So you'll only be punished for that.

42
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,506
It pisses me off,
but that's just the reality.

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,593
If you repent your sins and plead guilty,

44
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,971
we'll just stop here.

45
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,017
So you want me to help you prove

46
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,104
that Lee Dae-cheol was executed
for a crime he didn't commit.

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,981
Is this what you want?

48
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,567
You killed Yoon Ji-seon.

49
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,404
And Lee Dae-cheol was executed
in your place.

50
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,950
Do you not even have
the slightest bit of conscience?

51
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
You don't think

52
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,456
I killed Detective Jang Jin-su too,
don't you?

53
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,960
You think he was murdered
by someone else, right?

54
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,924
Then you can't just blame it all
on the guy who killed Yoon Ji-seon.

55
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,259
The person who killed the detective

56
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,470
is also responsible
for Lee Dae-cheol's death.

57
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,890
Catch him and let me talk to him.

58
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,519
Then I'll discuss it with him
and think about what to do.

59
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,981
Damn it.

60
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,736
My lawyer will get pissed at me again
for talking too much.

61
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,820
Let's end it here.

62
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,493
My gosh.

63
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,664
He won't get locked up for that long.

64
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:12,043
And he won't even learn what he did wrong
until the day he dies.

65
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,675
He may act all confident,

66
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,552
but deep down inside,
he's actually really anxious and scared.

67
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:22,929
I can tell.

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,141
He realized he might actually go to jail
for the first time in his life.

69
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,102
That's what he's scared of. He's in fear.

70
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,189
He met Yoo Jeong-ryeol
so he could escape from that fear.

71
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,233
Yoo Jeong-ryeol.

72
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,696
What if we end up
having to let him go again?

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,533
The NFS just sent us the DNA analysis
of the skeletons we found.

74
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,786
-What does it say?
-It's Jo Seong-gi.

75
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,914
His DNA was in our database
because he used to be a cop.

76
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,332
So it came out pretty quickly.

77
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,593
You know Jo Seong-gi, right?

78
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,345
Yes.

79
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:09,058
Do you remember meeting him
five years ago?

80
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,895
It's been about five years.

81
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,023
The remains turned out to be Jo Seong-gi.

82
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,900
The estimated time of his murder
is five years ago.

83
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,320
But he was reported missing

84
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,573
right around the time when he met you.

85
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,450
Are you saying I'm a suspect?

86
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,410
We have no choice.

87
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,788
We think you were the last person he met
before he died.

88
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,250
You know about my past
with Jo Seong-gi, right?

89
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,712
And I'm sure you know
that I kept looking for him.

90
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,923
So I guess it's natural to think of me
as a key suspect.

91
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,675
But it won't be easy.

92
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,429
Circumstantial evidence won't be enough
to turn me into a suspect.

93
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,764
Yes, you're right.

94
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,640
You're an editor at Jeonghan Daily,

95
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,768
and your brother is
the minister of justice.

96
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,436
So it'll be difficult to investigate.

97
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,772
I understand why you think
I might have killed Jo Seong-gi

98
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,192
due to the personal grudge
I had against him.

99
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,154
But five years have passed,
and the only remains are his bones.

100
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,199
So it'll be very difficult
to find direct evidence to prove

101
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,201
that I was the one who killed him.

102
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,536
That means it'll be hard
to solve this case

103
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,873
without the culprit's confession.

104
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,335
That day, Detective Jang was also murdered

105
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,547
at the same time and place
of the incident.

106
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,965
You know that, right?

107
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,050
Are you saying

108
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,138
you're open to the possibility
that I might have killed him as well?

109
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,433
We also think
it could've been a coincidence.

110
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,479
According to Seo-kyung's article,

111
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,314
Jo Seong-gi's remains

112
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,234
were found a lot further away
from where Jang Jin-su's corpse was found.

113
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,528
If the culprit killed them both,

114
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,239
why would he have buried them
so far away from each other?

115
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,909
Wouldn't it be more logical
to bury them together?

116
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,203
Logically speaking, yes.

117
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:57,625
But what if the culprit was also familiar
with murder scenes like us?

118
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,419
He might have wanted to flip that logic.

119
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,840
The culprit burned the vehicle
that had evidence inside

120
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,341
and buried the body beneath it.

121
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,010
He obviously tried to fool the police

122
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,055
because he knew it's important for us
to preserve the scene.

123
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,270
That sounds pretty plausible,
but that doesn't mean it's a fact.

124
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,106
It's going to take a lot of effort

125
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,400
to turn your assumptions into facts.

126
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,695
Today, we came to see you as a witness,
so we'll stop here.

127
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,196
Thank you for your cooperation.

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,450
Feel free to call me
if you need my help to solve the case.

129
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,454
But not before the copy deadline.
I have a lot of articles to read.

130
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,331
I should get going now.
I have a meeting soon.

131
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,507
My gosh. I'll be honest.

132
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,302
This case is too big for us.

133
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,766
Yes, Chief.

134
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,727
Okay, I'll be right there.

135
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,148
Maybe I should talk about this
with the chief.

136
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,608
Do you think he'll be of any help?

137
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,693
Three is better than two.

138
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,571
Come inside.

139
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,866
Hey, guys.

140
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,035
You didn't eat, did you?

141
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,703
Let's eat together.

142
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,914
Have a seat.

143
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,169
-Enjoy your meal, sir.
-Thanks. By the way,

144
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,881
tell your chef to use better meat
for the sweet and sour pork.

145
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,008
-It tastes different these days.
-Okay, sir.

146
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,636
You guys don't have
anywhere to go today, right?

147
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,305
Even if you do, it doesn't matter.

148
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,809
Our job requires a little bit of alcohol.
You can't do this job with a sane mind.

149
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,770
Why did you bring alcohol to your office?

150
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,189
-Is everything okay?
-Just take off the plastic wrap.

151
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,316
-Do I need to do that, too?
-Okay, sir.

152
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,905
I got this as a bribe.

153
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,034
It's great. It's really strong.
You knock out and come back pretty fast.

154
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,537
Why would you accept that as a bribe?

155
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,915
You confiscated everything from me.
I barely managed to keep this.

156
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,960
If I knew this was going to happen,
I should've kept all the alcohol.

157
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,963
Then I would have had fun drinking them
during my break.

158
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,049
What? Why are you taking a break?

159
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,885
I want to take a break
from all the trouble you keep causing.

160
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,138
Were you told to do so
from the higher-ups?

161
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,349
What do they have a problem with
this time?

162
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:23,145
I realized that you can't
hide your sins forever.

163
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:28,192
They come out one by one
without my knowing about it.

164
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,028
That's why people tell you not to sin.

165
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,114
Drink up.

166
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,994
What happened, sir? What's going on?
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

167
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,662
I was dismissed from office.

168
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,290
-I'll be on standby.
-What?

169
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,334
Is it because of the case
we're investigating?

170
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,919
I have to say, I'm really upset.

171
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,757
I should have fired all of you
while I was still in office.

172
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,134
But I didn't even get a chance.

173
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,762
This is so unfair.
We should file a petition.

174
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,347
They can't just fire you

175
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,891
for investigating something
they didn't want us to investigate.

176
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,019
You guys are investigating a case

177
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,105
that the higher-ups didn't approve of.
Isn't that more ridiculous?

178
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,149
-But sir--
-See? I told you we should have

179
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,526
handed the case over to the head office.

180
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,321
What you're doing is ridiculous.

181
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,530
But I like it.

182
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,287
Don't stop just because I got fired.

183
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
If you get intimidated

184
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,958
and fail to do your jobs
just because I got fired,

185
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,668
I really won't be able to sleep at night.

186
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,922
I want you guys to arrest

187
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,385
every single person
who's involved in this case.

188
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,059
Who are you?

189
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,894
-What do you think you're doing?
-Who are you?

190
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,437
Who do you think you are?

191
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,773
Get up.

192
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,732
What?

193
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,485
Get lost, okay? Come here.

194
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,820
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

195
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,615
You little…

196
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,368
Yes, I just watched it.

197
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,413
But what does this have anything to do
with Minister Yoo Jeong-ryeol?

198
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,669
Okay, it's going to take me
about 30 minutes.

199
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,212
I'll see you there.

200
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,646
If you have any questions, just ask me.

201
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,982
Don't try to find out through the police.

202
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,987
I'll let you know through my article.

203
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,323
If you have anything to point out,
you can tell me then.

204
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,588
Should I call you a cab, sir?

205
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,006
No, it's fine.

206
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,885
I want to walk a little.
You guys should go inside.

207
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,014
Go inside already.

208
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,767
Stop following me!

209
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,738
SEOBU POLICE STATION

210
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,265
He worked here for over 20 years.

211
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,436
We kicked him out of his own home.

212
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,690
I don't know what's right anymore.

213
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,610
I'm starting to get confused.

214
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,168
About the video I got earlier--

215
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,379
Kim Myeong-seon uploaded the video
on our online bulletin board.

216
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,881
It got deleted right away.

217
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,175
It doesn't matter who uploaded it.

218
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,053
What matters more is
who deleted it and why.

219
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,639
You think this has something to do
with Minister Yoo?

220
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,934
Incheon Jeil Investment Trust
is owned by Oh Jong-tae.

221
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,647
And Oh Jong-tae was called in as a witness
to answer questions at the hearing.

222
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,359
The garbage dump is located
in Minister Yoo's constituency.

223
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,279
Isn't this more than enough
to draw a rough sketch?

224
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,115
What do you want me to do?

225
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,617
The cops will do the investigation.

226
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,913
But if the press doesn't show interest,
the investigation will come to nothing

227
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,957
based on the logic of power.

228
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,792
I want you to prevent that.

229
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,588
As you already know,
our editor is Minister Yoo's brother.

230
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,506
You're a reporter.

231
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,967
Isn't this appealing?

232
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,469
The police are also involved in this.

233
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,722
If things go wrong,
you might end up backstabbing them.

234
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,599
-I know.
-Then why are you doing this?

235
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,144
Are you trying to take revenge
because they neglected you?

236
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,564
No, that's foolish.

237
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,692
What I want

238
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,694
is power.

239
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,905
I want to be powerful enough
to break down the wall in front of me.

240
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,619
Okay, let's give it a try.

241
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,047
Oh, my goodness. Hey.

242
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,759
My gosh, seriously.

243
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,097
You're not even that well.
Just take care of your health.

244
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,058
Don't collapse
and make me go to the hospital again.

245
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,810
I promised to clean.

246
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,938
That only applies to your room.
No, never mind. I'll clean your room.

247
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,064
You just need to…

248
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,444
Never mind.

249
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,030
You quit your part-time job, didn't you?

250
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,867
Yes, I told the manager
that I'll be taking a break.

251
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,786
-How are your eyes?
-They're no longer bloodshot.

252
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,704
Let me see.

253
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,749
Just go inside and rest.

254
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,084
Don't do anything I never asked you to do.

255
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,425
Hey, what's up?

256
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,554
Oh, my gosh. Are you serious?

257
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,642
Jae-ung went there himself
and asked you to teach him judo?

258
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,060
Goodness gracious.

259
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,522
Why does he suddenly want to learn judo?
Did you ask him why?

260
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,192
What?

261
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,569
Really?

262
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
He said that?

263
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,408
He knows I used to be a judo player?

264
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,786
He wants to be like me?

265
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,046
PRIZE CERTIFICATE

266
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,965
Okay. Hey.

267
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,967
Teach him well.

268
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,263
If he forgets to pay, just let me know.

269
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,059
I'll pay for it even if it means
I need to work at a restaurant.

270
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,687
Okay, do me a favor.

271
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,188
Bye.

272
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,531
My boy, Jae-ung.

273
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,534
Jae-ung.

274
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
My son.

275
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,248
SEOBU POLICE STATION

276
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,516
Hey.

277
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,309
Where's the chief?

278
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,103
He was dismissed. Don't you know that?

279
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,231
Oh, was that starting from today?

280
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,609
I should have checked. What a pity.

281
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,570
I came to say goodbye before he left.

282
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,822
-Sang-mi.
-I'm glad you're here.

283
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,366
I was going to go downstairs
to see you anyway.

284
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,952
Tell me the truth.
You did this, didn't you?

285
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,121
Yes, it's my job.

286
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,540
You should have fired me instead.

287
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,293
Why dismiss the chief?
He did nothing wrong.

288
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,337
If I fire you, things won't go as planned.

289
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,632
Like I said, you just need to push ahead.

290
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,387
Ms. Jin told me everything yesterday.

291
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,433
I heard your target is Yoo Jeong-seok.

292
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,602
If you mess with him,
Yoo Jeong-ryeol will make a move.

293
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,520
He'll do something
to stop the investigation.

294
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,359
I helped Chief Moon avoid the trouble
by making him leave for a while.

295
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,652
What?

296
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,279
We don't have time.

297
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,157
The higher-ups will appoint someone

298
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,826
who will fully cooperate with them
to replace Chief Moon.

299
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,622
This needs to go public before that.

300
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,918
Like I told you, information is power.

301
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,463
And power can only be defeated with power.

302
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,549
I also told you not to talk too fancy.

303
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,221
What do you think you're doing here?

304
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,514
My gosh.

305
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,474
Who are you to do this to me?

306
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,226
-Who do you think you are?
-Stop here.

307
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,185
Get lost!

308
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,813
It's this guy.

309
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,316
Do-chang, we have so much work to do.

310
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,443
Why do you want us to catch a gangster?

311
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,239
It's a little complicated.
But let me try to keep it simple.

312
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,827
Back when Minister Yoo Jeong-ryeol
got elected in his constituency…

313
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,705
I mean, he was… How should I explain this?

314
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,377
Just do as you're told and catch him.

315
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,795
-Okay.
-Okay.

316
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,590
Why is it so hard to explain?

317
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,108
I'm Kwon Jae-hong
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

318
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,444
You're under arrest
without a warrant for assault.

319
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,739
Let me finish my reps.

320
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,116
I have a routine.

321
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,706
Wait a minute. I lost count.

322
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,957
I'll start over from five.

323
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,585
Routine, my ass.

324
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,878
-Five.
-Come here.

325
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,754
-I'll be your personal trainer.
-Six.

326
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,048
-I'll be your trainer for the day.
-Gosh, stop it.

327
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,593
-Eight.
-Yes, I'm listening.

328
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,053
Who is that punk?

329
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,307
My gosh, come on.

330
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,311
Find out his phone number and address.

331
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:52,107
I'll kick his ass and make sure
he'll never be able to do anything again.

332
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,066
What?

333
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,987
His uncle is the head
of a precinct station?

334
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,406
What a joke.

335
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,952
Does he seriously think
that's something to brag about?

336
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,497
Tell him to cut the bullshit.

337
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,627
-Okay.
-We need to teach him who's boss.

338
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,961
Okay.

339
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,504
WOMEN'S JUDO CHAMPION

340
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,639
Can you give this to my son?
Tell him it's a gift from his mom.

341
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,432
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

342
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,768
I bet he'll love it even more.

343
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,855
No, I can't.
His dad put a restraining order on me.

344
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,815
Can't you just meet him in secret?

345
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,984
I'll sneak him out.

346
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,030
No.

347
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,367
I don't want to make him lie
and say he didn't meet me.

348
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:49,164
Plus, my son never once lied in his life.

349
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,500
He's too kind.

350
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,136
Is it yummy?

351
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,850
Do you like your mom's gold medal?

352
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,313
Your mom misses you a lot.

353
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,065
Don't you miss her?

354
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,109
I miss her.

355
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,736
But I can't meet her.

356
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,365
My dad told me she'll get arrested
if I meet her.

357
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,576
Hey, your uncle is a cop.

358
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,036
Don't you think he'll help?

359
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,127
No, I'm just going to hold it in.

360
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,336
I'll try not to miss her.

361
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,132
Oh, come on. If I were you, I'd visit her
and spend time with her every day.

362
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,093
Why do you keep saying that?

363
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,888
I told you
that I'm just going to hold it in.

364
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,475
I'll try to cope with it.

365
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,646
I don't want my mom to get arrested.

366
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,783
You're a really kind kid.

367
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,335
Who asked you to do this?

368
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,421
You were paid to beat him up, right?

369
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,007
No one asked me to do anything.

370
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,801
He glared at me first.

371
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,220
Come on. Let's not act like amateurs.

372
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,307
A neighborhood bully might beat someone up
for glaring at them.

373
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,727
But you used to work in a pretty big gang.

374
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,353
What do you take me for?

375
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,023
Are you saying I work for a gang?

376
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,194
You shouldn't accuse me
for something that's not true.

377
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,072
I beat him up because he pissed me off.

378
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,114
I did it for no reason.

379
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,785
Go ahead and get me locked up for assault.
If you can, that is.

380
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,332
My gosh, will you stop?

381
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,667
Damn it!

382
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,878
That asshole!

383
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:00,837
Just hold your anger.

384
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,132
I want to kill that son of a gun
and get him locked up in jail!

385
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,344
My gosh, will you please stop?
Lose your temper, will you?

386
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,055
My gosh. Damn it.

387
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,600
You bastard! Cross me one more time!

388
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,770
I'll break your back
and make sure you never walk again!

389
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,814
Will you stop? What's wrong with you?

390
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,899
If you keep doing this,
you'll get disciplined again.

391
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,442
Damn it!

392
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,610
My gosh!

393
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,239
My goodness.

394
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,074
What are you looking at?

395
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,793
-Did he just smirk?
-Let's not act like amateurs.

396
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,965
If you wanted to scare me,
you should've done it directly.

397
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,383
Or at least be brave enough

398
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,471
to hit me on my forehead with this
and make me bleed.

399
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,849
Go ahead and hit me.

400
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,936
Are you scared you might get disciplined?

401
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,105
It'll only last a few months.

402
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,899
Hit me.

403
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,277
Don't be scared. Just hit me.

404
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,998
He's sleeping right now.

405
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,249
You should hurry.

406
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,961
His dad called the judo instructor.

407
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,298
He told him he'll be here in two hours
and asked him to look after him.

408
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,301
You just need to get here before he comes.

409
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,138
Jae-ung is exhausted from exercising.
He'll be asleep for a while.

410
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,655
My baby.

411
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,677
GUKMIN JUDO DOJO

412
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,777
MS. KANG EUN-HUI

413
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,072
Ms. Kang, you need to get out of there.
His dad is here.

414
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,407
Hey.

415
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,702
I'll be there after I fetch my kid
and go grocery shopping. Okay, bye.

416
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,413
Hey, Min-sik!

417
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,126
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were my friend, Min-sik.

418
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,795
My goodness, I'm really sorry.

419
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,840
You look really young from behind.
I totally mistook you for someone else.

420
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,341
I'm sorry.

421
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,759
Have you lost your mind?

422
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,055
Hey, wait! Are you Min-sik's dad?

423
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,807
No, I'm not!

424
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,559
Oh, okay.

425
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,438
You even kind of look like him.
You're Min-sik's dad, aren't you?

426
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,939
No, I'm not.

427
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
I'm not his dad.

428
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,317
-Okay?
-I asked just in case.

429
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,069
Min-sik borrowed my money,
and he hasn't paid me back yet.

430
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,779
Listen, lady. I'm not his dad.

431
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,406
I'm sorry.

432
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,867
What is your problem? Seriously.

433
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,498
SEOBU POLICE STATION

434
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,465
Are you going to keep this up?

435
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,508
You can keep quiet,
but I still won't give up.

436
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,762
How many times have I told you?
I never received any money.

437
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,766
Okay, fine. Let's see who will win.

438
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,893
Listen to me, detective.

439
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,272
You're a busy fellow.
Stop wasting your time on me.

440
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,732
Let me give you a word of advice.

441
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,525
What? Advice?

442
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,237
I may not look like much,
but I know a lot of powerful people.

443
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,740
Once you find out who's behind me,

444
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,827
I swear you'll regret
having done this to me.

445
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,122
So if you don't want to end up
resenting me later on,

446
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,833
I advise you to just end it here.

447
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,419
I'm telling you this for your sake.

448
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,546
Hey, relax.

449
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,097
Let's take a break.

450
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,312
Damn it.

451
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,735
My temper isn't as bad as it used to be.

452
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,073
-Hey.
-Do-chang!

453
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,324
What are you doing?

454
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,577
We purposely met up near your office
because you told us you're busy.

455
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,248
Hey, I'm kind of busy
doing something right now.

456
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,750
Why is it so hard to meet you?

457
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,794
We're almost about to go home now.

458
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,296
What are you going to do?
Are you coming or not?

459
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,926
Hey, then why don't you guys
come here instead?

460
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,138
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

461
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,223
-Hello.
-Hey, you're here.

462
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,225
Are you doing a good job
of supporting Do-chang?

463
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,268
Of course, sir.

464
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,312
Hey, long time no see.

465
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,189
Hey, did you bring the others?

466
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,691
-Yes.
-Okay.

467
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,608
Come on in, boys.

468
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,444
-Okay.
-Got it.

469
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,237
-Look who's here.
-Hello.

470
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,739
-Hey.
-Have you been well?

471
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,365
-Hello.
-My goodness.

472
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,366
Look at you.

473
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,160
-It's good to see you.
-Hello.

474
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,619
Who's the big guy?

475
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,580
-Is it him?
-Yes.

476
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,501
Hey, it won't hurt to get to know them.

477
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,628
You should say hello to these guys.

478
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,797
He's Kim Seung-u,
a violent crimes unit captain

479
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,591
from Nambu Police Station.

480
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,551
He's in the community crime
investigation team.

481
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,094
-Jang Min-gyun.
-I'll see you around.

482
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,096
-Ko Min-ho from Yeonsu Police Station.
-Hi.

483
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,016
Du-chang, the best fighter
in Jungbu Police Station.

484
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,392
This punk didn't even flinch.

485
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,019
Baek Gyeong-hun
from Dongbu Police Station.

486
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,645
Kim Gi-dong. in the community crime
investigation team.

487
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,898
Lee Taek-jin
in the criminal intelligence team.

488
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,857
Hey, what's your name?

489
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,109
-My name is Kim Sang-gyun.
-Kim Sang-gyun.

490
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,445
Those guys are
in the criminal investigation division.

491
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,238
Hong Min-gi, Lee Su-hyeon,
and Hong Nan-hui.

492
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,950
Do you know
what these guys have in common?

493
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,536
They never let go of their target.

494
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
-He doesn't look nervous at all.
-My gosh.

495
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,875
As long as you stay in Incheon,

496
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,295
you'll have to see them day and night.

497
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,797
What about us?

498
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,465
What? Oh, right. I forgot our team.

499
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,259
-Come on and join.
-Hey, guys.

500
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,261
Don't leave out Team One.

501
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,056
Oh, I didn't see you there.
You guys are still here?

502
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,766
All right, you guys.

503
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,979
I may have nothing,
but these guys have my back.

504
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,650
Now that I showed you my guys,
why don't you show me yours?

505
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,320
Let's see which person has better support.

506
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,488
Let's see who wins.

507
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,365
Why don't we go for a drink?

508
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,742
-Sounds great.
-Sure.

509
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,036
-You should join.
-How about some pork belly?

510
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,705
I hope we get along, big guy.

511
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,500
Don't get too scared.

512
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,545
Come in.

513
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,050
I don't feel like drinking alone.

514
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,552
Would you like to keep me company?

515
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,306
My goodness, you draw really well.

516
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,559
You'll easily get into art school.

517
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,519
I still have a lot to learn.

518
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,900
Did you

519
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,653
see my son learn judo?

520
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,530
Yes, a little.

521
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,906
He's good, isn't he?

522
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,201
He takes after me, so he'll do well.

523
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,287
He has my bone structure.

524
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,371
I see.

525
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:18,459
What about you? How do you draw so well?
Who do you take after?

526
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,921
My dad.

527
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,299
Did he draw well?

528
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,050
I don't know. I just feel like

529
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,596
he would've drawn well.

530
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,308
You miss him, don't you?

531
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,566
I should hold it in.

532
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,986
Even Jae-ung is strong enough
to cope with it.

533
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,289
Thank you for today, Eun-hye.

534
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,082
Don't mention it.

535
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,545
You take after your dad,
so you'll draw really well

536
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,797
and become an amazing artist.

537
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,304
Isn't my son a real catch?

538
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,056
I bet he's going to be really popular.

539
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,350
Yes, I even fell for him today.

540
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,935
-Right?
-Yes.

541
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,645
I knew it.

542
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,403
Here's the call history

543
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,531
that shows that Mr. Nam called that thug
on the day of the incident.

544
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,203
And here's the bank record that shows
the money that Mr. Nam wired to him.

545
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,416
Is it okay to give me this
without a warrant?

546
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,044
Our division already had these files.

547
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,381
We already received a warrant back then,
so it'll be fine.

548
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,842
-Then why didn't you--
-I told you

549
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,971
that information always needs
to be exposed at the right timing.

550
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,264
Does that mean you guys always know

551
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,143
when to get back at people
if they mess with you?

552
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,315
I'd like to apologize
for crossing you in the past.

553
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,192
I won't ever mess with you again.

554
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,321
You're finally getting the message.

555
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:35,888
Lunatics from Violent Crimes Unit Team Two
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

556
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,350
Let's go catch the whale.

557
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,164
How is it being in politics?
Do you think it suits you?

558
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,541
I'm starting to get used to it.

559
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,211
I'm sure Jeong-seok already told you this.

560
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,132
I really tried hard to beat you.

561
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,761
Gosh, I failed in the end.

562
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,304
It's not easy.

563
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,722
Why did you want to see me?

564
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,769
I want to go back
to being friends with you.

565
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,232
Will that really change anything?

566
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,905
You do have a point. At our age,
we only like being friends

567
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,239
with those who bring us benefit.

568
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,035
It'd be nice if we could go for a drink,
but I'm too busy today.

569
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,079
Let's meet again next time.

570
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,917
I'm sorry,
but this will have to do for today.

571
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,878
I bet you have

572
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,839
a lot on your mind these days
because of Jeong-seok.

573
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,719
Things got complicated for him.

574
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,264
But if you think about it,
it all started in Incheon.

575
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,267
Don't you need someone
to take care of the mess?

576
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,900
Keep talking.

577
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,361
The chief prosecutor in Incheon
needs to be on your payroll

578
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,321
if you want this to end well.

579
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,326
I guess you're right.
I'll try to find the right person.

580
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,084
Let me be your person for a short while.

581
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,006
You?

582
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,175
Do you really think that's possible?

583
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,303
That depends on your decision.

584
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,016
If you choose to help me out,

585
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,644
I'll help Jeong-seok.

586
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,857
But that's all I'm going to do for you.

587
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,275
I won't do more than that.

588
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,986
It'll be too humiliating.

589
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,329
You're under arrest without a warrant
for bribery

590
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,123
and incitement to violence.

591
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,458
What?

592
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,211
You have the right to a lawyer

593
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,964
and the right to remain silent.

594
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,258
-Take him.
-Okay.

595
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,895
You called the press already?

596
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,314
You think we told them?

597
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,482
They always come on their own.

598
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,484
Do you admit to your allegations?

599
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,612
Is this related to Minister Yoo
in any kind of way?

600
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,198
Let's go.

601
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,824
Mr. Nam.

602
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,535
Sir.

603
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,209
You all read Seo-kyung's report, right?

604
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,335
-Yes.
-Yes.

605
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,796
This is too big for her
to handle by herself.

606
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,592
Jun-seok, I want you guys
to help her gather information.

607
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,760
This is going to be big.

608
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,804
This could involve Incheon City

609
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,350
as well as a high ranking official
from the police force or even a minister.

610
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,810
You can keep digging into this,

611
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,188
but keep sharing information
with the Ministry of Justice.

612
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,940
We can't just keep attacking them.

613
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,069
Sir, I get why you want us to do that.

614
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,405
But isn't that against the whole point?

615
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,324
It's the director's orders.

616
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,825
Then

617
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,328
I'll talk about it with Jun-seok
and keep things under control.

618
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,916
Okay, I just told you
the company's stance on this.

619
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,376
If this doesn't turn out well,

620
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,128
you'll have to take responsibility
for the consequences.

621
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,589
I'll keep that in mind.

622
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,264
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT

623
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,773
You guys worked so hard to get this far.
I feel so bad for you guys.

624
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,066
You failed again.

625
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,151
You must feel dejected.

626
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,070
This is just a process.
We already expected it.

627
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,530
A process?

628
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,157
So you still haven't given up on me?

629
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,368
You're not innocent
just because you didn't go to jail.

630
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,536
We can still investigate.

631
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,663
We'll hear the results
once we take things to court.

632
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,164
No one knows what will happen.

633
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,544
You never get into a fight
if you know you'll lose.

634
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,045
You have bad judgment this time.

635
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,422
How was the detention house?

636
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,341
I got to experience something new
thanks to you.

637
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,884
You'll have to get used to it.

638
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,304
Because you'll have to stay there
for a lot longer next time.

639
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,726
Ji-hyeok is rich enough to get by
even if he quits his job.

640
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,728
But not you, Detective Kang.

641
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,605
You don't need to worry about that.

642
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,525
There's someone in my family
who's really rich.

643
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,321
I'm going to keep him close
and live off him for the rest of my life.

644
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,573
So you don't need to worry.

645
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,660
Just go ahead and keep up your bullshit.
Let's go.

646
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,383
"Bullshit"?

647
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,761
"Bullshit"?

648
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,889
It must have been nice for you
since I wasn't around.

649
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,390
But too bad for you.

650
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,352
I'm back to keep up my bullshit.

651
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,103
I don't think that way, sir.

652
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,521
You should look forward to it.

653
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,151
I'll go back to being my old self.

654
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,111
I was too well-behaved.

655
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,072
That's why

656
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,575
people keep looking down on me.

657
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,078
Let's go.

658
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,170
You told me no one in your family is rich.

659
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,547
You told me they all ask you for help.

660
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,258
No, there's one guy. He's younger than me.

661
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,553
If things don't go well,
I plan to treat him like a big brother.

662
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,432
Age doesn't matter. If someone's rich,
they become your big brother.

663
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,725
Right, big brother?

664
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,688
I told you I'm going to donate my money
to Eun-hye, not you.

665
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,232
I know. I'm kidding.

666
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,151
I'll just have to bear
with the consequences.

667
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,986
So what if I become a bit poorer?

668
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,030
If I get fired,

669
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,783
I'll just have fun. Let's go, big brother.

670
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,993
Okay.

671
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,453
INCHEON METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

672
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,832
It all started when Kim Jin-se,
the president

673
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,751
of the Incheon Environmental Movement
got beaten up by a gangster.

674
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,921
I already checked that the video
was sent to the police.

675
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,006
But why didn't the police
do anything about it?

676
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,511
That's nonsense.

677
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,304
Maybe you're mistaken.

678
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,598
The victim filed a report

679
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,517
and even uploaded a petition online.

680
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,769
But of course, it got deleted right away.

681
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:43,149
Doesn't that prove
that the police tried to cover it up?

682
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:48,320
Ms. Jin, why do you think we arrested
a congressman's secretary?

683
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,531
We're doing our job.

684
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,827
Are you trying to make an issue
by getting us involved in this?

685
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,495
Someone in the police force told me this.

686
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,874
-Who?
-You know I can't tell you that.

687
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,294
Anyway, this is a pretty big case.

688
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,547
The police will have to make
a public announcement.

689
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,719
This case is related to the current
Minister of Justice, isn't it?

690
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,432
Did Yoo Jeong-seok suggest this?

691
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,270
Does he want to blame the police
and make people lose focus on the matter?

692
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,064
Are you saying Jeonghan Daily
makes biased news reports?

693
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,735
This case could cause
a lot of misunderstandings.

694
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,572
I'm not saying we don't want
anything to do with this.

695
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,867
But you need to give us a chance
to minimize the damage.

696
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,120
That will help us get rid of
our misunderstanding of Jeonghan Daily.

697
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,876
I received the information
from the Civil Petition Division.

698
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,799
Please keep in mind
that I gave you a chance to deal with it.

699
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:01,101
Did you tell him you got the information
from the Civil Petition Division?

700
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:05,481
Yes. But why does it feel like you're
taking revenge for what was done to you?

701
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,650
Am I wrong?

702
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,609
You're right.

703
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,153
But I thought it wasn't personal.

704
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,240
If you think about it,
I'm helping Detective Kang.

705
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,700
Is that really your purpose?

706
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,202
No, it's not.

707
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,623
My real purpose is to get rid of
all the corrupt people

708
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,959
in the police force.

709
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,419
Oh, is that so?

710
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,422
What about you? Why did you
get involved in something so dangerous?

711
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,550
It's my sense of duty as a reporter.

712
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,760
My duty is to get rid of all the evil
in this society.

713
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,637
I see.

714
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,639
I'll be off now.

715
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,646
I'll walk you to the parking lot.

716
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,273
There's no need.

717
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,609
I'm bored. I have nothing better to do.

718
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,820
Okay, fine. Go ahead.

719
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,155
Don't you think we're kind of similar?

720
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,909
Yes, I felt that just now.

721
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,620
Then why don't we become friends?

722
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,416
I'll be your friend if you promise
to keep giving me information.

723
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,459
You really are just like me.

724
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,377
Okay, deal.

725
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,589
Then can I start calling you by your name?

726
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,132
Sure.

727
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,428
Seo-kyung, why are you
doing something so useless?

728
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,181
I'm really stubborn. When someone tells me
not to do something, I do it even more.

729
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,059
-I see.
-What about you?

730
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,979
Me? I'm doing this for my own success.

731
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,940
I want to get rid of everyone
that's in my way

732
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,025
and become the best.

733
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,901
I knew it.

734
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,863
You're not doing this
to get rid of corruption, are you?

735
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,325
Of course not. I can't change anything
just by getting rid of a few people.

736
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,077
But I do think

737
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,789
this case will make me
feel proud of myself for being a cop.

738
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,208
I'm not so sure.

739
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,671
I don't know if I'll feel proud of
being a reporter.

740
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,924
Like you just said,

741
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,595
I don't think this will change anyone
or the world we live in.

742
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,481
I recently bought a designer bag.

743
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,275
But I just keep it at home.

744
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,402
Me too.

745
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,697
I don't know why I bought it.
I never use that thing.

746
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,242
But don't you feel happy
whenever you look at it?

747
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:23,994
Yes, I do.

748
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,247
It's completely useless,
and you don't know why you bought it.

749
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,291
But you know how

750
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,003
everyone wants to own
at least one designer purse.

751
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,716
This case might become something similar

752
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,927
and make us happy whenever we look back.

753
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,391
Let's go.

754
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,901
What's gotten into you?
You're not drinking today.

755
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,986
I guess we're out of alcohol.

756
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,198
-I'm going to quit drinking.
-You're going to quit drinking?

757
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,282
That's impossible.

758
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,576
Why would you say that?

759
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,164
You should compliment her
for making such a big decision.

760
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,708
He always talks that way.

761
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,670
-You should understand.
-He's really mean.

762
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,089
I get why you never quit drinking.

763
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,217
I would've been drunk all the time
if I had to live with someone like him.

764
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,595
-What's wrong with you?
-What? What did I do?

765
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,682
Why are you so mean
to your one and only sister?

766
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,435
I didn't do anything--

767
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,229
I think he feels inferior to me.

768
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,150
You have a point.
You won tons of gold medals.

769
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,403
-But he only won one bronze medal.
-Yes.

770
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,779
I guess that's why.

771
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,989
What? That's not true.

772
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,490
You're right, Eun-hye.

773
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,244
I won a lot of gold medals,

774
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,456
but you only won one bronze medal.

775
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,875
Are you angry at me
for being a good athlete?

776
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,335
Why are you guys shoving me to a corner?

777
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,588
Eun-hui, what did you do to her?

778
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,299
I didn't do anything to her.

779
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,134
She gave me courage.

780
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,638
I'm going to get custody no matter what.
I can't live without Jae-ung.

781
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,349
If you don't want me killing myself,

782
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,101
you'd better help me do that, okay?

783
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:15,814
We can't just bring him home
just because we want to.

784
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,566
We need to have a trial--

785
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,193
What's the point?

786
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,236
You need to be powerful in order to win.

787
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,780
You should know that
after what happened to my dad.

788
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,075
I'd like to have a word with you.

789
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,662
Why would you get her involved
in our family issue? Why?

790
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,790
If you have something to say,
just say it here.

791
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,667
Eun-hye is our family now.

792
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,211
There's nothing to hide.

793
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,383
What? Family?

794
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,179
You told me you want to be there for her
until the day you die.

795
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,599
That means she's family.

796
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,101
Yes, she's family.

797
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,603
Being a family isn't anything grand.

798
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,234
We live together, so we're a family now.

799
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,863
Let's eat.

800
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,038
-Eun-hui.
-What?

801
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:13,997
Eun-hye.

802
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,291
-Yes?
-Let's

803
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,212
-be happy.
-Gosh, cut the crap.

804
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,390
Thanks a lot, guys.

805
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,314
I should be the one thanking you.

806
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:40,857
Thank you.

807
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,029
-Thank you too, Eun-hui.
-You should brace yourself.

808
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,699
There are two women in the family.
You're the only guy.

809
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,908
I don't care.

810
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,038
My testosterone levels are going down.

811
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,833
At this rate,

812
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,627
there might be three women in this family.

813
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,090
My gosh, good for you.

814
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,899
THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE'S
FORMER SECRETARY ARRESTED

815
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,901
FOR BRIBERY AND INSTIGATING VIOLENCE

816
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,888
We could've just shared this.

817
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,016
Why did all of you buy the same copy?

818
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,726
It's to commemorate our achievement.

819
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,896
When will we get a chance
to arrest someone so powerful again?

820
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,775
This will be passed down
generation after generation.

821
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,818
"Look at what your ancestor did.

822
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,738
He was brave enough
to arrest the Minister of Justice."

823
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,531
Aren't you guys worried?

824
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,908
I'm really nervous.

825
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,744
Do-chang, are you sure
we're going to be okay?

826
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,953
What did we do wrong?

827
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,498
We just arrested a criminal
and made him admit to his crimes.

828
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:24,211
Yes, that's right.
We just did our job as the police.

829
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,255
They're right. Just keep it simple.

830
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,925
We just did our job.

831
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,761
The issue just became a lot bigger
than we expected.

832
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,514
We didn't do anything
we shouldn't have done.

833
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,600
-Yes, I know. But--
-Are you worried we might get in trouble?

834
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,439
The Minister of Justice won't even care
about a few small fries like us.

835
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,858
If he does anything to us,
it'll be humiliating on his end.

836
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:52,739
The higher-ups will discuss what to do
and settle this on their own.

837
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,284
I don't want anyone overreacting, okay?
This is nothing to brag about.

838
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,829
If you want something to brag about,
let's catch the murderer.

839
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,080
Let's catch the murderer

840
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,708
and have him locked up in jail.
Then we can brag.

841
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,042
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

842
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,590
If we didn't mention your name,

843
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,260
people would've assumed
that you and I schemed this together.

844
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,762
That's why I let them publish your name.

845
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,014
I figured it'd be better
to take the bull by the horns.

846
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,187
Be honest with me. Did you know
that Mr. Nam received money

847
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,522
from Oh Jong-tae?

848
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,900
I was just told that Oh Jong-tae
made a donation.

849
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,155
Then we can just blame it all on Mr. Nam.

850
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,492
Don't take any legal responsibilities.
Say you'll take political responsibility.

851
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,829
But why do you think

852
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,457
the police

853
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,334
made an issue of this now?

854
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,505
Mr. Nam was arrested by the police
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

855
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,758
They arrested Oh Jong-tae
before my eyes as well.

856
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,678
And they even found Jo Seong-gi's remains.

857
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,721
Why do these things

858
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,390
keep happening over there?

859
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,311
We're the only ones who know
that those cases are related.

860
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,231
Other people think of them
as different cases.

861
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,069
One day, the world will find out.

862
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,948
Let's worry about that later.

863
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,451
Right now,
let's deal with what's in front of us.

864
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,668
Hello?

865
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,421
Okay, let them inside.

866
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,259
The broadcasting team is here.
Let's carry on after the interview.

867
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,856
-What are you doing?
-What?

868
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,608
-What are you doing?
-Who are you?

869
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,485
-Come here.
-Why are you doing this?

870
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,653
Who do you think you are?

871
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,281
The former secretary
of Minister Yoo Jeong-ryeol

872
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,116
was arrested by the police

873
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,495
for inciting violence
against the man in the video.

874
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,581
He's also suspected of
having accepted a bribe

875
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,501
from a construction company that wasn't
in favor of the one-man protest.

876
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,711
Let's talk to Minister Yoo

877
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,131
and ask him
what he thinks about the issue.

878
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,426
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

879
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,013
I'm sure you're already aware
of what's going on through the news.

880
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,517
Some people think
you were involved in what happened.

881
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,520
What's your opinion on that?

882
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,982
I'll be honest with you.
I'm quite taken aback.

883
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:36,820
But I promise to take responsibility
for whatever I'm responsible for.

884
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:41,783
It sounds like you weren't aware
of what your secretary was doing.

885
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,161
The truth will be revealed
during the investigation process.

886
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,997
The general election is coming up,

887
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,082
so some think there's a political agenda

888
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,292
hidden behind this case.

889
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,502
What's your opinion on that?

890
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,798
There were no political agendas
behind this case.

891
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,342
It happened because I was too careless.

892
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,513
I'd like to apologize to the public
for causing such an issue.

893
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,517
This is going to be
pretty pressuring for the police.

894
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,812
Some doubt they'll be able to do
a proper job of investigating the case

895
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,398
since you're the Minister of Justice.

896
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:17,861
I will not use my position
to exert influence on the investigation,

897
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,655
and I will not interfere
with the investigation whatsoever.

898
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,910
I will not receive any reports
regarding the investigation.

899
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,288
I trust that the police will carry out
a just investigation.

900
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,207
I expect the police

901
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,628
to stick to their principles
and carry out a transparent investigation.

902
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,963
Thank you for doing the interview
amid your busy schedule.

903
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,635
People are also suspecting that the police
tried to cover things up.

904
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:46,222
They're suspected to have kept quiet
about the report that was made

905
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,391
by the victim of the incident.

906
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,894
So people are starting to assume
that a high ranking official

907
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,980
in the police force
was involved in keeping things quiet.

908
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,607
You saw the news, right?

909
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,609
Yes, I watched it before I came here.

910
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:01,029
The guys at Seobu Police Station
made the arrest, right?

911
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,699
-Yes, sir.
-Don't do anything.

912
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,743
Just let them carry on
with the investigation

913
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:10,121
so that no one raises an issue
regarding external coercion.

914
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,706
Okay, sir.

915
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,002
The press will also raise an issue
regarding the police force.

916
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,965
I want your division
to take responsibility for it.

917
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,970
Pardon? What does this have
anything to do with our division?

918
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,055
A high ranking police officer

919
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:30,058
needs to take responsibility
in order to settle the issue.

920
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,270
The chief of the relevant police station
can take responsibility.

921
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,856
That's Chief Moon Sang-beom.

922
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,151
You already dismissed him.

923
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,821
If you insist on punishing a guy
who's already getting punished,

924
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,155
no one will agree to it.

925
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,782
But why must I take responsibility?

926
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,535
This case became an issue
because of a whistleblower.

927
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,287
It came from the Civil Petition Division,

928
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,123
the place that manages
all our information.

929
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,791
What?

930
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,585
Who in the world…

931
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,264
Why are you doing this to me?

932
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,434
-What are you talking about?
-You're the whistleblower!

933
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,977
It was you, wasn't it?

934
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,854
Why are you getting me involved?

935
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,773
You schemed this with the guys
at Seobu Police Station

936
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,775
and made me take responsibility
for everything!

937
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,610
It was your idea, wasn't it?

938
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,031
What's the point of asking me that?

939
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:30,744
Just do what you're told.

940
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,705
If you try to fight back,

941
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,042
the door to success
will only get smaller for you.

942
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,543
What?

943
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,307
If I also met Jo Seong-gi,

944
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,978
I would've done something to him as well.

945
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,565
Don't jump to conclusions.

946
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,110
There's no evidence to prove
that I killed Jo Seong-gi.

947
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,410
What should we do?

948
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,370
The choice is yours.

949
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,250
-What are you talking about?
-You can confess what happened

950
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,835
and get punished for what you did.

951
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,130
But if not,

952
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,424
keep saying you didn't do it.

953
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,677
I'll do everything I can to cover for you.

954
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,225
You've grown old.

955
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:41,689
Jeong-seok, I'm willing to accept
whatever you choose to do.

956
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,609
It all started from me anyway.

957
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,152
What made you become so weak?

958
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,614
You can't overreact
to something like this.

959
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,282
How will you continue to be a politician?

960
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,285
I'm willing to give up everything.

961
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,040
Stop being absurd and get some rest.

962
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,459
Your judgment isn't
as clear as it used to be.

963
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,504
Jeong-seok.

964
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,882
You need to choose before it's too late.

965
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,718
You need to do that for the both of us.

966
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,888
Just walk your path.

967
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,684
That's all you can do for me.

968
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,036
Lieutenant Yoon called me earlier.

969
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,832
Ko Gyeong-ho will be stepping down
from his position.

970
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,669
Now, no one in the police force
will try to stop you and Detective Kang.

971
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,214
You're right. Things are going great.

972
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,802
Minister Yoo promised not to interfere,
so there will be no external coercion.

973
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,306
And that means he won't be able
to protect Jong-tae either.

974
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,725
Now, all that's left is my boss, right?

975
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,062
It won't be easy to catch him.

976
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,106
It'll be really hard to prove

977
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,525
that he killed Jo Seong-gi.

978
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,736
It'll be great if he confesses everything,

979
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,032
-but that won't happen, right?
-Do you still think

980
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,326
he also killed Detective Jang?

981
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,620
It was either Yoo Jeong-seok
or Nam Guk-hyeon.

982
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,371
They both have clear motives for murder.

983
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,292
I understand why

984
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,170
he murdered Jo Seong-gi.

985
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,674
He was the guy who killed his sister.

986
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,136
But I'm not so sure about Detective Jang.

987
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,013
I don't take him to be that horrible.

988
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,647
He used the voice recording

989
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,775
to get Lee Dae-cheol executed
for something he didn't even do

990
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,570
just so he could cover up his murder case.

991
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,740
And for the same reason,

992
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,867
he reached out to Jong-tae
even though he was guilty.

993
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,454
If he did all that
without even murdering anyone,

994
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,997
I'd say that's even worse.

995
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,966
It's going to become harder for me
to trust people from now on.

996
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,184
OH JONG-TAE

997
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,609
Hello, sir.

998
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,527
Hello.

999
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,280
Can you talk right now?

1000
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,115
Yes, go ahead.

1001
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,244
There's something that bothers me
regarding what you said today on the news.

1002
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,455
I get the situation you're in,

1003
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:48,334
but you haven't
forgotten our promise, right?

1004
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,796
You had that in mind
when you said those things earlier, right?

1005
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,424
I promised you nothing.

1006
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,176
Sir.

1007
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,386
Like I said earlier,

1008
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,555
I won't interfere
with the police investigation

1009
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,889
regarding your allegations.

1010
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,100
Let me warn you one last time.

1011
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,352
You'll have to pay

1012
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,771
for everything you've done.

1013
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,566
The more you keep clinging onto me,

1014
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,776
the longer you'll end up
doing time in jail.

1015
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,487
Minister Yoo.

1016
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,743
That won't be any good for your brother.
Are you okay with that?

1017
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:22,910
I'm going to hang up now.

1018
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,121
I hope we never talk again.

1019
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,716
He wants to take me down with him?

1020
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,926
No way.

1021
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,221
Why would I go down with you guys?

1022
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,432
Why?

1023
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,560
What's there to worry about?

1024
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,231
Like you said,
we just need to keep pushing ahead.

1025
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,524
I told you

1026
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,778
that you need to take care of this
before the next chief comes.

1027
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,907
He'll surely try to stop you guys
from investigating the case.

1028
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,785
You need to wrap things up before that.
Hurry up.

1029
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,037
Okay, thank you.

1030
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,374
She's right.

1031
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,795
They won't just sit back
and watch us do what we want.

1032
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:19,926
Sir, it's only been two days
since we arrested Mr. Nam.

1033
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,761
We're not even done writing a report.

1034
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,806
Can the prosecution wait a little bit
before you guys take him from us?

1035
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,683
What an asshole.

1036
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,477
We did all the work,

1037
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,063
but he wants to take credit
for everything.

1038
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,523
He can hear you.

1039
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,527
The Minister of Justice said
he trusts the police.

1040
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,320
Let me talk to him.

1041
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:43,491
-Why?
-I have something to say.

1042
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,076
Fine. Here.

1043
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,663
Hello, this is Kang Do-chang.

1044
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,165
You can go ahead and take

1045
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,875
Nam Seong-hwan.

1046
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,380
Yes.

1047
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,550
But instead, can you issue
a search and seizure warrant for us?

1048
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:04,303
If you do that for us, you can do
whatever you want with Nam Seong-hwan.

1049
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,848
You can even let him go.
We won't raise any issues.

1050
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,393
-What?
-What's going on?

1051
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,978
-Who are you people?
-What's this?

1052
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,771
What's going on?

1053
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,940
-Who are they?
-What's happening?

1054
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,358
What are you doing here?

1055
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,110
-Where are you going?
-Who are they?

1056
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,863
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

1057
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,740
-What's going on?
-What are you doing here?

1058
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,616
-What are you doing?
-What is this?

1059
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,577
-Hey, get out.
-Get out of here.

1060
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,412
Get out of here right now!

1061
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,830
-Please leave.
-Get out.

1062
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,874
-You're not allowed in here.
-Get out right now.

1063
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,209
-You need to leave.
-Why are you here?

1064
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,044
Please leave right now.

1065
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,005
-Get out.
-What's going on?

1066
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,507
This is a search and seizure warrant
issued by the prosecution.

1067
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,302
This is Jeonghan Daily.

1068
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,012
Have you lost your mind?

1069
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,055
How are you going to deal
with the consequences?

1070
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,140
If you don't cooperate,

1071
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,058
you'll get arrested
for obstruction of justice.

1072
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,227
Are you seriously going to do this?

1073
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,854
You've crossed the line.

1074
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,856
This is wrong. You need to leave.

1075
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,567
This isn't regarding Jeonghan Daily.

1076
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,404
This search and seizure
only applies to Yoo Jeong-seok.

1077
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,531
He's suspected of murder.

1078
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,200
-What?
-Murder?

1079
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,035
-What does that mean?
-He murdered someone?

1080
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,328
Move aside.

1081
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,383
You are only allowed to take the items

1082
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,428
that are related to the case
written on the warrant.

1083
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,056
Let me warn you.

1084
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,309
You'd better be careful.

1085
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,104
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

1086
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,936
Be careful, guys.

1087
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,967
What should we do?
Should we respond to this?

1088
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,554
This is a personal matter.
I don't want you doing anything.

1089
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:01,314
Sir, don't you owe us an explanation?

1090
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,192
Why did we have to get
humiliated like this?

1091
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,862
What exactly do I need to explain?

1092
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,073
The truth.

1093
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:12,992
"The truth"?

1094
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,163
All I did

1095
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,668
was kill someone who deserved to die.

1096
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,147
A SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK JI-HWAN

1097
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,668
It'll be best for you to go to jail
for instigating murder.

1098
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,964
I don't get it. Why is it
that guys like you are never grateful?

1099
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,007
I have evidence to prove
that Yoo Jeong-seok

1100
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,926
killed both Jo Seong-gi and Jang Jin-su.

1101
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:13,844
You murderer.

1102
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:14,845
If he shows up,

1103
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,139
tell him what he's charged with
and make an emergency arrest.

1104
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,225
Let me just leave quietly.

1105
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,810
Nam Guk-hyeon might be right.

1106
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,145
The only thing we can trust
is Yoo Jeong-seok's conscience.

1107
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,189
What's the truth that you're hiding?

1108
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,483
Jeonghan Daily only reports the truth.

1109
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:30,027
I believe I still have
something left to do.

1110
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,113
I have a big gift for you, Mr. Oh.

1111
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,198
Where can I get that gift?

1112
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,826
I am your gift.

1113
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,828
I'm the gift I prepared for you.

1114
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:45,292
