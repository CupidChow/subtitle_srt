00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,386
SEOBU POLICE STATION

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,721
Chief.

5
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,390
Hold on. Just a little longer.

6
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,061
-Chief.
-Give me a break.

7
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:07,108
Can I just enjoy a moment of peace?

8
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,529
What in the world?
Turn the car around. Now!

9
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,116
-It's him!
-Wait, Chief!

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
Chief Moon!

11
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,703
-Stop!
-Give us a comment!

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,331
He's getting away!

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:34,385
Why do I have to
jump the walls of my own station?

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,348
This is all your guys' fault.

15
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,477
I'm too old for this.

16
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,315
Hear me out.

17
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,277
The case happened in Seoul, not Incheon.

18
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,613
Why would we take a case
under your jurisdiction?

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,408
My detectives went unknowingly.
It was a coincidence.

20
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,120
They were simply invited by
Director Cheon Na-na.

21
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,746
No, that's…

22
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,414
Captain!

23
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,625
Darn it.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,335
What did he say?

25
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,088
They're saying we should take the case

26
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,132
because two of our guys were on site.

27
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,844
Simply put, they want us to take
this headache of a case away from them

28
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,303
regardless of jurisdiction.

29
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,556
Do we know why Cheon Na-na collapsed?

30
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,101
According to the hospital,
she seems to have overdosed on insulin,

31
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,978
which caused her to go into shock.

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,606
Does that mean whoever gave her the shot
made a mistake?

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,111
We don't know if it was a mistake
or intentional yet.

34
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,448
Are you saying there's a chance
someone gave her an overdose on purpose?

35
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,701
According to a forensic pathologist,

36
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,994
there's been a case abroad

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,079
where insulin was weaponized.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,458
But why is this case
being compared to an overseas case?

39
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,921
It's because of the interview Ms. Cheon
had with WCN before the incident.

40
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,134
Former Chairman Cheon Seong-dae
was put on trial for corruption

41
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,721
because I actually reported it.

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,683
And the crime of
current Chairman Cheon Sang-woo

43
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,478
came to light because
I gave the detectives decisive evidence.

44
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,316
Incheon Seobu Station revealed
Chairman Cheon to be the abettor

45
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,651
and is now in charge of the case.

46
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,030
Incheon Seobu Station is yet to explain

47
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,617
what the decisive evidence
Ms. Cheon gave them was

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,454
or how it's related
to Ms. Cheon's current incident.

49
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,088
What kind of answer
are we supposed to give them?

50
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,049
We have no answers yet.

51
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,093
But Cheon Na-na sent us hers.

52
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,972
Do you know why you got prison time?

53
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,184
I sent the documents to the Blue House.

54
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,021
You really want to die at my hands.

55
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,441
I'll be honest with you.

56
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,819
I'm afraid of you.

57
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,030
I fear…

58
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,532
You will actually kill me.

59
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,743
That's the end.

60
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,918
I asked you personally.

61
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,463
My career could've been on the line.
I had no choice.

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,760
What about the result?
Did you inform them too?

63
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,179
So by sending us that file,

64
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,268
she's telling us that this was
Cheon Seong-dae's attempt to kill her,

65
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,522
and that she wants us to catch him, right?

66
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,274
Yes, basically.

67
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,236
Detective Oh, do you really believe
he tried to kill his daughter?

68
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,824
No, I think she's using the same method
she used on Woo Tae-ho.

69
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,326
She's charging at him
with another risky play.

70
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,161
It was probably staged by her.

71
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,288
He's right.

72
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,374
Inviting us to the scene must have
also been a part of her plan

73
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,167
to make us witness everything.

74
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,129
She got us involved on purpose.

75
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,673
Let's just say it never happened then.

76
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,133
We can ignore it.

77
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,220
No, we shouldn't throw away this chance
to attack Cheon Seong-dae.

78
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,849
I say we go after him
just like Cheon Na-na wanted us to.

79
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,935
We'll pressure Cheon Seong-dae
to bring him closer to us.

80
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,645
He'll be a great asset to our case.

81
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,273
Are you buddies with Cheon Seong-dae?

82
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,861
Does he seem like a man

83
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,864
we can call over at our convenience?

84
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,451
Chief has a point with this one.

85
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,787
You're saying you want to play him,

86
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,375
but that's just not a realistic plan.

87
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,630
Cheon Seong-dae is
on a different level from his kids.

88
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,342
He's had years to solidify friendships
with the most powerful political figures.

89
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,303
People that would make our jaws drop.

90
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,432
We're no match against
a single one of them.

91
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,352
Once Cheon Seong-dae gets involved,
we'll drop dead like flies.

92
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,896
And it won't just be us flies.

93
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,607
Our families would be exterminated too.

94
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,903
I understand where you're coming from.

95
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,198
We may all end up losing our jobs.

96
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,991
So you agree?

97
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,493
Okay.

98
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,203
Then we have one job.

99
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,246
Do absolutely nothing.

100
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,916
I don't want any of you
coming in to work from now on.

101
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll still pay you.

102
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,504
Stay put like a statue at home.

103
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,380
Just sit there and zone out.

104
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,673
Easy, right?

105
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,177
We should carry on investigating
Cheon Na-na's case.

106
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,347
We already have evidence against her.

107
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,598
Hey!

108
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,353
Do-chang.

109
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,774
Violent Crimes Team Two Troublemakers.

110
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm begging you.

111
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,531
I don't want anything.

112
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,449
I just want one thing.

113
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,537
It's inner peace.

114
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,296
I'll put the building
I own in Gangnam on the line.

115
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,551
If we all end up getting fired,

116
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,553
we'll split it eight ways.

117
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,475
You don't have to go that far--

118
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,437
There's no way we all get fired.
I'm positive.

119
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,064
How are you so sure?
It might very well be possible.

120
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,942
Don't you think we'll get fired
if we keep pushing it, chief?

121
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,111
If that's the case,

122
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,948
I think it'll be a win for us
regardless of the result.

123
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:29,866
I agree.

124
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,418
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,796
I can't accept your proposal, Chairman.

126
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,423
Why not?

127
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,427
I'm not in a position
to get involved and resolve this.

128
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,430
That's your position.

129
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,392
What does McQueen headquarters think
about this situation?

130
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,646
Change of management?

131
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,899
Yes.

132
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,529
"Make Cheon Na-na the new head of TJ."

133
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,577
Why didn't you burn it? Why?

134
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,164
I was curious about what was inside.

135
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,295
That's it?

136
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,674
I told you, Gi-jin.

137
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,801
We won't get paid if that gets revealed.

138
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,471
We may have to cough up
the money we already received.

139
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,474
Do you know why Gi Dong-jae held onto it?

140
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,393
It was to extort money from Cheon Na-na.

141
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,730
Gi Dong-jae is dead.

142
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,983
This is our chance to take his share.

143
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,987
I'll make myself clear.

144
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,573
I've bet my whole life on this.

145
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,825
There are only two ways this can end.

146
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,578
I either die behind bars

147
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,206
or live on a pile of money.

148
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,178
Tell me then.

149
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,306
How do you plan on dealing with
the Incheon Seobu Station guys?

150
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,392
They got the forensic result too.

151
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,647
I came this far because I trusted you.

152
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,859
You must help me through this
until the very end.

153
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,908
TJ is in the hands of Cheon Na-na now.

154
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,536
Cheon Sang-woo is beyond redemption.

155
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,248
Use him one more time.

156
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,875
How?

157
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,712
Reveal everything you found.

158
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,755
Then destroy him with it.

159
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,010
The guys at Traffic Crimes
were hiding these.

160
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,888
It's proof that Cheon Na-na's fingerprints
were on the buckle and steering wheel.

161
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,808
How'd you get these?
I doubt they just handed them over.

162
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,519
They most definitely didn't.
We made a whole scene.

163
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,771
We forcibly rummaged through
all their cabinets.

164
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,398
It got pretty physical.

165
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,067
What if they use it against us later?

166
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,487
What's there to fear?
We can just become landlords.

167
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,364
We took it up a notch on purpose.

168
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,491
I'm counting on them to get us fired.

169
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,328
That's smart. We should've gone with them.

170
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,537
I know right?

171
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,582
Cut the crap, you fools.

172
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,503
Cheon Na-na's blood was found
on Jung Hui-ju's clothes.

173
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,048
We even have her fingerprints
from the car.

174
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,635
Does this mean that

175
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,096
Cheon Na-na murdered both
Jung Hui-ju and Woo Tae-ho?

176
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,224
No, it's not definitive.
It's still just a suspicion.

177
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,978
So she could've murdered both
or just one of them

178
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,230
or neither of them? Is that right?

179
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,277
Shouldn't we decide on one narrative

180
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,029
to focus our time and energy on?

181
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,323
Which one should we run with?

182
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,700
To obtain Jung Hui-ju's belongings,

183
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,869
Jang Gi-jin went as far as harming
her grandpa.

184
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,955
Probably out of fear that
we'd find Cheon Na-na's blood.

185
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,125
He wouldn't have gone that far
if that bloodstain

186
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,211
had nothing to do with
Jung Hui-ju's murder.

187
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,337
-Right.
-I agree.

188
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,549
She killed Gi Dong-jae to rid of evidence
for that same reason too.

189
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,135
If it turns out that Cheon Na-na
killed Jung Hui-ju,

190
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,721
then her motive to murder Woo Tae-ho
becomes very clear.

191
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,431
Woo Tae-ho learned the truth.

192
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,393
So she murdered him to hide it.

193
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,895
Then what was her motive
for murdering Jung Hui-ju?

194
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,439
Simply because she had an affair
with her husband?

195
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,483
Does she look like one to kill for love?

196
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,364
We have evidence, so why not bring
Cheon Na-na in for questioning?

197
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,700
If we do that, we're basically admitting
that Cheon Sang-woo,

198
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,286
the guy we sent to prison
as the abettor is innocent.

199
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,457
If Cheon Na-na killed Jung Hui-ju,
then Gi Dong-jae wasn't the murderer.

200
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,710
If that's the case, Cheon Sang-woo
will be cleared of his charges.

201
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,462
Things will get really complicated.

202
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,174
Darn it. We have enough evidence
but our hands are tied.

203
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,722
Hello?

204
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,727
Okay. We'll be waiting.

205
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,856
Captain. Cheon Na-na is on her way.

206
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,774
-What?
-Why?

207
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,444
I told her lawyer that we need
the victim's statement.

208
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,654
But she wants to personally give it to us.

209
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,449
No way.

210
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,245
POLICE FOR THE PEOPLE JUSTICE IN KOREA

211
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,747
What's her real reason for doing this?

212
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,126
Does she really plan on putting
Cheon Seong-dae behind bars?

213
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,462
I doubt it.
I'm sure she knows that's impossible.

214
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,546
Then why?

215
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,882
It's simple.

216
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,050
One reason is self-preservation

217
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,595
and the other is crisis management.

218
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,388
I see.

219
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,892
Did you expect me to understand that?

220
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,144
Lay it out simply. Don't use big words.

221
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,564
She beat us to the punch.

222
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,692
She wants us on a leash
in case she gets busted.

223
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,445
Much better. I understand now.

224
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,741
She's truly a conniving one.

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,286
FAITHFUL WARM AND TRUSTY POLICE

226
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,913
SEOBU POLICE STATION

227
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,145
Do we have your permission to record this?

228
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,772
Yes, go ahead.

229
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
Okay then.

230
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,525
Start recording.

231
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,110
-Have you recovered?
-Why is she so confident?

232
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,570
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

233
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,822
We investigated the hospital.

234
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,701
We found nothing suspicious regarding
how the medicine was supplied.

235
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,497
This means the insulin shot was
tampered with

236
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,749
while it was in your possession.

237
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,960
It must've been switched out in my office.

238
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,712
That means someone went in there.

239
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,007
It was most likely one of my employees.

240
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,095
Which leads us to someone powerful enough
to order around an employee like that.

241
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,391
If it was an inside job,
finding the culprit won't be easy.

242
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,436
I think it'll be a quick process
since Detective Oh is in charge.

243
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,774
Is that why you invited me to the event?

244
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,652
"You clearly saw it,
so catch the culprit."

245
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,904
Are you…

246
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,448
suspecting me?

247
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,701
Are you saying

248
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,288
that I purposely injected
a lethal amount of insulin into myself?

249
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,958
We meet all sorts of people
working this job.

250
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,294
We come across people

251
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,130
who are impossible to make sense of
with a normal mindset.

252
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,133
Are you struggling with the investigation?

253
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,384
That's a strange excuse.

254
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,552
Yes, it's an excuse.

255
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,223
We're finding it hard to approach
the suspect due to his high profile.

256
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,727
I will do my best to cooperate.
This person tried to kill me.

257
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,855
You must catch the culprit,
whoever it may be.

258
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,859
Right, but everything is circumstantial.

259
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,527
Unless we find direct evidence--

260
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,945
I have faith.

261
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,366
You put the chairman of
a conglomerate on trial.

262
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,038
I cooperated with your investigation
because of that faith,

263
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,623
fully knowing it was illegal.

264
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,211
I'm talking about the search and seizure.

265
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,881
It was a trick to make
the evidence admissible.

266
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,051
I didn't know.

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,011
I found out later.

268
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,598
That there was an issue
with how the evidence was collected.

269
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,603
It might become a problem if that's
revealed in Sang-woo's second trial.

270
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,438
She's here to threaten us.

271
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,231
Should I keep recording?

272
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,359
Yes, let's see how far she goes.

273
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,778
I agree.

274
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,156
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo may
be acquitted on all charges.

275
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,367
That's not ideal for you either.

276
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,369
You're misunderstanding me.

277
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,454
But I understand.

278
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,585
I distorted the truth a little
when I testified to you.

279
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,171
What is it?

280
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,466
I apologize.

281
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,719
I was being selfish.

282
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,596
I think that's why

283
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,850
I tried to direct your investigation
another way.

284
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,900
I deeply regret I failed to stop
my brother from murdering Jung Hui-ju

285
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,614
even though I heard him give the order.

286
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,575
I had Jung Hui-ju come see me

287
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,328
the day she was murdered.

288
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,248
I should have told her.

289
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,334
But I couldn't.

290
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,963
I may…

291
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,634
I may have wanted Jung Hui-ju dead.

292
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,472
She was the one who stole my husband.

293
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,186
I felt tormented.

294
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,984
Jung Hui-ju wouldn't be dead
if I had spoken up.

295
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,781
That guilt was why

296
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,743
I tried to kill myself with Tae-ho.

297
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,620
Tae-ho didn't commit suicide.

298
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,081
I...

299
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,669
I wanted us to die together.

300
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,841
When I survived,
I figured that the only thing I could do

301
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:36,013
was find out who killed Jung Hui-ju.

302
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,681
That's why…

303
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,602
That's why I helped you, Detective Oh.

304
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,274
So you met Jung Hui-ju
on the day she was murdered?

305
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,735
Nothing happened?

306
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,029
No, nothing.

307
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,572
We just talked and she left.

308
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,534
Is there any chance
you concealed this from us

309
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,329
out of fear you might become a suspect?

310
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,123
That didn't cross my mind.

311
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,918
It was the guilt.

312
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,631
Because I did nothing
to prevent her murder.

313
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,259
That's why I couldn't tell you.

314
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,178
It's not because you don't remember?

315
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,307
It's not.

316
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,018
Memories can be manipulated subconsciously

317
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,978
when you're in shock.

318
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,607
To remember it in a way that
is advantageous to oneself.

319
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,150
Does that happen?

320
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,822
Maybe it did to you, Detective Oh.

321
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,535
You said you saw you killed your father.

322
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,621
But maybe you didn't.

323
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,706
Maybe you were so frightened

324
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,459
that you deluded yourself
into thinking you did.

325
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,294
You're right.

326
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,297
I changed the truth.

327
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,633
I manipulated it to how I wanted it to be.

328
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,094
Just like you.

329
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,016
I'm very busy these days.

330
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,269
The company is in trouble.

331
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,939
Everyone is counting on me.

332
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,861
Today's the last day that
I'll have time to meet with you.

333
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,988
I carved out my precious time to come by.

334
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,990
I hope

335
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,618
I no longer have to
concern myself with this matter.

336
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,210
If I'm being honest,

337
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,546
I agree with everything Cheon Na-na said.

338
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,214
That's how it is at first.

339
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,757
Everything makes perfect sense

340
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,926
because every detail was
prepared to a tee.

341
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,137
It's kind of amazing
if she really was acting.

342
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,764
This won't be easy.

343
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,393
We have no evidence
to refute her testimony.

344
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,395
Her acting will fool every judge.

345
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,608
But she didn't explain why her blood was
found on Jung Hui-ju's clothes.

346
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,068
Maybe we should've cornered her with that.

347
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,655
Jang Gi-jin knows
we got the forensics result.

348
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,490
Naturally, Cheon Na-na will find out.

349
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,952
Did we give them time to
come up with a plan?

350
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,496
It's best to let her believe
she's winning for now.

351
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,374
Cheon Na-na's main goal is
to have TJ all to herself.

352
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,628
She came to tell us
she won't allow anyone to stop her

353
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,755
from fulfilling that goal.

354
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,841
We might end up with another victim.

355
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,178
He's right. The woman even turned
her own father into a murderer.

356
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,638
She would do anything.

357
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,017
Hello. Who is Detective Sim Dong-uk?

358
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,603
-What?
-It's me.

359
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,273
You're under arrest for accepting bribery
and breach of duty.

360
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,567
-What?
-Let go.

361
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,694
-What the hell?
-Don't make this hard.

362
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,322
-You better let go.
-Get your hands off of him.

363
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,241
-Shut up.
-You darn punk.

364
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,867
-Hey, let go of him.
-Wait!

365
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,369
-Calm down.
-Stop, Do-chang.

366
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,997
Sim Dong-il is your brother, correct?

367
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,333
Yes.

368
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,919
What does he do?
How does he make a living?

369
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,632
-Why do you ask?
-He's unemployed, right?

370
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:03,595
Didn't you drag me here
because you had charges against me?

371
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
Then just investigate me.

372
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,933
Why do you keep bringing my brother in?

373
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,061
We found that 300 million won was
deposited into his account.

374
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,106
How did an unemployed man
deposit such a large sum?

375
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,025
What are you talking about?

376
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,989
The money was transferred by TJ.
The company you're investigating.

377
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,075
Your brother has zero connections to TJ.

378
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,660
You used your brother's account.

379
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,372
The plan was to divvy up the money
with your fellow teammates.

380
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,834
What the hell did you just say?
How dare you!

381
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,170
It's you, right?

382
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,631
You're behind all this, aren't you?

383
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,841
What are you doing?

384
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,135
I know it's you, Jang Gi-jin!

385
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,973
Yes, it's me, you little punk.

386
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,022
I saw the money in my account.

387
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,025
Why didn't you tell us?

388
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,609
Didn't you find it suspicious?

389
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,695
You should've told your detective brother.

390
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,198
I thought it was sent by mistake.

391
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,452
You didn't touch the money, right?

392
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,911
Well...

393
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,666
I withdrew it to invest it in stocks...

394
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,377
-Are you mad?
-Seriously?

395
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,381
I was going to put the money back
once I made a profit.

396
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,551
I can do it right now.
Thankfully the stock price rose.

397
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,844
What's wrong with you?

398
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,346
That money wasn't yours to withdraw.
That's a crime!

399
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,390
Your life is still a mess.

400
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,477
Dong-uk's on the verge of
going to jail because of you!

401
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,605
-Calm down.
-Hey, he did nothing wrong.

402
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,648
He got unlucky and fell into the trap.

403
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,651
We should be glad
we can get the principal back.

404
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,696
Quickly take it out
and put it back in the account.

405
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,075
Okay. But will Dong-uk really go to jail

406
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,160
because of me?

407
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,162
No, that will never happen.

408
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,081
We won't let that happen. Don't worry.

409
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,876
How did they find out
your account number though?

410
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,336
Did someone ask for it?

411
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,504
No, nobody.

412
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,424
I rarely used it recently
because I wasn't getting paid

413
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,343
or paying anyone either.

414
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,012
When was the last transaction made?

415
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,058
It was the former Team Director of TJ...

416
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,976
-Choi Yong-geun?
-Yes, him.

417
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,354
He told me to make this account.

418
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,440
I think that was the first
and last time I used it.

419
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,359
This was Choi Yong-geun's idea.

420
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,362
Jang Gi-jin was just the executioner.

421
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,906
Let's catch Jang Gi-jin.

422
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,867
Take Gu Jae-chun's testimony
and request an arrest warrant.

423
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,955
Charge Jang Gi-jin for abetting
the attempted murder of Jung In-beom.

424
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,000
That vile bastard started this.
We need to win this fight first.

425
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,671
We can only get Cheon Na-na that way.

426
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,383
These are the clothes Jung Hui-ju was
wearing when she was murdered.

427
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,136
We seized them
from an undisclosed location.

428
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,389
It's evidence that
the murderer Gi Dong-jae was hiding.

429
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,976
Why has this evidence been found now?

430
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,729
We suspect one of the investigators
kept it hidden on purpose.

431
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,398
For what purpose?

432
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,859
It was to prove
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo's innocence

433
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,194
during the second trial.

434
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,574
There was another bloodstain
that wasn't the victim's.

435
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,242
Whose is it?

436
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,328
I can't reveal that yet.

437
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,623
However, we think the other bloodstain
wasn't present at the time of the incident

438
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,627
but was added on later.
The other blood was likely

439
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,462
fabricated evidence.

440
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,007
On what grounds do you say that?

441
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,968
TJ transferred a large sum of money
to a family member of one of

442
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,346
the detectives from Violent Crimes Unit
who was in charge of Jung's case.

443
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,473
We believe they bribed him

444
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,684
to keep the evidence concealed

445
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,936
so the Chairman can win his second trial.

446
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,355
You mentioned the Violent Crimes Unit.

447
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,983
Do you mean Incheon Seobu Station's
Violent Crimes Unit?

448
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:45,984
Yes, that's right.

449
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,485
This team you're talking about

450
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,614
played the biggest role in getting
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo

451
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,490
behind bars for abetting murder.

452
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,244
Why would they want him innocent now?

453
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,288
You bring up a good point.

454
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,792
People would've suspected them
of aiding a chairman of a powerful company

455
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,087
if he was found innocent
in the first trial.

456
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,341
It was their goal
to have him lose the first trial

457
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,509
and then win the second one.

458
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,386
This is the scenario that

459
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,389
Incheon Seobu's Violent Crimes Unit
and Chairman Cheon Sang-woo

460
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,975
came up with together.

461
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,813
I thought you said
Jung Hui-ju's clothes were burned.

462
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,025
So why do you have it?

463
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,027
Why? Explain to me.

464
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,616
It's the same reason why
Gi Dong-jae didn't burn the clothes.

465
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,576
I've done too much

466
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,412
for me to get rid of that evidence.

467
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,082
It's as you said.

468
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,502
The moment you claim ignorance,

469
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,671
my life will be over.

470
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,131
I kept it as insurance.

471
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,345
So whose blood was found on her clothes?

472
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,350
I think you know that better than anyone.

473
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,605
Can you really make people believe

474
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,650
what you told the reporters?
That the evidence was fabricated?

475
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,195
I can't do it without your help.

476
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,114
You'll have to manipulate the police,

477
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,408
prosecution, and the press.

478
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,077
Me?

479
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,414
If things go awry one more time,

480
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,666
you and I will be done for.

481
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:31,548
Do you think you can catch me with
that petty evidence you have?

482
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,551
You can't.

483
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,928
Neither can the detectives.

484
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,223
I decide my fate.

485
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,394
No one can end me beside me.

486
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,813
I will make every decision.

487
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:51,609
You better wrap this up well
for your sake, not mine.

488
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,739
Gu Jae-chun and Jang Gi-jin
talked using burner cells.

489
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,576
That means they were conspiring
Jung In-beom's murder.

490
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,953
We also have clear evidence that

491
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,539
Jang Gi-jin handed Gi Dong-jae over
to Gu Jae-chun.

492
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,500
Pardon?

493
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,504
Okay.

494
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,925
I'll find corroborative evidence
and get back to you. Bye.

495
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:19,929
What did he say?

496
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,475
He said it's not enough to prove
they were accomplices.

497
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,103
Do you think he was influenced by
Jang Gi-jin's announcement

498
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,396
about us?

499
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,107
I'm sure he was.
The prosecutor doesn't trust us.

500
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,235
Let's be real,
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division's

501
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,488
claims hold more weight than ours.

502
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,865
We're losing the game to him.

503
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,242
Cheon Na-na probably helped him.

504
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,579
The power of TJ has shifted to her.

505
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,581
I'm sure that played a part.

506
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,210
How should I say this…

507
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,464
The Civil Petition Division
at Headquarters called me.

508
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,801
You've all been summoned
for investigation.

509
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,429
Wait, all of us?

510
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,307
Yes. It's serious.

511
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,683
I think Jang Gi-jin

512
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,061
trapped us good.

513
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,523
They made everything up.

514
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,983
We have no reason to be scared.

515
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,194
We'll just go and tell the truth.

516
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,488
Their goal isn't to arrest us.

517
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,825
They're trying to shorten
the length of our investigation.

518
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,161
There's no need to all go in yet.

519
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,914
I'll go first
and try to get this under control.

520
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,751
INCHEON METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

521
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,089
Why does the opponent keep getting bigger?

522
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,550
You overreached. This was greed.

523
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,926
You went too far this time.

524
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,971
It wasn't on purpose.
I was just investigating a murder case.

525
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,682
The big guys happened to be involved.

526
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,977
You should've avoided it then.
It's not only your job on the line.

527
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,272
Your teammates are about to lose
their jobs. What are you going to do?

528
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,816
Stop scaring me. You know that

529
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,860
I'm not one to do that.

530
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,029
A quick look into this could tell you
who's playing tricks.

531
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,281
I don't care.

532
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,116
I know one thing for sure.

533
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,160
The moment I help you,

534
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,079
I'll be hit with
the biggest roadblock of my career.

535
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,749
I'm not asking for your help.

536
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,169
Just give us some time.

537
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,213
Their goal is to waste our time.

538
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,465
Give us time to--

539
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,262
Please, Inspector Yoon Sang-mi.

540
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,269
Once is enough, Do-chang.

541
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,563
You did your part.

542
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,232
What you did was truly admirable.

543
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,987
This is where you stop.
You're not a superhero.

544
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,076
That brat.

545
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,208
Darn it.

546
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,010
That darn brat hasn't changed one bit.

547
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,554
So we're screwed.

548
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,016
Do you know anyone at the main office?

549
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,935
That place is packed with your alumni.

550
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,436
I know a ton.

551
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,191
But I was hated by most of them.

552
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,193
Why did you live that way?

553
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,694
I lived like you.

554
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,280
And I plan on living like you
for the rest of my life.

555
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,782
You little…

556
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,788
What?

557
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,873
Why do you live like that?

558
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,959
What? I'm hanging up if you lecture me.

559
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,336
Why are you always so oblivious?

560
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,215
You should be more discreet
when you're asking for a favor.

561
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,134
How could you ask me
in front of everyone like that?

562
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,303
That's why you can't get promoted.

563
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,014
You're one to run your mouth.

564
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,395
That's how you're going to talk to someone
who outranks you by a mile?

565
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,480
You need to learn some manners.

566
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,107
Just hang up! I'm done with you!

567
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,526
I looked over the charges again.

568
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,113
I'll need another week to review it.

569
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,658
What?

570
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,326
Pardon, ma'am?

571
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,452
Of course.

572
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:17,166
I admire your thoroughness,
Inspector Yoon Sang-mi.

573
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,377
You should most definitely
review it carefully.

574
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,922
You have one week.
Then I'll proceed by the book.

575
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,757
Understood, ma'am. Salute.

576
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,807
I knew I lived a good life.

577
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,851
Just follow my path.

578
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,854
There's no need to improvise.
Do exactly as I do.

579
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,397
Yes, sir.

580
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,194
We bought some time,
but how will we turn this around?

581
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,613
We need support.

582
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,198
From who?

583
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,034
Someone who is much more powerful than

584
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,620
Cheon Na-na.

585
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,122
You have a huge headache, don't you?

586
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,875
From making up all those stories.

587
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,418
Hey.

588
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:05,298
You need to come up with stories
that are believable.

589
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,426
This is just too far-fetched.

590
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,637
Didn't you order the fabrication?

591
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,559
I don't share your skill of
conjuring up stories.

592
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,146
It was Dad then.

593
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:25,360
Yes, it all makes sense now.

594
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,488
Did you really believe it was me?

595
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,908
You're his beloved son.

596
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,161
He'd do anything for you.

597
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,998
He thinks I put you in here.

598
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,670
He'd do anything to kill me and save you.

599
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,299
Then why does everything keep
ending up in your favor?

600
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,593
Why?

601
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,346
Does Father seem that dumb to you?

602
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,807
Reality hasn't sunk in for him yet.

603
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,101
He thinks he still has power.

604
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,397
He doesn't know that
I'm the one with the power now.

605
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,108
That's why he's not thinking straight.

606
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,445
No one else thinks that!

607
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,531
We have never given you any power.

608
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,908
You just think you have it.

609
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,454
This is all just happening
inside your head!

610
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,584
Do you know why I want Dad's place?

611
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:29,048
He realizes all of his visions.

612
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,925
He can make anything come true.

613
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,302
Doesn't matter if it makes no sense.

614
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,264
If he says it's the truth, then it is.

615
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,516
I'll show you.

616
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,519
A world where my thoughts become reality.

617
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,358
You can't do it.

618
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,737
I told you. You can't beat us.

619
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,072
Look at yourself right now.

620
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,283
I've realized my vision.

621
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,210
Originally, my next step was going to be

622
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,630
to get you out of this place

623
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,800
if you didn't provoke me.

624
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,261
But both you and Dad

625
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,514
keep making me change my mind.

626
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,106
I can't beat you.

627
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,944
I can't go up against a lunatic.

628
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,327
Fine, try to destroy us.
Knock yourself out.

629
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,538
I will keep a close watch on

630
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,083
how you realize your thoughts.

631
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,305
Yes?

632
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,058
You've been summoned to

633
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,477
Incheon Seobu Police Station, sir.

634
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,354
Me? Are you sure?

635
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,606
They summoned me?

636
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,483
Yes, sir.

637
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,860
What are they playing at?

638
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,987
Are they trying to infuriate me?

639
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:15,988
I'm sorry, sir.

640
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,826
They also sent an attachment.

641
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,246
The content of it
complicates this situation.

642
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,872
DIRECTOR CHOI SANG-HO

643
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:30,670
I sent the only person
you think of as a family to jail.

644
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,423
I gave the police the evidence.

645
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,636
How could you forgive me,
even if I was your daughter?

646
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,430
You seem quite determined tonight.

647
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,226
You are trying to provoke me
so I won't ignore you.

648
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,271
FAITHFUL WARM AND TRUSTY POLICE

649
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,774
Did Na-na send you that recording?

650
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,859
Yes.

651
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,571
What was her purpose in sending it to you?

652
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,158
As you saw on the news,
we're in charge of Cheon Na-na's case.

653
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,911
It was sent by the victim,
so we have no choice but to call--

654
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,914
I was simply scolding her as a father.

655
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,585
Any father who hears that

656
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,962
would've lost it, don't you agree?

657
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,757
Yes, you're right.
Your reaction was completely valid.

658
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,219
However, I ask that you understand
where we are coming from.

659
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,098
Cheon Na-na's overdose case

660
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,517
coincided perfectly

661
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,313
with what you said to her.

662
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,564
So what?

663
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,860
Must I defend myself to you people?

664
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,111
There's no need for that.

665
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,908
We're sure Cheon Na-na
fabricated everything.

666
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,242
Are you saying…

667
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,789
that I should also claim
that she fabricated this incident

668
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,585
to make me look like the culprit?

669
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,213
We're asking for your cooperation, sir.

670
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,133
We'll be honest with you.

671
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,510
Someone is obstructing our investigation.

672
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,554
We need your help to stop them.

673
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,223
And if I don't cooperate,

674
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,975
you'll release this recording
to the press.

675
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,852
Is that it?

676
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,479
Yes.

677
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,028
My pride

678
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,948
got very hurt just now.

679
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,159
I know I've grown weaker.

680
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,039
But not to the point that
I have to make a deal with you people.

681
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,336
Release the recording to the press.

682
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,548
Those words came out of my mouth.
I must take responsibility.

683
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,343
Your names are

684
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:47,473
Detectives Kang Do-chang
and Oh Ji-hyeok, right?

685
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:48,933
Yes, sir.

686
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,978
I only remember the names of people that

687
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,400
did me a great favor

688
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,821
or humiliated me beyond measure.

689
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,656
It's one of those two.

690
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,451
Regardless of why I remember your names,

691
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,373
I doubt I will ever forget them.

692
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,801
-Chairman!
-Stop him.

693
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,766
Chairman, I have something to tell you.

694
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,769
Let him through.

695
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,156
Our investigation is

696
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,076
to prove that Gi Dong-jae
didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

697
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,957
If we can prove it,
Cheon Sang-woo will be released.

698
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,056
My prediction is about to be correct.

699
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,433
Do you have the results?

700
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,060
Yes, sir.

701
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,688
I looked into the prices of
other properties around the area.

702
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,607
With the current market,

703
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,151
they go for about 45 billion won.

704
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,322
-My gosh.
-Divide that by 8. It's around 4 billion.

705
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,410
Why are you happy, you fool?

706
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,540
But isn't this a little unfair?

707
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,668
Shouldn't the money match the rank?

708
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,465
No, if anything, you and the Chief
should get less money.

709
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,925
Why?

710
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,635
You're both close to retirement.

711
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,428
We still have years left. We deserve more.

712
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,389
-Yes.
-You agree, right?

713
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,682
You boys are single.

714
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,561
The Chief and I are breadwinners.

715
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,563
I have my mom...

716
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,485
Chairman Cheon Seong-dae
has promised to cooperate.

717
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,112
Our investigation is good to go.

718
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,364
We just need to carry on this path.

719
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,865
Darn it.

720
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,551
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour, Mr. Cha.

721
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,053
It's fine. What is it, sir?

722
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,388
Are you free for dinner?

723
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,891
I am, but why do you want to see me?

724
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,937
I have some people
I want to introduce you to.

725
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,648
-Let's go in.
-All right.

726
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,066
It's good to see you.

727
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,781
-Hello.
-Thank you for calling me.

728
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,242
-I appreciate you coming here.
-It's my pleasure.

729
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,411
I'm glad to be here.

730
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,621
-You're here.
-Hello, Chairman.

731
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,623
-It's great seeing you.
-Yes, likewise.

732
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,417
-Hello, there.
-Gosh, hello.

733
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,210
What a pleasure.

734
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,296
-I'll see you inside.
-Okay.

735
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,090
-Hello.
-Thank you.

736
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,134
Members of the assembly,

737
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,387
Prosecutor General, Commissioner,
and Minister.

738
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,724
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

739
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,604
This is a great confidence boost for me.

740
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,984
You have all been on good terms with me,

741
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,944
one way or another.

742
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:34,241
I have never asked a favor
from any of you.

743
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,995
However, I wished that I had
just one time.

744
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,790
I thought I wasn't a picky eater,

745
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,003
but the food I ate in prison was

746
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,130
really not for my palate.

747
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,719
I'm a little embarrassed
to say this myself,

748
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,849
but I never wanted any of you to feel like
you owed me

749
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,019
for all the support I gave you.

750
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,148
To be completely honest,

751
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:11,237
I was saving my favor to ask you

752
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,864
in my most dire time of need.

753
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,910
That is now.

754
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,956
Please help me.

755
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,918
-What's he saying?
-What does he want?

756
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,133
-It was good seeing you.
-Yes, thank you for coming.

757
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,011
-Thank you.
-I had a great time.

758
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,013
-I enjoyed the meal.
-Thank you.

759
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,890
-Have a good night.
-I'll see you again.

760
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,310
-Goodnight.
-Goodbye, everyone.

761
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,818
This was a great opportunity for me.

762
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,778
I got to meet with such powerful people.

763
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,406
It was an honor for me.

764
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,119
You grew up in America, right?

765
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,454
Yes, sir.

766
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,295
There's one crucial thing you should know
if you want to do business here.

767
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,673
Unlike America,
you don't do business with money here.

768
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,175
You do it with politics.

769
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,428
Yes, sir.

770
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,649
What the hell are you people doing?

771
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,610
We have a search and seizure warrant.

772
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,945
For what?

773
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,666
You drew this yourself?

774
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,667
Yes.

775
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,379
I thought you only got a glance.
How is this so detailed?

776
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,842
Did someone give you a picture
and you drew based on that?

777
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,430
Can you give me a piece of paper, sir?

778
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,111
Would you mind coming in for a second?

779
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,160
Why did you want to see me, sir?

780
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,123
It's nothing. You can go.

781
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,041
Okay.

782
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,842
I need you to tell me
every single detail of what happened

783
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,721
between you and Captain Jang Gi-jin
at Mr. Jung's store.

784
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,353
Darn it.

785
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,527
What's going on, Captain?

786
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,028
What do you mean?

787
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,240
I saw that you were charged
with murdering Gi Dong-jae

788
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,909
and attempted murder of Jung In-beom
on the warrant.

789
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,161
Do you actually believe that?

790
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,831
They conjured up this nonsense

791
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,916
based on the lies Gu Jae-chun told them.

792
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,460
Captain... Listen, Gi-jin.

793
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,379
Your recent conduct

794
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,090
has been questionable to us too.

795
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,592
Please give us an explanation.

796
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,303
Why are you pushing the investigation
in an odd direction?

797
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,684
Summon Gu Jae-chun
from the detention center.

798
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,603
I'll question him myself

799
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,689
and reveal the truth to you all.

800
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,444
I prefer this over regular tofu.

801
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,029
Thanks for hanging in there. Eat up.

802
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,573
What about my brother?

803
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,826
He got me in this mess, right?

804
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,204
Hey, he did an honorable thing.

805
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:53,041
We didn't have to track down
the account thanks to his help.

806
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,877
I heard he withdrew the money.

807
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,087
Well, that's because he sensed

808
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,007
something was fishy about that money.

809
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,135
He did it just in case
it could be used against you.

810
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,137
He basically laundered the money.

811
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,141
You're not making any sense, Do-chang.

812
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,642
What? I'm not?

813
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,519
Why'd you say he laundered the money?

814
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,689
There's no need for criminal terminology.

815
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,483
Hey, don't blame your brother.

816
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,402
He was just used by bad people.

817
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,907
Jae-hong's right.
He was worried sick about you.

818
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,909
Not to mention, you got released

819
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,244
because he didn't get greedy
and told the truth.

820
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,539
Okay, I'm sorry.

821
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,957
-Hey, Man-gu.
-Yes?

822
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,501
If you look in my cabinet

823
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,878
-you'll see a bottle of soju.
-Okay.

824
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,464
-Here.
-You looked without my permission?

825
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,801
I won't have a drop of alcohol

826
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,013
until I cuff Jang Gi-jin myself.

827
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,724
I will make sure that

828
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,268
I arrest him myself.

829
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,272
All right.

830
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,110
-Let's have a drink in his stead then.
-Okay.

831
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,613
Yes, Inspector Yoon Sang-mi?

832
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,990
You've learned a lot.
You know how to ask for help.

833
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,575
What?

834
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,913
I got a call
from the Commissioner himself.

835
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,290
He ordered me to shut down
all investigations on

836
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,085
the detectives at Incheon Seobu Station.
How'd you do it?

837
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,130
I'm only one call away from
the Commissioner of the Incheon Division,

838
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,132
so that was a piece of cake.

839
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,009
Not him.

840
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,805
I got a call from the Commissioner
of the Seoul Headquarters.

841
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,682
It's my first time speaking to him too.

842
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,892
What? He called you himself?

843
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,144
Who's good side did you get on?

844
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,480
The Commissioner is not
an easy man to sway.

845
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,525
I can't tell you that.

846
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,902
You see, Sang-mi.

847
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,655
There are many secret connections
in the police force.

848
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:50,242
Just know that
I'm in the center of it all.

849
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,494
Is that so?

850
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,331
I'll have to hang up now

851
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,750
because I'm about to curse you out.

852
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,254
And don't ever answer my call

853
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:06,008
while you're drinking on duty
and spew nonsense at me.

854
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,929
You're in a good mood today.

855
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,640
No, I'm not.

856
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,059
I've just gone mad.

857
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,271
I'm losing my mind.

858
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,694
I'm going to pay for my crimes.

859
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,405
I suggest you do the same.

860
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,531
Let's accept our fates.

861
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,035
And stop trying
to come up with useless tricks.

862
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:36,955
Accepting your fate means
you'll rot in jail for life.

863
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,126
What are you going to tempt me with now?

864
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,086
I've seen your dirty deeds firsthand.

865
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,421
I'm still a cop.

866
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,049
I can easily get you out of this.

867
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:50,177
Stop with your lies.

868
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,096
Just go pray to whoever you believe in.

869
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,850
And pray you don't get sent to
the same prison as me, you punk.

870
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,687
You better watch your mouth.

871
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,527
Hey, it's me.

872
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,822
I'll put your boss on the phone.
Talk to him.

873
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,076
Here, take it.

874
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,745
It's your brother that you trust the most.

875
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,417
What's up?

876
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,379
Are you sure?

877
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,631
In cash?

878
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,051
Is that so?

879
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,220
All right.

880
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,348
I said I heard you, punk.

881
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,355
You're going to take care of my family?

882
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,440
That's a problem.

883
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,859
I have no family.

884
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,028
They're more like my enemies.

885
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,741
I have no interest in
taking care of my family.

886
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,583
That's too much money
for someone with a life sentence.

887
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,585
I'll probably die before I spend it all.

888
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,088
You wasted your time.

889
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,678
Do you want us both to go down?

890
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,430
Let's live.

891
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,975
You and me both.

892
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,779
I appreciate it. Put it here.

893
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,785
Boss.

894
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,091
Thanks for all your hard work.

895
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,635
This is going to take
longer than I thought.

896
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,721
You should go eat.

897
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,265
No, we're fine.

898
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,184
How's your boss doing?

899
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,772
I'm worried he might be upset with me.
He won't pick up my calls.

900
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,359
Please tell him I'll go see him soon.

901
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,736
Okay.

902
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,573
Is he still drinking
and frequenting karaoke bars?

903
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,450
This morning, murder suspect Gu Jae-chun

904
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,286
was caught on CCTV walking out
dressed in a police uniform

905
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:25,373
while being investigated at
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

906
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,710
Police have set up checkpoints
and are conducting a rigorous search

907
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,713
all across the city to catch
the escapee Gu Jae-chun.

908
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,133
However, they have yet to find
any leads on his whereabouts--

909
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:40,764
What kind of bullshit situation is this?

910
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,642
Jang Gi-jin is behind this.

911
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,561
That scumbag is not going to stop--

912
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,232
Jang Gi-jin broke him out.
He's probably hiding him somewhere.

913
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,983
Then he'll kill him.

914
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,569
Gu Jae-chun has to die
for his charges to disappear.

915
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,781
We'll find Gu Jae-chun
if we keep hounding Jang Gi-jin.

916
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:01,117
You think we can catch that sly fox?

917
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,954
Ji-ung is right.
He's probably coming up with a plan

918
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,372
as we speak.

919
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,124
I'm sorry I'm late.

920
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,837
Where have you been?
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

921
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,213
You got us all worried.

922
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,757
Jang Gi-jin is in
the palm of my hands now.

923
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,758
While tailing him,

924
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,761
I've memorized all his everyday routes.

925
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,766
-You're done with this, right?
-Yes, why do you ask?

926
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,934
It may come in handy.

927
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,060
Don't act rashly.

928
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,770
If you make the slightest mistake

929
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,231
while tailing or tracking him,
he'll know right away.

930
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,775
-Then it'll all go down the drain.
-I know.

931
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,444
Like you always say,
it's time to do some fieldwork.

932
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,990
I need to go, his meeting is about to end.

933
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,284
And I want you all to trust me
and be on standby.

934
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,535
I'll let you know if something goes down.

935
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,453
Wait, Dong-uk…

936
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,915
Why is he so confident?

937
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,376
Just trust him.
He's going out to do some fieldwork.

938
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,336
That's what a good detective does.

939
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:33,168
DANGER
BEWARE OF FALLING

940
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,679
I put it in just in case
someone tries to harm you.

941
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,348
It's loaded. Check for yourself.

942
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,565
Goodbye.

943
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,246
You all have bullets left, right?

944
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,330
-Yes.
-Yes.

945
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,500
Put your gun down.

946
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:00,922
You too.

947
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,382
Yes, sir!

948
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,385
Arrest them.

949
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,141
Goodness.

950
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:16,646
Consider yourself lucky.
I almost shot your head off.

951
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,897
You should be grateful.

952
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,331
Hey, hurry up and let him out.

953
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,042
I almost forgot.

954
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,962
-Darn, it's tight.
-What the--

955
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,847
-How long were you in there?
-Damn.

956
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:51,765
Here.

957
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,391
Throw this out for me.

958
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,477
Gross.

959
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,688
You should have just peed your pants.
This is worse.

960
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,107
-I got you.
-Good job, kid.

961
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,901
I caught him.

962
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,249
-Ji-ung.
-Yes?

963
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,419
Uncuff Captain Jang.

964
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,796
Why?

965
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,091
We should hear him out first.
We might've gotten it wrong.

966
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,927
It's also bad manners
to cuff a fellow detective.

967
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,095
Yes, you're right.

968
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,222
Sit down, you punk.

969
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,224
Sit.

970
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,768
-There.
-Darn it.

971
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,028
Let's start with Captain Jang first.

972
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,115
Why were the two of you
out there together?

973
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:55,078
He was trying to catch Gu Jae-chun.
You wanted to catch him yourself, right?

974
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,333
How will you explain the bag of money,

975
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,877
the fake passport,
and the gun found on site?

976
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,671
It was a sting operation.

977
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,258
He used to lure Gu in
so he could catch him. Isn't that right?

978
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,176
That makes sense.

979
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,053
Is that what he said?

980
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:16,182
You saw what happened.
He tried to shoot me.

981
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,560
He was going to kill me
to get rid of the evidence.

982
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,728
No way.

983
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,274
I was just his puppet.

984
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,901
I didn't even think about breaking out.

985
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,321
He ordered one of my men
to take my place in prison.

986
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,783
Then he gave me money and a ticket out
of this country. It was all him.

987
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,952
You punk! That's enough lies!

988
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,746
He's Captain of
the Seoul Criminal Investigation Division!

989
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,708
Why would a man like him do
something so atrocious?

990
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,420
This Captain was the one

991
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,505
who ordered us to kill
Jung Hui-ju's grandpa.

992
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,049
That's why we tried to kill him.

993
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,470
He broke me out of prison
and tried to kill me

994
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,096
to cover up his tracks!

995
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,307
He was also the one

996
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,268
who handed over Gi Dong-jae to us.

997
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,187
He wanted me to kill him!

998
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,691
I won't sit back and let you side with him
because he's a fellow detective.

999
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,860
I'm going to tell every reporter I know.

1000
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:13,198
How you detectives are
trying to frame me for everything!

1001
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,700
-Ji-ung.
-Yes?

1002
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,368
-Put the handcuffs…
-Yes?

1003
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,370
…back on Captain Jang.

1004
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,873
Yes, sir.

1005
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,170
Did you people take me for a fool?

1006
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,714
-No, we didn't.
-Be gentle.

1007
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,924
-Okay.
-Two notches.

1008
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,884
-Right.
-We didn't take you for a fool.

1009
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,885
We never would.

1010
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:41,142
This didn't happen
because Jang Gi-jin made a mistake.

1011
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:45,730
Honorary Chairman Cheon Seong-dae
has the detectives' backs.

1012
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,401
If things continue on this path,

1013
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,488
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo
might get released.

1014
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:54,822
If he does,

1015
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,117
that will give the detectives

1016
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,578
the chance to reinvestigate
Jung Hui-ju's murder.

1017
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,623
So?

1018
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,042
Even if they conduct a reinvestigation,

1019
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,003
they won't find any new evidence.

1020
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,631
But what's concerning is…

1021
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,760
Woo Tae-ho's case.

1022
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,934
If they find out that
his case was not an accident,

1023
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,812
then they will connect it to
Jung Hui-ju's case.

1024
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,690
That'll give the detectives a reason to

1025
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,859
keep digging into Jung Hui-ju's case.

1026
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,990
There's no need to worry.

1027
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,828
The detectives think
I tried to get us both killed.

1028
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,581
And that's the truth.

1029
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,587
Is it really?

1030
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:52,839
Yes.

1031
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,513
4 MONTHS AGO

1032
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,016
I'm saying,

1033
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,894
I didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

1034
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,647
Then who--

1035
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,982
I don't know that either.

1036
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,445
Why should I believe you?

1037
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,697
Do you know about

1038
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,160
the vacation home in Yangpyeong?

1039
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:27,498
I was handed Jung Hui-ju's body
from that place.

1040
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:30,960
From whom?

1041
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,962
Captain Choi Yong-geun.

1042
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,679
So he killed Jung Hui-ju?

1043
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,765
Who knows.

1044
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,266
However,

1045
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:49,854
there was no need
for him to murder her himself.

1046
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:54,192
If he waited, I would've done it for him.

1047
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,449
So I wondered if it was Cheon Sang-woo

1048
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,702
who killed her.

1049
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,163
But then Mr. Choi said to me,

1050
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,626
"Tell Vice-chairman Cheon
that you killed her."

1051
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,419
"Or you won't get paid."

1052
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,965
I called Vice-chairman Cheon
after I took the body.

1053
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,512
I told him I wasn't
able to kill Jung Hui-ju yet.

1054
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,224
Then he told me to hurry up and kill her.

1055
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,269
Vice-chairman Cheon

1056
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,482
didn't know Jung Hui-ju was dead.

1057
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:35,983
So I realized

1058
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,071
it wasn't Cheon Sang-woo.

1059
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,824
Then who could it be?

1060
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,787
The shadow I saw in the living room
of the vacation room

1061
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,500
when I was taking the body.

1062
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,337
Who was it?

1063
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,301
That's everything I know.

1064
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,513
It's your turn now.

1065
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,057
I know

1066
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,436
you're suspicious of someone.

1067
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,274
Tell me.

1068
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,527
Who is that person?

1069
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,575
101 OCHEON-RI, SEONGSA-MYEON,
YANGPYEONG-GUN, GYEONGGI-DO

1070
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,593
What is it?

1071
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,228
Why…

1072
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,775
were you here that day?

1073
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:02,987
The day Jung Hui-ju was murdered.

1074
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,325
Why did you come here?

1075
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,294
I don't remember.

1076
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,840
What exact date are you talking about?

1077
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,885
I went through your car's GPS records.

1078
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,347
You came here that day.

1079
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,809
I guess I did then.

1080
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,519
With whom?

1081
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,106
Jung Hui-ju?

1082
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,444
Why did you bring her here?

1083
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,538
I asked her

1084
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,540
why it was.

1085
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,000
Why...

1086
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,046
she loved you.

1087
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,343
Did you love her too?

1088
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,014
I'm still confused.

1089
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,433
Tae-ho.

1090
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,692
Were we ever in love?

1091
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,245
Were you in pain…

1092
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,750
when she died?

1093
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,052
What about today?

1094
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,056
I know you know.

1095
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,268
How do you feel?

1096
01:04:58,686 --> 01:04:59,937
Is it equally as painful?

1097
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,526
I never loved you.

1098
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,573
If I had,

1099
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,577
I would've killed Jung Hui-ju.

1100
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,790
But I didn't kill her.

1101
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,045
What you're suspecting is wrong.

1102
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,214
Cheong Sang-woo killed Jung Hui-ju.

1103
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,926
It was my brother who did it.

1104
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,430
No.

1105
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,391
It wasn't Cheon Sang-woo.

1106
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,103
I killed her.

1107
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,151
I was scared our relationship
might come to light.

1108
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,820
So I killed her.

1109
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:55,242
This all started because of me.
So that's what happened.

1110
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,539
You didn't do anything, Na-na.

1111
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,834
I'll turn myself in.

1112
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:08,839
The police will agree that
I had a clear motive.

1113
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,050
Who are you doing this for?

1114
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:13,678
Jung Hui-ju?

1115
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,306
Or me?

1116
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,437
It was me.

1117
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,440
I killed Jung Hui-ju here.

1118
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,362
It was an accident.

1119
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,787
About ten years.

1120
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,168
I'll get to see you again

1121
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,422
in about ten years.

1122
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,676
All I ask is…

1123
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,221
that you will tell me one thing.

1124
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,101
That...

1125
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,315
you will forgive me.

1126
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,695
I'm sorry.

1127
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:57,948
I still can't…

1128
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,994
forgive you.

1129
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,362
Let's have Cheon Na-na take
the reins for the time being.

1130
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,614
You've already chosen one over the other.

1131
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,658
I looked into my brother's trial.

1132
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,743
I saw Detective Oh was
a witness for the defense.

1133
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,078
You are the killer.

1134
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:47,915
-Won't you regret this?
-I'll prove that I'm right.

1135
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,917
It was Cheon Sang-woo, not me!

1136
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,169
The killer's scenario is perfect.

1137
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,088
But there's one flaw.

1138
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,090
Are you talking about Choi Yong-geun?

1139
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,925
Has any of your colleagues died?

1140
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,510
They're looking all over for me.

1141
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,596
Now we have to trust each other.

1142
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:10,980
