1
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,963
This watch used to belong
to my late father.

2
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,886
After my father passed away,
I was raised by my uncle.

3
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,055
And he had this watch back then.

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,850
It's me, your uncle.

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
What's up?

6
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,189
Do you remember the watch
your father gave me before he died?

7
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,649
-Yes.
-Did you take that

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,568
when you were in high school?

9
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,028
No.

10
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,449
Jong-tae told me you stole it
from my study.

11
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:18,578
Does that mean Jong-tae lied to me?

12
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,999
Okay, let's hang up.

13
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,630
It had been ten years since I left home,
and this was the first time he called me.

14
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,882
It was November 6, 2015.

15
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,969
This phone call was recorded three days
after Yoon Ji-seon's body was found.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,229
Don't people say the coffee tastes better?

17
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,981
I think it's a lot creamier.
The smell seems to last longer, too.

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,191
Yes.

19
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,612
Tell your friend that our sales went up
and thank him for me.

20
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,741
If he ever tries to increase the cost,
don't forget to mention my name.

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,203
He was able to grow his business
thanks to me.

22
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,790
If it weren't for me, he'd still be
importing and selling rotten meat.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,168
I always wonder

24
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,339
how Hyeon-ju and I would've gotten by
if it weren't for you.

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,842
Same here.

26
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,220
If it weren't for you and Hyeon-ju,

27
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,764
life would've been really tough.

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,438
Detective Kang Do-chang came by earlier.

29
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,774
Why?

30
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,860
The watch you told me
to put up for auction.

31
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,945
Where did you get it?

32
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,155
Did he ask you that?

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,489
Tell me the truth.

34
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,199
Did you tell him that I gave it to you?

35
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,244
I can't use that kind of money
to pay for Hyeon-ju's overseas studies.

36
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,954
What if she finds out later?

37
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,623
She can just study here.

38
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,292
I asked you if you told him.

39
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,961
Did you tell Do-chang?

40
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,882
Yes.

41
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,890
Do you know why

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,393
I chose to be
with a single mother like you?

43
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,148
It was because of Jin-su.

44
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,776
I felt sorry for him.

45
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,406
It was because I felt sorry for him.

46
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,050
Yes, she told Kang Do-chang
and Oh Ji-hyeok.

47
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,969
She's also going to testify in court.

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,806
Try to keep things within my jurisdiction.

49
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,935
It'll be easier to take care of things.

50
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,101
Hey, you know

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,187
that watch you bought at the auction?

52
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,524
Did you really pay
800 million won for that?

53
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,485
Yes.

54
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,073
Then you could've paid
for the jajangmyeon.

55
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,242
Rich people are greedier.

56
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,494
Hello, sir.

57
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,180
Do you really think she'll testify?

58
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,515
She has a lot to give up.

59
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,561
She's a kind woman.

60
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,105
I know that for a fact.

61
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,067
Hello.

62
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,944
One hot Americano, please.

63
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,863
Are you going to drink it here?

64
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,573
Okay.

65
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,671
Captain Woo.

66
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,299
Yes, sir?

67
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,385
I think of you as my family.

68
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,304
The same goes for you guys.

69
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:52,310
We're a family because we risk our lives
to protect one another.

70
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,148
But when someone turns their back
and tries to attack the family,

71
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,526
that person becomes a traitor.

72
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,654
You agree with that, right?

73
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,869
I'm sure you all know
whom I'm talking about.

74
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,413
I trust you'll behave accordingly.

75
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,969
I heard the chief gathered you guys.
What did he say?

76
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,721
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

77
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,018
You punks. Didn't you hear the chief?

78
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,355
He told you that if you fail to catch
at least one culprit every day,

79
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,148
he'll make you guys

80
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,361
run around looking for missing dogs!
Did you not hear that?

81
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,990
Jae-hong, what's going on?

82
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,200
Do-chang, seriouslyâ€¦

83
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,328
My gosh, forget it.

84
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,082
Shall we go?

85
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,003
-Do-chang.
-Yes, sir?

86
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,172
Can we talk in private?

87
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,107
-What should we do now?
-What do you think?

88
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,067
We should listen to the guy
who has more power.

89
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,112
You all have a few cases
up your sleeves, right?

90
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,200
If not, be ready to sleep outside
for the next few days.

91
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,994
-Yes, I have one.
-Me too.

92
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,203
I have one right here.

93
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,499
Here.

94
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,214
Do-chang, it's time for you to stop.

95
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:51,637
Stop worrying about someone else
and start thinking about yourself.

96
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,765
It's time for you to get promoted.

97
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,058
Bong-sik.

98
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,480
I majored in sports back in high school,
but I failed to go to college.

99
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,815
So do you know what I did
right after I graduated?

100
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,570
I joined a gang, and they gave me dog food
to keep myself full.

101
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,033
But the cops just happened to show up
on the first day I was given a job.

102
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,285
I ran like crazy.

103
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,705
No, I didn't run. I rolled.

104
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,332
I got caught right away and fell down.

105
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,712
The cop asked me my age,
and I told him I was 19 years old.

106
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,715
Then he put on a smile and told me this.
"Lose weight and come back."

107
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:32,553
And as soon as he turned around,
I could see a halo shining from behind.

108
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,640
-He was really cool.
-Why are you suddenly talking about--

109
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,893
That's why I lost weight and became a cop.
It was all because of that halo.

110
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,733
Bong-sik, let me tell you something.

111
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,570
Even if I get fired, I want to be a cop
whom people can look up to.

112
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,493
Do-chang, you were assigned
to a new position.

113
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,622
-Hey, sir.
-Hey.

114
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,583
-Hey, officer.
-Listen to me.

115
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,544
-My gosh.
-Damn.

116
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,128
When do we rotate?

117
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,549
I'll take your place at 6:00 p.m.

118
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,134
And you need to be back here
by 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

119
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,765
It was Oh Jong-tae, right?

120
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,766
Oh Jong-tae.

121
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,270
You wrote in your article
that it was a businessman named Mr. Oh.

122
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,437
That has to be Oh Jong-tae.

123
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,443
So he turned out to be Yoo Jeong-ryeol
and Yoo Jeong-seok's weakness.

124
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,574
My gosh, it all makes sense now.

125
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,243
What's the new evidence
that you said you'd give me?

126
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,121
Oh Jong-tae is the real culprit, right?

127
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,747
What's the other evidence?

128
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,542
You just wait. You'll hear it soon.

129
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,505
You'll end up earning brownie points
from your boss.

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,884
Okay, great.

131
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,731
My gosh.

132
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,777
Isn't he Cho Yong-hwan,
the guy who runs a gambling house?

133
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,530
You recently told me he got away.

134
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,573
Back then, I had toâ€¦

135
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,618
He had to attend his father's
memorial service the next day.

136
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,495
His father runs a dumpling restaurant
in Songdo.

137
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,372
I even ate there yesterday.

138
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,499
What kind of nonsense is that?

139
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,626
A dumpling restaurant?

140
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,794
You're friends
with his brother-in-law, right?

141
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,714
I know you guys drink together
at hostess bars, you darn punks.

142
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,842
You have no right to talk. Be quiet.

143
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,969
I'm so disappointed in you guys.

144
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,471
What? What's your problem?

145
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,140
You were capable of catching them,
but you didn't.

146
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,516
-My gosh.
-Unbelievable.

147
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,563
Hey, come on.
You shouldn't think of it like that.

148
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,609
These guys areâ€¦ Professionally speakingâ€¦

149
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,820
-They're our emergency food.
-That's right. Our emergency food.

150
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,197
Let's go.

151
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,531
Do we go back to the office?

152
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,284
Why would we go there?

153
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,827
Pardon?

154
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,914
SEOBU POLICE STATION

155
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,006
Do-chang.

156
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,300
How is it?

157
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,761
I'm not fit for the job.

158
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,138
I might get blisters on my ass.

159
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,474
What should we do?

160
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,227
We have a lot to investigate
before the second trial.

161
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,272
My gosh.

162
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,069
-What?
-What are these minions doing here?

163
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,737
Minions?

164
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,454
-Thanks, guys.
-Don't thank us. It's no big deal.

165
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,165
We're a team.
The chief can't stop us from helping you.

166
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,042
Can you make sure he doesn't notice?

167
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,753
We have enough emergency food
for about three days.

168
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,422
We'll arrest one guy every day.

169
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,174
He adjusts very quickly.

170
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,051
You're so fit for the job.

171
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,137
Is the van open?

172
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,264
Oh, yes. You're going there alone?

173
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,099
No, don't.
Dong-uk, you should go with her.

174
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,517
She can go alone.

175
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:12,106
Hey, tell them to come inside
if they need to use the bathroom.

176
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,274
Got it.

177
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,027
Gosh, you can't send her there alone.
It's dangerous.

178
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,614
That bronze one over there
is the only one that's mine.

179
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,577
The other silver and gold medals
all belong to her.

180
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,413
My gosh, Eun-hui won all these?

181
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,081
Don't touch anything.

182
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,082
Okay.

183
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,851
I'm not in a good mood these days.

184
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,686
If you cause trouble, I'll kill you.

185
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,491
YOO JEONG-RYEOL APPOINTED
AS THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE

186
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,494
YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL

187
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,703
What's this?

188
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,749
Prosecutor Jung,
please help me out just this once.

189
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,127
Can you call the civil petition officer
and talk to him?

190
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,046
I have no power.

191
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,465
Do you not remember
Lee Dae-cheol's case from five years ago?

192
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,345
If you didn't ask me for a favor,
I would've let him go.

193
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,598
Chief Moon, what are you talking about?

194
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,518
You asked me to conceal the evidence.

195
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,647
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?
You're unbelievable.

196
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,569
Okay, fine. Just don't go around
talking about that to anyone else.

197
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,909
You asked me to conceal the evidence.

198
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,913
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?
You're unbelievable.

199
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:55,501
Okay, fine. Just don't go around
talking about that to anyone else.

200
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,795
Okay, sure. I'll forget about

201
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:02,967
everything that happened between us
as of this very moment.

202
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,427
If this goes public, we'll win the trial.

203
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,596
You'll win?

204
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,975
If Lee Dae-cheol gets acquitted,
does that mean you win?

205
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,562
No, that's not what I meant.

206
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,981
But still, this is conclusive evidence.

207
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,775
One person is Moon Sang-beom,
the chief investigator of the case,

208
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,403
and the other guy is Jung Sang-il,
the prosecutor who was in charge

209
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,905
of the case back then
and is in charge of the current retrial.

210
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,160
The police and prosecutors worked together
to frame Lee Dae-cheol five years ago.

211
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,996
Who sent you this recording file?

212
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,708
-That'sâ€¦
-Is it necessary for you to hide

213
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,209
the source even to your boss?

214
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,132
Kim Gi-tae, the former chief prosecutor.

215
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,095
Okay, go ahead and write the article.

216
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,181
-Let's publish it tomorrow.
-Okay.

217
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,518
But don't tell this to anyone
until the article is published.

218
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,061
I want it to be exclusive.

219
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,355
Make sure you don't leak
the recording file.

220
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,815
Okay.

221
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,609
Hello, chief. It's me, Yoo Jeong-seok.

222
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,863
You'll have to take care
of something urgently.

223
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,035
Finding the culprit
isn't our first priority.

224
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,828
We have to find the evidence to prove that

225
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,165
the police fabricated the evidence, and
Lee Dae-cheol was framed for the murder.

226
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,045
The biggest reason Lee Dae-cheol was
accused as the murderer

227
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,716
was because Yoon Ji-seon's hair
was found inside his truck.

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,136
Please check where he went with his truck
and when it got sent to get inspected.

229
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,680
Do you guys normally wash the truck?

230
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,391
Like you told us earlier, do the trucksâ€¦

231
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,184
There's a witness who's willing to testify

232
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,436
that there was a deal
between a cop and the real culprit.

233
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,607
We need to make sure she stays safe
until the day of the trial.

234
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,455
This manâ€¦

235
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,791
Isn't he the murderer?

236
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,167
Yes, that's right.

237
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,337
The residents all freaked out back then.

238
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:50,676
We had to reinstall security cameras
at the main gate because of him.

239
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,304
It's so hard to tell a book by its cover.

240
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,933
I used to pity him because he always
used to make deliveries with his daughter.

241
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,020
He took his daughter with him?

242
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,815
Yes, she was in middle school,
and her school was nearby.

243
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,318
I heard he picked her up after school
and took her along to make deliveries.

244
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:18,162
NOVEMBER 8, 2015
5 DAYS AFTER YOON JI-SEON'S BODY WAS FOUND

245
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,487
Dad, when are we going to eat?

246
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
I'm hungry.

247
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,588
What are you doing outside? It's cold.

248
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,347
Do you remember the man you saw that day?

249
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,977
Try to remember.
You're the only person who saw him.

250
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,315
I don't remember.

251
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,569
Eun-hye, you must remember his face.

252
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,532
That's how you can save your dad.

253
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,661
Ji-hyeok, you must remember his face.

254
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,706
That way, your father will be able
to rest in peace.

255
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,086
Please try to remember.

256
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,256
Whether we win or lose this trial
depends on you.

257
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,893
Do-chang, it's almost time for your shift.

258
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,645
You should get going now.

259
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,651
Eun-hye, you have to remember him, okay?

260
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,128
Mr. Yoo, where are you right now?

261
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,926
What happened?

262
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,179
Why didn't my article get published?

263
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,056
Whyâ€¦

264
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,727
Can you tell me why? You told me
to write the article yesterday.

265
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
It was decided
during the meeting last night.

266
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,232
Is that before I sent you my article?

267
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,692
Or after?

268
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,905
You had already decided
not to publish it, didn't you?

269
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,866
You were never
going to publish my article, were you?

270
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,499
"We write articles for the weak."

271
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,670
When my dad had no power,

272
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,090
and no one was willing to hear him out,

273
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,553
that's what you said to me
as you wrote an article about him.

274
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,139
But whyâ€¦

275
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,476
Whyâ€¦ Why not do the same this time?

276
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,857
Do you think I wrote that article
because your father was weak?

277
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,571
The organization he was working for
was weak enough for me to fight against.

278
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,200
But this time,
it's the police and prosecution.

279
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,870
If the recording goes public,
they'll cut off their tails.

280
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,539
But they won't forgive those
who caused harm to their organization.

281
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,208
That's how they roll.

282
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,460
Do you think

283
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,046
Lee Dae-cheol will be able
to win the trial with this?

284
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,467
The police and prosecution
will try even harder to win.

285
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,304
They'll destroy Lee Dae-cheol's life
along with every single person

286
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,849
who stood by his side
and tried to help him.

287
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,394
And that includes you,
the person who wrote the article.

288
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,730
What if I'm willing to risk that
to expose the truth?

289
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,107
How will you do that

290
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,442
when we have no space for your article?

291
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,116
Pretend you never heard it.

292
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,285
That's how you can protect your career.

293
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,746
If I stay quiet about this,

294
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,293
it will burden me until the day I die.

295
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,379
The same goes for me.

296
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,799
You're not the only one
who's staying quiet about this.

297
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,278
I met the commissioner this morning.

298
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,114
We talked about a few things,

299
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,659
and I told him about you.

300
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,870
Me?

301
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,707
I told him we have someone
very competent in our team

302
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,210
and asked him to remember
your name, Yoon Sang-mi.

303
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,840
Thank you. But whyâ€¦

304
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,763
He's showing interest
in Lee Dae-cheol's retrial these days.

305
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,226
I heard you were in the team
that was in charge of the case.

306
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,062
Yes, that's right.

307
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,023
Can you tell me what happened back then?

308
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,986
I want you to be honest
and tell me everything that happened.

309
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,824
This will be a great chance
to get the commissioner to remember you.

310
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,415
Why is she taking so long?

311
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,015
Ms. Jung!

312
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,101
Darn it.

313
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,270
Ms. Jung Yu-seon!

314
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,396
Get out of the car!

315
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,023
Ms. Jung!

316
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,275
Get out of the car!

317
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,236
Hey!

318
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,321
Ms. Jung was in there, right?

319
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,948
Remember, 4728.

320
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,095
The witness isn't here yet.

321
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,638
Can you not reach her?

322
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,224
You might have to prepare for the worst.

323
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,145
We'll get off here.

324
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,838
Excuse me.

325
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,758
Isn't heâ€¦

326
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,052
It's him. Check if Ms. Jung is inside.

327
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,054
He's the guy that Detective Oh arrested.

328
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,184
Ms. Jung.

329
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,977
That punk.

330
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,313
Hey!

331
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,190
Ms. Jung, are you inside?

332
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,775
Ms. Jung!

333
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,987
Hey! Stop!

334
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,114
Hey, wait. Let's just talk.

335
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,950
That damn bastard.

336
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,413
This is crazy.

337
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,587
Hey, come on.
Let's not make this difficult.

338
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,172
Heyâ€¦ Oh, come on!

339
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,556
Darn it.

340
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,231
Hey, stop!

341
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,942
That littleâ€¦ You're dead.

342
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,208
Hey, come here.

343
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,417
You littleâ€¦

344
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,798
My gosh.

345
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,883
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

346
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,177
How did it go? Did you find her?

347
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,887
Yes, kind of.

348
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,848
But he switched her with someone else.

349
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,433
Ms. Jung isn't here.

350
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,854
Okay, try to find her again.

351
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,525
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.
Do you understand?

352
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,245
Yu-seon.

353
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,415
Are you okay? Is everything okay?

354
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,211
I don't think I can go to court.

355
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,298
You don't need to go. You really don't.

356
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,135
Just tell me you're okay.
Nothing happened to you, right?

357
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,803
I'm fine.

358
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,099
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

359
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,768
I hope you understand.

360
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,022
I don't care what happens to me.

361
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,900
But my daughterâ€¦

362
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,571
I feel like this might
put Hyeon-ju in danger.

363
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,823
I'm sorry, Detective Kang.

364
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,658
No, it's okay.

365
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,578
What matters is that you're okay.

366
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,789
I asked for too much.

367
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,500
I won't ever ask you
to do anything like this again.

368
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,461
Just make sure

369
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,131
you don't ever get hurt.

370
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,426
That'sâ€¦

371
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,512
all I ask of you.

372
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,224
Okay. Goodbye then.

373
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,995
Come back once the retrial is over.

374
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,999
I was the one who should've died, right?

375
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,796
Make sure you get on the plane.

376
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,464
Or your safety won't be guaranteed.

377
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,112
Neverâ€¦

378
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,074
I will neverâ€¦

379
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,079
forgive you people.

380
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,668
You damn bastards.

381
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,470
-Do you remember this watch?
-Yes.

382
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,680
Tell us about the watch.

383
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,141
I saw it in Ji-seon's studio.

384
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,060
Someone had left it in the bathroom,
and I found it.

385
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,937
Whom did she say it belonged to?

386
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,981
Oh Jong-tae.

387
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,525
DUI INCIDENT REPORT

388
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,197
In the morning of November 3, 2015,
which was when the body was found,

389
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,451
Oh Jong-tae was caught by the police
driving under the influence

390
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,953
at 45-1 Baekgogae-ro, Namdong-gu, Incheon.

391
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,456
He got investigated at the police station.

392
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,501
This proves that the CCTV footage
that shows he was at a hotel in Busan

393
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,711
was actually fabricated.

394
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,840
He got caught driving under the influence

395
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,509
around 13km away from
where Yoon Ji-seon's body was abandoned

396
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,219
which only takes about ten minutes by car.

397
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,722
The police also gave him a ticket

398
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,224
for crossing the centerline.

399
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,562
You crossed the centerline.

400
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,314
Can I see your license?

401
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,527
He was on his way back
to where he had abandoned the body.

402
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,573
The reason he wanted to go back

403
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,326
was because of this watch.

404
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,537
He realized that he accidentally dropped
his watch there.

405
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,335
Was that watch found at the scene?

406
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,462
Yes, I'm sure that's where it was found.

407
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,757
But someone secretly took this watch.

408
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,219
He found out
the watch belonged to Oh Jong-tae

409
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,554
and tried to make a deal with him.

410
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,934
How can you prove that Oh Jong-tae was
the owner of that watch?

411
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:15,939
This watch is a luxury watch,
and only two exist in Korea.

412
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,108
There's only one place in the country
that's capable of fixing this watch.

413
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,401
Once you go there,

414
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,488
it's easy to figure out
who owned the watch back then.

415
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,534
The person who found this
probably knew that, too.

416
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,912
Who was the person
that checked the information?

417
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,916
Detective Nam Guk-hyeon
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

418
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,964
Your Honor.

419
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,882
Yes, go ahead.

420
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,553
Is there any evidence
or a witness that can prove

421
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,471
that Detective Nam had that watch?

422
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,854
No, not yet.

423
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,146
That means

424
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,941
the watchmaker's memory
from five years ago

425
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,401
is the only thing we can rely on.

426
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,071
How old is the watchmaker?

427
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,949
He's 75 years old.

428
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,742
That is all.

429
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:25,550
The biggest proof that got the defendant
arrested as Yoon Ji-seon's murderer

430
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,428
was the victim's hair that was found
inside his truck.

431
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,182
And her hair was found in his truck

432
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,351
five days after she was found dead.

433
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,855
But according to the logistics company,
the inside of Lee Dae-cheol's truck

434
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,108
was cleaned out three days
after the murder occurred.

435
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,029
That means her hair still remained
even after the truck was cleaned.

436
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,741
But when the company cleans the truck,
they also wash it down with water.

437
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,162
But for some reason,
her hair still remained in the car.

438
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,831
Why do you think so?

439
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,291
Witness.

440
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,545
After school, you always followed your dad
to make deliveries. Is that correct?

441
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:03,922
Yes.

442
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,716
And you heard someone
open the truck doors from behind

443
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,968
while your dad was gone
to make a delivery, right?

444
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,263
-Yes.
-You thought that was your dad,

445
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,973
so you got out and checked.

446
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,351
But that person wasn't your dad.
Is that correct?

447
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,312
Yes.

448
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,272
Do you remember his face?

449
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,952
I remember he was wearing a hat and jeans.

450
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,499
I understand.
You were in seventh grade back then.

451
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,752
And it's hard to remember someone
that you saw briefly five years ago.

452
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:47,048
But what if you see him again?

453
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,550
Then you might remember.

454
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,184
Are you the detective in charge
of Yoon Ji-seon's murder case?

455
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,852
Do you know who killed her?

456
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,855
No, I'm sorry. Not yet.

457
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,193
This is a footage of Detective Nam,

458
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,863
the detective who was in charge,
appearing on the news.

459
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,991
He's wearing a hat and jeans.

460
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,285
If he turns out to be the one
who opened the truck doors,

461
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,413
that means the evidence was fabricated.

462
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,585
Witness.

463
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,295
Do you remember him?

464
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,176
Try your best to remember.
It's him, right?

465
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,806
Turn your face to the left so he can see.

466
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,352
Ji-hyeok, please.

467
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,022
He's the one
who stabbed your father, right?

468
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,067
Ji-hyeok, I'm sure it was him.

469
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,528
Just tell me it was him.

470
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,698
You were too shocked then,
so you probably don't remember.

471
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,034
I'm sure it's him.

472
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,161
Just tell me he killed your father.

473
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,736
Witness, do you remember now?

474
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,488
Was it him?

475
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,448
Your Honor.

476
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,285
Do not pressure the witness.

477
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,544
I don't know.

478
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,339
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

479
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,306
It's okay.

480
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,475
Dad.

481
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,976
It's okay.

482
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,407
I made a mistake, didn't I?

483
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,121
I should've said it was him, right?

484
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,834
It's not right to lie in court.

485
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,671
We did pretty well today.

486
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,672
We'll see good results.

487
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,440
Do you think

488
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,776
Lee Dae-cheol will be able
to win the trial with this?

489
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,988
The police and prosecution
will try even harder to win.

490
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,408
They'll destroy Lee Dae-cheol's life
along with every single person

491
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,035
who stood by his side
and tried to help him.

492
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,016
Do you understand Kang Do-chang?

493
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,144
If Lee Dae-cheol turns out to be innocent,

494
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,565
people won't be able to trust the cops
with anything anymore.

495
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,735
Why is he doing this when he's been
working as a cop for 18 years?

496
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,903
I don't get it.

497
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,530
What can I do to help you?

498
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,240
Didn't the commissioner tell you?

499
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,909
He just told me

500
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,828
to meet you.

501
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,163
Oh, I see.

502
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,083
The commissioner called me in person

503
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,877
and gave me a heads-up.

504
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,422
You're going to get a special promotion

505
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,759
for preserving the reputation
of the police organization.

506
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,599
I should've called to congratulate him.

507
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,601
But I only get limited phone calls.

508
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,854
I know it's late, but tell your brother
that I sincerely congratulate him.

509
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,607
You sent the recording file
to Ms. Jin, didn't you?

510
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,275
Me? I didn't send her anything.

511
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,027
What do you want?

512
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,528
What do you think?

513
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,740
I just want to get out of here.

514
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,283
That's all I want.

515
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,745
-Is that what you want?
-But I don't expect that to happen.

516
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,207
As you already know, I'm not on good terms
with the new minister of justice.

517
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,417
You know how much your brother hates me.

518
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,630
Gi-tae.

519
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,967
-Yes?
-You just opened Pandora's box.

520
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,469
I plan

521
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,973
to close it again
so that there won't be any hope.

522
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,685
But I'll leave you a hole
so you can breathe

523
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,728
and stay alive.

524
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,943
You were just a little kid
who knew nothing about the world.

525
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,822
But you seem to have learned a few things
seeing that you know how to play around

526
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,991
with your opponent.

527
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,463
It's urgent.

528
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,732
-Detective Oh.
-Yes?

529
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,986
You take a lot of bribes, don't you?

530
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,988
Me?

531
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,367
-I'm not sure.
-How can you afford to pay for this?

532
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,162
I bet you have your fun
behind people's backs.

533
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,583
You don't sound too sophisticated
for a reporter.

534
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,086
What did the lawyer say?
Does he think you'll win the trial?

535
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,671
-Yes.
-He might be right.

536
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,091
That judge is pretty unusual,
so he might act out of the ordinary.

537
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,510
But it won't work.

538
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,056
Lee Dae-cheol and his daughter
are both too nice.

539
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,142
They need to be a little selfish.
Otherwise, they won't win.

540
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,561
You don't always lose
just because you're kind.

541
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,775
Detective Kang is going to testify
as a witness during the next trial.

542
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,151
That might help us win.

543
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,654
Whom do you think you're fighting against?

544
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,159
Prosecutor Jung? Detective Nam?

545
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,160
Or Oh Jong-tae?

546
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,497
Why? Do you have additional evidence?

547
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,999
No.

548
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,087
-No.
-Then why did you ask me that?

549
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,383
In the end,
people only care about themselves.

550
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,015
Do you enjoy being a detective?

551
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,850
Yes.

552
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,268
Then you should thank me.

553
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,023
Thank me for helping you keep your job.
Go on.

554
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,862
Just say it.
I also enjoy being a reporter.

555
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,865
I want to keep working as one.

556
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,785
So just thank me.

557
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,786
Hurry.

558
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,789
I need to know why in order to thank you.

559
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,754
Later on,

560
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,340
when the time comes,

561
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,593
you'll end up thanking me.

562
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,222
I guarantee that.

563
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,856
Yes, it's true that my life is important.

564
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,484
But sometimes,

565
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,989
other people's lives end up
determining my life.

566
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,057
Try to remember.
You're the only person who saw him.

567
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,894
Do you remember now? Was it him?

568
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,313
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

569
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,065
It's okay.

570
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,401
It's okay.

571
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,164
Mr. Lee.

572
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,335
-Yes, sir?
-Does this feel unfair to you?

573
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,005
You killed Yoon Ji-seon, didn't you?
Just admit it.

574
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,425
No, I swearâ€¦

575
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,761
I swear I didn't kill her.

576
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,221
Then what about Detective Jang?

577
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,599
Of course I didn't kill him.
Why would I kill him

578
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,518
when I didn't even kill Yoon Ji-seon?

579
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,894
Why not?

580
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,023
-What?
-He kept accusing you of murder

581
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,317
when you didn't even kill anyone.

582
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,320
So you could've gotten angry
and killed him.

583
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,822
Think about it carefully.

584
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,534
You won't get executed
with accidental murder.

585
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,042
A trial always ends
with a winner and a loser.

586
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,213
But sometimes,
both sides can win the case.

587
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,923
Come inside.

588
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,260
See you in court.

589
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,231
What are you doing here?

590
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,942
Well, the thing is,

591
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,487
Detective Kang wasn't feeling very well,
so he asked me to take his place.

592
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,906
Where is Do-chang right now?

593
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,957
Hello?

594
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,461
Go ahead and fire me.

595
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,882
If you want me fired, then go ahead.

596
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,093
What?

597
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,596
No, you're wrong.

598
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,515
What I'm doing is right.

599
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,060
I'm doing the right thing.

600
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,729
What?

601
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,233
You're the one
who's disgracing the police.

602
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,778
You little piece of trash!

603
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,821
You bastard.

604
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,282
Do-chang.

605
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,785
Don't quit your job.

606
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,703
Don't worry.

607
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,708
Even if I quit, I'll make enough money
to support you.

608
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:31,919
Do-chang.

609
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,880
Working as a cop

610
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,177
is the only thing you can do.

611
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,763
Think about it carefully.

612
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,891
Think about what you'll be left with
once you're no longer a cop.

613
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,828
I'm Detective Kang Do-chang
in Violent Crimes Unit Team Two,

614
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,288
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

615
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,751
Witness. How do you know the defendant,
Lee Dae-cheol?

616
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,588
My colleagues,
Detective Jang and Detective Nam,

617
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,342
were in charge of investigating
Yoon Ji-seon's death.

618
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,512
And when Detective Jang got killed
during the investigation,

619
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,723
I took over and was in charge
until we solved the case.

620
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,853
Back then, were you convinced
that Lee Dae-cheol was the culprit?

621
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,272
-Yes.
-How about now?

622
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,862
Detective Jang,
who got murdered back then,

623
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,030
was both my colleague and friend.

624
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,117
He was the best detective.

625
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,580
Back then, I was furious
and wasn't thinking straight.

626
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,708
I had to find the culprit.

627
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,419
I had to get a confession no matter what.

628
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,172
-You bastard!
-And because of that,

629
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,925
I drove Lee Dae-cheol to a corner.

630
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,180
I didn't verify the evidence
that I had received back then.

631
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,099
I just believed it was the truth.

632
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,978
I was just obsessed with

633
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,689
catching the culprit.

634
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,568
So do you admit you didn't carry out
a proper investigation

635
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:23,906
because you were affected
by the death of your colleague?

636
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,240
Yes, I admit that.

637
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,702
Witness. Let me ask you one more time.
Do you still believe

638
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,164
that the defendant is the culprit?

639
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,123
No.

640
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,506
Do you admit that the investigation
was carried out poorly and coercively?

641
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,840
Yes, I do.

642
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:46,845
The defendant was declared guilty
because the evidence was loud and clear.

643
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,098
What do you think about the evidence?

644
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,518
I found a weapon near the murder site

645
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,271
that was presumed to have been used

646
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,398
to kill Detective Jang.

647
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,485
And that weapon was covered
with the defendant's DNA, right?

648
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,737
Yes, that's right.

649
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,575
But before we sent it to the KCSI,
there was an accident.

650
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,826
What accident?

651
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,080
The weapon went missing

652
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,374
for about an hour.

653
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,587
Does that mean someone could've
fabricated the evidence?

654
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,049
-Yes.
-Why didn't you report that back then?

655
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,889
I was worried
that might get the culprit acquitted.

656
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,309
So I just kept quiet.

657
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,688
Who lost that weapon?

658
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,399
It was me.

659
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,616
That is all.

660
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,869
Prosecutor,
you may begin asking questions.

661
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,251
The defendant was sentenced to death
during his last trial.

662
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,003
If you truly felt responsible

663
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,506
for getting him sent to jail,

664
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,133
shouldn't you have

665
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,844
come clean about this back then?

666
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,137
So why now?

667
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,890
Back then, I didn't think I was wrong.

668
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,267
But

669
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,645
I do now.

670
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:23,650
Witness. You're admitting to
your negligence of duty right now.

671
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,653
No one would have found out
if you kept quiet.

672
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,991
So why are you
risking your reputation and career

673
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,367
to tell people this?

674
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,786
I will only end up
ruining my reputation and career.

675
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,707
But to him,

676
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,418
this is a matter of life and death.

677
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,799
You are very weak-hearted.

678
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,616
Witness. Five years ago,

679
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,660
were you and Kang Do-chang
working in the same team

680
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,287
and investigating
Lee Dae-cheol's case together?

681
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,915
Yes, he was my mentor.

682
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:24,294
I guess that means
he was kind of like a teacher to you.

683
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,296
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

684
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,924
How was his personality back then?

685
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,929
He was very warm-hearted
both at work and outside of work.

686
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,808
He was very kind
not only to his colleagues

687
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,976
but also to the suspects that we arrested.

688
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,563
Even if the suspect was
arrested for murder?

689
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,275
"Hate the sin and not the sinner."

690
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,320
That's what he always used to say.

691
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,863
Objection, Your Honor.

692
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,950
This trial is about the defendant,
Lee Dae-cheol.

693
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,160
It has nothing to do with his personality.

694
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,330
Kang Do-chang was in charge
of investigating this case.

695
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,082
So I don't think it's irrelevant.

696
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,209
Prosecutor, you may continue.

697
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,378
Kang Do-chang stated

698
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,839
that the police had lost the weapon
during the investigation.

699
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,674
Is that true?

700
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,925
Yes.

701
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,094
It's true that we lost the weapon.

702
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,222
Was Kang Do-chang responsible

703
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,307
for losing that weapon?

704
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,231
No, I was the one who lost it.

705
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:34,364
Then why do you think Kang Do-chang lied?

706
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,908
He probably wanted to conceal my fault.

707
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:41,872
Back when I lost the weapon,
he talked to everyone who knew about it

708
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,625
and asked them to keep quiet
about my mistake.

709
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,462
He claims the evidence
could have been fabricated

710
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,297
when the weapon went missing.

711
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,049
-Do you agree with that?
-No.

712
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:57,262
I just left it in my trunk
and forgot about it.

713
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:01,308
It was in my car trunk,
so no one could have stolen it.

714
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,230
Yoon Sang-mi.

715
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,693
Lee Dae-cheol's daughter, Lee Eun-hye,
recently went missing.

716
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,906
And it turned out to be a scenario
fabricated by Lee Eun-hye and Park Gun-ho.

717
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:20,452
That's when our witness met
Lee Dae-cheol's daughter.

718
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,206
She had no home,
and she was living in severe poverty.

719
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:29,294
Kang Do-chang, who's extremely kind enough
to take responsibility

720
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,506
for even the mistakes
made by his own colleagues,

721
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,801
probably felt sorry and blamed himself

722
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:40,096
after he saw Lee Eun-hye
living such a horrible life.

723
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,810
Lee Dae-cheol's daughter, Lee Eun-hye,
probably told him her dad is innocent.

724
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,353
And I bet he got swayed

725
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,982
because he's an emotional detective
rather than a rational one.

726
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,109
That is all.

727
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,487
Yoon Sang-mi.

728
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,407
That weapon was found by Chief Moon.

729
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,827
Why are you lying?

730
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,539
You're mistaken.

731
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:11,294
Hey, you two. This is not a place
where you can have a private conversation.

732
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,340
We'll decide whether or not
your testimony is false.

733
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,767
Think about it carefully.

734
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,520
You won't get executed
with accidental murder.

735
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,857
But sometimes,
both sides can win the case.

736
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:40,448
Your Honor, can I get a chance
to make a statement?

737
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,617
Go ahead.

738
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,051
I didn't kill Yoon Ji-seon.

739
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,804
But I did kill

740
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,473
Detective Jang.

741
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,190
He kept trying to frame me,
so I got angry.

742
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,610
It was accidental.

743
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,612
How would I dare try to killâ€¦

744
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,574
How would I dare
plan his murder beforehand?

745
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,829
-Your Honor.
-Yes, go ahead.

746
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,880
-Defendant.
-Yes?

747
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:40,425
Didn't you say that to me five years ago?

748
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,179
"Just say I only killed Detective Jang.

749
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,601
Then I'll admit that I'm guilty in court."

750
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,562
-Prosecutor.
-I told you back then

751
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,272
that you can't get away with it like that.

752
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,693
I told you that it's an act
of insulting the court of law.

753
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,279
I thought I made myself clear back then!

754
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,408
Whatâ€¦ What?

755
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,157
What was the final verdict?

756
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,372
It was all planned to turn out like this.

757
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,749
It's no one's fault.

758
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,003
No one is at fault for this.

759
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,051
LEE DAE-CHEOL WILL BE EXECUTED AS PLANNED

760
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,531
Ms. Jin.

761
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,993
You did great.

762
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,717
We could've won the trial.

763
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:50,013
But I got too greedy in the end.

764
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,225
It's all my fault.

765
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,644
You did nothing wrong.

766
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,108
You did nothing wrong, you fool.

767
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,738
You're not at fault for this.

768
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,158
You're innocent.

769
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,494
Detective Kang.

770
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,997
I only wished for one thing.

771
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,249
I just wanted at least one person

772
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,252
to believe that I'm innocent.

773
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,423
That was all I asked for.

774
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,261
But I did better than that.

775
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,850
But I'm not sure if Eun-hyeâ€¦

776
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,103
She also knows.

777
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,232
Then that's good enough.

778
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,692
That's good enough.

779
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,717
Daeâ€¦ Dae-cheol.

780
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,889
Dae-cheol.

781
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,647
I'm sorry.

782
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,403
When Eun-hye gets married,

783
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,906
you're going to walk her
down the aisle, right?

784
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,451
I'm sorry.

785
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,249
I'll go now, Do-chang.

786
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,742
Let's go, Dae-cheol.

787
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,869
Just keep walking.

788
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,247
You can do it. Come on.
Let's walk together.

789
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,964
Get up.

790
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,050
Get up, Dae-cheol.

791
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,469
Be a man and leave with dignity.

792
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,659
Eun-hye.

793
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,252
Keep it with you
instead of selling it this time.

794
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,839
People will look at you differently.

795
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,925
Okay, thank you.

796
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,971
We won't ever have to meet again, right?

797
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,392
Of course.

798
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,118
But let me ask you one thing.

799
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,915
I know who killed Yoon Ji-seon.

800
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,631
But

801
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,551
who killed Detective Jang?

802
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,029
LATE LEE DAE-CHEOL

803
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,080
Let's go now.

804
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:50,665
Just a little longer.

805
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,543
Let me stay a bit longer.

806
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,086
I'll be waiting outside.

807
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,522
LATE YOO JEONG-SEON

808
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,279
A SPECIAL THANKS TO JO JAE-YUN

809
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,631
You'd better stay quiet from now on
if you want to keep your job.

810
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,926
Let me keep working as a detective.
There's something I need to do.

811
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,890
Did we not get any cases today as usual?

812
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,350
Good going.

813
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,353
Do you know Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?
He bothers me a little.

814
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,607
I will make sure I see you
shed tears of blood.

815
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,568
You look very kind.
Do you know Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?

816
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,487
Did you help Oh Jong-tae?

817
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,654
Why would I do that?

818
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,033
Mr. Yoo already knew
about the recording a long time ago.

819
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,660
Why did you do that? Why?

820
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,539
Just admit that I'm right
and you're wrong.

821
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:19,086
