2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,809
Hey. Come here.

4
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,395
Come here!

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,439
Come here.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,151
I said to come here! Why won't you listen?

7
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,154
Why won't you listen to me?

8
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,032
Why?

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,620
Come here.

10
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,039
Stop making me the bad guy!

11
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,749
Come on!

12
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,412
You're here.

13
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,200
Woo Tae-ho.

14
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,953
Help me out.

15
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,342
He's one of them, right?

16
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,222
Which one is it?

17
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,307
Don't you think…

18
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,060
it would be better
to turn a blind eye to this one?

19
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,687
So he's in this picture.

20
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,897
I don't know.

21
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,274
It's been a while so I don't remember.

22
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,236
You said you saw him last weekend
with the Gangnam East Gang.

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,155
It's only been a few days.

24
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,824
I just ran into him in the hallway
for a second.

25
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,451
I really don't remember.

26
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,703
Take a good look again.

27
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,171
If you're unsure,
there's no need to answer.

28
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,598
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,975
I really can't recall anything.

30
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,102
I'll get going then.

31
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,979
Okay, go ahead.

32
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,126
CAPTAIN CHOI YONG-GEUN

33
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,300
Yes, Captain?

34
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,345
Go to the hospital
and check on the victim.

35
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,472
Then hand the case over
to the Criminal Investigation Division.

36
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:28,768
Make sure the local detectives
don't get involved. Got it?

37
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,020
You just worry about that.

38
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,398
I'll take care of everything else
when I get there.

39
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,315
I'm hanging up.

40
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,547
A bit higher.

41
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,090
Hold the lesion.

42
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,008
She's bleeding a lot.

43
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,509
Let's stop the bleeding first.

44
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,304
Okay, hold it right there.

45
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,764
-Suction.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,269
Raise this.

47
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,814
-Hold this upper part.
-Yes, sir.

48
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,399
-Go higher.
-Okay.

49
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,738
What was the situation like
when you arrived?

50
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,074
I'm not sure.
The patient was in a critical state,

51
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,659
so I had no time to look around.

52
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,829
CAPTAIN CHOI YONG-GEUN

53
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,207
All right. I'll reach out to you
if I need additional information.

54
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,584
Sure.

55
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,003
-Yes, sir?
-How's the victim doing?

56
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,337
Her organs are ruptured.

57
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,089
I suspect she was severely beaten.

58
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,883
I'm asking if she's alive!

59
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,262
Yes, barely.

60
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,056
Okay, that's good.

61
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,059
Did you take care of the local detectives?

62
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:51,976
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,023
Stand by until I arrive.
Don't do anything.

64
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,192
I don't want you to interfere
and screw things up.

65
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,570
This isn't a simple assault case.

66
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,696
It's attempted murder.

67
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,200
Did you not hear me?
I told you not to interfere, you bastard.

68
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm hanging up.

69
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,205
Excuse me, let us through.

70
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,277
Can you show me the CCTV footage?

71
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,780
Our customers' privacy
is very important to us.

72
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,032
We have no CCTVs installed.

73
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:54,330
-Who cleaned up the scene?
-I would assume the cleaning company did.

74
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,624
Did you know
you can be charged with destruction

75
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,293
and tampering with evidence
for touching the crime scene?

76
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,878
I did not participate in it.

77
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,757
The assault also happened
while I was away.

78
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,218
Excuse me.

79
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,638
Yes, sir?

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,517
A total of three people,
including the Vice-chairman?

81
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,354
WOO TAE-HO

82
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,357
I went into the bathroom
and then I heard someone groaning.

83
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,862
I thought it was strange to hear
a woman's voice inside the men's bathroom.

84
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,655
I opened the door to check

85
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,116
and found a woman collapsed
next to the toilet.

86
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,785
It was an emergency, so I called 911.

87
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,203
What state was the victim in?

88
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,122
I think she was assaulted.

89
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,376
Can you be more detailed?

90
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,547
Her face was badly bruised.

91
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,340
I think her nose was bleeding too.

92
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,638
Her organs were ruptured
and her genitals were severely mutilated.

93
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,600
She was hemorrhaging
by the time she got to the hospital.

94
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,146
People don't get a hemorrhage
from a nosebleed.

95
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,647
I'm…

96
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,194
only telling you what I saw at the time.

97
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,574
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

98
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,494
Didn't I tell you to stand by
at the hospital until I arrived?

99
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,287
And why didn't you pick up my calls?

100
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,956
I was just doing my job of questioning.

101
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,460
I was busy getting his statement,
so I couldn't pick up your call.

102
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,380
Are you the one who reported it?

103
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,007
Yes.

104
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,511
You can leave. I'll take over from here.

105
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,471
Hurry up and leave.

106
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,737
The victim is alive
thanks to you reporting it quickly.

107
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,114
-Thank you.
-Captain.

108
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,618
-Yes?
-That detective.

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,706
He's a pain in the ass, isn't he?

110
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,051
Hello.

111
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,637
I'm a little busy right now.

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,389
It won't take long.

113
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,141
I'm here to confirm some stuff
missing from your statement.

114
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,646
Why were you at that club
at the time of the incident?

115
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,982
Isn't it obvious why I was there?

116
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,150
Is there someone to confirm your alibi?

117
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,902
I can't tell you that.

118
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,112
He was at the club with me.

119
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,574
We were drinking together
when that happened.

120
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,993
Would that be enough?

121
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,625
TJ GROUP'S ELDEST, CHEON NA-NA,
MARRIES FORMER DISTRICT ATTORNEY

122
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,127
WEDDING FILLED WITH VIP OFFICIALS

123
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,281
I understand you're disgusted,
but let's let it slide just once.

124
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,409
It's a family matter.

125
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,536
Family?

126
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,664
Does that even mean anything?

127
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,115
Hey!

128
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,701
You filthy bitch.

129
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,952
Die!

130
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,080
You dirty whore.

131
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,832
You filthy piece of shit!

132
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,168
You don't deserve to live!

133
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,341
Are you okay?

134
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,056
I'm Detective Oh Ji-hyeok,
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

135
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,642
If it's difficult to talk,

136
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,187
just nod yes or no to my questions.

137
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,651
Did you happen to see the culprit's face?

138
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,119
You don't remember anything?

139
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,086
Who owns the car?

140
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,423
It's Park Seong-ok.
He works at TJ's legal team.

141
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,051
Okay, thank you.

142
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,473
Hurry up and come in.

143
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,058
Did he confess to everything?

144
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,477
-Yes, he did.
-Pass him on then.

145
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,647
-Come on. Quickly.
-That's not true!

146
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,232
Hurry up.

147
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,281
That guy…

148
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,992
is my informant.

149
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,828
Exactly. That means you two are close.

150
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,127
Hey, I need you to get tested.

151
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,505
OH JI-HYEOK

152
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,133
OH JI-HYEOK

153
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,051
I hope you understand.

154
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,636
I had no other choice.

155
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,347
He confessed that he gave you drugs.

156
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,060
I plan on taking this
to the National Forensic Service myself.

157
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,272
Just to make sure
no funny business happens to it.

158
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,317
Hey.

159
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,322
Why were you prescribed
so many medications?

160
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,283
I saw a lot of psychotropic drugs.

161
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,785
Why did you do that?

162
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,414
You can't get yourself together
with the weak stuff anymore?

163
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,921
You came well prepared.

164
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,593
Stop wasting time
and show me what's up your sleeve.

165
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,720
I'll decide
what my next move will be then.

166
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,308
A truce.

167
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,397
LEAVE OF ABSENCE FORM

168
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,071
Let my innocent informant go too.

169
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,917
APPLICANT: OH JI-HYEOK

170
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,131
I guess I have to let him go.

171
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,928
Since I have no evidence of him
giving you any drugs.

172
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,892
The statute of limitations
for special assault is seven years.

173
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm sure you're aware of that.

174
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,650
Here. A present.

175
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,363
Where's Ms. Kim?

176
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,199
She was transferred
to a different hospital about an hour ago.

177
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
Can you tell me which one?

178
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,037
It's not in Korea.
It's a hospital in the US.

179
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,259
LOS ANGELES

180
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,524
The White Gown Serial Murder Case
that terrified the citizens

181
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,569
is still at a complete loss.

182
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,446
The police have lost credibility

183
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,740
due to their passive ways
in the initial investigation.

184
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,825
The people are growing more anxious

185
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,661
out of fear that another murder
may take place.

186
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,999
The Seoul Criminal Investigation Division

187
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,418
must be taking some serious heat.

188
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,630
The headquarters requested support
from our team.

189
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,341
Shall we volunteer to go help them out?

190
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,885
Why should we?
It's not even in our jurisdiction.

191
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,012
It's a big case. You need to get promoted.

192
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,556
If we fail to catch him,
our asses will be on fire.

193
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,266
We won't fail. You have me.

194
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,768
Then volunteer alone.

195
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,727
As for me,

196
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,648
I plan on living a simple life in Incheon,
catching ginseng thieves.

197
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,277
The investigation is focusing
on the culprit's perverted nature.

198
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,948
They took the wrong turn by obsessing
over the traces the culprit left behind.

199
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,367
Don't get yourself involved.

200
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,369
This is not our case. Got it?

201
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,914
The culprit is your textbook
hedonistic serial killer,

202
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,041
whose goal is murder, not rape.

203
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,086
It's likely he's the ostentatious type,

204
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,879
seeing how he sticks to his MO.

205
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,422
Hey, Oh Ji-hyeok.

206
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,842
Your insomnia rubbed off on me
so I can't sleep these days.

207
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,220
If my life goes down the drain
chasing after this case,

208
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,180
are you going to take responsibility?

209
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,683
The culprit will continue to kill.

210
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,977
Leading to more innocent victims.

211
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,895
-Shouldn't we prevent that?
-Ji-hyeok.

212
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,689
I don't expect anything from you.

213
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,275
Just please let me live to
my expected lifespan.

214
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,318
Do-chang!

215
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,279
That lunatic. Be quiet!

216
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,742
-Anyone suspicious?
-No, not at all.

217
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,537
Well done. We'll take over.
Go and get some rest.

218
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,080
-Thanks.
-Where's Man-gu?

219
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,624
He had a stomachache,
so he went to go poop.

220
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,043
Why the hell does he poop
whenever we're at a scene?

221
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,503
Is he marking his territory?

222
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,428
Gosh, stop it.

223
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,811
Damn it. Seriously?

224
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,363
It's so dark. How will we catch him?

225
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,199
This has the best view
of the entire ginseng field.

226
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,118
-I can't see anything though.
-I can.

227
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,413
Can you even see with those binoculars?

228
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,916
These are infrared binoculars.
It has great night vision.

229
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,878
-Where did you get those?
-I bought them of course.

230
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,380
I guess you can't catch bad guys now
if you're poor.

231
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,381
So full of himself.

232
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,968
Do-chang.

233
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,846
Someone came down.

234
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,347
Over there by the cairn.

235
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,145
I think that's our guy.

236
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,980
-Should we get him?
-Wait, hold on.

237
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,108
We need to catch him red-handed.

238
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,446
Let's go down. Come on.

239
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,868
Help!

240
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,207
What's he doing? Why is he running?

241
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,375
-Damn it!
-Hey.

242
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,795
Run! Hurry!

243
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,379
Damn it!

244
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,360
It's coming!

245
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,490
Who are you?

246
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,080
Damn it!

247
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,129
Damn it.

248
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
Damn it.

249
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,524
Help me.

250
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,903
Hold on.

251
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,116
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

252
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,367
Who am I?

253
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,537
Oh Ji-hyeok, Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.

254
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,583
That really hurts. Wait a second.

255
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,793
Why are you doing this?

256
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,920
Please.

257
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,596
UNLIKELY THAT THE SUSPECT
IS THE VICTIM'S ACQUAINTANCE

258
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,222
1ST VICTIM: KANG SO-JEONG

259
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,974
2ND VICTIM: JUNG HYE-JIN

260
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,684
KANG SO-JEONG
FOUND AT SEOJIN-GU CONSTRUCTION SITE

261
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,603
WHITE GOWN SERIAL MURDER CASE

262
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,897
1ST VICTIM: KANG SO-JEONG

263
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,315
AUTOPSY RESULTS

264
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,941
1ST, 2ND, 3RD

265
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,319
Next news.

266
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,572
The Blue House bulletin board
is blowing up from criticism

267
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,782
regarding the investigation
of the serial murders.

268
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,327
The Prime Minister
promised a speedy arrest

269
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,831
of the White Gown Serial Killer
through a statement this afternoon.

270
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,958
However, it's been reported

271
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,045
the police haven't made much headway
with the investigation.

272
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,172
We have Reporter Park Seo-ha.

273
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,968
Hey! Wake up!

274
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,721
Get up!

275
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,182
Why does it smell rotten in here?

276
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,808
This isn't a pigpen.

277
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,644
-Sang-won.
-Yes?

278
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,729
Wash up.

279
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,774
-Hello?
-I just bought these toe socks.

280
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,400
I gave one two days ago.

281
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,236
I'm not doing another press conference!

282
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,695
Forget it.

283
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,447
I can't do it.

284
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,783
I won't!

285
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,457
Are we going to sit around
on our butts all day?

286
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,251
It's been three months.

287
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,254
Do I still have to
spoon-feed you my orders?

288
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,297
No, sir. Let's go.

289
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,590
Get going!

290
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,633
Hurry up.

291
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,683
Gosh.

292
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,519
Did you see me stealing it?

293
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,230
Or do you have evidence that I did?

294
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,525
Then why did you run?

295
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,613
How many times did I tell you?
It was because of the boar.

296
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,867
You were all running away
from the boar too.

297
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,203
-Did you run a background check?
-Yes, he's clean.

298
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,622
You didn't find any ginseng
in his bag or pockets?

299
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,332
No, sir.

300
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,376
Why couldn't you pop out a little later?

301
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,211
Three days of work went to waste.

302
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,129
Ji-ung.

303
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,757
A gigantic boar
was staring me down like this.

304
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,302
You can't blame me
for not prioritizing the case.

305
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,346
Man-gu. You better wear diapers
the next time we stake out.

306
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,934
-You little…
-How dare you laugh, you punk?

307
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,644
Why were you there at that hour?

308
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,397
You don't even live around the area.

309
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,358
I got lost
while gathering medicinal herbs.

310
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,111
My uncle owns that ginseng field
you stole from.

311
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,865
-Pardon?
-You stole from a cop's family member.

312
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,327
You have three days
to return the ginseng you stole.

313
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,203
If you sold it, buy it and return it.

314
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,873
-I'll give you three days. Get going.
-Pardon?

315
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,541
I said go, you little punk.

316
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,591
What's bothering you most these days?

317
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,259
My sleep.

318
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,306
I'm always getting chased
by a murderer in my dreams.

319
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,266
Besides when you sleep,

320
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,644
does that thought ever get in the way
while you're on duty?

321
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,731
I hesitate every time I make an arrest.

322
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,568
I question myself,
"What if he's not the real culprit?"

323
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,199
What do you think

324
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,409
about switching to desk duty?

325
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,494
The thing is,

326
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,829
for over 20 years now,

327
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,999
I've been in Violent Crimes.

328
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,464
I can make the switch.

329
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,767
Why are you here?

330
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,519
Aren't you off today?

331
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,312
I just wanted to.

332
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,106
I couldn't sleep either.

333
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,440
Do we have a new case?

334
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,317
None.

335
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,027
Go home and rest if you're tired.

336
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,362
I'll stay tonight.

337
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,573
Do you enjoy catching culprits?

338
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,783
Why do you ask?

339
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,911
Is it no longer enjoyable for you?

340
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,705
Let's say I'm not a culprit,

341
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,210
but someone still cuffed me.

342
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,755
How would I feel then?

343
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:59,729
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

344
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,514
-Detective Kang. What brings you here?
-Hey.

345
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,268
No special reason.

346
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,644
How's work? Not too bad?

347
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,771
It's comfortable.
The job is always the same.

348
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,356
I see.

349
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,192
INVESTIGATION COMPLAINTS
CONSULTING CENTER

350
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,737
This place is nice. It's peaceful.

351
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,380
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION

352
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,216
How's the examination coming along?

353
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,092
WHITE GOWN SERIAL MURDER CASE

354
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,137
The results are in for the lipstick
and gown components.

355
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,556
They were all from different companies.

356
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,142
-Also--
-What's your point then?

357
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,770
It sounds like you got nothing.

358
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,022
What have you all been doing?

359
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,066
What did you guys find out?

360
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,944
Besides telling me the culprit
is meticulous and smart,

361
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,654
what else is there?

362
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,322
This case has no motives.

363
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,407
-It will naturally take longer.
-Enough.

364
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,493
We have no time to waste here.

365
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:40,247
I want a special investigation team
set up in every jurisdiction.

366
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,706
Work together from now on.

367
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,336
Damn it.

368
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,423
Sir. Expanding the team
will only cause more confusion.

369
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,175
It's better to unify the command.

370
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,385
What if the killer strikes?

371
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,928
That'll take some time.

372
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,473
On what grounds?

373
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:02,102
The culprit is meticulous. He accounts
our investigation before striking.

374
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,312
He's all over the news right now.

375
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,815
I'm sure the risk of being caught
is pressuring him.

376
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,317
He will stop for the time being.

377
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,318
Are you certain?

378
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,905
I've been chasing him
for three months without a wink of sleep.

379
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,615
That's easy to read now.

380
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,034
This case is big now.

381
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,370
Meaning the responsibility is bigger too.

382
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,331
If we can't do it, no one can.

383
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,126
My goodness.

384
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,337
Are you being greedy or confident?

385
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,505
Both.

386
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,257
Gosh.

387
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,634
I'm going to trust you one more time.

388
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,430
But I'll give you only one week. Got it?

389
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,440
Hey, don't mind him. I'm right.

390
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,359
Just do as I say then we'll catch him.
Understand?

391
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,736
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

392
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,325
Hello?

393
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,869
What?

394
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,594
This bastard is crazy.

395
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,763
You must keep on your toes now.

396
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,724
Don't let any nonsense
from outside sway you.

397
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,726
Only we can catch him, got it?

398
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,935
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

399
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,646
Request for a rapid exam
on any evidence you find.

400
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,025
Don't even think of leaving the scene
until you find something.

401
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,443
-Yes, sir.
-Get moving.

402
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,743
I'm authorized. A detective.
I'll show you my badge later.

403
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,371
Hello there.

404
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,499
I'm from Incheon Seobu Station
Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.

405
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,502
-I'm Woo Bong-sik.
-So what?

406
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,504
This is under our jurisdiction.

407
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,589
The report was made to us first.

408
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,051
You didn't round up your men
because of that, did you?

409
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,095
Of course not. I had them stand by.

410
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,596
We have enough men in this case.

411
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,767
Wait at your station
until we request cooperation.

412
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,560
You'll only cause confusion.

413
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,312
Hey, Rookie!

414
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,440
You better get the scene under control.

415
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,528
We already have
useless gnats flying around!

416
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,822
Make sure you control the scene better.

417
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,124
How is it? Did you check the body?

418
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,252
I think it's only been a couple of days
since she was murdered.

419
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,671
-When did you catch the thief?
-Three days ago.

420
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,633
So Kim Hyeong-bok
might be the serial killer.

421
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,427
Did you tell the investigation division

422
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,138
we caught a thief here three days ago?

423
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,932
Ji-hyeok. You caught that thief, right?

424
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,016
How was he?

425
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,935
If he had killed someone,

426
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,730
he would've tried to run away
with all his might.

427
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,857
-I'm not sure.
-Did you tell them

428
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,109
-or not?
-They wouldn't give me a chance!

429
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,611
I was treated like a solicitor.
They won't listen.

430
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,613
What if he turns out
to be a serial killer?

431
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,865
What will you do then?

432
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,324
Don't put it on me!

433
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,827
It's your fault for letting him go.

434
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,620
If we still had him,

435
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,206
we would've been the team
that caught the serial killer.

436
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,418
You still can't
get a hold of Kim Hyeong-bok?

437
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,336
No, I can't.

438
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,672
His number doesn't exist.
He must've changed it.

439
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,719
Damn it. We might take the fall
for everything.

440
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,471
Let's head back for now.

441
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,473
This is not for us to decide.

442
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,599
Okay.

443
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,769
Gosh.

444
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,239
Did you find anything?

445
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,868
I think there was a fight here.

446
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,037
There are traces of someone
rolling down there

447
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,413
and we also found this.

448
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,670
Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.

449
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,298
Why are you acting up again?

450
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,008
You stayed quiet for a while.

451
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,386
Why are you idiots
trying to make my life harder?

452
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,055
Three years ago,

453
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,724
a bunch of police chiefs got fired

454
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,518
for letting a serial killer escape.

455
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,020
You know that, right?

456
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:18,149
But isn't that a little different, sir?

457
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,819
We didn't exactly make a mistake.

458
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,154
Things just got messed up…

459
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,615
This is not a mistake?

460
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,284
If he turns out to be the culprit,

461
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,037
how will you explain yourselves?

462
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,291
Will you tell them your poop attracted
a boar, and it chased after you?

463
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,171
You have no other choice.
Rearrest Kim Hyeong-bok.

464
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,383
Use whatever means you have to.

465
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,386
If the investigation division
happens to catch on

466
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,222
and arrests him first…

467
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,932
Hey, Sim Dong-uk.

468
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,935
-You're the youngest, right?
-Yes, sir.

469
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,895
How long have you been a cop?

470
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,398
-It's been three years, sir.
-Won't you feel wronged?

471
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,651
About the fact that
you'll get fired with me,

472
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,069
a 25-year veteran.

473
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,494
Damn it.

474
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
Gosh, this is filthy.

475
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,806
Do-chang. Look at this.

476
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,477
CHINATOWN
TRADITIONAL CHINESE FOOD

477
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:44,611
Goodness, just what kind
of crime did my son commit?

478
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,447
Is it a serious crime?

479
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,074
Please let us know if you know his number.

480
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,703
If we can talk to him
it may turn out to be nothing.

481
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,580
Hiding him will only make things worse.

482
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,457
I don't know. I mean it.

483
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,210
I would have told you if I knew.

484
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,670
What should I do about this?

485
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,172
It wasn't a pocket knife.

486
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,592
The weapon used
was thin enough to be a razor.

487
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,719
NFS thinks it was
a sashimi knife or cutter.

488
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,429
Let's take it just in case.

489
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,058
Did Hyeong-bok

490
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,226
kill someone?

491
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,187
Let me explain…

492
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,731
No, it can't be.

493
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,277
Hyeong-bok would never do such a thing.

494
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:31,157
He can't even properly kill a bug.

495
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,579
Look, I know that Hyeong-bok
does a lot of bad stuff.

496
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:41,709
But he's not the type
that would murder someone.

497
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,295
Gosh, hold on.

498
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:50,093
My son attended church until ninth grade.

499
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,011
Goodness.

500
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,184
Here it is.

501
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,728
There's a photo in here somewhere.

502
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,648
Here, take a look.

503
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,651
Here it is.

504
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,446
You see the picture of him
at church, right?

505
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,617
He even prayed before eating.

506
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,286
So how could he be capable of that?

507
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,414
That would be a grave sin.

508
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,040
Yes, you're right.

509
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,502
Can we take this and have a look?

510
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,761
Take a good look at the album.

511
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,015
If anyone appears more than twice,
find the person and contact them.

512
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,810
Search his computer thoroughly
and print out anything that seems fishy.

513
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,103
Okay.

514
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,647
But I don't think we should
get our hopes up.

515
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,442
-Why not?
-He didn't even secure it.

516
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,528
He'd be more careful
if he had something to hide.

517
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,989
Don't make conclusions.
Let's do everything we can.

518
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,867
You two, don't go to the station
and ask around.

519
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,703
He was born and raised here
so most people will know him.

520
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,787
-Okay.
-Okay.

521
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,124
Dong-uk, you stay here
in case he comes back.

522
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,208
Yes, sir.

523
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,089
Excuse me. Take this.

524
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,092
What is this?

525
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,596
You are all working so hard.

526
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,723
I didn't want you to starve.

527
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,645
I got this from the oldest
and most famous restaurant here.

528
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,107
Okay, ma'am. We'll take it then.

529
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,903
Please contact us
if Hyeong-bok reaches out to you.

530
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,780
Yes, of course.

531
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,159
Detective.

532
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,120
Do you…

533
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,374
really think that Hyeong-bok

534
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,045
killed someone?

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,923
No.

536
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,674
He probably didn't.

537
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,385
Right? I thought so.

538
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,806
You think so too, don't you?

539
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,897
In your opinion,
how likely is it that Kim Hyeong-bok

540
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,274
is a serial killer?

541
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,151
It's a possibility.

542
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,905
I'm sure there's a reason why
he changed his number

543
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,282
and suddenly disappeared.

544
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,618
I have a bad feeling.

545
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,870
I think it's going to be a twisted one.

546
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,832
Like this twisted donut.

547
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,459
Is it good?

548
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,669
TWO-WHEELED VEHICLE
REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE

549
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,088
KIM HYEONG-BOK

550
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,633
Yes, Hyeong-bok bought this
from our store recently.

551
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,052
I see. You know him?

552
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,554
Yes, we grew up together here.

553
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,390
Did he explain why
he was buying the motorcycle?

554
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,935
Besides for deliveries, I'm not sure.

555
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,106
There are some guys
who buy second-hand motorcycles

556
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,067
to deliberately crash them
and extort money from the driver.

557
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:53,985
Insurance fraud.

558
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,487
But he hasn't come in for any repairs yet.

559
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,364
So I can't tell you for sure.

560
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,574
All right.

561
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,659
If you run into him by any chance…

562
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,537
-Please give me a call.
-Sure.

563
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,456
-Have a good one then.
-You too.

564
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,546
I called the district office
for CCTV footage

565
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,256
but the investigation division took them.

566
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,925
They must have the original.
Can't they make a copy?

567
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,927
They sealed everything in case it leaks.

568
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,471
So we can't enter the scene
or look at the footage

569
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,140
when it's under our jurisdiction?

570
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,725
What the hell is wrong with them?

571
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,604
Are they prioritizing their numbers
over actually catching the culprit?

572
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,690
What are you yelling at me for?
I'm not one of them.

573
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,735
Hey, you punk.
Don't talk back to me like that.

574
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,361
-When did you call them?
-I didn't even do anything.

575
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,613
Did you just glare at me?

576
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,156
Hey!

577
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,575
How dare you, you punk?

578
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,538
The CCTV by the scene captured it.

579
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,081
The driver is headed toward the scene.

580
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,167
-The license plate?
-We can't make it out.

581
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,836
Hey.

582
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,964
Don't say you can't
just because you can't see it.

583
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,259
If human eyes won't do
then use a computer, got it?

584
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,719
Yes, sir.

585
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,097
Bring me all the clothes
that are similar to his.

586
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,768
Find it and compare it
to the button we found on the scene.

587
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,186
If it's the same one,

588
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,146
this guy is our culprit.

589
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:16,859
This appears to be a case of collusion

590
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,737
between political power
and economic capital.

591
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,533
The court has come to a decision
regarding the sentencing

592
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,621
of defendant Cheon Seong-dae,
who is under indictment

593
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,209
for bribery, embezzlement,
concealment of criminal profits, and more.

594
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,002
Order.

595
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:39,090
I sentence the defendant Cheon Seong-dae
to seven years in prison,

596
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,883
effective as of now.

597
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,563
Next up.

598
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,941
TJ Group's Chairman Cheon Seong-dae

599
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,486
was sentenced to seven years
in prison in court today.

600
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,823
Contrary to predictions
that he won't be given prison time,

601
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,201
it's likely he received a heavy sentence

602
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,079
due to the conclusive evidence
that the prosecution submitted.

603
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,789
Reporter Park Seo-ha is live now.

604
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,878
You're screwed, Tae-ho.

605
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,259
Tae-ho.

606
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,511
Yes, sir.

607
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,681
Explain to me the reason
why I have to be here.

608
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,892
It seems
confidential information was leaked.

609
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,313
It's my fault for not managing it better.

610
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,108
I'll find who leaked it
and make sure this never happens.

611
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,612
Can I trust…

612
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,906
what your husband is saying?

613
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,285
He's your family.

614
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,911
You have to trust him.

615
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,291
Please wait until the second trial.

616
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,463
We suspect the evidence was collected
illegally by the prosecution.

617
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,507
We'll prove it and get you acquitted.

618
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,762
If I end up staying here,

619
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,973
who do you think will rejoice the most?

620
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,933
Tell me, Na-na.

621
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,605
Why?

622
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,231
Are there too many?

623
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,235
Or do you have someone in mind,

624
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,321
but it's a tough one to answer?

625
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,823
Dad.

626
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,827
I'm your employee.

627
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,205
But I'll refuse that title right now.

628
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,956
For now…

629
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,211
I just want to be your daughter.

630
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,216
I'm not in the right mindset
to pick out your enemies.

631
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,761
My mind is blank.

632
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,641
It's just hard.

633
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,813
This situation is hard to handle.

634
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,898
I'm struggling.

635
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,123
That means he used his motorcycle

636
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,667
to get around on the day of the incident.

637
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,503
VICTIM IS JUNG HUI-JU,
AN EMPLOYEE OF TJ GROUP'S LEGAL TEAM

638
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,131
The victim has been identified
as Jung Hui-ju.

639
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,298
What does she do?

640
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,802
WOO TAE-HO

641
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,978
She was an employee
of TJ Group's legal team.

642
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:44,692
SEOUL TAEJOO MEDICAL CENTER

643
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,995
Will you be okay?

644
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,497
Why don't you just call Dr. Kim
and rest at home?

645
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,876
No, it's more comfortable here.
I'll take some rest and go home.

646
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,463
Can you go alone? Shall I go with you?

647
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,590
It's fine. Go on then.

648
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,905
Hey, did you look into what I asked?

649
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,823
Yes, I have an idea.

650
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,866
Who was it?

651
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,994
The prosecution didn't find
the evidence on their own.

652
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,914
I think a whole pile
was handed over from the Blue House.

653
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,542
So someone reported it to the Blue House.

654
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,294
Can you find out who?

655
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,714
I told you everything I know
within my capacity.

656
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,591
All right, thanks.

657
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,974
JUNG HUI-JU

658
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:04,188
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

659
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,028
Hi, Mr. Choi.

660
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,197
Did Ms. Jung come in today?

661
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,450
I'm trying to reach her,
but her phone is off.

662
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,621
It's an urgent matter.

663
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,956
Do you know where she is?

664
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,626
She was murdered.

665
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,965
I didn't know until I read
the police announcements today.

666
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,510
She was murdered?

667
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,011
Yes.

668
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,516
According to the police,
it was a serial killer.

669
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,853
Mr. Woo?

670
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,022
Yes.

671
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,692
I understand.

672
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,278
Well…

673
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,448
Contact the police,

674
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,285
and make sure they don't leak
that she's our employee.

675
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,871
The press may try
to connect this to the Chairman's case.

676
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,374
Try to keep it under wraps.

677
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,127
Don't worry, I already gave directions.

678
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,628
Okay, good work.

679
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,055
Congratulations.

680
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,350
You're still early into your pregnancy,
so be careful.

681
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,605
I'll have to think about it.

682
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,231
What do you mean?

683
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,152
If I should be congratulated or not.

684
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,658
Please try to remember.

685
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,619
This was stuck on his fridge.

686
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,579
Maybe you remember him from delivery?

687
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,081
I'm not sure. I might have seen him.

688
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,627
You should ask
the delivery guy once he gets back.

689
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,962
He won't be long.

690
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,590
-We'll hang around then.
-Okay.

691
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,594
Shall we eat something?

692
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,512
How could you be hungry right now?

693
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,850
Gosh, thank you.

694
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,108
-Is it okay that we do this?
-Do what?

695
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,402
The rule is we tell
the Seoul Criminal Investigation Division

696
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,862
and catch him together.

697
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,155
Yes, that's true.

698
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:22,034
Right, so let's tell Do-chang
and hand it over to them.

699
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,121
What if we do
and they end up catching Kim Hyeong-bok?

700
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,707
They'll take credit for everything.

701
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,751
But if we lose him, we'll take the blame.

702
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,961
Why can't you understand the situation?

703
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,422
I do understand.

704
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,800
I just think we're way in over our heads.

705
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,717
Hey.

706
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,887
If we investigate on our own
without their knowledge

707
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,473
and end up catching Kim Hyeong-bok.

708
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,142
Then he turns out to be the culprit.

709
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,644
What do you think will follow?

710
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,731
We'll be up for special promotions.
Do you still want to hand it over?

711
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,360
Absolutely not!
I won't do them any favors.

712
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,613
You said we should
because that's the rule.

713
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,949
Think about it, Ji-ung.

714
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,994
Those punks didn't even
let us in the crime scene.

715
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,621
They hoarded all the evidence too.

716
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,666
No rules apply to rude jerks like that.

717
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,626
You were the one who brought it up!

718
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,920
-Do you know what your worst trait is?
-What is it?

719
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,089
You obsess over the past.

720
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,341
Forget it. The past is the past.

721
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,551
Welcome.

722
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,595
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

723
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,722
I see. They're detectives too.

724
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,476
This is from the CCTV outside.

725
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,646
He was filmed leaving this restaurant.

726
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,314
Do you remember him?

727
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,691
I'm not sure.

728
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,526
It was three days ago at 6:00 p.m.

729
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,570
He came on his motorcycle for a meal.

730
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,364
We have a lot of customers
during that time.

731
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,244
But why are you all suddenly--

732
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,787
Gosh, working hard I see.

733
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,540
Byun Ji-ung from Incheon Seobu Station
Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.

734
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,417
So what?

735
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,504
Well, what brings you guys

736
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,339
to our jurisdiction?

737
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,883
Are you looking for someone?

738
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,135
Who is it? Let me see.

739
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,847
We're still keeping this within our team.
I apologize.

740
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,307
I see.

741
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,894
Do you think it's because of that case?

742
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,647
Right. The White Gown Serial Murder Case?

743
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,735
-That must be it.
-I guess it is.

744
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,321
So you're here to find the suspect.

745
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,532
The case where the pompous Seoul cops
ditched the local guys.

746
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,409
-So they can run the case solo.
-Seriously?

747
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,079
Do you have any leads on the suspect?

748
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,582
Something came up. Let us know later.

749
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,042
-Wait, show us the photo.
-Hey.

750
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,127
-Let us have a look.
-Come on, show us.

751
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,337
Sorry for interrupting.

752
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,630
Don't be, just give it.

753
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,131
-Let's see if we know him.
-Exactly.

754
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,758
-Let's go.
-We're trying to help.

755
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,887
We can help you!

756
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,182
You identified him?

757
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,684
Kim Hyeong-bok. What's his address?

758
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,479
It's nearby. All right.

759
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,981
We'll head over first.
Meet us there. Let's go.

760
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,776
-My gosh.
-Darn it.

761
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,611
-Get the picture.
-Okay.

762
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,154
Is this the guy they showed you?

763
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,072
Yes, it is.

764
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,952
Hello.

765
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,578
Does this man live here?

766
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,121
-Yes.
-May we go in?

767
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,510
It's getting really complicated.

768
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,016
Can you leave if you're done looking?

769
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,602
If I get caught
letting another unit's detective in,

770
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,187
I'll be done for.

771
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,065
Hey! This is my jurisdiction…

772
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,279
Forget it. I'm done looking, so I'll go.

773
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,243
Do-chang. Over here.

774
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,335
This is where I rolled around
with Kim Hyeong-bok that night.

775
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,297
They probably found traces of him here.

776
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,008
We'll have to catch him
before they can confirm anything.

777
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,093
Do-chang.

778
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,761
If Kim Hyeong-bok

779
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,680
murdered someone over there,

780
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,224
would he have run away this way?

781
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,644
Wouldn't he have tried
to stay away from the murder scene?

782
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,731
If he's not familiar with the area
he might've gotten confused.

783
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,482
It was a dark mountain.

784
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,986
The culprit was careful enough
to not leave any evidence behind.

785
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:30,157
I'm sure he scoped out the area thoroughly
before committing the crime.

786
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,200
He wouldn't make such a mistake.

787
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,663
Yes, Ji-ung.

788
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,875
Do-chang. The investigation division
is looking for Kim Hyeong-bok.

789
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,629
How did they find out about him?

790
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,632
We know he left home
around 4:00 p.m. on his motorcycle,

791
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,843
ate at a Chinese restaurant,
then headed to the crime scene.

792
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:53,096
-Did you get his license plate number?
-Yes, Kim Hyeong-bok owns it.

793
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,806
-Could you reach him?
-No, sir.

794
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,183
I think he has a burner cell.

795
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,268
What about his home? Did you check?

796
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,520
We did, but they took everything.

797
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,065
-Who did?
-Violent Crimes Unit Team Two in Incheon.

798
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,902
How did they find out about him?

799
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,865
The Seoul Criminal Investigation Division
has requested cooperation.

800
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,201
Out of the blue?

801
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,162
Why all of a sudden?

802
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:21,124
Our guys found out
they're also after Kim Hyeong-bok.

803
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,463
Do they also know
we had him and let him go?

804
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,508
It doesn't seem like it.

805
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,886
I think all they know is that
we are after the same guy.

806
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,973
Excuse me, sir.

807
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,894
Hello?

808
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,566
Yes, I'm at the station right now.

809
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,278
If you wait at the office,
I'll be right there.

810
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,076
It's the captain
from the investigation division.

811
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,786
-What should I do?
-Don't ask me.

812
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,456
You boys started it,
so figure it out yourselves.

813
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,169
Yes, right. I'll have to tell the truth.

814
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,212
Leave me out of it.

815
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,466
Tell them you got yourselves
into this mess without reporting it to me.

816
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,010
Wouldn't they find that odd?

817
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,887
It's a big serial murder case.

818
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,390
But would they buy that story?

819
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,809
-That we didn't tell you?
-Make them believe it.

820
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,395
It's the investigation division.

821
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,772
They have the best detectives in Korea.

822
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,482
They won't be easily fooled.

823
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,819
So you want me
burning in the fire right next to you?

824
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,654
No, absolutely not.

825
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,239
-All right then.
-What?

826
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,200
I'll do my best to wrap it up

827
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,746
so that only my team
would get burnt in the fire.

828
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,789
-Let's go, Captain.
-Do-chang.

829
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,837
May you live long and prosperously, Chief.

830
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,507
Gosh, that little punk.

831
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:56,219
My goodness.

832
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,847
What should I do then?

833
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,641
Should we jump into the fire,
and it'll be just us--

834
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,934
Are you screwing with me too?

835
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,478
No, I wouldn't dare.

836
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,857
I'm gravely concerned this may
tarnish your good image,

837
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,443
which you've built up
for such a long time.

838
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,111
You little punks.

839
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,322
You're just like Do-chang!

840
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,701
Go ahead and meet with him first.

841
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,453
I'll try to come up with something.

842
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,580
Understood, sir.

843
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,297
What did he say?

844
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,716
He told us to wait
while he racks his brain.

845
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,759
We're good then.

846
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,720
We're not. The chief can only do so much.

847
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,223
He'll just find a way
to weasel out of it alone.

848
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,433
You know what his nickname was
when he was a chief investigator?

849
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,102
Lightning rod.
He never runs from lightning.

850
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,938
He makes it run from him.

851
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,939
Goodness.

852
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,525
What brings you here so late?

853
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,361
I'd like to apologize for my behavior
at the scene last time.

854
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,739
As you know,
this is a very sensitive case.

855
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:02,577
I wasn't myself due to
the immense pressure I was facing.

856
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,787
I understand.

857
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,791
You probably heard why I'm here.

858
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,209
-Rookie, what are you doing?
-Sir?

859
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,379
We have special guests from Seoul.
Serve them some coffee.

860
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,839
Yes, sir.

861
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,924
What would you like?

862
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,009
Anything.

863
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,136
-"Anything" isn't on our menu.
-So…

864
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,930
We only have instant coffee,

865
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,765
and there's only
one bag of green tea left.

866
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,226
You both can't have green tea.

867
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,270
Give us coffee then.

868
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,565
Hey, try to be more friendly.

869
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,484
You should get on their good side
if you want to succeed.

870
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,237
You never know, maybe you'll be
transferred to their team.

871
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,906
Joining their unit doesn't mean
my career is a success.

872
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,158
Nobody thinks like that but themselves.

873
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,494
We're all the same pigs, right?

874
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:46,663
That punk.

875
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:54,004
While checking the CCTV footage
around the crime scene…

876
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,505
That reminds me.

877
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,715
-Hey, Ji-ung.
-Yes?

878
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,009
Did you ask the district office
for the footage?

879
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,218
No, some sons of…

880
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:07,183
Sorry, some canine-like punks told them
to never share the footage with us.

881
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,562
You should've obtained it regardless.
This is under our jurisdiction.

882
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,397
We need to be of some assistance,

883
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,691
so we don't look completely useless.

884
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,902
How can we help when we have jack squat?

885
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,029
All we know is what we saw on the news.

886
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,280
You should find a way.

887
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,824
Look for witnesses if there's no footage.

888
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,367
If you're banned from the scene,

889
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,537
sneak in and take photos like a burglar.

890
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,665
That's dangerous
with all the boars in the area.

891
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,835
There's no need
to bring up the boars right now.

892
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,921
Why are you guys after Kim Hyeong-bok?

893
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,923
Do you have something on him or what?

894
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:43,261
How about you watch your manners,
special guest?

895
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,805
Even dogs know not to mess
with what's not theirs.

896
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,142
Tell me.

897
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,227
Who is Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?

898
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,604
That would be me.

899
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,190
Why did you run a background check
on Kim Hyeong-bok?

900
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,358
Because I had to.

901
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,360
So what's the exact reason?

902
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,237
You must be hiding something from us.

903
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,489
Okay, I understand.

904
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,991
I get that you're investigating separately
to catch the culprit.

905
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,162
But if you ignore the system,
work separately, and things go south,

906
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,998
would you be able to face the music?

907
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,670
I'll be straightforward.

908
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,089
Hand over Kim Hyeong-bok's file.

909
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,217
Then I'll sweep everything under the rug.

910
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,512
I'll hold no one accountable. I promise--

911
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,638
Attention, everyone.

912
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,307
Hey, Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.

913
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,476
What are you doing?

914
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,521
My uncle called again.

915
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,816
Do-chang.
You said you'll catch him in no time.

916
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,194
-Pardon?
-The ginseng thief, you punk.

917
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:46,116
Right. We're trying.

918
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,034
I thought you were looking for suspects.

919
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,162
Didn't you say Kim Hyeong-bok or something
is the prime suspect?

920
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,376
That's why we searched
his home inside and out,

921
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,753
but we couldn't find any ginseng,
let alone an herb.

922
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,589
You're saying you were barking up
the wrong tree?

923
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,134
We have a few more suspects besides him.

924
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,177
We'll know once we investigate them.

925
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,429
You better catch him.

926
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,932
This uncle sold his ginseng
from that very field

927
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,393
to pay for my university tuition.

928
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:17,647
Please catch him so I can save my face.

929
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,065
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

930
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,863
Who are these people?

931
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,949
Hello. I'm Captain Jang Gi-jin,
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

932
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,077
You must be swamped right now.
What brings you here?

933
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,497
These men are looking
for Kim Hyeong-bok also.

934
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,082
Why?

935
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,834
Is your unit also looking

936
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,420
for my uncle's ginseng thief?

937
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,094
JUNG HUI-JU

938
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,814
WHITE GOWN SERIAL MURDER CASE

939
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,856
Captain.

940
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,900
Check the CCTV footage.

941
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,744
The color and design are identical.

942
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,039
The manufacturers said they're
the only ones that make this design.

943
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,125
Show me the button from the scene.

944
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,386
Put out a nationwide APB
on Kim Hyeong-bok.

945
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,932
That's the one.

946
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,690
It's 7332.

947
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,775
Let's see.

948
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,070
Wait.

949
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,406
The number is different.

950
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,202
Doesn't the plate look way too new
compared to the motorcycle?

951
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,037
What if he switched out the plate?

952
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,331
-I doubt it.
-How are you so sure?

953
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,708
Kim Hyeong--

954
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,420
Are you the owner?

955
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,546
Yes.

956
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,137
Kim Hyeong-bok isn't smart enough
to think of switching plates.

957
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,639
I thought you agreed with me on that.

958
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,809
Don't judge someone
from their first impression.

959
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:04,105
There may be an evil side to him
that we don't know of.

960
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,901
Do you really think he's a serial killer?

961
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,652
I said I don't know! I'm not God.

962
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,071
How am I supposed to know
what's hiding in him?

963
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,374
TTOBONGEE CHICKEN

964
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,005
I'm sorry, we're not open yet.

965
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,508
Make us ramyeon.

966
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,176
We're in a hurry.

967
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,595
-Hello.
-Hi.

968
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,389
You do know this is
a chicken joint, right?

969
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,100
I'll pay you.
I'll match the price for one chicken.

970
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,649
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

971
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,404
Shall I fry you some chicken?

972
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,948
No, we don't have time.

973
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,410
What a shame.

974
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,247
I can't see your handsome face anymore,
Detective Oh.

975
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,041
-Sorry?
-You don't know?

976
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,044
-Do-chang didn't tell you?
-That's enough.

977
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,254
It's not set in stone.

978
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,966
You agreed to switch to desk duty
after your consultation.

979
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,386
You made your decision, so just go okay?

980
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,930
If your insomnia
and daily drinking continue,

981
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,306
you'll croak in no time.

982
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,142
You've suffered enough, okay?

983
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,062
You did your duty
as a violent crime detective in Korea.

984
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,606
-You can quit now.
-It's time for you to open.

985
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,650
Go and fry up a chicken.

986
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,319
Instead of calling Eun-hye for help
and making her suffer.

987
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,323
All you think of is Eun-hye day and night.

988
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,409
Worry about yourself.

989
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,371
Welcome.

990
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,249
Who will take care of you if you fall ill?

991
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,751
You'll make me and Eun-hye's life hell.

992
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,839
What would you like?

993
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,677
-Do-chang.
-Just keep your mouth shut.

994
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,387
I'll take care of myself.

995
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,603
Oh Ji-hyeok, Incheon Seobu Station.

996
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:07,937
Yes.

997
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,397
Is that so?

998
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,983
When was the accident reported?

999
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,862
Are you sure the name is Kim Hyeong-bok?

1000
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,450
Can you tell me which hospital he's in?

1001
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,536
Okay.

1002
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,344
Where was the call from?

1003
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,972
An insurance company.
I gave them the plate number in advance.

1004
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,391
So they'd call me if there's an accident.

1005
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,521
How did you know
he'll get into an accident?

1006
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,065
You heard it too.

1007
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,236
There are some guys
who buy second-hand motorcycles

1008
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,571
to deliberately crash them
and extort money from the driver.

1009
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,739
Insurance fraud.

1010
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,744
From what I remember,
weren't you out taking a call?

1011
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,246
I have two ears.

1012
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,875
You're showing off
using your body parts now?

1013
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,130
Did you see the address I sent?

1014
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,674
Kim Hyeong-bok is there. Hurry.

1015
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,843
Come on, what's your name?
Min-ji. Your name is pretty too.

1016
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,516
-Hyeong-bok, I need a minute.
-Pigs?

1017
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,267
Damn it.

1018
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,228
Move!

1019
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,604
Move!

1020
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,737
Move!

1021
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,784
Don't run away!

1022
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,077
Hey!

1023
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,538
Come here!

1024
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,997
Stop right there!

1025
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,167
You bastard! Where are you going?

1026
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,419
Let's just talk!

1027
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,797
Hey!

1028
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,842
Police put out
a nationwide APB on Kim Hyeong-bok,

1029
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,802
their prime suspect,
for the White Gown Serial Murder Case

1030
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,220
and are tracking him down.

1031
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:07,056
They found conclusive evidence
that he was the culprit

1032
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,725
at the fourth murder scene,

1033
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,311
and he was also caught on camera
around the crime scene.

1034
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,148
Hey!

1035
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,798
Hyeong-bok.

1036
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,676
We just want to talk.

1037
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,720
-Stop chasing me!
-Hyeong-bok!

1038
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,015
Hey! Hyeong-bok!

1039
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,477
Hyeong-bok.

1040
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,729
-Stop.
-Jeez.

1041
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,355
Hyeong-bok.

1042
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:58,983
You punk.

1043
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,201
-So long, you pigs!
-You punk!

1044
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,661
Hey, stop!

1045
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,466
Hyeong-bok.

1046
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,095
We're not after you for insurance fraud.
Don't misunderstand.

1047
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,766
Just listen to me, don't get it twisted.
Hear me out.

1048
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,728
We're not chasing you for insurance fraud!

1049
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,938
Cut the bullshit, pigs!

1050
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:37,897
Hey!

1051
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,702
-Shit.
-Damn it.

1052
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,205
Please don't kill me.

1053
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,874
A girl named Jung Hui-ju died.

1054
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,585
-It's my fault.
-Stop blaming yourself.

1055
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,170
That's equal to a cop
framing an innocent person.

1056
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,256
Burn it so there's absolutely
no trace left.

1057
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,550
What if that company files a lawsuit?

1058
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,051
I'll become a worse villain then.

1059
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,803
We caught the guy
the Seoul Criminal Investigation Division

1060
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,305
couldn't catch for three months.

1061
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,015
How is this your case, you bastard?

1062
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,559
It's the victims'
and their families' case!

1063
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,769
I will go see you soon.

1064
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,855
-It was that sound.
-Stay here no matter what.

1065
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,398
The killer is sending us a message.

1066
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,733
"I'm the real killer."

1067
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:13,034
