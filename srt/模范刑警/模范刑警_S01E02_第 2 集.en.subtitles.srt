1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,336
"Lord, I love the house where you live,

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,506
the place where your glory dwells.

3
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,633
Do not take away my soul
along with sinners,

4
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,344
my life with those who are bloodthirsty."

5
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:58,349
Park Gun-ho targeted Lee Eun-hye,
Lee Dae-cheol's daughter from the start.

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,811
Why do you think he killed Lee Eun-hye?

7
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,648
Probably because of Lee Dae-cheol.

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,067
Exactly.

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,278
Why did he take out his grudge against
Lee Dae-cheol on his innocent daughter?

10
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,490
What an evil jerk.

11
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,408
"Be strong and courageous.

12
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,868
Do not be afraid

13
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,703
or terrified because of them.

14
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,457
For the Lord your God goes with you.

15
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,877
He will never leave you nor forsake you."

16
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,525
Haven't you identified the body yet?

17
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,276
No. But why?

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,320
Is it related to your case?

19
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,082
Can I see the face?

20
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,220
The face is severely damaged
so it's hard to tell who it is.

21
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,764
Do you recognize this person?

22
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,308
No.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,232
I was wrong.

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,067
This case is completely irrelevant.

25
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,070
I saw Lee Eun-hye five years ago,
and she looked completely different.

26
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,573
Maybe she's changed.
It's been over five years.

27
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,492
No, I remember what she looked like.

28
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,785
That's not Lee Eun-hye.

29
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,871
She looked nothing like the girl
in the CCTV footage.

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,291
That person drowned,
so it's hard to judge by her face alone.

31
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,667
I'm sure it's not her.

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,544
It's not when I say it's not her!

33
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,426
Anyway,

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,846
that's not what
Lee Eun-hye was wearing in the footage.

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,475
Exactly. That's it.

36
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,103
That's what I was going to say.

37
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,731
That's not Lee Eun-hye.

38
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,337
Die!

39
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,299
Die!

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,386
A jerk like you deserves to die.

41
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,473
You're no better than an animal.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,641
Die!

43
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,572
Please forgive my sins
and guide me to heaven.

44
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,117
Please forgive my sins
and guide me to heaven.

45
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,913
Please forgive my sins
and guide me to heaven.

46
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,084
Please forgive my sins
and guide me to heaven.

47
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,342
POLICE

48
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,220
You were supposed to be here ages ago.
What took you so long?

49
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,597
I barely managed to bring these guys.

50
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,183
Aren't they conscripted?
Where are the riot police?

51
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,728
The riot police are busy taking care
of the rally in front of City Hall.

52
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,689
Then is this all we have?

53
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,483
The others will come at night
once the rally is over.

54
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,611
They'll probably come tomorrow.

55
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,529
Are you kidding me?

56
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,489
Just go wake them up.

57
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,117
They might lie down on the ground
and fall asleep.

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,743
Hey, you punks!

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,495
We're here for a murder case, you punks!

60
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,038
-My gosh.
-The equipment!

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,374
Go bring the equipment. Hurry up.

62
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,335
-You little punks.
-What is Man-gu doing there?

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,170
He said he wanted to use
the restroom earlier.

64
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,549
So he's taking a dump
where the body might be buried?

65
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,844
Gosh, he really drives me crazy.
Are you taking a dump?

66
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,053
Get a move on.

67
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,930
-I'm taking a dump!
-My gosh.

68
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,143
Go check how many pairs of underwear
I have left in my trunk.

69
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,978
-Why?
-I know I can't shower,

70
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,646
but I should at least change my undies.

71
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,606
Make him change his underwear, too.

72
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,066
He's disgusting.

73
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,570
I can already tell that this is
going to take at least two weeks.

74
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,613
What a headache.

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,242
This is quite an issue.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,038
-What about the body?
-We're looking for it right now.

77
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,874
Can't you take him there
and ask him where he buried her?

78
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,209
Apparently, he wasn't in his right mind
when he killed her

79
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,377
so he can't remember.

80
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,629
Is his confession consistent?

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,840
Well…

82
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,885
Are you saying he keeps
changing his statement?

83
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,969
Yes, kind of.

84
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,682
Withdraw the search team.

85
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,351
-Sorry?
-Judging by the circumstances,

86
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,480
it's most likely
that Park Gun-ho fabricated this.

87
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,565
But they were both caught on CCTV.

88
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,568
We can search for the body

89
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,154
once we're sure
that he is telling the truth.

90
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,405
I guess you're right.

91
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,951
Finding the body a little quicker
won't help with the investigation.

92
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,623
Also, make sure the reporters
don't find out about this.

93
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,125
This is a great case
for them to raise an issue with.

94
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,585
It'll get really complicated.

95
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,921
Okay, sir. I'll make sure no one talks.

96
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,468
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,011
Dig deeper.

98
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,721
-My gosh, come on.
-Check over here.

99
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,139
-Step on the shovel.
-Dig a hole.

100
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,141
-Put your weight on it.
-Like this.

101
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,976
-Dig deeper like this.
-Come on.

102
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,229
Will you please dig deeper?

103
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,774
-My gosh, come on.
-What are you doing there?

104
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,109
Sorry?

105
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,610
Think about it.

106
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,153
If he buried a body there,

107
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,948
there wouldn't be any reeds
growing from there.

108
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,575
Oh, I see. The culprit must've planted
them back on the ground

109
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,453
-after he buried the victim there.
-Oh, right.

110
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,996
-"Oh, right"?
-You have a point.

111
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,331
What? I have a point?

112
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,875
Oh, my gosh.

113
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,628
Yes, Captain.

114
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,047
Of course we haven't found the body yet.

115
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,299
You want us to withdraw?

116
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,766
REPORTER HONG JAE-WON

117
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,394
NOTABLE PROTESTS SCHEDULED FOR THE DAY

118
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,189
CONSCRIPTED POLICEMEN
DISPATCHED BY SEOBU POLICE STATION

119
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,406
Conscripted policemen were dispatched
by Seobu Police Station?

120
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,658
-Yes.
-When there's a protest? Did you check?

121
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,827
Yes, I checked.
But they won't tell me why.

122
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,455
I see. Where are you right now?

123
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,206
I'm at the protest.

124
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,876
Okay, head over to Seobu Police Station
once the protest is over.

125
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,586
Something's going on there.

126
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,212
I want you to stay there until tomorrow.

127
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,755
Okay, got it.

128
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,799
Ms. Jin Seo-kyung.

129
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,100
INCHEON METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

130
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,816
Why does the chief prosecutor
want to see me?

131
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,028
"Go and bring Ms. Jin for me."

132
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,447
That's all he said.

133
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,916
I read your article in the morning paper.

134
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,210
You always write articles

135
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,130
that are very appealing to the public.

136
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,342
The reason I'm here
is because of all those people

137
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,093
who were convinced by you.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,723
I have nothing personal against you, sir.

139
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,267
I just wrote what I heard and confirmed.

140
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,939
I know. You're an honest reporter.
It's hard to find reporters like you.

141
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,193
You're wasting your time if you called me
to ask for a personal favor.

142
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,948
My goodness, you read my mind
before I even got to tell you anything.

143
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,158
I should be working right now.

144
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,203
I'm not free enough to kill time with you.

145
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,664
I apologize.

146
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,375
Now that I've been here for a while,

147
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,876
I started to regret

148
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,337
a lot of the things I did in the past.

149
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,506
I'd like to rectify them.

150
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,925
I think you should be talking to a pastor.

151
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,886
Do you know Lee Dae-cheol?

152
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,515
I sentenced him to death-row
back when I was

153
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,267
the head of the criminal department.

154
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,477
He is…

155
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,312
innocent.

156
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,816
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

157
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,527
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

158
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,611
Salute.

159
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,197
Is Team Two working on a case these days?

160
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,657
They're never here.

161
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,909
Two days ago, some guy turned himself in

162
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,078
for killing Lee Dae-cheol's daughter.

163
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,205
-Lee Dae-cheol's daughter?
-Yes.

164
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,958
They're probably busy with that case.

165
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,502
Really?

166
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,129
-It must be a headache.
-Yes.

167
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,841
If Team Two asks any of you for help,
let me know first.

168
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,302
Don't give them what they want
just because they're seniors.

169
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,721
I want you to ask for my permission first.
Do you understand?

170
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,306
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

171
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,559
You withdrew the search?
Was it the chief's order?

172
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,562
Yes, he thinks it's a fabricated scenario.

173
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,982
No, the chief is just worried.

174
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,693
He doesn't want to be held responsible.

175
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,070
The chief? Why?

176
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,905
Back when I arrested Lee Dae-cheol,

177
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,533
he was the chief investigator.

178
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,201
If we reinvestigated the case

179
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,662
and found out that we made a mistake,

180
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,497
he'll have to take responsibility.

181
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,915
No wonder.

182
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,208
Didn't he ask you

183
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,211
-to be extra careful of the press?
-Yes, he did.

184
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,089
If the reporters find out
that we dispatched a search team,

185
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,718
it might harm his career.
So he's just using us as an excuse.

186
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,012
Is that so?

187
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,806
Well, he was the one
who ordered the withdrawal

188
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,392
So if anything goes wrong,
it'll be on him.

189
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,272
Let's see.

190
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,036
You're a detective.
You shouldn't wear a fake watch.

191
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,456
That watch is way out of your league.

192
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,476
Did you look into it?

193
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,937
I don't know. I asked around,

194
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,313
but no one knows.

195
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,439
Who did you ask?

196
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,316
My gosh, seriously.

197
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,778
I don't know.
Do I need to tell you that too?

198
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,071
You're so annoying.

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,781
Hey.

200
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,202
Do you think I'm letting you stay here

201
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,914
just for your sake?

202
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,169
Okay, fine. I just need to do enough
for the room, right?

203
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,213
What are you into? I'll do it for you.

204
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,757
Tell me. What do you want?

205
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,635
Is this what you want?

206
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,304
-Give me your cell phone.
-Why?

207
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,223
Meeting guys for money and prostitution.

208
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,725
All the evidence is in your cell phone,
so give it to me.

209
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,396
Hurry.

210
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,405
I've bought you some mandarins.
They're on the table.

211
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,032
Eat them and play games just for an hour.

212
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,452
By the time you're done, I'll be home.

213
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,839
My gosh.

214
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,178
Good job, guys.

215
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,889
Why did you make us go out there
in the first place?

216
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,808
It was the chief's order.
I hope you guys understand.

217
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,811
Shouldn't we still search for the body
even if we fail to find it?

218
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,522
I personally think
you made the right call, sir.

219
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,901
Shouldn't you have insisted on searching
no matter what the chief said?

220
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,278
Well, yes. But the chief--

221
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,780
Hey, it's our job to follow
the chief's orders.

222
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,782
If he wants us to search, we search.

223
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,409
If he wants us to go kill ourselves,

224
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,162
we wait until we're outside the office
and kill ourselves then. Right?

225
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,497
The chief does have a point.

226
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,416
I told you to withdraw
because I agreed with him.

227
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,378
Does that mean
we don't need to go back there again?

228
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,464
Then we need to tell the riot police.

229
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,549
They promised to come
right after the protest.

230
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,052
-Yes, but--
-Hurry up and make up your mind.

231
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,430
That way, we'll know
if we can get some rest or not.

232
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,765
We stayed up all night.

233
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,893
Yes, I know. But we don't know
how things will turn out--

234
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,811
You should call the chief and ask.

235
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,688
Ask him if you can send
your underlings home.

236
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,357
Tell him that even dogs

237
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,776
need to eat and get some sleep
in order to work.

238
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,860
Tell him that now.

239
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,864
Hey, forget about the chief.
Just go home and get some rest.

240
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,658
The chief rarely goes back on his word.

241
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,451
Good work, you guys. Go home now.

242
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,664
I don't get why we need to take orders
from the chief when he's not even here.

243
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,165
Hey, Man-gu.

244
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,002
What makes you think you have the right
to get so upset like that?

245
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,671
Didn't you get the call yet?

246
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,756
What call? I'm not expecting any calls.

247
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,718
Remember Park Man-gu, the guy you arrested
a month ago for theft?

248
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,971
Park Ju-man. Man-gu is my name.

249
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,264
Yes, Park Ju-man.

250
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,016
He was released from the detention center.

251
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,853
Why? I swear it was him.

252
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,690
Jungbu Police Station
caught the real culprit.

253
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,526
Didn't you tell me you got him to confess?

254
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,403
You told me you had concrete evidence.

255
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,906
What kind of confession
and evidence did you collect?

256
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,285
No, I'm sure it was Park Ju-man.

257
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,996
Hey, just go home.
I think it's better for you to leave.

258
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,747
Just go, you punk.

259
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,958
I'll be off now.

260
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,002
Gosh, I'm not feeling well.

261
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,712
-Bye, sir.
-Ji Man-gu!

262
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,299
My gosh, you came so quickly.
What brings you here, Mr. Park?

263
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,550
You jerk.

264
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,135
-What are you doing?
-Stop.

265
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,387
Let him take a few more punches.
Wait a bit more.

266
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,890
I told you I didn't do it!

267
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,141
Again?

268
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,478
What are you going to do now?

269
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,230
You ruined an innocent man's life!

270
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,065
What are you going to do now, you punk?

271
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,443
-Stop.
-Mr. Park, please calm down.

272
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,528
-Get off me!
-Calm down.

273
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,447
How do you expect me to calm down?

274
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,408
I clearly told you that I didn't do it.

275
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,493
But he kept saying I did it.

276
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,454
He told me I was the culprit!

277
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,122
How are you going to compensate?

278
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,124
I want my time back, you punk!

279
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,168
-Let's talk outside.
-Let me go!

280
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,378
Ji Man-gu! Come out here!

281
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,672
-Get off me!
-My goodness.

282
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,382
My gosh.

283
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,928
What are you doing?
Get on your knees and beg.

284
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,888
Okay, I'm going.

285
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,014
Darn it.

286
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,600
Are you kidding me?

287
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,060
Hey, did you take a video?

288
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,728
-I won't send it to anyone.
-Delete it.

289
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,938
No way.

290
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,690
-Delete it.
-I'm going to keep it. It's funny.

291
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,360
-Your face is funnier, so just delete it.
-Yours is even funnier.

292
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,986
Yours is the funniest, so delete it.

293
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,821
Go and shave.
And yours is funnier than mine.

294
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,532
-Your breath stinks. Don't talk.
-You guys are thugs, not detectives.

295
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,285
-You're the thug, you jerk.
-Your breath stinks even more.

296
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,871
-Do you have a death wish?
-Go ahead and kill me. I'll arrest you.

297
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,248
-Captain Nam.
-Delete the video, you punk.

298
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,833
-Detective Choi.
-Yes, sir?

299
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,669
Just delete the video.

300
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,712
Why would you save that video?

301
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,422
It's an insult to the entire police force.

302
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,799
Okay, sir.

303
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,551
Here you go. I deleted it.

304
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,719
Darn it.

305
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,929
Shave your beard.

306
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,390
Captain Nam Guk-hyeon.

307
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,141
Can I have a word with you?

308
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,107
You know how Detective Choi can be
a little careless at times.

309
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,525
It was just a joke.

310
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,112
No, it's not about that.
It's about the case from five years ago.

311
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,698
The Lee Dae-cheol's case.

312
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,743
-What about it?
-I know I was the one

313
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,246
who made the arrest.

314
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,749
But to be exact, I wrapped up the case
based on the investigation materials

315
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,834
you gave me.

316
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,629
What about that?
Does that suddenly bother you?

317
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,256
You were fine with it back then.

318
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,092
Yes, I checked everything you gave me,

319
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,886
and everything seemed fine.
That's why I made the final judgment

320
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,847
and arrested him.

321
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,684
I don't have anything against you.

322
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,771
I just wanted to know
your personal opinion.

323
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,652
By any chance,
did anything catch your attention

324
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,195
while investigating the case?

325
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,489
Or did you forget to investigate anything?

326
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,449
No.

327
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,701
Not at all.

328
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,244
I see.

329
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,747
Well, you are very meticulous.

330
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,500
Is it because Lee Dae-cheol's daughter,
Lee Eun-hye, suddenly went missing?

331
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,877
Is that why you're asking?

332
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,797
I see you remember his daughter's name.

333
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,385
I had forgotten, but Detective Choi
told me what's going on and reminded me.

334
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,388
Anyway, everything will be fine. Right?

335
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,644
Just don't get swayed by Park Gun-ho.
Then everything will be fine.

336
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,064
Don't worry about that.
That won't ever happen.

337
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,524
Don't care about what others think.

338
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,818
Just believe in yourself.

339
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,820
That's all that matters.

340
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,449
Yes, of course. I believe in myself.

341
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,367
But it's just…

342
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,161
That darn punk.

343
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,677
-Hello?
-Is this Park Hong-du?

344
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,262
Yes. Who is this?

345
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,848
I'm Oh Ji-hyeok
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

346
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,727
Nice to meet you.

347
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,273
-Hello.
-My goodness.

348
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,032
Hong-du.

349
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,121
My goodness, Hong-du!

350
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,748
Hey, you punk!

351
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,089
Hong-du!

352
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,507
Hey, you punk!

353
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,053
Hey!

354
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,181
Hey, stop!

355
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,271
Damn it.

356
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,084
My gosh.

357
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,761
My goodness, Hong-du.

358
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,150
What are you doing?

359
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,527
It's evidence to show
that you pulled out a knife first.

360
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,698
In other words,

361
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,619
I could kill you right now,

362
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,538
and that won't be a problem.

363
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,168
Goodness.

364
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,926
I'm a police officer.

365
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,594
Sorry.

366
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,305
Hey.

367
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,767
Don't take out a knife
in front of a police officer.

368
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,018
You could get yourself killed.

369
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,104
-Okay?
-Okay, I'm sorry.

370
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,111
The last text you got was three days ago?

371
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,532
Yes, her phone was turned off after that,
so I couldn't reach her ever since.

372
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,953
"Don't look for me.
I'm going to disappear."

373
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,872
That means she knew
she was going to disappear.

374
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,875
Just go.

375
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,961
-What?
-I said go.

376
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,380
Oh, okay.

377
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,340
Hey.

378
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,092
Yes?

379
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,971
Hey.

380
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,889
-Yes?
-You'd better answer my calls.

381
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,266
If you don't, we'll meet again.

382
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,684
Yes, sir.

383
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,894
-Hey.
-Yes?

384
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,605
Oh, right.

385
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
Hello?

386
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,778
Do you have the results?

387
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,032
Oh, really? Gosh, thank you.

388
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,617
Bye.

389
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,203
It wasn't Lee Eun-hye.

390
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,873
They found a will
and the person's belongings nearby.

391
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,501
It definitely wasn't Lee Eun-hye.

392
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,755
Do-chang.

393
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,633
Yesterday, Park Gun-ho gave me
some kind of a hint.

394
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,553
-A hint?
-"You snakes.

395
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,514
You brood of vipers.

396
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,766
How will you escape
being condemned to hell?"

397
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,518
What does that mean?

398
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,686
Do-chang.

399
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,938
Who do you think is the viper?

400
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,398
-Lee Eun-hye?
-What if it's not her?

401
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,692
Then who?

402
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,943
You.

403
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,703
You cunning little jerk.

404
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,747
How did you think of that?

405
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,166
I have to say,
you played a nice trick on us.

406
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,587
You didn't kill Lee Eun-hye
in that field of reeds, did you?

407
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,966
We found her dead this morning!

408
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,386
Hey, listen.

409
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,680
Do you think I don't know
what you were up to?

410
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,599
You got caught on CCTV

411
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,185
with Lee Eun-hye on purpose, didn't you?

412
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,062
Because if her body is found elsewhere,

413
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,149
that would naturally become your alibi.

414
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,776
What are you talking about?

415
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,071
What did that girl do wrong?
Why did you have to kill her like that?

416
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,572
Detective.

417
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,823
Slow down.

418
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,159
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

419
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:54,372
We found Lee Eun-hye's body
by the beach, you punk!

420
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,917
Are you going to say
you didn't kill her all of a sudden?

421
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,337
You told us that you killed her!

422
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,216
You are the one who told us
that you killed Lee Eun-hye!

423
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,551
You found her body by the beach?

424
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,845
-Do-chang.
-What?

425
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,806
I got a call from Yeonsu Police Station.

426
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,433
Her belongings and a will
were found nearby.

427
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,935
I think she committed suicide.

428
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,312
No, this guy killed her.

429
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,399
Tell me the truth.

430
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,235
You staged it as suicide.

431
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,487
You killed her and threw her into the sea,
didn't you?

432
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,323
You told us you killed her
in the field of reeds to hide that.

433
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,282
Why did you kill her?

434
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,494
Why did you kill that innocent girl?
Why did you kill her?

435
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,038
-You shouldn't do this.
-Why did you kill her?

436
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,581
-Why?
-Do-chang.

437
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,876
I won't let you get away with this.

438
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,254
I swear I'm going to put you away myself.

439
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,713
-You should go outside.
-Let me go!

440
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,174
Let go of me, you punk.

441
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,802
I don't care that you graduated the KNPU
as the top student.

442
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,763
You don't just investigate
with your head, you punk.

443
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,306
-Okay, I get it.
-You punk.

444
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,850
-Just go outside!
-Let go of me!

445
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,941
Why did he have to be so violent?

446
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,486
I even told him it was a suicide.

447
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,784
You planned this

448
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,120
with Lee Eun-hye, didn't you?

449
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,540
"I'll go to the police station
to put on an act.

450
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,627
You stay hidden and act like you're dead."

451
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,214
But Lee Eun-hye disagreed with you.

452
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,508
You may have wanted to put on a show,

453
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,761
but she wanted to turn that into reality.

454
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,848
The show is over, Park Gun-ho.

455
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,349
It ended as a tragedy.

456
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,114
I didn't graduate with top grades.

457
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,325
I know.

458
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,995
If you were the top student,
there'd be no future for the KNPU.

459
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,290
I can't believe you hit me.

460
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,953
I can't stop thinking

461
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,456
that you guys are trying to fool me.

462
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,501
I don't think I can handle this on my own.

463
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,044
I want a lawyer.

464
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,297
A lawyer.

465
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,677
Okay, I'll find you a public defender.

466
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,678
No.

467
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,930
I'll need to appoint a lawyer I know.

468
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,932
Give me my cell phone.

469
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,685
I have his number in my contacts list.

470
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,690
Wait.

471
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,487
What is he trying to pull?

472
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,657
What he needs isn't an attorney,
it's his cell phone.

473
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,286
He would've prepared a way
to contact Lee Eun-hye.

474
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,620
I do hope

475
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,331
he contacts Lee Eun-hye.

476
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,416
Please.

477
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,919
She needs to be alive.

478
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,411
Forget it.

479
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,496
-You can take it back.
-Why?

480
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,833
You wanted to call the lawyer.

481
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,335
Have you…

482
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,005
ever killed someone?

483
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,924
Do you know how it feels
to strangle someone

484
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,843
as they squirm and struggle

485
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,179
to stay alive?

486
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,598
Make a guess.

487
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,850
If you guess correctly,

488
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,519
I'll go along with your scenario.

489
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,522
Are you saying you really killed--

490
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,399
Stop asking me half-assed questions.

491
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,027
Do a proper job if you want to make me
a murderer.

492
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,737
You guys are good at that.

493
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,821
What?

494
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,532
Can you sense that I'm a murderer?

495
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,286
Do I look like a murderer? Do I?

496
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,455
Then make me one.

497
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,374
"You're a murderer.

498
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,459
You're a murderer!"

499
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,003
Say that.

500
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:53,838
Go on.

501
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,767
THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES STILL LIVE IN AGONY
DESPITE THE DEATH PENALTY

502
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,185
You've changed the tone of voice.

503
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,062
It sounds like
I'm arguing for the death penalty.

504
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,147
You interviewed the victims' families.

505
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,649
Yours would've been the same.

506
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,818
No, I tried my best to be objective about

507
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,070
both the death-row convicts
and the victims' families.

508
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,322
You tried your best to be objective?

509
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,492
Seo-kyung, how can you be so naive?

510
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,578
A company is run by an owner,
and all newspapers have a stance.

511
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,498
Then let me ask you one thing.

512
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,961
Is this the company's stance
or your personal opinion?

513
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,587
-That's enough.
-Mr. Yoo.

514
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,755
Anyway, you did great.

515
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,383
The director read the article
and told me he wants to meet you.

516
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,592
I'll call once we fix a date.

517
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,677
Mr. Yoo.

518
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,307
THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES STILL LIVE IN AGONY
DESPITE THE DEATH PENALTY

519
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,439
Lee Dae-cheol isn't the real culprit.

520
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,107
He was framed.

521
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,860
A detective, prosecutor, and judge
all worked together

522
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,486
to turn him into a criminal.

523
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,322
And your role was to wrap things up

524
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,783
and deliver the finishing blow.

525
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,639
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

526
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,059
SQUID INTERNET CAFE
HUE MOTEL

527
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,147
WAGU BURGER
HAPPY INTERNET CAFE

528
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,623
This is Kang Do-chang
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

529
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,209
Hello, sir. I'm Jin Seo-kyung
from Jeonghan Daily.

530
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,211
Hey, what's up?

531
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,546
Do you remember Lee Dae-cheol's case
from five years ago?

532
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,881
What?

533
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,592
You were in charge of the case,
weren't you?

534
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,094
From what I know, your team arrested him.

535
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,441
Why are you suddenly asking about a case
from five years ago?

536
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,401
Hello.

537
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,280
Long time no see, Ms. Jin.

538
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,699
Detective Kang, you're here, too.

539
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,660
Hey, have you been well?

540
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,912
Did you guys meet for personal reasons?

541
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,623
Yes, I came to ask him for a favor.

542
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,919
I see. Then I'm guessing
I shouldn't join you.

543
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,128
Sorry.

544
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,382
Okay, I understand.
I'll leave you guys to talk.

545
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,758
See you.

546
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,095
Hey, it's me.

547
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,098
A reporter from Jeonghan Daily
came to Seobu Police Station.

548
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,811
Did the prosecution happen to receive
any cases from Seobu Police Station?

549
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,147
No.

550
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,818
I just got a hunch.

551
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,530
Let me be straightforward.

552
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,450
Are you sure that Lee Dae-cheol
is the real culprit of that case?

553
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,911
Why are you asking me that?

554
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,580
I asked you a question first.

555
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,749
Yes, I'm sure.

556
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,420
Now, it's your turn to answer my question.

557
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,506
I received a tip-off
saying Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

558
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,718
What? Who?

559
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,928
I can't tell you that yet.

560
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,058
I'm sorry, but we can't let
any reporters in here.

561
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:38,104
I've been told there's been a violation
of human rights in this holding cell.

562
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,982
What? What are you talking about?

563
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,776
Who? Who told you that?

564
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,697
I read a post on the online bulletin board
of this police station.

565
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,116
-Why don't you check?
-What?

566
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,576
That can't be.

567
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,620
MURDER: PARK GUN-HO

568
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,667
-Are you Park Gun-ho?
-Yes.

569
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,461
Why are you locked up?

570
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,087
I killed someone.

571
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,424
-What?
-I killed a girl.

572
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,259
An 18-year-old girl.

573
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,137
And?

574
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,764
I buried her.

575
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,140
What?

576
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,642
What do you think you're doing?

577
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,102
-Wait. Let me talk to him.
-No, you need to leave.

578
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,772
You're not allowed to talk to the inmates.
Get out of here.

579
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,856
Please leave.

580
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,327
Ms. Jin, I'm already busy
with tons of work.

581
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,829
I have no time to investigate
a closed case again.

582
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,457
If you're so sure,
there's no reason not to cooperate.

583
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,043
Then officially request my superiors
for cooperation.

584
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,170
I have nothing more to say.

585
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,966
Okay.

586
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,468
I'm still going to write an article.

587
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,553
What are you going to write?
Nothing's been proven.

588
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,890
The person who tipped me off
is a pretty reliable source.

589
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,517
That's more than enough for an article.

590
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,185
-I'll be off now.
-Ms. Jin, wait.

591
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,729
Give me a minute.

592
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,276
We're in a very sensitive situation
right now.

593
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,028
Can you write the article a little later?

594
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,532
If you publish that article,
things will get really complicated.

595
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,409
It's a sensitive situation?

596
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,870
Why? Why will it complicate things?

597
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,205
Who tipped you off?

598
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,669
Kim Gi-tae,
the former chief prosecutor of Incheon.

599
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,214
Why did he tell you that? On what basis?

600
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,676
He was the head of the criminal division
when Lee Dae-cheol was arrested.

601
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,263
He's a pretty trustworthy informant.

602
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,809
Okay, it's your turn now.

603
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,190
Last night,

604
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,236
Lee Dae-cheol's daughter, Lee Eun-hye,
was reported missing.

605
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,530
And some guy turned himself in

606
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,574
saying he killed and buried her.

607
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,327
But we still haven't confirmed
whether she's dead or alive.

608
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,205
If you publish an article,
things could really get dangerous.

609
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,708
This can't be a coincidence.

610
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,462
I really hope it is.

611
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,117
Look how beautiful

612
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,412
my sister is.

613
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:51,297
LATE YOO JEONG-SEON

614
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,052
This morning, I read the article
regarding the victims' families.

615
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,388
The article was pretty convincing.
Who wrote it?

616
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,850
Her name is Jin Seo-kyung.
She's pretty smart.

617
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,648
The President pledged
to abolish the death penalty.

618
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,149
Be careful.

619
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,026
The Blue House might
find this uncomfortable.

620
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,070
I bet they'll like it.

621
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,697
They need to clean up the waste
in order to pave a new road.

622
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,122
They'll soon announce the result

623
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,916
of the cabinet reshuffle.

624
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,793
The Minister of Justice?

625
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,421
-Congratulations, Jeong-ryeol.
-It's too early for that.

626
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,423
The hearing will raise quite an issue.

627
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,343
Don't worry. I'll deal with the press.

628
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,595
Okay.

629
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,185
AN EVANGELIST MURDERS HIGH SCHOOL GIRL
AND SECRETLY BURIES HER

630
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,190
I told you to keep things confidential!

631
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,401
Who did this?

632
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,361
What kind of lunatic leaked this?

633
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:59,073
I'll let you know
after I look into it, sir.

634
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,618
My gosh, who did this?

635
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,746
People in our team are the only ones
who know about this.

636
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,624
Why would we leak the case
when we know it'll backfire on us?

637
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,293
Did any reporters come to see you?

638
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,628
No, I wouldn't have met them
even if they came.

639
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,172
Which jerk did this then?

640
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,800
Just wait until I get my hands
on whoever leaked this.

641
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,968
It might be him.

642
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,137
Darn it!

643
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,057
Yes, I met a reporter.

644
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,227
I fell for that cunning reporter

645
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,229
and told her everything. Are you happy?

646
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,273
Isn't that your phone?

647
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,406
What do you want?

648
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm busy. What?

649
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,035
I gave you my card this morning.

650
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,080
These days, you can use credit cards
to pay for delivery food.

651
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,082
And don't use my credit card
on something useless.

652
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,085
I get notifications about
how much you spend, okay?

653
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,337
Now, hang up.

654
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,758
She makes me so angry.

655
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,843
Who is she to yell at me?

656
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,803
I still pay for her stuff
even after the divorce.

657
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,433
She always gets me riled up
every time I'm about to forget about her.

658
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,190
Park Gun-ho gave his credit card
to Lee Eun-hye.

659
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,859
He checked the notifications
regarding his card usage

660
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,028
and confirmed that she's still alive.

661
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,950
But we don't know for sure
if it was her who used the card.

662
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,452
They were all places
where high school girls normally go.

663
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,496
Snack bars, internet cafes,
and convenience stores.

664
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,581
It could be his little sister
or his girlfriend.

665
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
Park Gun-ho was an orphan.

666
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,293
And one of the places was a motel.

667
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,837
What kind of woman pays for a motel
with her boyfriend's card?

668
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,381
Let's go to the motel first.

669
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,299
If a high school girl
went there by herself,

670
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,717
they'll surely remember her.

671
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,681
-Did you tell the reporter?
-No.

672
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,600
Then how did he write an article
saying you killed and buried her?

673
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,685
Darn it!

674
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,397
It was me! I killed someone!

675
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,439
That's what matters.

676
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,442
Do I also need to take responsibility
for what a darn reporter wrote?

677
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,820
Why? Why do I need to do that?

678
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,792
He purposely got the press
involved in this.

679
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,670
Make sure he doesn't talk
to any of the reporters, okay?

680
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,754
Yes, sir.

681
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,256
Excuse me.

682
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,425
Yes, Prosecutor.

683
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,885
What? No, I didn't hide it on purpose.

684
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,346
Hello? Sir?

685
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,848
What did he say?

686
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,474
He practically threw a fit.

687
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,186
He's angry that he had to read about
what happened in his jurisdiction.

688
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,439
He wants us to send Park Gun-ho
to the prosecution.

689
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,773
Darn it.

690
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,028
-It hasn't been 48 hours yet, right?
-No.

691
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,946
Keep him here until then no matter what.

692
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,616
And send the search team again.

693
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,660
-Pardon?
-We're not doing anything right now.

694
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,871
But what if he really did bury the body?

695
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,289
Will you deal with the backlash?

696
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,416
You have a point.

697
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,084
Instead,

698
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,964
send them somewhere else other than
the place Park Gun-ho mentioned.

699
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,593
-Sorry?
-The place he mentioned

700
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,346
is where Lee Dae-cheol killed
and buried Jang Jin-su.

701
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,849
At least one reporter would
remember that case.

702
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,559
Then what do you think will happen?

703
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,897
That reporter will realize that this case
is related to Lee Dae-cheol.

704
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,856
Right.

705
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,779
This is where Mr. Park, an evangelist,
killed and buried a high school girl.

706
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,990
Right now, around 200 policemen
have gathered here

707
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,950
to search for her body.

708
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,995
Dong-uk.

709
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,458
Tell the guys up front to take their time.

710
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,086
Tell them not to waste
their energy too quickly. Hurry.

711
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,088
Let's slow down, everyone.

712
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,215
-Hey, run!
-Slow down!

713
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,051
I get he wanted to put on a show,
but why not choose a flatland?

714
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,969
This is so damn exhausting.

715
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,682
An automated motel.

716
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,522
Look. There's a security camera.

717
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,066
They'll only let us check
if we bring a warrant.

718
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,527
Then let's check out
the other places first.

719
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,488
Think carefully.

720
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,366
She ate a hamburger here last night
and paid with a credit card.

721
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,995
Well, as you can see behind you…

722
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,632
Over there.

723
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,342
Hey!

724
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,764
-What's this?
-What are you doing?

725
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,308
PARK GUN-HO'S CASE WILL BE TRANSFERRED
TO THE PROSECUTION

726
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,940
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

727
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,337
Where are you right now?

728
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,174
The police station is a mess right now.

729
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,178
Really?

730
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,515
Are you saying Lee Eun-hye could be alive?

731
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,142
-Give me that.
-Okay, sir.

732
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,853
What do you mean?

733
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,938
Lee Eun-hye is alive?

734
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,648
We're not sure yet.

735
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,942
But there is a possibility.

736
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,027
Yes.

737
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,656
Okay, sir.
We'll try to find her as soon as possible.

738
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,622
Gosh, he's going to nag at me all day.

739
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,917
We'll just have to check
the CCTVs ourselves.

740
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,794
There's no point in checking the footage.

741
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,131
We need to find the actual person.

742
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,046
I've been staying up
for three days straight.

743
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,550
Now I don't know what I'm eating
or why I'm even doing this.

744
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,301
I don't know what's what anymore.

745
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,887
-Is it good?
-Yes.

746
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,682
Poor you. This ended up being
your first case since you've arrived.

747
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,934
Why make yourself suffer like this?

748
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,229
You already have an impressive resume.

749
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,399
I went to the KNPU because I was told
that I could go to college for free,

750
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,776
and I didn't want to work
for any of the other teams.

751
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,777
That's why I'm here.

752
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,071
And I found out I was pretty good at it,
so I stayed.

753
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,366
Okay, sir.
Thank you for the insincere answer.

754
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,537
My gosh.

755
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,126
Yes, sir.

756
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:11,213
Yes, we're doing our best to find her.
Please give us a bit more time.

757
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,466
We're searching all over Incheon
right now.

758
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,552
Yes, sir.

759
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,640
Why doesn't he look for her himself?

760
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,559
He became the chief
thanks to that mouth of his,

761
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,104
so all he ever does is talk.
He never does anything himself.

762
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,901
Do-chang, she just used the credit card.

763
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,069
Where?

764
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,156
-Here?
-Yes.

765
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,496
It's a guy.

766
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,498
Does that mean
he's been using the credit card?

767
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,250
-He bought alcohol and cigarettes.
-So?

768
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,629
Lee Eun-hye isn't old enough
to buy alcohol and cigarettes.

769
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,713
Come on.

770
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,028
-Who are you?
-What?

771
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,198
Whose card did you use?
Did you get it from Lee Eun-hye?

772
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,200
Who's Lee Eun-hye?

773
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,910
Someone asked me to buy this.

774
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,912
Do-chang.

775
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,210
-You go that way.
-Okay.

776
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:40,344
HOLDING CELL

777
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,013
Mr. Park, you will be
taken to the prosecution.

778
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,186
The prosecutor sent an investigator here.

779
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,063
He's going to take Park Gun-ho himself.

780
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,523
-What?
-What?

781
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,565
-My gosh.
-Darn it.

782
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,334
-Hey!
-Wait!

783
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,920
Hey, wait! Darn it!

784
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,255
Make sure he doesn't talk.

785
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,381
Yes, sir.

786
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,299
-Hey!
-Out of the way!

787
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,678
Out of the way!

788
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,805
Take his picture, now!

789
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,598
-Please move.
-Are you really an evangelist?

790
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,851
Do you admit to murdering
a high school girl?

791
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,185
-Move!
-Why did you kill her?

792
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,146
Aren't you embarrassed as an evangelist?

793
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,859
-Get inside.
-I have something to say.

794
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,318
-Just go inside.
-Let me go!

795
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,737
I have something to say to the reporters!

796
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,115
-Please give me a chance to speak!
-My goodness.

797
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,075
Let me talk!

798
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,785
-Gosh, get in.
-Wait.

799
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,205
It looks like he has something to say.
Let me interview him.

800
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,707
If you keep stopping him,

801
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,209
I'll have to write a negative article
about the police.

802
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,175
I confessed that I killed Lee Eun-hye,

803
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,635
the daughter of a death-row inmate
named Lee Dae-cheol.

804
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,431
Why? Do you know why I did that?

805
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,641
Because no one listened.

806
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,436
No one ever tried to listen to the truth.

807
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:16,315
I had to tell the world that an evangelist
murdered a high school girl

808
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,527
because that was the only way for me
to get a chance to speak.

809
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:25,073
Today, in God's name,
I wish to tell you the truth

810
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,075
and nothing but the truth.

811
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,996
Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

812
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,081
He had to live as a murderer
for five years

813
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,667
because of something he didn't even do.

814
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,047
Please help me so that the police
will carry out a reinvestigation.

815
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,549
Please. Please help me.

816
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,176
-Please!
-Get in.

817
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,427
-Please help!
-Get inside!

818
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,054
-That's enough!
-Please!

819
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,472
-Mr. Park.
-My gosh.

820
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,891
Eun-hye!

821
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,072
It's all over now. Let's just give up.

822
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,698
No, Eun-hye. We can't give up!

823
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,742
It's over now! That's enough!

824
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,328
Are you Lee Dae-cheol's daughter?

825
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,164
Did Park Gun-ho really kidnap you?

826
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,499
Does this mean he lied?

827
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,293
Did you plan this with him
so you could clear your father's name?

828
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,213
-How do you know Park Gun-ho?
-Calm down. She knows nothing.

829
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,965
-Let's do this later.
-What happened?

830
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,716
-Tell us the truth!
-Tell us what happened!

831
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,884
-That's enough!
-Tell us!

832
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,198
What do you want from me?

833
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,117
You all know it already.

834
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,828
My dad is a murderer,
and I'm the murderer's daughter.

835
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,996
Do you want me to cry?

836
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,040
Do you want me to cry and ask you
to forgive my dad for committing murder?

837
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,417
Or do you want me to die?

838
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,919
Do you want me to bite my tongue
and just kill myself?

839
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,091
Do you think I won't be able to do it?

840
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,677
I don't want to hear anyone talk
from now on.

841
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,111
You see that?

842
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,113
Do you finally get
what kind of person I am?

843
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,740
Now, go ahead and write your article

844
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,743
saying I'm just as dangerous as my dad
who committed murder.

845
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,663
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

846
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,874
Eun-hye!

847
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,584
Your dad didn't kill anyone.

848
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,169
You can't give up!

849
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,630
-Eun-hye!
-Just get inside!

850
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,929
I think that's enough.

851
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,348
Who are you to stop me?

852
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,266
She's not a suspect.

853
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,977
The police are obligated to protect her.

854
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,188
It sounds like you know her pretty well.

855
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,190
Then tell me about her.

856
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,318
Name. Lee Eun-hye.

857
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,819
Father. Lee Dae-cheol.

858
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,823
A dangerous girl who could kill herself
if a reporter keeps asking her questions.

859
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,991
Is that enough?

860
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,460
No one was kidnapped or murdered.

861
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,254
This was just a fabricated scenario
created by Mr. Park.

862
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,006
And we, the police,

863
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,052
have requested a medical opinion
regarding his mental health.

864
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,762
That is all I have for today.

865
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,515
-You may start asking questions.
-What's going to happen to Mr. Park?

866
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:40,018
We'll have to wait for the prosecution
and judge to decide.

867
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,187
Are you really an evangelist?

868
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,065
An online article raised an issue
about a missing high school girl,

869
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,442
but it turned out to be a fabricated case.

870
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,405
Some say Lee Dae-cheol fabricated the case
so he could prove his innocence

871
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,450
and request for a reinvestigation.

872
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,038
NOVEMBER 12 2015, 2 A.M.

873
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,790
You lost the evidence?

874
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,917
And a murder weapon at that?

875
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,169
I'll take responsibility.

876
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,213
You'll take responsibility? How?

877
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,674
I don't care if you get fired.

878
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,300
We'll all get fired!

879
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,970
I'd be grateful if it ends there.

880
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,263
If this goes public,

881
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:21,101
the entire police force
will be humiliated because of you.

882
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,188
My gosh, this is driving me crazy. Hey!

883
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,026
When did you realize you lost it?

884
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,987
It's been about an hour.

885
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,281
Who else did you tell other than me?

886
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,283
I really wanted to find it,

887
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,786
so I told forensics
and everyone else at the scene.

888
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,079
Shut it.

889
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,255
EVIDENCE

890
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,342
Sir, where did you find that?

891
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,678
Yes, that's…

892
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,931
That's the evidence I lost.

893
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,142
Listen, Sang-mi.

894
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,270
You forgot that you gave this to me.

895
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,814
This evidence

896
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:12,402
never disappeared from our sight.

897
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,613
Do you understand?

898
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,949
Yes, sir.

899
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,870
You darn punk. This is mostly your fault.

900
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,664
You should've trained her properly.

901
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,083
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I expect you to take care of this.

902
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,838
Okay, sir. I'll make sure no one talks.

903
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,891
What's wrong with this?

904
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,395
Gosh.

905
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,398
Damn it!

906
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,287
You'll be number 12,
and you'll be number 13.

907
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,248
You'll be number 14, 15, and 16.

908
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,749
Remember your numbers.

909
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,001
I'll cut your throats one by one.

910
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,212
I'll draw your blood

911
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,381
and cut you into pieces.

912
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,135
How are the people reacting online?

913
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,720
You can tell by the number of views.

914
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,014
The video is quickly going viral.

915
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,184
And because of this, a lot more people
seem to agree with the death penalty.

916
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,519
Did you check who uploaded this?

917
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,771
Someone must've uploaded it
on another community site

918
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,898
after downloading it
from the Blue House website.

919
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,196
Hello?

920
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,616
Yes, Mr. President.

921
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,160
I'm listening, sir.

922
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,746
Yes, I just watched it.

923
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,915
Yes.

924
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,586
I understand
that you're not happy with this.

925
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,631
But this might be
a good opportunity for you.

926
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,632
Hey, how could you be eating right now?

927
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,598
Are you looking down on me

928
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,184
now that you know a few cops?

929
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,103
What? What did I do wrong?

930
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,944
Hey, did you guys see her glare at me?

931
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,571
My gosh, how terrifying.

932
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,698
You scare me so much.

933
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,369
Hey.

934
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,037
You brat.

935
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,874
Get lost before I pluck all your hair out.

936
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,669
Do you understand me, murderer's daughter?

937
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,672
Stop talking to me about my dad.
I have nothing to do with him.

938
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,050
How? How could you
have nothing to do with him?

939
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,182
I was taken to the police station
because of your dad.

940
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,356
I'm sorry, Hong-du. I'm really sorry, bro.

941
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,526
I'm not your "bro."

942
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,444
If I was your brother,

943
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:47,826
does that mean
that damn murderer is my dad?

944
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,870
How dare you turn me
into a murderer's son, you annoying wench?

945
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,499
Hey, get up.

946
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,458
Get up, damn it.

947
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,589
Leave. And don't ever
show up before me again.

948
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,008
Do you understand?

949
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,759
Hong-du, please.

950
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,761
Forgive me just this once.

951
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,680
I have nowhere else to go.

952
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,933
Please.

953
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,435
I'll do anything.

954
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,146
Leave before I bust your head.

955
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,241
Do you want to keep living with us?

956
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,284
Yes.

957
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,119
Then

958
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,663
go somewhere quiet

959
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,624
and slit your wrist.

960
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:43,465
And wait until the blood of a murderer
no longer runs in your body.

961
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,843
Once you do that, you can come back.

962
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,475
Asshole.

963
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,806
I have news.

964
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:37,227
-What is it this time?
-The chief is going to buy dinner

965
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,354
just for our team.

966
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,773
What's gotten into him?
He never does anything for us.

967
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:42,732
Isn't that big news?

968
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,818
And do you know where we'll be eating?

969
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,195
We're eating at Horimjeong.

970
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,404
That means we're having beef!

971
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,991
I guess we didn't search the mountain
for nothing.

972
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,452
We'll get to fill our stomachs
with Korean beef thanks to you.

973
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,829
I'm not in the mood

974
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,623
for beef right now.

975
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,292
Get ready to leave.

976
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,215
This is Kang Do-chang
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

977
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,550
I'd like to make a report.

978
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,260
Yes, go ahead.

979
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,887
I sent the files to your email,
Detective Kang.

980
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,472
Take a look and decide for yourself.

981
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,515
What?

982
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,059
It's evidence to prove
that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

983
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,438
What? Hello? Hello?

984
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,522
Damn it.

985
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,027

991
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,182
Hey!

992
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,142
Hey, stop right there!

993
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,564
Hey!

994
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,607
Hey! Stop! Stop right there!

995
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,256
Hey! What's wrong with you?

996
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,966
Hey, wake up!

997
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,634
What… Why is she…

998
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,928
Hey, what's wrong?

999
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,680
Hey!

1000
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,890
She suddenly collapsed.

1001
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,059
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

1002
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,145
-My gosh.
-Let me see.

1003
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,689
My gosh, what's the matter with her?

1004
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,983
-My gosh.
-I swear I didn't do anything.

1005
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,485
She collapsed on her own.

1006
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,613
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

AROUND 3:00 A.M. ON NOVEMBER 3, 2015

1013
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,268
What's going on?

1014
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,854
What is it?

1015
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,523
If this CCTV footage wasn't fabricated,

1016
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,194
it proves Lee Dae-cheol's alibi.

1017
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,198
It means Lee Dae-cheol wasn't there

1018
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,201
at the time and location

1019
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,828

A SPECIAL THANKS TO JO JAE-YUN
AND LEE HYUN-WOOK

1022
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,543
Shouldn't we reinvestigate?

1023
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,295
Just act like you don't know anything.

1024
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,881
Wouldn't it be hard for you
to ignore what you already know?

1025
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:43,342
Lee Dae-cheol. You killed someone,
but you're scared to die?

1026
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,636
I didn't kill anyone.
I'm not a murderer like you.

1027
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,805
Do you go around badmouthing your parents?

1028
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:51,309
I even bought diapers for your mother!

1029
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,644
You shouldn't do that.

1030
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,854
Are you still a cop?

1031
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,398
The person who framed Lee Dae-cheol
will soon come for me.

1032
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,859
Hello? Mr. Park Gun-ho?

1033
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:03,654
I met him.

1034
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,741
I have no time to talk.
I'll send you a photo.

1035
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,327
Do you know who the culprit is?

1036
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,205
The real culprit
behind the Lee Dae-cheol's case.

1037
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,751
