1
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,376
SEJOONG MEDICAL CENTER

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,593
She has epilepsy.

3
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,762
She needs to take a test
for us to know the cause,

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,889
but it's normally hard to find out
the exact reason.

5
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,349
It was just a seizure.

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,436
If she takes her medicine,
the seizures will occur less frequently.

7
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,150
Yes, Captain.

8
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,278
Okay. Yes, sir.

9
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,822
I want her admitted.

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,991
It's not that bad.

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,702
You can take her home
once she finishes taking her IV fluid.

12
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,204
Just have her admitted.

13
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,457
Her illness doesn't require her
to get hospitalized.

14
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,250
Don't jump to conclusions

15
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,462
and think you know everything
just because you're a doctor.

16
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,172
"Unknown cause of illness.

17
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,674
Requires an in-depth examination
and hospitalization."

18
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,645
Now is a good time to have beef.

19
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,938
Eat up.

20
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,443
Why are you all just sitting there?

21
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,571
Do you find me that uncomfortable?

22
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,365
No, it's not that. We're just…

23
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,617
It's not because of you, sir.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,745
Hey, forget about work and eat up.

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,915
When will we get the chance
to eat expensive beef again?

26
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,709
-Sir, I…
-What is it?

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,671
I have something to say
about Lee Dae-cheol.

28
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,880
What is it this time?

29
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,049
What's bothering you this time?

30
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,718
Well, I just find it really hard

31
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,929
to ignore this one.

32
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,722
Do-chang.

33
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,726
The chief came here to praise you
for all your hard work.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,395
Why do you have to ruin the mood--

35
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,730
-Violent Crimes Unit Team Two.
-Yes, sir.

36
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,399
You useless punks.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,652
It's so hard for me to like you guys.

38
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,987
Do you know why?

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,615
Because one of you keeps causing trouble.

40
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,577
And because of him,
you've become a group of useless punks.

41
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,579
Do you understand?

42
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,874
You followed me, didn't you?

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,542
Yes.

44
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,460
Why?

45
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,546
You guys proved your point.

46
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,798
No, not yet.

47
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,717
There's something you need to do.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,888
We need your testimony
in order to arrest Park Gun-ho.

49
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,766
Forget it. I'm not interested.

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,810
I was worried you might say that.

51
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,230
But thanks to the trouble you caused,
I'll get what I want.

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,317
I'll take you once you get treated.

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,818
I'll arrest you for theft.

54
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,778
You're unbelievable.

55
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,365
The doctor told me
you need to be hospitalized for a week,

56
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,117
so get some good rest until then.

57
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,828
Once you're free to go,
I'll take you with me.

58
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,247
PATIENT: LEE EUN-HYE

59
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,668
-Keep an eye on her. I'll be back.
-Okay. But, sir.

60
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,504
What are you charging her with?

61
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,009
She didn't do anything.
We're protecting a witness.

62
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,316
I wanted to use this chance
to better my relationship with you guys.

63
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,985
But you messed it up again.

64
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,571
Keep acting up like this.

65
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,449
And you'll see how that will affect you
in the long run.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,284
Do-chang.

67
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,205
This is why you can't make it,
you dumb fool.

68
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,457
Your juniors keep getting promoted,

69
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,210
but you're not even a captain yet,
and you still do fieldwork.

70
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,215
Sir.

71
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,342
-Sir.
-No, let go.

72
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,677
-Sir, please.
-I'm done here.

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,012
Sir, come on.
You can't just leave like this.

74
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,098
Damn it.

75
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,478
You've changed so much
after you became the chief.

76
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,438
What did you say?

77
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,358
I had to deal with Park Gun-ho's nonsense,

78
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,528
so I said some crazy stuff.
What's the big deal?

79
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,779
Back when we worked together,

80
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,074
you used to brush it off
even when your juniors complained.

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,161
Forget it. You can go if you want.
It'll be better for us if you're not here.

82
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,330
Hey, pass the drinks.
Let's have fun on our own.

83
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,415
Have a glass.

84
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,625
Fill your glasses.

85
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,629
Go on. You were on your way out.
Stop ruining the mood, and just leave.

86
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
Hey.

87
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,969
Are you upset at me?

88
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,972
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,101
You have no idea
how frustrated I am because of you.

90
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,937
Why do you keep being unreasonable
about something so unnecessary?

91
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,024
That's why I'm so harsh on you.

92
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,402
You should change a little
now that you've aged.

93
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,862
Yes, sure.

94
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,114
I should change

95
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,533
in order to survive.

96
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,167
Hey, I want you guys
to switch your glasses too.

97
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,877
Let's get wasted tonight.

98
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,420
Drink up.

99
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,921
-Here.
-Okay, sir.

100
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,631
Drink up.

101
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,681
My goodness.

102
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,895
Come here, Bong-sik.

103
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,067
Boys, you guys are the most useless punks

104
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,361
at our police station.

105
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,574
Hey, guys.

106
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,286
You know how much I love you guys, right?

107
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,329
Yes, sir.

108
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,331
Okay.

109
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,085
Violent Crimes Unit Team Two,
Kang Do-chang.

110
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,836
You punk.

111
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,884
He's the best cop I've ever seen.

112
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,178
I'm serious. Do you know that?

113
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,137
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,555
You know nothing, punks.

115
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,476
I'll be off now.

116
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,812
-Bye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

117
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,190
Bong-sik.

118
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,276
Drink as much as you want
with the boys tonight.

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,445
Don't worry about the bill, okay?

120
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,614
-Thank you, sir. Goodbye.
-Bye.

121
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,698
Take him home safely.

122
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,244
-Bye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

123
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,501
You guys should learn from the chief.

124
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,753
Listen, Do-chang.

125
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,839
Chief Moon is nothing but talk,

126
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,425
and I like you a hundred times
better than him.

127
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,594
What's with him?

128
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,763
I love him the most.

129
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,640
Hey, get off me.

130
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,643
Do-chang, I don't care about the chief.

131
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,229
I'm going to become a detective like you.

132
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,397
Cut the crap.

133
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,817
This is why he calls you
a bunch of useless punks.

134
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,071
Hey, what took you so long?
We called you ages ago.

135
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,115
The chief already left.

136
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,159
Sorry. I had to take care of some stuff.

137
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,872
Gosh, isn't Detective Oh really something?

138
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,958
"You can go ahead and live a servile life.

139
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,296
I will keep my chin up
and live by my standards."

140
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,341
He's a totally different breed from us.

141
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,344
He really is amazing. You're the best.

142
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,764
But seriously, shouldn't we reinvestigate
the case?

143
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,059
Hey, didn't you hear the chief go nuts?

144
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,439
But we should still look into it.
We got a tip-off.

145
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,065
Darn it.

146
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,610
Hey, why do you guys work as cops?

147
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,780
It's to earn a living.

148
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,575
If we reinvestigate this case,
it'll be over for us.

149
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,784
It's going to ruin us all.

150
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,873
I received it on my email,
so I'm the only one who saw it.

151
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,666
You guys don't need to worry about it.

152
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,504
-Sir.
-Hey.

153
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,255
-What about a second round?
-No, I'm done.

154
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,424
-Jae-hong, grab him a cab.
-I'll take him home.

155
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,842
Come this way.

156
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,845
-Okay.
-This way.

157
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,973
-Bye.
-Go home safely.

158
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,518
Let's go for a second round. Let's go.

159
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,069
When are they executing them?

160
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,615
There's not a lot of time left.

161
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,535
By any chance,
is Lee Dae-cheol on the list?

162
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,286
Yes.

163
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,748
Okay, thanks.

164
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,851
3:10 A.M., NOVEMBER 3, 2015,
HANDONG LOGISTICS OFFICE

165
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,693
Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

166
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,861
He had to live as a murderer
for five years

167
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,322
because of something he didn't even do.

168
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,865
Do you know Lee Dae-cheol?

169
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,826
I sentenced him to death-row

170
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,203
back when I was
the head of the criminal department.

171
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,204
He's…

172
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,623
innocent.

173
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,431
LEE DAE-CHEOL MURDERED
AND ABANDONED THE BODY AT DAWN

174
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,809
NOVEMBER 3, 2015

175
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,060
3:10 A.M., NOVEMBER 3

176
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,939
AROUND 3:00 A.M., NOVEMBER 3, 2015

177
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,691
Was it sent to your email?

178
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
Just act like you don't know anything.

179
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,947
It's better for you that way.

180
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,159
I know I shouldn't cross the chief
especially since I only just got here.

181
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,869
But wouldn't it be hard for you?

182
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,413
What are you talking about?
What would be hard for me?

183
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,540
Ignoring what you already know.

184
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,666
Ji-hyeok.

185
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,044
Have you never felt uneasy
after arresting a criminal?

186
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,503
Did that never happen to you?

187
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,423
But if we don't learn how to ignore that,

188
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,844
not a single detective would be able
to sleep properly at night.

189
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,304
-Do you understand?
-Exactly.

190
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,473
The problem is that you can't sleep.

191
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,476
Why? Why do you think
I have trouble sleeping at night?

192
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,605
No matter how hard we try,

193
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,441
nothing will work out
if the higher-ups don't want it.

194
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,028
We'll just end up
getting on their bad side.

195
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,947
So why bother?
It's obvious how things will turn out.

196
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,158
Then just forget about it
if that's what you want to do.

197
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,242
Hey.

198
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,037
There's no reason for me to feel uneasy.

199
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,208
All I did was gather evidence
and arrest the guy.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,418
It's all up to the judge to decide.

201
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,755
Why does a detective have to be
responsible for the judge's verdict?

202
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,256
No one will condemn you

203
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,634
for not reinvestigating the case.

204
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,970
I'm saying you don't need to give me
such a long statement.

205
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,389
"Statement"?

206
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,599
Were you questioning me?

207
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,935
My gosh.

208
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,986
We're here, Do-chang. Have a good night.

209
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,615
Don't worry, you punk.

210
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,870
I'll have a really good night.

211
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,792
-What are you looking at?
-Salute.

212
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,043
My gosh.

213
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,731
Gosh, my head.

214
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,235
Eun-hui.

215
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,905
Eun-hui.

216
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,211
This darn headache.

217
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,648
My head hurts.

218
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,539
What a lousy life.

219
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,801
WHOLESALE WATCHES AND GOLD

220
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,976
Yes.

221
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,937
I put this up for auction.

222
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,022
Who was the previous owner?

223
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,608
I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.

224
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,279
OH JI-HYEOK
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

225
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,114
Are you saying this was stolen?

226
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,366
There's no way.

227
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,785
I checked the list of stolen items
before I accepted it.

228
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,036
If it wasn't stolen,

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,372
how could a detective like me
own something so expensive?

230
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,377
I don't know who it was exactly.

231
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,422
I just know that she was
a woman in her 40s.

232
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,340
But you spoke on the phone, didn't you?

233
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,225
Instead, please don't tell her
that I gave you this number.

234
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,060
It's not a cell phone number.

235
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,896
She only called me through that number.

236
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,734
It's me, your uncle.

237
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,320
What's up?

238
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,239
Do you remember the watch
your father gave me before he died?

239
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,949
Yes.

240
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,369
Did you take that
when you were in high school?

241
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,413
No.

242
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,709
Jong-tae told me you stole it
from my study.

243
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,671
Does that mean Jong-tae lied to me?

244
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,260
Okay, let's hang up.

245
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,565
We came across clear evidence,

246
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,777
so we can't just ignore it.
That's totally absurd.

247
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,114
And you heard what Park Gun-ho said
in front of all those reporters.

248
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,409
That guy totally fooled around with us.

249
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,411
How can we trust him?

250
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,206
I'm saying this based on a hunch.
The hunch of a detective.

251
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,500
Didn't you feel anything?

252
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,168
That guy was full of lies,

253
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,297
but he really seemed sincere
when he talked about Lee Dae-cheol.

254
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,342
-Don't you agree?
-I felt the same way.

255
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,970
If we don't do anything,
it would be a dereliction of duty.

256
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,138
And I can't allow myself to ignore this

257
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,848
as a detective.

258
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,642
This is driving me crazy.

259
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,103
Goodness, you all came to work early.

260
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,313
-Hello, sir.
-Gosh, I'm dying.

261
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,693
We drank so much last night
because of the chief.

262
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,405
I couldn't sleep a wink
because my stomach hurt all night.

263
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,615
-Where's Ji-hyeok?
-He left early

264
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,534
saying he needs to investigate something.

265
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,870
Does he think this is a part-time job?
He always does whatever he wants.

266
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,497
Do-chang.

267
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,625
What are you going to do
about Lee Dae-cheol?

268
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,003
What about him?

269
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,840
-What do you mean?
-Yesterday, you said so yourself

270
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,926
that Lee Dae-cheol can't be the culprit
if the CCTV footage is real.

271
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,097
Violent Crimes Unit,
Woo Bong-sik speaking.

272
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,015
Prosecutor.

273
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,308
When did I say that?

274
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,353
I just said it's a possibility.

275
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,024
Don't we carry out investigations
based on possibilities?

276
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,817
I almost forgot.

277
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,070
We already settled this yesterday.
Why are you bringing this up again?

278
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,321
Oh, okay.

279
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,490
-Share it with everyone.
-Yes, he's here.

280
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,616
Do-chang.

281
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,619
It's Prosecutor Yang.
He wants to ask you about Park Gun-ho.

282
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,664
Yes, Kang Do-chang speaking.

283
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,083
Park Gun-ho's intention?

284
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,127
I'm not sure. But according to the press,

285
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,421
he did it to prove
Lee Dae-cheol's innocence.

286
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,507
What kind of evidence would he have?

287
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,802
Maybe he just…
I really don't know why he did that.

288
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,262
What?

289
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,264
You think he schemed it with Lee Eun-hye?

290
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,599
No, I think she just did

291
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,477
what Park Gun-ho told her to do.

292
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,312
What?

293
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,481
My gosh.

294
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,608
I told you I don't know.

295
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,235
How am I supposed to know
if he's crazy or not?

296
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,987
I'm not a doctor.

297
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,241
You guys took him,
so deal with it on your own.

298
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,535
I don't know!

299
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,204
Hey.

300
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,997
-How dare he order me around?
-Prosecutor?

301
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,791
-He's way younger than me.
-Hello?

302
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,667
Does he not have any manners?

303
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,169
He pisses me off so much.

304
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,713
Why won't this turn on? Darn it.

305
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,466
Hey!

306
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,636
Don't make me angrier.
Are you looking down on me, too?

307
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,555
Darn it. Come on.

308
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,932
Gosh, this is so darn annoying.

309
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,572
Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

310
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,743
Please help me so that the police
will carry out a reinvestigation.

311
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,287
Please. Please help me.

312
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,831
You all know it already.

313
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,291
My dad is a murderer,
and I'm the murderer's daughter.

314
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,376
Do you want me to cry?

315
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,295
Do you want me to cry and ask you
to forgive my dad for committing murder?

316
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,005
Or do you want me to die?

317
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,341
Do you want me to bite my tongue
and just kill myself?

318
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,479
Goodness.

319
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,278
Why is life so complicated?

320
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,488
You know the boys

321
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,408
respect you more than me, right?

322
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,953
Everything depends on what you say.

323
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,748
I know you hate embarrassing yourself.

324
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,251
But can you swallow your pride

325
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,503
just this once?

326
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,964
Think of Sim Dong-uk.

327
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,049
His career only just started.

328
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,388
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

329
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,060
I recently got a call
from a colleague of mine

330
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,898
working at Nambu Police Station
saying he got promoted.

331
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,525
I'm the only sergeant among my friends.

332
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,363
You know I might get promoted soon, right?

333
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,283
Please help me out.

334
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,079
Let's just pretend

335
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,207
nothing happened.

336
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,211
You guys can badmouth me behind my back.

337
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,505
But imagine how you'd feel
if you were still a sergeant at my age.

338
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,049
You guys might end up like me.

339
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,552
Don't think about it too much.
It's just life.

340
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,263
Let's go eat lunch. It's on me.

341
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,724
Why don't we have samgyetang?
We haven't had it in a while.

342
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,268
Let's go.

343
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,896
Come on. Do-chang's going to pay.

344
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
I'll buy you each
a shot of ginseng liquor.

345
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,068
That's normally on the house.

346
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,694
All right.

347
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,571
INCHEON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

348
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,792
CALL HISTORY

349
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,132
Yes, who is this?

350
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,760
Park Gun-ho, it's me.

351
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,303
Why did you call me?

352
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,598
Oh, did you see me on the news?

353
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,142
Don't worry.

354
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,813
I haven't told anyone
about what happened between us.

355
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,815
Why are you doing this?

356
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,858
Do you remember what you asked me to do

357
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,569
a long time ago?

358
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,782
You asked me to kill Lee Dae-cheol.

359
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,370
You told me he's going to die anyway
and promised to pay off my gambling debt.

360
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,832
I'd like to meet the guy

361
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,500
who gave the order.

362
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,836
Why? What for?

363
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,255
I need to ask him for financial help.

364
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,133
I can't help you with that.

365
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,099
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,019
I need to meet someone right now.
I'll call you next time.

367
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,986
I'm in front of the prosecutor's office.

368
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,446
Should I go back inside

369
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,657
and tell the prosecutor
that I forgot to tell him something?

370
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,410
Okay, fine.

371
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,663
I'll look into it and call you back.

372
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,128
Hello, I'm Jin Seo-kyung,
a reporter at Jeonghan Daily.

373
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,048
JEONGHAN DAILY
JIN SEO-KYUNG

374
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,925
Can we talk for a moment?

375
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
The police already announced

376
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,977
that I'm crazy.

377
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,730
Can you trust a madman for your article?

378
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,191
The police aren't always correct.

379
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,861
Come on. You're all on the same side.

380
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,864
Be honest with me.

381
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,617
You came here

382
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,161
because you want something
that's more provocative, right?

383
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,954
Then how about this?

384
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,375
Why don't you say
Lee Dae-cheol and I were a couple?

385
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,796
You can say
Lee Dae-cheol and I are actually gay,

386
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,632
and that's why
I keep saying he's innocent.

387
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,841
That sounds fun.

388
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,553
You're sure that he's innocent,
aren't you?

389
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,891
I could tell when I saw you
in front of the police station.

390
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,810
You were desperate

391
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,813
and you meant everything you said.

392
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,025
I'm guessing you felt really frustrated
and exhausted.

393
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,611
I've also felt that way before.

394
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,074
If you went through the stuff
I went through,

395
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,743
you would have gone
to the human rights commission first.

396
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,414
-This man is innocent.
-If that didn't work,

397
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,667
you would've asked for a reinvestigation.

398
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,836
-We don't know anything. Please leave.
-Go.

399
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,173
I bet you uploaded a petition
on the Blue House website.

400
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,010
Then you probably went to a lawyer
who deals with retrials.

401
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,011
Sir, please.

402
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,013
And I bet they asked you
for clear evidence.

403
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,682
-Sir, please listen to me.
-I'm busy.

404
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,392
I bet you were frustrated and exhausted.

405
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,605
Because you didn't have any evidence.
You just had faith in that person.

406
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,025
"Faith is being sure of what we hope for

407
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,028
and certain of what we do not see."

408
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,782
The person who framed Lee Dae-cheol
will soon come for me.

409
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,118
I'll call you.

410
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,379
ORDER OF EXECUTION

411
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,548
DATE: MARCH 2, 2020

412
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,675
LEE DAE-CHEOL, MURDER

413
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,433
Hey, come on!

414
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,978
Gosh, you suck.

415
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,396
Over here.

416
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,191
-Hey!
-Pass it over here.

417
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,317
Kick it properly.

418
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,484
-Okay.
-Let's go.

419
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,154
-Hey, are you kidding?
-Give me that.

420
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,363
You guys, come on.

421
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,531
Lee Dae-cheol.

422
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,742
Didn't you notice anything?

423
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,411
The prison guards are
suddenly acting differently.

424
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,872
They won't even look me in the eye.

425
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,499
I bet we're going to get hanged soon.

426
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,254
Are you scared?

427
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,591
You killed someone,
but you're scared to die?

428
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,218
I didn't kill anyone.

429
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,636
I didn't kill anyone either.

430
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,138
I didn't kill anyone.
I'm not a murderer like you.

431
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,767
The floor will open.

432
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,977
And bam!

433
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,856
Your neck bone will break,
and that will be the end of it.

434
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,233
But you see,

435
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,403
if you're unlucky,
your neck bone won't even break.

436
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,366
Then you'll just have to choke to death.

437
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,992
Slowly.

438
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,244
What are you doing?

439
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,873
What? We're just close. That's all.

440
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,750
Get away from him. Go over there.

441
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:49,464
I bet we'll shit ourselves either way.
Don't you think?

442
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,549
What are you doing? Get going already.

443
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,732
INCHEON JEIL INVESTMENT TRUST

444
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,529
-Make sure you record everything.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,289
First, let me talk about the issues
within the company.

446
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,166
We need to focus on our own abilities to…

447
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:33,842
Stand up.

448
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,306
Hey.

449
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,393
Do you go around badmouthing your parents?

450
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,229
I bet you thought I'd never know.

451
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,773
I see everything you upload
on social media.

452
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,235
I know that your mother has dementia.

453
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,157
And I even get updates about your wife
when she cheats on you.

454
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,450
Darn it.

455
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:11,463
Hey, if you want this,
I'll send it to you as a gift.

456
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,757
Make it go viral if you want.

457
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,260
Instead, I'll upload it
on your daughter's social media page.

458
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,431
Imagine how heartbroken she will be

459
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,933
once she sees her dad
getting dragged away like a dog.

460
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,810
She'd probably want to die.

461
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,937
I'm sorry, sir.

462
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,522
Hey!

463
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:34,110
Who do you think pays
for your daughter's tuition?

464
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,697
I even bought diapers for your mother!

465
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,491
You shouldn't do that.

466
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,127
You should've been careful not to fall.

467
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,010
Are you still a cop?

468
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,184
I heard you quit being a cop
after you got your inheritance.

469
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,812
Spending money

470
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,314
wasn't as fun as I thought it would be.

471
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,575
I recently got it at an auction.

472
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,370
It suits you. It looks like a nice watch.

473
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,788
Don't you remember?

474
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,834
Oh, that?

475
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,878
Why was that put up for auction?

476
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,131
Didn't you steal that from my dad?

477
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,341
Yes, that's right.

478
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,552
Are you here because of that watch?

479
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:45,056
This watch reminded me
of our good old days.

480
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,891
Back then…

481
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,688
I know it's in the past,
but I still don't get why you did that.

482
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,858
If you trusted me
and did what you were told to do,

483
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,193
you would've had a comfortable life.

484
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,321
Does it look like
I live an uncomfortable life?

485
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,450
You go around chasing others.
That can't be an easy life.

486
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,743
It's okay. It suits me.

487
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,453
I'm glad to hear that.

488
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,414
I was worried that you might not
be able to socialize properly

489
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,250
because of what you went through
when you were little.

490
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,044
I was actually worried about you.

491
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,547
Me? I'm doing fine.

492
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,967
I live doing whatever I want.

493
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,343
That's the problem.

494
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,473
You shouldn't be allowed to live that way.

495
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,640
You need a supervisor.

496
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,601
Or you don't know
what you'll end up doing.

497
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,188
It looks like you have
a twisted view of others

498
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,692
because you've been
chasing bad guys for too long.

499
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,819
Do you think it's because

500
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,031
you think of everyone
as the culprit who killed your father?

501
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,326
You're right.

502
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,370
That's why I can't sleep at night
if I fail to catch bad guys.

503
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,331
I only feel at ease once I catch them.

504
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,125
I'm not surprised.

505
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,377
But it must be really tiring

506
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,881
to live that way.

507
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,299
You should know how to have fun.

508
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,009
Why don't we go for a drink?

509
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,428
No, I'm not done with work.

510
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,888
I should go now.

511
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,933
Well, feel free to call me whenever.

512
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,770
We're cousins.
We should meet up every once in a while.

513
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,563
You'll see me often from now on.

514
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,617
Today is a bad day.

515
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,894
He hasn't changed at all.

516
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,523
-Come on!
-Let's go!

517
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,692
FEBRUARY 27 2019

518
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,946
-Die!
-What are you doing?

519
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,787
Lee Dae-cheol! Are you okay?

520
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,832
What did you do to him?

521
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,668
-Take him to the infirmary!
-Yes, sir.

522
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,338
I'll make sure
nothing unfair happens to you unfairly,

523
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,049
so trust me and tell me what happened.

524
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,725
I didn't want to live.

525
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,019
But…

526
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,898
I had no courage to kill myself. So…

527
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:45,236
So I purposely hit Mr. Park first.

528
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,323
So that he could kill me.

529
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,035
I wanted him to kill me.

530
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,959
You believed Lee Dae-cheol?

531
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,212
Shouldn't you have investigated
what happened?

532
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,299
Death-row convicts rarely lie.

533
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,678
You know what Park Gun-ho
did recently, right?

534
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,723
Yes, I saw the news.

535
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,392
Why do you think Park Gun-ho
went out of his way

536
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,394
to claim that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent?

537
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,481
I also get confused from time to time.

538
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,026
He's known to be very kind here,

539
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,279
so I wonder how he managed
to kill people so brutally.

540
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,285
Do you remember this video?

541
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,621
Come on if you want a fight.

542
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,624
What's the matter? Are you afraid

543
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,002
because Dae-cheol only killed two people
and I snuffed eleven?

544
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,170
Come on, you idiots.

545
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,588
Cho Byeong-gil was confident

546
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,674
that Lee Dae-cheol was beaten up
by the prison guard.

547
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,551
Park Gun-ho tried to kill Lee Dae-cheol,
didn't he?

548
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,806
Like he said, he killed 11 people.

549
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,976
Do you really think
Cho Byeong-gil is in his right mind?

550
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,521
You just told me
that death-row convicts don't lie.

551
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,232
Ms. Jin.

552
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,528
I only told you this much
because you promised

553
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,530
not to write an article
based on what I said.

554
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,200
Please don't make things difficult for me.

555
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,954
Okay, let's end it here.

556
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,580
Thank you.

557
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,210
Hello.

558
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,464
What would you like?

559
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,341
-One tall Americano, please.
-Okay.

560
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,097
Thank you.

561
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,438
-You can wait in your seat.
-Thank you.

562
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,647
No problem.

563
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,373
CAFE TASSION
JUNG YU-SEON

564
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,719
-Mr. Park.
-Yes, sir?

565
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,805
We need to be more attentive
of the accredited reporters.

566
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,224
Make sure everything's comfortable
in the pressroom.

567
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,103
Buy them drinks every now and then,
and give them some information.

568
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,481
The reporters should have
a positive image about us

569
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,649
in order for us to gain the trust
of our residents.

570
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,942
Okay, sir.

571
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,404
-And as for the Detective Division.
-Yes, sir?

572
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,157
Don't just focus on solving cases.

573
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,493
Human rights are more important
than catching culprits.

574
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,745
Your performance doesn't matter.

575
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,539
So tell everyone to stick
to the human rights regulations.

576
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,832
Okay, sir.

577
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,335
And Detective Kang Do-chang.

578
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,629
Yes, sir?

579
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,298
If things didn't go well
with the recent case,

580
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,884
it would've caused
a lot of misunderstandings.

581
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,968
Good work.

582
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,971
Thanks to you, things went very smoothly.

583
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,432
I didn't really do…

584
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,226
Don't be modest.

585
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,394
You deserve a compliment.

586
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,522
When I became

587
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,982
the chief,

588
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,194
I promised myself that I'll make sure
to do two things.

589
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,530
Number one.

590
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:22,120
I was determined to pick out
those who blame others for their faults.

591
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,164
And number two. I promised myself

592
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,919
to reward people
who contributed to doing the right thing.

593
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,215
That way, people will be
motivated to work hard.

594
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,845
Don't you agree, Detective Kang?

595
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,395
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir.

596
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,856
Do-chang,
I'd like to talk to you in private.

597
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,191
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

598
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,901
-Congratulations.
-Good work.

599
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,572
-Congratulations.
-Lucky you.

600
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,323
He's one lucky guy.

601
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,746
You're finally getting a little lucky.

602
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,540
It's hard to make

603
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,668
such a great achievement
prior to your promotion evaluation.

604
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,836
Well…

605
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,047
Everyone there will be evaluating you
regarding your promotion.

606
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,842
I said enough good things about you today.

607
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,969
So I'm sure they got the message.

608
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,221
Well, thank you, sir.

609
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,557
I'll give you a few days off.
Go take a break.

610
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,558
No, it's okay, sir.

611
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,352
The Civil Petition Division
brought up your name.

612
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,230
You know Yoon Sang-mi
raised an issue with you, right?

613
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,442
-Yes.
-It's best not to be around.

614
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,485
Go take a break.

615
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,571
I'll have everything taken care of.

616
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,200
So just go somewhere quiet
and enjoy fishing for a few days.

617
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,951
Okay?

618
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,871
-Yes, sir.
-You can go now.

619
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,960
Do-chang.

620
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,215
It's dangerous to overdo things
in this kind of situation.

621
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,966
Don't cross the line.

622
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:09,977
He's right.

623
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,313
I'm just a salaryman.

624
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,567
Let's just keep things simple and easy.

625
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,573
The Ministry of Justice officially issued

626
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,492
an order of execution.

627
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,494
This morning, the director of corrections

628
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,995
held a press conference

629
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,664
and announced that the order of execution

630
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,291
for 12 death-row convicts
including Cho Byeong-gil

631
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,002
was sent to each and every prison.

632
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,713
The death-row convicts
that will be executed include

633
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,175
Cho Byeong-gil, the man who went to prison
after killing 11 people 7 years ago,

634
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,012
Park In-seok, who shocked everyone
by murdering a baby,

635
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,933
and Yoo Jin-yong,
the man who killed his own father.

636
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,352
The Ministry of Justice announced
that the execution

637
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,230
will be carried out as scheduled…

638
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,650
There's no need to watch this.

639
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,859
It's none of our business.

640
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,946
And so what if death-row convicts
are getting executed?

641
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,240
It's totally normal. Don't you agree?

642
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,202
Hey, Ji-ung. Is Lee Dae-cheol on the list?

643
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,954
Yes, he's on the list.

644
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,163
Damn it.

645
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,249
Hey, guys.

646
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,671
I was given a few days off.

647
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,298
The chief told me to take a break.

648
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,800
I'll see you guys.

649
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,809
Come on, guys.

650
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,186
Now that you're all full,
get back to your jobs.

651
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,105
Get up, guys.

652
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,150
Let's go for a drink.

653
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,735
-What?
-Is there a problem?

654
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,029
Well…

655
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,739
Let me join you.

656
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,490
I was craving a drink as well.

657
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,828
Detective Sim.

658
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,372
Do you have what Detective Kang received
via email yesterday?

659
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,087
Keep going.

660
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,340
Move it.

661
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,884
Hurry up.

662
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,469
There you go.

663
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,180
-Come on.
-Let's move.

664
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,144
-Hurry up.
-Let's hurry.

665
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,732
Come on. Let's go.

666
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,858
Excuse me.

667
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,527
Can you spare me some time?

668
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,447
I already told everything
to the other detective.

669
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,698
-Other detective?
-Yes.

670
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,413
Keep going.

671
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,259
Do you have anything else to do
if you quit being a cop?

672
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,886
No.

673
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,930
That's why I came back.

674
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,265
Then stay out of it.

675
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,142
I just started working on it.
I can't leave.

676
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,980
Let's do this together.

677
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,982
Until the very end.

678
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,653
My gosh.

679
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,071
You lunatic.

680
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,786
What were you doing here acting all cool?

681
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,788
Tell me.

682
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,290
-Come on!
-Let's hurry!

683
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,419
Are you sure Detective Jang Jin-su
is the guy who received

684
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,045
the CCTV footage five years ago?

685
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,174
Yes, I'm sure.
I even saw his business card.

686
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,512
Then that means Detective Jang knew
that Lee Dae-cheol was innocent.

687
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,974
But why did he hide that?

688
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,852
Maybe he wanted to frame him
as the murderer.

689
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,229
Jin-su and I are friends.
He wouldn't do that.

690
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,776
Detective Jang used to be partners
with Captain Nam Guk-hyeon, right?

691
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,777
Nam Guk-hyeon?

692
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,113
If we ask him,
maybe we'll find the answer.

693
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,573
If he's the type to tell us,

694
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,324
he would've told me everything

695
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,201
when he gave me the case files
five years ago.

696
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,247
Hey, Ms. Jin.

697
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,291
What brings you here?

698
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,335
It looks like you also got the email
that I received.

699
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,549
Maybe it was Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae.

700
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,967
That's a possibility.

701
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,929
He's the guy who told you
that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

702
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:18,559
He had enough power to get his hands on
that kind of information five years ago.

703
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,769
Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae?

704
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,481
You mean the guy
who recently went to prison?

705
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,316
The woman sitting in front of you

706
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,985
is the person who dug up his dirt
and sent him to prison.

707
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,655
I met Park Gun-ho this morning.

708
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,073
He was released.

709
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,993
My gosh, already? Unbelievable.

710
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,329
Park Gun-ho really meant what he said.

711
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,164
He really thinks
Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

712
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,082
Don't believe him. He's a liar.

713
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,085
Two people keep claiming
that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

714
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,421
Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae
and Park Gun-ho.

715
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,924
And they both have nothing to gain

716
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,885
even if Lee Dae-cheol
turns out to be innocent.

717
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,347
On the other hand,
those who keep insisting he's guilty

718
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,683
obviously have a lot to lose
if Lee Dae-cheol turns out to be innocent.

719
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,896
Who do you think I should trust?

720
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,193
You know Lee Dae-cheol is included
on the execution list, right?

721
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,282
If Lee Dae-cheol is executed
despite being innocent,

722
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,578
you will end up feeling guilty
for the rest of your lives.

723
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,663
Why would we?

724
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,543
We can't let our emotions control us
if we want to do our jobs properly.

725
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,240
Why are you here alone?
What about the person I asked for?

726
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,825
He agreed to come earlier.

727
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,953
But I think he changed his mind.

728
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,123
He obviously wouldn't want to meet you.

729
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,917
-Who is it?
-Can't you just talk to me?

730
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,337
Just tell me how much you need.

731
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,006
Come on. Think about it.

732
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,343
Right now, your name is the only thing
I can tell the cops.

733
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,928
In other words,
no one will find out about him

734
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,056
if you disappear.

735
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,975
You need to show me who he is

736
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,353
for your own safety.

737
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,105
And that way,
I'll be able to ask for more money.

738
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,238
He's the culprit, isn't he?

739
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,575
Is that why he wanted me
to kill Lee Dae-cheol?

740
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,454
I'll try to convince him.

741
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,670
He already knows how rashly you can act.

742
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,755
So if I talk to him,
he'll get scared and show up.

743
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,252
Damn it.

744
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,245
You're not going to write
the article yet, right?

745
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,331
No, I need to be more careful.

746
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,790
Good.

747
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,585
We don't know for sure
that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

748
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,462
-Let's be cautious.
-Okay.

749
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,215
From now on, if you want to meet people
regarding this case,

750
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,425
you should discuss it with us beforehand.

751
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,343
Why?

752
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,136
If you talk to random people,

753
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,514
-it'll disturb our investigation.
-What?

754
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,849
Did you really have to say it like that?

755
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,977
-What he means is…
-You don't need to beat around the bush.

756
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,022
If I dig into this case,
it won't be any good for the police.

757
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,816
So you're telling me
not to interfere, right?

758
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,194
I'm saying your greed for an exclusive

759
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,988
will end up getting in the way
of our investigation.

760
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,658
Do you know why Park Gun-ho

761
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,118
did something so reckless
instead of trusting the police?

762
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,288
Because the police kept focusing on
what's good for them

763
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,333
instead of investigating the case
from the victim's perspective.

764
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,252
You obviously believe
what Park Gun-ho told you

765
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,505
because you're just a reporter
who's after an exclusive.

766
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:28,011
Park Gun-ho tried to murder Lee Dae-cheol
when he worked as a prison guard.

767
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,724
But Lee Dae-cheol kept it a secret.

768
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,395
That's when Park Gun-ho realized
that Lee Dae-cheol was telling the truth.

769
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,564
Why are you telling us that now?

770
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,608
We promised to tell each other everything.

771
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,362
Because there's someone I can't trust yet.

772
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,116
And that person really hates
having a reporter involved.

773
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,744
Hey, did you say something
to offend Ms. Jin?

774
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,543
-Hello, this is Jin Seo-kyung.
-I…

775
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,129
I met him.

776
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,297
I took a photo of him.

777
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,882
Hello? Mr. Park Gun-ho?

778
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,842
Is that you?

779
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,802
I have no time to talk.

780
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,763
-I'll send you a photo.
-Hello?

781
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,725
What's wrong?

782
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,268
Why did Park Gun-ho call you?

783
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,728
He told me

784
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,480
that he was going to meet
the real culprit.

785
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,191
He's going to send me
a photo of the culprit.

786
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,764
Didn't he say he'll send the photo
right away?

787
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,149
Isn't he picking up?

788
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,986
Do-chang, I found out
where Park Gun-ho made the call.

789
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,833
We're almost at the place
where he called you.

790
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,794
He's within a 1km radius.

791
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,712
We'll go there as soon as he calls.

792
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,592
I'm worried he might be
playing with us again.

793
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,386
Why isn't he sending her the photo?

794
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,846
Maybe he doesn't trust her yet.

795
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,935
It's either that,

796
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,479
or he had no time to send the photo.

797
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,472
Damn it.

798
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,936
Don't touch his body
until forensics gets here.

799
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,062
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

800
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,199
Ma'am.

801
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,660
Can we have a bottle of soju and cola?

802
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,953
Stop drinking.

803
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,788
Just give us a bottle of soda.

804
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,039
Detective Kang

805
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,126
took off, didn't he?

806
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,254
He got scared and ran away, right?

807
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,925
I slept two hours a day

808
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,512
and barely managed to pass
the police exam.

809
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,681
That's how I became a cop.

810
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,808
Hey, you're drunk. That's enough.

811
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,228
And when I saw Detective Kang,

812
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,525
I was so glad I studied so hard
to become a cop.

813
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,070
I was so proud that I became a cop.

814
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,990
I wanted to become just like…

815
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,493
My gosh.

816
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,371
My dream was to become
a good detective like him.

817
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,457
Damn it.

818
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,043
-Hey.
-Sorry, sir.

819
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,212
-My dream won't come true.
-Hey!

820
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,215
Stop crying. You're a detective
in the violent crimes unit.

821
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,593
I'm just worried
I might turn out like him.

822
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,387
-He needs to learn his manners.
-You darn punk.

823
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,639
-Hey!
-Hey, stop.

824
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,891
-Get to your senses!
-Ma'am, can we have a cola?

825
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,142
-Hey!
-That's enough.

826
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,560
Enough.

827
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,313
Let's call it a day. Everyone, get up.

828
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,442
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I'll pay for this, sir.

829
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,694
Cut the crap.

830
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,112
-Hey, Detective Oh.
-I have money.

831
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,991
Are you sure it's Park Gun-ho?

832
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,879
Do you see the wound on his left thigh?

833
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,300
-It's a stab wound.
-It means he was murdered.

834
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,345
By any chance,

835
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,640
do you know who the culprit is?

836
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,559
-The real culprit.
-What?

837
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,019
The real culprit
behind the Lee Dae-cheol's case.

838
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,481
Are you kidding me?

839
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,358
Why would you connect that with this?

840
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,653
Do you think I'd joke with you
in front of a dead man?

841
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,663
A REPORT ON THE PARK GUN-HO CASE

842
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,042
If you told us what Park Gun-ho told you,

843
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,587
we would've followed him.

844
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,675
Then he wouldn't have died?

845
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,635
Are you saying he died because of me?

846
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,595
No.

847
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,972
I'm saying we would've caught the culprit.

848
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,019
When someone gets killed,
the only person responsible

849
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,146
is the one who killed that person.

850
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,190
It's no one else's fault.

851
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,909
What's going on?

852
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,370
How did they find out about this?

853
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,582
I had to report it to the chief.
It's a murder case.

854
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,292
You darn punk.

855
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,216
Damn it.

856
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,345
I'm sorry.

857
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,014
But this is our case.

858
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,682
Stay out of it. It's the chief's orders.

859
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,977
Gosh, you're crossing the line.

860
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,605
We found the body, so stop talking crap.

861
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,315
-Hey, stop.
-What did you just say, punk?

862
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,360
Gosh, you're really pissing me off.

863
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,528
I'm not in your team.

864
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,113
We're Team Two.

865
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,074
I don't take orders from you.

866
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,868
You shouldn't disrespect people
who aren't in your team.

867
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,411
Just stay off the case, you punk.

868
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,372
Are you serious?

869
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,415
What if I don't?

870
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,502
-Just do as I say and leave.
-Step back.

871
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,921
-He reeks of alcohol.
-What's this?

872
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,715
You crazy punk.

873
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,634
Darn it.

874
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,428
You punk.

875
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,513
Why would you hit him?

876
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,306
Are you nuts?

877
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,724
You came to a murder scene drunk?

878
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,893
We didn't…

879
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,812
We drank because of you.

880
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,146
Leave the scene right now!

881
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,107
That's not the point right now.

882
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,234
You crazy punk! Leave!

883
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,902
-Get lost.
-That bastard.

884
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:41,903
Do-chang.

885
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,239
-You need to go on vacation.
-Leave.

886
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,200
-But look at what he's doing.
-You didn't have to hit us.

887
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,869
I want you to leave, Detective Choi.

888
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,997
Yes, you're right.

889
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,748
I should go on vacation.

890
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,583
Make sure you restrict the area.

891
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,961
Don't let anyone inside
apart from our team.

892
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,129
-Never.
-Okay, sir.

893
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,338
-Gosh.
-Do you understand?

894
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,506
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

895
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,801
Come here.

896
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,767
Ms. Jin.

897
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,325
Ms. Jin, what are you going to do now?

898
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,369
To be honest, this is a lot to handle.

899
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,539
I also feel like I should stay out of it.

900
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,461
Maybe I'm just hungry.
I'll feel better once I eat something.

901
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,130
What are you going to do, Detective Kang?

902
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,506
I should catch the culprit.

903
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,467
That's my job.

904
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,971
-What about you, Detective Oh?
-Should I drop you off at the cafe we met?

905
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,683
Yes, how kind of you.

906
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,315
Yes.

907
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,400
Oh, I see.

908
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,196
Okay, bye.

909
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,116
His cell phone is still in the area.

910
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,785
No one took his cell phone yet.

911
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,536
It was still on when you called, right?

912
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,579
Yes.

913
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,415
Park Gun-ho probably hid his cell phone

914
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,959
so that the culprit
wouldn't be able to find it.

915
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,253
When he called Ms. Jin,

916
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,798
he already knew he was in danger.

917
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,674
Normally, people ask for help.

918
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:30,386
But instead,
he told her he'd send her a photo.

919
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,431
He cared more about

920
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,309
revealing who the culprit is
than his own life.

921
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,898
Why did he try so hard
to prove Lee Dae-cheol's innocence

922
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,235
even by risking his own life?

923
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:07,590
RESTRICTED AREA

924
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,894
What floor are we on?

925
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,938
The fifth floor.

926
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:25,066
How many more stories are there?

927
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,318
-This is a 15-story building.
-Gosh.

928
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,280
If we turn on the flashlight,

929
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,324
those guys down there will see us, right?

930
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,702
Why don't we wait here
until the sun rises?

931
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,789
-Sit comfortably.
-I'm comfortable.

932
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,417
Lean on the wall.

933
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,755
Don't cross your legs.

934
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,925
What time is it?

935
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,261
It's 3:00 a.m.

936
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,054
Gosh, there's still a lot of time left.

937
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,891
Why did you take a leave of absence?

938
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,684
Were you sick of being a detective?

939
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,687
Didn't you say the job suits you?

940
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,522
-I came into some money.
-What?

941
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,150
Did you win the lottery?

942
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,278
-I received an inheritance.
-How much did you get?

943
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,281
A lot more than the lottery.

944
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,451
No wonder.

945
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:19,621
You have something to fall back on.

946
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,789
Then why are you working?

947
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,793
If I were you,
I'd go on trips and enjoy my life.

948
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,505
You have a family, right?

949
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,923
Yes, I do.

950
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,008
But unlike you,
there's no one who can give me money.

951
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,552
I just have kids

952
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,472
who are waiting with their mouths open
like a bunch of birds.

953
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,474
I don't have a family.

954
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,811
If I quit being a detective,

955
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,774
I'd have nothing left in my life
but money.

956
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,154
You're so full of it.

957
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,491
You talk too fancy.

958
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,536
What time is it?

959
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,163
It's 3:02 a.m.

960
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,957
It's only been two minutes?

961
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,671
Send the files to forensics.

962
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,339
Go there and explain the scene.

963
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,217
Tell them it could've been a nail
since he was at a construction site.

964
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,344
Explain properly
or they'll focus on the wrong thing.

965
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,470
Okay, sir.

966
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,347
Did you find anything else?

967
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,267
No, not really.
But there was no cell phone.

968
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,646
That's not a big deal.

969
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,648
Don't think of it too seriously.

970
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,776
But just in case,
I checked his most recent phone calls,

971
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,570
and it was made near the scene.

972
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,157
But someone had already checked
his call history before we did.

973
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,743
-Who?
-Detective Oh in Team Two.

974
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,299
Do-chang.

975
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,041
Why isn't Ji-hyeok answering his phone?

976
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,669
Did you notice anyone peculiar?

977
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,170
No, sir.

978
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,359
There's nothing here.

979
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,986
-Go upstairs.
-Okay, sir.

980
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,681
The chief prosecutor wishes to see me
one more time?

981
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,766
Why?

982
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,810
I don't know.

983
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,686
Why don't you ask him yourself?

984
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,064
Your father will be executed soon.

985
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:20,982
I'm going to check

986
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,276
why that keeps bothering me.

987
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,238
-You punk!
-I didn't kill the student either.

988
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,698
Why would I kill them?

989
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,784
I'm here to meet your boss.
Jo Seong-dae is inside, right?

990
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,743
Kill him!

991
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,748
I'm with the guy in the photo.

992
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,085
Please don't kill me.

993
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,754
Park Gun-ho wanted to tell us

994
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,173
to reinvestigate the case from here.

995
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,593
Once I start investigating,
I never give up

996
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,761
until the culprit gets locked up in jail.

997
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:57,435
