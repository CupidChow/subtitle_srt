1
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,580
Don't go.

2
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,433
Don't blame yourself.

3
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,729
You're not to blame for any of this.

4
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,025
It just

5
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,027
happened.

6
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,113
It just happened.

7
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,212
You have a scar on your neck.

8
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,339
I guess you had a little fight.

9
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,511
I guess I have no way out of this.

10
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,724
But how did you manage
to show up right at that moment?

11
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,060
He called you, didn't he?

12
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,022
He really is a smart jerk.

13
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,318
He was trying to frame me for murder.

14
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,406
Be honest with me.
You knew already, didn't you?

15
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,033
Am I wrong?

16
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,495
SEOBU POLICE STATION

17
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,210
The NFS gave us
an autopsy report of the victim.

18
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,337
And they found the DNA of the suspect,

19
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:56,134
on the victim's clothes and fingernails
when he was arrested at the scene.

20
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,635
Did the suspect plead guilty?

21
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,971
No, he hasn't pleaded guilty yet.

22
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,390
Do the police think
the victim was murdered?

23
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,311
We're still investigating the case,
so we can't tell you anything in detail.

24
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,063
You haven't mentioned anything
regarding his motive for murder.

25
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,525
We still haven't found any clear evidence
to prove the victim was murdered--

26
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,777
You arrested the suspect
at the scene of the incident.

27
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,405
Isn't that enough
to think of him as the culprit?

28
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,824
Plus, we all know his motive for murder.

29
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,911
Mr. Yoo wrote an article
that put the suspect at a disadvantage,

30
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,330
and that's obviously why he murdered him.

31
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,542
It's too early for us
to jump to conclusions--

32
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,920
Yoo Jeong-seok was our senior reporter.

33
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,632
A reporter got killed
because of an article he wrote.

34
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,634
That's a fact.

35
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,637
If you don't acknowledge that,
we will have to question the possibility

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,891
that there might have been
an external intervention.

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,357
My lawyer called after he read
all the articles about me.

38
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,777
I heard all the reporters
have gathered together

39
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,987
to accuse me for murder.

40
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,366
That's exactly what Yoo Jeong-seok wanted.

41
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,244
"Do not remember me as a murderer.

42
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,457
Remember me as a conscientious reporter
who got killed by a murderer."

43
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,794
If Yoo Jeong-seok
really did commit suicide,

44
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,005
why were your DNA found on his fingernails

45
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,133
and your footprints on his suit?

46
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,260
How will you explain that?

47
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,139
Is this how you framed
Lee Dae-cheol for murder?

48
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,393
Do-chang.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,690
How dare you say Lee Dae-cheol's name?

50
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,527
Don't you remember
what you did to him, you disgusting jerk?

51
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,786
I forgive you for hitting me just now.

52
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,832
That is,

53
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,629
if you admit that you hit me
out of utter hatred.

54
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,923
That's what this is.

55
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,553
You hate me for what I did
to Lee Dae-cheol, don't you?

56
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,098
That's why you're doing everything you can
to get me locked up in jail.

57
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,599
Right?

58
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,192
Did Oh Jong-tae plead guilty?

59
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,862
No, of course not.
He'll never plead guilty.

60
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,488
Exactly.

61
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,574
What is he trying to prove?

62
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,659
That he didn't kill him.
He says he killed himself.

63
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,827
But it makes no sense.

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,122
Who calls the cops and puts on a show
before they commit suicide?

65
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,665
Have you ever seen anyone do that?

66
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,835
Weren't there any CCTVs
or dashcams nearby?

67
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,171
No, we couldn't find any direct footage.

68
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,674
-Did you find anything else?
-Based on what we have, he was murdered.

69
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,428
My goodness. Then let's think of this

70
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,055
as a murder case for now.

71
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,640
But it's also possible
that he might've killed himself.

72
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,267
So let's also investigate that.

73
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,518
If we can't find anything,

74
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,438
let's go ahead and hand him over
to the prosecution.

75
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,649
The reporters are
seriously driving me crazy.

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,071
What? What did you say?

77
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,907
I heard you say something.

78
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,746
I AM A MURDERER

79
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,348
By any chance, did the other reporters
experience any kind of disadvantages

80
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,228
due to the recent happenings
regarding Jeong-seok?

81
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,313
No, not at all.

82
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,815
I'm relieved to hear that.

83
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,278
You must've been
very disappointed in Jeong-seok.

84
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,904
I know how much

85
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,533
you trusted him and relied on him.

86
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:35,371
Mr. Yoo took care of everything
before he left.

87
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,918
And in that sense,
he lived up to his reputation.

88
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,136
Did he happen to say anything to you
before he died?

89
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,557
He told me he had to take responsibility
for something.

90
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,353
So that's what it was.

91
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,274
He just wanted to take responsibility

92
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,861
for the mess he had caused.

93
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,574
I AM A MURDERER

94
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,164
Are you going to go home or not?

95
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,665
Should I go first?

96
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,335
Yoo Jeong-seok probably knew

97
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,464
that Jong-tae wouldn't get punished
for Lee Dae-cheol's death, right?

98
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,510
If he gets accused of murder
in addition to his incitement of murder,

99
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,429
Jong-tae will receive a maximum penalty.

100
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,182
What if that's what Yoo Jeong-seok wanted?

101
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,391
What's your point?

102
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,395
Are you saying Yoo Jeong-seok
purposely framed Oh Jong-tae

103
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,564
and made it seem like he committed murder?

104
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,318
It could have been his way
of apologizing to Lee Dae-cheol--

105
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,611
Hey.

106
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,031
Do you really think Yoo Jeong-seok
had enough conscience to do that?

107
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,909
He killed two people,

108
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,829
and he came up with all sorts of schemes
to get Lee Dae-cheol executed.

109
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,332
You actually think

110
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,001
he wanted to atone for his sins
now that things rose to the surface?

111
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,298
Yoo Jeong-seok is no better
than Oh Jong-tae.

112
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,968
There's no reason for us
to make a hero of him

113
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,094
just because he's dead.

114
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,347
Okay, I get what you mean.

115
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,557
If he wanted to apologize,

116
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,767
he should've done it
before Lee Dae-cheol got executed.

117
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,978
You can go home first.

118
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,355
I'm going to call Ms. Jin
and meet up with her.

119
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,232
She was the last person
Yoo Jeong-seok called,

120
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,110
so I should meet her
and ask her what he said.

121
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,658
If…

122
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,160
If, by any chance,

123
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,414
it turns out that Yoo Jeong-seok

124
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,167
really did fabricate his death on purpose,

125
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,711
I'm going to turn a blind eye

126
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,838
and go along with his plan.

127
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,424
I'm going to play along with it.

128
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,010
You can criticize me
for not being a good detective.

129
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,346
But you can't criticize me
for being human.

130
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,445
I wanted to confirm something with you

131
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,241
before we hand over the case
to the prosecution tomorrow.

132
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,911
What's your question?

133
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,331
Why do you think Mr. Yoo died?

134
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,917
Why are you asking me that?

135
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,296
He told you he felt like he was in danger
right before he died.

136
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,925
Why do you think he met Jong-tae
even though he felt that way?

137
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,970
I feel like he might've given you a hint.

138
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,683
He told me that if he ever dies,
I should investigate it as a murder case.

139
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,353
-Anything else?
-I think he was going to

140
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,271
convince Oh Jong-tae to turn himself in.

141
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,068
In order to fulfill his duty
as a reporter,

142
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,488
he confessed his sins through his article.

143
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,742
And in order to prove
Lee Dae-cheol's innocence,

144
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,328
he met up with Jong-tae

145
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,789
and asked him to turn himself in,
but he failed.

146
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,584
Then he got into a physical fight
and ended up getting killed by Jong-tae.

147
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,629
I guess those are the facts.

148
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,173
Is that what you really think?

149
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,513
Ms. Jin, what if the actual truth

150
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,392
is in favor of the bad guy?

151
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,936
Would it still be necessary
to reveal the truth?

152
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,367
Don't rely on alcohol too much.

153
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,661
Instead of alcohol,

154
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,666
you should just believe in yourself.

155
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,711
I'll contact you again. Thanks.

156
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,190
Due to the recent article
written by the late Yoo Jeong-seok

157
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,151
regarding the past murders he committed,

158
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,611
more and more people are
starting to bring into question

159
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,281
the validity of Lee Dae-cheol's execution.

160
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,659
Many people are uploading online petitions
asking the Blue House

161
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,745
and the Ministry of Justice
to clear his name and find the culprit.

162
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,292
Many people are also
starting to raise an issue

163
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,377
with our legal system.

164
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,548
A source from the Ministry of Justice
claims they are discussing ways

165
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,427
to acknowledge Lee Dae-cheol's innocence
and compensate his family.

166
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:46,015
An employee at a food company,
who got fired for abusing his power,

167
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,517
filed a lawsuit against the company
for firing him…

168
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,562
Mr. Kang, thank you
for keeping your promise.

169
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,022
Eun-hye.

170
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,859
Promise me one more thing.

171
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,528
Promise me

172
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,323
that you'll live for yourself from now on.

173
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,619
Live only for yourself.

174
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,788
Then I also want you
to promise me something.

175
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,626
From now on, stop feeling guilty
toward me and my dad.

176
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,421
Just live for yourself.

177
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:36,899
Aren't you guys embarrassed?
Don't you guys have a guilty conscience?

178
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,734
What a brazen jerk.

179
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,238
There's no use in fighting it.
You're done now, you punk.

180
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,990
-Take him.
-My gosh.

181
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,333
Our job is done now.

182
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,752
Let's go back to our old jobs.

183
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,420
The convenience store got robbed again.

184
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,047
We'll be done for if we lose him again.

185
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,507
Do you understand?

186
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,800
Answer me!

187
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,218
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

188
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,681
Hey, you met Ms. Jin yesterday, right?

189
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,640
What did she say?

190
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,810
Did she say anything strange?

191
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,603
No, she didn't tell me much.

192
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,565
You'd better not get any funny ideas.

193
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,985
We put aside our personal feelings
and just did our best.

194
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,198
I wonder what
Jong-tae is thinking right now.

195
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,368
He's probably thinking of a way
to get himself out of this.

196
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:35,124
I bet this is going to remind him
of Lee Dae-cheol a lot.

197
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,085
INCHEON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

198
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,882
You didn't kill Yoo Jeong-seok?

199
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,842
He committed suicide?

200
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,302
Yes.

201
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,847
Didn't you also get accused
of inciting Park Gun-ho's murder?

202
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,308
-Yes, I did.
-You'll get a heavy sentence

203
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,226
with those cases put together.

204
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,354
I'll be honest with you. It won't be easy
to get acquitted for both cases.

205
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,482
On top of that,
the judge who's in charge of your trial

206
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,860
is very sensitive
when it comes to the public sentiment.

207
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,529
So why don't you at least admit to one?

208
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,573
Are you asking me to compromise?

209
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,742
No, not exactly.

210
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,203
If you truly believe you're innocent,
you should keep saying so.

211
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,749
This is quite ironic.

212
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,544
I unintentionally ended up helping you out
during Lee Dae-cheol's retrial,

213
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,921
but things are different now.

214
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,258
Why don't you be consistent
and try to help me out again?

215
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,302
Don't bother changing your stance.

216
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,429
I would if I could.

217
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,390
But my superiors won't like it.

218
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,394
What brings you here, sir?

219
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,066
-I got curious, so I dropped by.
-I see.

220
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,151
Is he the suspect in this case?

221
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,694
Yes, sir.

222
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,281
Don't think it's better for you
to keep denying things.

223
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,744
You need to compromise
and admit a few things

224
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,788
if you want your trial to go well.

225
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,165
-I'll be off now.
-Bye, sir.

226
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,249
Sir.

227
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,836
Are you back as the chief prosecutor
for the Incheon District?

228
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,047
Yes, why do you ask?

229
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,675
Should I be glad

230
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,719
that you're back as the Chief Prosecutor?

231
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,683
Have we ever met?

232
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,019
I don't ever recall meeting you before.

233
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,357
Am I the one who's mistaken?

234
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,652
Sang-il, you'd better do your best.

235
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,404
It's my first case since I've returned.

236
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,114
I'm expecting a lot from you.

237
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,281
Don't worry, sir.

238
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,422
Just for your information,

239
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,092
the chief prosecutor
and the victim, Yoo Jeong-seok,

240
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,927
grew up in the same hometown.

241
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,723
You're quite unlucky this time.

242
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,067
The night before Jeong-seok died,
he asked me to meet.

243
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,653
He had something to tell me.

244
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,031
Why you?

245
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,075
He knew I was going to be reinstated
as the chief prosecutor in Incheon.

246
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,535
And?

247
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,954
What did Jeong-seok say to you?

248
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,249
I'm writing an article right now.

249
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,629
I plan to expose everything
Oh Jong-tae did in that article.

250
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,090
Do you remember what you said

251
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,801
to me and Ms. Jin
at that church last time?

252
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,306
Hey, I told you I had no choice
but to say that in that situation.

253
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,809
The point is, things don't make sense
if I leave you out of the story.

254
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,854
Jeong-seok, why would you--

255
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm also going to write
that I killed Jo Seong-gi and Jang Jin-su.

256
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,358
What?

257
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,072
If you don't tell anyone,
there won't be an investigation.

258
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,324
All you need to do is keep quiet about it.

259
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,117
Why in the world would you confess?

260
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,746
I've been meaning to confess
for a long time.

261
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't want my past to haunt me anymore.

262
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,461
It's my choice,
so I hope you respect my decision.

263
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,798
You haven't handed over the article yet,
have you?

264
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,549
You should reconsider.

265
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,010
You need to think about
your future as well as your brother's.

266
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,346
When you're reinstated
as the chief prosecutor,

267
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,933
I want you to focus on making sure
Oh Jong-tae pays for his sins.

268
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,267
Make things up if you have to.

269
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,521
Why? Why do you need to do this?

270
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,981
You'll find out later

271
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,275
why I had to attack Oh Jong-tae.

272
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,486
Why are you doing this?

273
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,863
I'll leave your name out of the article.

274
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,741
That's what you'll get in return.

275
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,036
Have you discussed this with Jeong-ryeol?

276
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,539
Jeong-ryeol

277
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,333
will understand even if I don't tell him.

278
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,963
He knows me better than anyone.

279
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,265
LATE YOO JEONG-SEON

280
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,516
Jeong-ryeol will also know

281
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,560
where I would want to be

282
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,604
once this is all over.

283
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,022
LATE YOO JEONG-SEOK

284
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,539
What's going on?

285
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,916
The Minister of Justice, Yoo Jeong-ryeol,

286
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,670
is going to make a public statement
regarding what happened to his brother.

287
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,801
MINISTER YOO'S STATEMENT
REGARDING HIS BROTHER'S DEATH

288
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,014
Hello, I am Yoo Jeong-ryeol,
the Minister of Justice.

289
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,309
The recent incident regarding
Yoo Jeong-seok

290
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:50,522
left me and my family
extremely heartbroken.

291
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,733
As the Minister of Justice,

292
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,903
I sincerely apologize
for having shocked the citizens

293
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,322
due to the issue regarding my family.

294
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,450
He should've let us
do an exclusive interview.

295
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,743
Be quiet.

296
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,246
My brother, Yoo Jeong-seok,
was a murderer.

297
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:12,169
Whatever the reason,
it is unforgivable to kill another person.

298
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,795
And I also feel

299
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,301
extremely responsible for the crime
that my brother has committed.

300
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,553
So in order to take responsibility,

301
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,599
I will be resigning from my position
as of today.

302
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,360
Oh Jong-tae and his lawyer
keep saying the victim committed suicide.

303
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,986
What do you think?

304
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,405
I don't think we can just ignore
that possibility.

305
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,448
It's not easy, sir.

306
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,787
You're good at making things up.

307
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,414
Isn't that what kept you going?

308
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,299
Your motive for inciting
Park Gun-ho's murder is pretty clear.

309
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,844
But this was already dealt with
during the retrial.

310
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,348
We can't use any of the evidence we found
regarding Yoon Ji-seon's death.

311
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,061
The Minister of Justice had to step down
because of what his brother did.

312
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,731
So the judge will make sure
you get punished for what happened.

313
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,318
I personally think it'll be easier
to deal with Yoo Jeong-seok's case

314
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,405
rather than the incitement
of Park Gun-ho's murder.

315
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,740
Gosh, you really have a way
of complicating things.

316
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,701
I didn't kill Yoo Jeong-seok.

317
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,037
If you take a close look at what happened,

318
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,331
it'll be pretty easy to understand.

319
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,125
Just think about it.

320
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,585
That's all I can tell you.

321
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,256
By the way, Mr. Oh,

322
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,676
the death penalty
hasn't gotten abolished yet.

323
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,177
Keep that in mind.

324
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,558
I thought you wouldn't come, but you did.

325
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:50,892
Thank you.

326
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,605
Ms. Jin, I know I haven't
known you for a long time.

327
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,402
But I feel like you're someone
who always tries to focus on the truth.

328
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,737
I was.

329
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,449
That's why I tried so hard to prove
that you're the real culprit.

330
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,284
You really are clever.

331
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,910
You know

332
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,413
what kind of person
Yoo Jeong-seok was, right?

333
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,291
He was an incredible man.

334
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,421
So you must understand why he had to make

335
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,882
such a terrible choice.

336
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,011
If you know the truth,
you should write an article about it.

337
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,514
It's the least you can do
for Yoo Jeong-seok.

338
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,061
He even sacrificed his own life
to have me taken to court.

339
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,688
But if the case gets closed

340
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,524
as a murder case,

341
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,235
who will ever hear about
his virtuous intentions?

342
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,946
Shouldn't you reveal that to the world?

343
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,783
As a reporter, you must reveal the truth.

344
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,995
If you don't speak up about what you know,

345
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,707
you'll live in regret
for the rest of your life.

346
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,169
Thank you. I was actually contemplating.

347
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,130
I almost ended up living in regret.

348
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,298
Exactly.

349
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,509
A reporter's duty is to reveal the truth.

350
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,347
I just realized

351
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,350
that the truth might end up
ruining my life.

352
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:19,606
If I decided to help you,
I would have regretted it forever.

353
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,069
So you need to become a murderer
for my own sake.

354
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,198
You're pretty much admitting
that you're Yoo Jeong-seok's accomplice.

355
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,533
I don't care.

356
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,953
I just chose a more comfortable path.

357
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,704
I'm going to stay quiet about what I know.

358
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,208
Just like how you didn't say anything
even though you knew

359
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,293
Lee Dae-cheol was going to get executed

360
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,795
for what you did.

361
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,219
Detective Kang, you're not very fond of me

362
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,138
because of Lee Dae-cheol's retrial,
are you?

363
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,764
Obviously.

364
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,391
You're very honest.

365
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,185
You put in a lot of work in that retrial.

366
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,480
So I'm sure Oh Jong-tae
will get punished this time.

367
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,232
That has nothing to do with this case.

368
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,609
We did our best to stay objective.

369
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,115
To be honest, there's not enough evidence
to prove Yoo Jeong-seok was murdered.

370
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,743
I need you guys to find
more concrete evidence.

371
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,412
Then we can get Oh Jong-tae locked up.

372
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,375
You want to win this trial, right?

373
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,920
-Yes, of course.
-Then you should admit

374
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,923
that you were wrong about Lee Dae-cheol
during his retrial.

375
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,426
Then we can win this case.

376
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,761
What exactly do you want me to admit?

377
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,431
You know Lee Dae-cheol was innocent.

378
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,558
If you confess that in court,

379
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,477
we can get Oh Jong-tae locked up.

380
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,315
What good will that do for me?

381
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,025
You will become a conscientious prosecutor

382
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,152
and win the trial.

383
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,487
"A conscientious prosecutor"?

384
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,951
It's not bad.

385
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,945
This is a dashcam footage

386
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,990
of Yoo Jeong-seok
killing Jo Seong-gi and Jang Jin-su.

387
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,786
Your Honor, this is Oh Jong-tae's trial.

388
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,204
That footage is irrelevant.

389
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,415
Why are you showing us this footage?

390
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,920
My client received this footage
right before Yoo Jeong-seok died.

391
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,840
My client sent this to Yoo Jeong-seok
as soon as he received it

392
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,510
hoping he'd repent and turn himself in.

393
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,596
-Your Honor, this is--
-Please continue.

394
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,601
After Yoo Jeong-seok saw this,
he asked Mr. Oh to meet.

395
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,855
You can confirm that
by checking my client's call logs.

396
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,524
And just for your information,

397
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,151
the police haven't managed
to get their hands on this footage yet.

398
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,284
Why did the defendant keep it to himself?

399
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,204
That's because he thought
the brutal footage

400
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,082
might defame the victim's character.

401
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,213
On the day of the incident, Yoo Jeong-seok
asked my client to get rid of the footage.

402
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,549
However, my client refused.

403
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,884
The reason they had
a physical fight that day

404
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,512
was because Yoo Jeong-seok
tried to take the footage from my client

405
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:41,474
while my client was persistent
about revealing the truth.

406
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,062
In the end, Yoo Jeong-seok realized
that there was no way to change his mind

407
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,649
and fell into despair.
So he decided to commit suicide.

408
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,910
Witness.

409
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,749
You kept chasing the culprit
after Lee Dae-cheol got executed, right?

410
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,711
And right now,
you're in charge of the defendant's case.

411
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,628
Yes.

412
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,299
As the detective
who investigated this case,

413
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,010
what's your opinion
on the defendant's assertion

414
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,762
saying the victim committed suicide?

415
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,483
Oh Jong-tae killed Yoon Ji-seon.

416
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,446
Then he bribed the detective in charge
to fabricate the case.

417
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,992
After he incited Park Gun-ho's murder,

418
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,412
he bribed the detective in charge again

419
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,374
and fabricated his death as suicide.

420
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:54,130
That's already been confirmed
based on the evidence we handed in.

421
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,466
Oh Jong-tae evaded the law

422
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,220
by fabricating evidence
and bribing people.

423
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,431
And this time, he claims
that the victim committed suicide.

424
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:09,020
If we get fooled by Oh Jong-tae again,

425
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,982
that would be like
killing Lee Dae-cheol again

426
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,902
even after his wrongful execution.

427
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,824
Thank you.

428
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,039
I was the prosecutor in charge
of Lee Dae-cheol's retrial.

429
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,838
If the prosecutor
who got Lee Dae-cheol executed

430
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,548
acknowledges that he was innocent

431
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,260
and tells you that the defendant
fabricated the case,

432
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,930
that would definitely taint my career.

433
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:48,017
However, I will stick to my conscience
as a prosecutor

434
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,603
and dare tell you the truth.

435
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,230
Lee Dae-cheol was innocent.

436
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,695
And the real culprit, Oh Jong-tae,
fabricated everything from behind.

437
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,914
Send me the tip-off via email
and leave a number.

438
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,584
Then I'll look over it
and give you a call.

439
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,668
Bye.

440
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,296
Isn't Oh Jong-tae's final trial today?

441
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,839
Yes, Legal Affairs went there.

442
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,300
Shouldn't you be the one
writing the article?

443
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,552
No one knows about it better than you do.

444
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,345
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,599
I don't think I can write it this time.

446
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,643
Okay. I understand.

447
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,567
Suspicions of having incited
Park Gun-ho's murder.

448
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,320
Guilty.

449
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,697
Suspicions of having murdered
Yoo Jeong-seok.

450
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,615
Guilty.

451
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:49,329
I hereby sentence Oh Jong-tae
to life imprisonment.

452
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,223
No one here has the right to condemn me.

453
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,018
You're all the same people.

454
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,486
Okay, good work.

455
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,825
Attention, everyone!

456
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,619
He was found guilty for everything.

457
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,996
Oh Jong-tae got sentenced
to life imprisonment.

458
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,544
Nice.

459
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,880
We have one bottle left.

460
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,008
Hey.

461
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,888
Would you like a drink?

462
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,723
-No, I'm good.
-Have a drink.

463
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,518
-No?
-No, I'm fine.

464
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,812
Why do you keep soju at the office?

465
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,984
For some weird reason, I feel empty
every time I'm done with a case.

466
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,363
I can only go home
after I drink a bottle of soju.

467
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,575
Back in my prime,
I used to drink four to five bottles.

468
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,910
But we didn't have much
to celebrate lately,

469
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,412
so there aren't a lot stacked up.

470
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,709
Do-chang.

471
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,044
-Yes?
-There's one thing I want to know.

472
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,298
What is it?

473
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,260
I get really nervous
every time you have a question for me.

474
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,053
What? What is it?

475
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,601
You saw that footage in court.

476
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,685
What about that?

477
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,021
It proves that Yoo Jeong-seok
is the murderer.

478
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,230
There's nothing more to it.

479
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,567
Where do you think

480
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,446
-he got that from?
-Gosh, forget it.

481
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,407
I'm done now.
Once I'm done with this bottle,

482
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,285
I'm going to forget about the case.
I'm totally done.

483
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,643
What are you doing here?

484
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,019
Are you here to see your mom?

485
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,231
That's too bad. She left to find a job.

486
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,816
Should I ask her to come home early?

487
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,277
No, I'll just go.

488
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,822
Jae-ung.

489
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,367
Why didn't you go to school?

490
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,038
You can't skip school.
Your mom will be upset.

491
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,083
Our class went on a picnic today.

492
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,710
But I didn't go because I didn't want to.

493
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,421
Why? Are you sick?

494
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,131
Why didn't you go?

495
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,717
I'm not sick.

496
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,512
I just didn't want to go.

497
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,513
I see.

498
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,891
Then do you want to spend time with me?

499
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,148
-Did you tell your dad?
-No.

500
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,400
What if he finds out?

501
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,237
I'll take you home after you finish that.

502
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,572
He'll throw a fit if he finds out
you skipped school.

503
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,075
-I don't need to go home.
-Why not?

504
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,537
My dad and his girlfriend aren't at home.
They haven't come home in a while.

505
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,540
Did they go on a trip without you?

506
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,085
Tell me.

507
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,337
Why don't they come home?

508
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,258
His girlfriend gave birth to a baby.

509
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,095
The baby is too little,
so they need to be there for the baby.

510
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,932
I guess they're
at the postnatal care center.

511
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,560
Does that mean you sleep at home
all by yourself?

512
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,729
Unbelievable.

513
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,566
Then I guess your dad didn't know
about today's picnic.

514
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,027
You didn't want to go
because you didn't bring anything.

515
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,863
My dad's just busy because of the baby.

516
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,199
It's not that he doesn't like me.

517
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,785
Jae-ung.

518
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,706
Then why don't we spend time together
until really late?

519
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,584
I was actually really bored these days
because no one spent time with me.

520
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,258
AUTOPSY REPORT

521
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,011
PROSECUTOR'S NOTE

522
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,930
A STAB WOUND WAS FOUND ON HIS ABDOMEN

523
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,651
Hello, this is Detective Oh Ji-hyeok.

524
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,571
We recently investigated
a burned down van together.

525
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,573
-Hello?
-Yes, hello.

526
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,116
I called to ask you a favor.

527
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,785
Okay, got it.

528
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,954
The convenience store thief
is at a PC cafe by the intersection.

529
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,248
-What?
-Let's go.

530
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,416
Let's go catch that thief.

531
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,876
-Okay.
-Hurry. Go.

532
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,170
Call me as soon as you're done.

533
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,129
Okay, bye.

534
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,964
Get going.

535
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,966
Focus, okay? Focus!

536
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,848
Hey.

537
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,436
-You have Jae-ung, don't you?
-What are you talking about?

538
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,814
He's with you, isn't he?
You'd better not lie to me.

539
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,607
I won't turn a blind eye this time.

540
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,776
I'll have you locked up in jail.

541
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,778
What's wrong? Did Jae-ung disappear?

542
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,905
Stop pretending like you don't know.
Where is he?

543
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,324
That's what I want to know.
What happened to him?

544
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,369
I got a call from his school

545
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,579
saying he didn't show up
to the picnic today.

546
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,749
Where else would he go?
He came to see you, didn't he?

547
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,418
Did you call the judo dojo he goes to?

548
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,422
Hey, how do you know
that he's been going to a dojo?

549
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,801
You met him, didn't you?

550
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,220
-You met him, right?
-That's not the problem.

551
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,013
Jae-ung has a cell phone.
Did you call him?

552
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,560
-What?
-Well…

553
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,937
I got rid of it
because he kept playing games.

554
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,024
Then did you try
calling his friends' parents?

555
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,443
How would I know their phone numbers?

556
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,239
What about this morning?

557
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,533
He would've told you
that he's going on a picnic today.

558
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,201
Did you scold him?

559
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:06,455
Hey, listen. I found out about the picnic
when I got a call from his school.

560
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,583
You didn't know
that he was going on a picnic today?

561
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,878
Then I'm guessing you didn't
pack anything for him.

562
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,548
You made him go there empty-handed,
didn't you?

563
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,884
Why do you care?

564
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,761
Jae-ung is my kid.

565
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,930
Don't tell me how to raise him.

566
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,640
I'll raise him using my own ways…

567
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,899
I think you broke my arm.

568
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,152
How can you call yourself a dad?

569
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,821
You think you deserve to be his dad?

570
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,948
Hey, wait. My gosh.

571
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,492
Did you meet the owner of the car?

572
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,870
Oh, really?

573
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,290
Does he still have the memory card
from his dashcam?

574
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,627
Does he remember
who he gave the memory card to?

575
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,420
-Stop!
-Hey!

576
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,838
Oh, it was a detective?

577
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,302
Does he remember
the name of that detective?

578
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,512
-Stay still, you punk.
-I see.

579
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,267
Then I'll send you a photo.

580
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,978
Can you ask the car owner if he knows him?

581
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,605
-My gosh!
-It's in my cell phone,

582
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,774
so I'll send it to you right away. Bye.

583
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,238
Who are you calling during work hours?

584
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,366
Who do you think killed Detective Jang?

585
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,117
Are you still worried about that?

586
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,495
Will you please let it go already?

587
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,705
You really are unbelievable.

588
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,208
Hello?

589
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,085
So what?

590
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,589
What did you do to your ex-husband?

591
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,057
Hey, wait out here for a moment.

592
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,100
Let me go with you.

593
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,603
Who knows what you might do
to your ex-brother-in-law again?

594
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,106
My gosh.

595
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,283
I seriously thought of calling the cops,

596
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,327
but I told her to call you instead.

597
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,871
I'll let her off the hook one last time.

598
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,458
Instead, don't file for custody.

599
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,087
And please stop giving me a headache.

600
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,422
What's the matter?

601
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,382
Jae-ung disappeared.

602
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,509
It's all because he took his cell phone!

603
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,971
Then shouldn't we look for Jae-ung first?

604
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,765
Eun-hye called me earlier.
It turns out he was with her.

605
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,767
They're on their way home.

606
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,730
Imagine how shocked she must've been
when she heard her son disappeared.

607
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,150
-Just--
-I don't care about any of that.

608
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,445
I've had enough of this.
I really want this relationship to stop.

609
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,492
-Jae-ung.
-Hey!

610
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,827
What are you doing?

611
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,706
You're violating the restraining order!

612
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,710
Jae-ung, come here.

613
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,590
You punk.

614
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,759
Are you sorry or not?

615
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,802
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,847
Did you meet your mom or not?

617
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,100
How does she know
that you go to a judo dojo?

618
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,560
Did you meet her or not?

619
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,770
We didn't meet.

620
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,357
My friend runs that dojo,
so he called and told me about it.

621
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,983
Did you meet her or not?

622
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,194
If you lie to me, I'll have you grounded.

623
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,237
We met.

624
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,615
Jae-ung, when did we meet?

625
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,700
She came

626
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,078
while I was sleeping.

627
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,707
I pretended to be asleep when she came

628
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,378
and kept my eyes closed.

629
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,052
You punk. Didn't I tell you
that your mom will go to prison

630
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,012
if you meet her?

631
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,140
I'm sorry, Dad.

632
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,935
Don't make her go to prison.

633
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,272
Honey, listen. I'm sorry.

634
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,441
I'm sorry. Don't be like that to Jae-ung.

635
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,529
I won't file for custody.

636
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,740
I won't ask for anything.

637
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,827
I won't even meet him again.

638
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,705
Just be good to Jae-ung.

639
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,335
Just be a good dad to Jae-ung.

640
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,004
That's all I ask of you.

641
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,382
Please.

642
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,098
I'll forgive you just this once.

643
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,767
Don't ever meet your mom again.
Do you understand?

644
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,608
Why didn't you go on a picnic?

645
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,943
You didn't even tell me.

646
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,821
He couldn't tell you
because you're never home.

647
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,906
I heard your girlfriend
gave birth to a baby.

648
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,867
You couldn't take care of Jae-ung

649
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,744
because you were busy
taking care of your girlfriend and baby.

650
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,246
Don't try to blame it on him.

651
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,171
What are you saying?

652
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,048
Jae-ung, why did you tell her that?

653
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,301
Why would you tell that to a stranger…

654
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,263
Wait a minute.

655
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,973
Haven't we met before?

656
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,518
We met in front of the dojo, didn't we?

657
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,647
I guess you were in it all together.

658
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,317
Oh, I see. I guess

659
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,736
that lady finally gave birth.

660
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:34,325
I guess it makes sense.
Her belly was quite big

661
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,619
when I last saw her
in front of your house.

662
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,996
How long have you been divorced?

663
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,372
A little less than six months.

664
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,876
Well, she gave birth already.

665
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,086
That means he was seeing her
before the divorce.

666
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,589
He was having an affair.

667
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,592
-Kim Sang-su.
-Stop talking nonsense!

668
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,554
That baby isn't mine, okay?

669
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,723
We started dating after she got pregnant.

670
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,102
Hey, be honest with me.

671
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,812
-Don't lie.
-Don't come near me.

672
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,981
Do you want me to call the cops?

673
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,566
Should I do that?

674
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,276
You'd better watch what you say.

675
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,612
If you say stuff
without checking the facts,

676
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,572
that's considered libel.

677
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,534
I'm sure you know that much.

678
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,161
Sang-su.

679
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,871
-Hey! You darn little--
-Do-chang.

680
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,872
Jae-ung is with him.

681
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,043
Let's not say anything
that might hurt him.

682
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,504
My gosh.

683
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:29,964
Yes.

684
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,967
If the cops visit you
and ask you about the baby,

685
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,052
tell them you don't know anything.

686
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,974
And tell them we've been seeing each other
for less than three months.

687
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,143
I don't want things to turn into a mess.

688
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,566
Jae-ung said something he shouldn't have,
and it complicated things a little.

689
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,151
What? Hey, he's just a little kid.

690
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,153
Why would you cuss at him like that?

691
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,700
He's not good at lying.
What do you expect?

692
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,869
Are you neglecting Jae-ung
now that you have your own baby?

693
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,413
Is that what it is?

694
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,541
You promised to raise him like your own.

695
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,959
Forget it.

696
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,627
Hang up.

697
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,099
Jae-ung.

698
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,646
By any chance, are you angry at me

699
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,358
because you think I might only care about

700
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,486
your younger sibling?

701
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,659
You're still awkward
with your stepmother, aren't you?

702
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,332
Jae-ung, I'm sorry.

703
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,959
I'm already busy,
but now we even have a baby.

704
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,503
I haven't been around for you much,
and I'm sorry about that.

705
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,132
Jae-ung, you're all grown up now.

706
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,218
So you're old enough
to make your own decisions.

707
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:04,725
You can choose whom to live with
between me and your mom.

708
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,520
I'll do as you say.

709
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,649
Can't we do a paternity test?

710
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,277
If the baby really turns out to be his,

711
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,239
it'll prove that he committed adultery
before the divorce.

712
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:24,036
Yes, but the problem is that we can't
do a paternity test without his consent.

713
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:24,953
Oh, right.

714
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,583
Should I just force him
to do a paternity test?

715
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,341
Jae-ung.

716
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,344
Mom, Dad told me

717
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,263
that I can live with you if I want.

718
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,140
Really?

719
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,479
So did you tell him
that you want to live with me?

720
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,563
Yes.

721
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,109
Thank you, Jae-ung.

722
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,152
Thank you, Jae-ung.

723
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,285
Guk-hyeon. This isn't like you.

724
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,828
Why would you…

725
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,330
Damn it!

726
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,543
Are you sure you can undo this?

727
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,339
Yes, I must've been out of my mind.

728
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,424
I'll return what I received.

729
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,095
Then I'll catch Oh Jong-tae myself
and have him sent to jail for murder.

730
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,140
I swear. I promise.

731
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:54,144
Then call Oh Jeong-su right now.
Call him and tell him you wish to return

732
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,771
the money you received.

733
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,314
Jin-su, it's really late right now.

734
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,233
Just call him

735
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,236
and tell him that you want to return it!
That's the only way

736
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,154
you can get out of this.

737
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,176
-Where are you going?
-Just call him.

738
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,279
Jin-su!

739
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,157
Jin-su!

740
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,828
Jin-su!

741
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,331
Jin-su!

742
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,003
Jin-su!

743
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,464
Jin-su! Wake up!

744
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,549
Jin-su!

745
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,146
OH JEONG-SU

746
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,403
I noticed that you called.
What made you call me so late?

747
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,281
Well… Sir…

748
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,826
By any chance,

749
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,494
have you had a change of heart?

750
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,205
No.

751
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,958
No, the thing is…

752
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,085
If you don't think it's enough,

753
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,255
I'll give you the same amount of money
I gave you last time.

754
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:46,923
What?

755
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,885
But…

756
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,181
-Guk-hyeon.
-Jin-su.

757
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,351
Now that things have come to this,
let's just quietly cover it up.

758
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,311
What can you do now?

759
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:03,523
I already left a record
of having wired money into your account.

760
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,360
It's too late to turn things back.

761
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,741
I'll call you back, sir.

762
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,041
Jin-su.

763
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,002
Jin-su.

764
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,466
I'm really sorry.

765
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,805
I'm so sorry.

766
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,062
I'm so sorry, Jin-su.

767
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,040
Guk-hyeon took this from the scene

768
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,125
and gave it to Jong-tae.

769
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,294
He took out the last part
that shows what he did.

770
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,380
Why did this show up now?

771
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,883
It was caught on the dashcam
inside the car that was parked nearby.

772
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,095
Nam Guk-hyeon took it from the car owner
and deleted it.

773
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,680
I took it to forensics and restored it.

774
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,390
Why did he have this?

775
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,435
Just in case he might get accused
of Jang Jin-su's murder.

776
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,271
He just needed to reveal the scene

777
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,398
where Yoo Jeong-seok hits Jang Jin-su
with a rock

778
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,526
so that it'll make it seem like
he killed Jang Jin-su.

779
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,739
That means Mr. Yoo thought
he was guilty of murdering Jang Jin-su

780
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,158
when he wasn't responsible
for his death at all.

781
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,910
So Guk-hyeon did it all by himself.

782
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,581
He killed Jang Jin-su
and abandoned the body.

783
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,209
He framed Lee Dae-cheol for murder

784
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,587
and made him take the fall.

785
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,089
If we found this earlier,

786
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,467
Mr. Yoo wouldn't have had to die.

787
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,552
Let's catch him again.

788
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,681
Only then will it be over.

789
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,813
The prosecution won't want
to investigate this case again.

790
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,941
And why are you asking me
to get you a warrant?

791
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,443
That's the police's job.

792
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,736
You saw the video.

793
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,156
Jang Jin-su was murdered by Nam Guk-hyeon,
not Yoo Jeong-seok.

794
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,117
You need to reveal the truth.

795
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,078
The retrial is over,
so we can't even take it to trial again.

796
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,830
The prosecution won't give you a warrant.

797
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,583
We can't hold a retrial for Lee Dae-cheol.

798
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,294
But if the prosecution acknowledges this
as a separate murder case,

799
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,545
we'll be able to investigate.

800
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,631
The public also seems to want
a reinvestigation.

801
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,425
But it's all up to the prosecution.

802
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,136
We came this far.

803
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,555
Let's end it together.

804
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,616
Jeong-seok died for nothing.

805
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,994
We need to catch Nam Guk-hyeon
in order to reveal the truth.

806
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,916
Jeong-seok's case ended fairly well.

807
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,335
Why go through it again?

808
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,464
"Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae,
who was in charge of Lee Dae-cheol's case,

809
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,302
fought for the truth until the very end
and finally succeeded in revealing it."

810
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:25,642
I'll be writing that on the first page
of Jeonghan Daily along with your photo.

811
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,646
How long are you going to stay in Incheon?

812
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,189
It's time you go to Seoul.

813
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,656
Thank you in advance.

814
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,785
Ms. Jin.

815
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,748
Who do you think will win
once this case is over?

816
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,001
The police?

817
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,044
The press?

818
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,129
No.

819
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,718
Who do you think will
have the most to gain?

820
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,637
Think about it carefully.

821
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,934
It will help you greatly
with your career in the future.

822
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,311
What are the guys in Team Two
going to arrest me for this time?

823
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,773
Why did you kill your partner?

824
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,108
-What are you saying?
-All the guys

825
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,110
are furious because of what you did.

826
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,739
They'll chase you
to the end of this earth.

827
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,533
I can't believe I used to
respect someone like you.

828
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,452
I'm no longer on your side.

829
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,872
I'm going to help them catch you.

830
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,582
Do you understand, Guk-hyeon?

831
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,118
-Hello?
-We got an arrest warrant for murder.

832
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,578
I'm on my way with the warrant.

833
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,747
-Okay.
-Where is Nam Guk-hyeon?

834
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,790
He isn't out yet.

835
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,834
Wait just a little bit. I'm almost there.

836
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,918
Okay.

837
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,808
Hey.

838
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,269
You…

839
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,938
You killed Jang Jin-su, didn't you?

840
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,650
We checked the video file
you had deleted on your laptop.

841
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:25,030
You killed Jin-su. It was you.

842
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,823
Right?

843
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,272
Will you please just stop?

844
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,400
Just let me be!

845
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,026
Please!

846
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,046
Why couldn't you just let it go?

847
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,966
Then nothing would've happened!

848
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:53,136
But why…
Why did you have to obsess over it?

849
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,596
Why?

850
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,056
I won't ever let go.

851
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,394
You'll never get away with it
unless I die. Ever.

852
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,563
Never.

853
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,693
You brought this upon yourself.

854
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,780
You could've just stayed quiet about it!

855
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,199
But why…

856
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,075
Why did you have to do this?

857
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,067
SEOBU POLICE STATION

858
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,200
Judging by Do-chang's injury,

859
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,828
I understand that it was
an emergency situation.

860
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:06,042
But it's hard to tell if it was
really necessary to shoot him.

861
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,961
Did you stick to the firearm safety rules?

862
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,879
No.

863
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,048
Not exactly.

864
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,675
I see.

865
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,512
Why can't he just lie?

866
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,514
No one saw anything. What's with him?

867
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,766
He's just being stubborn.

868
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,394
What's the matter with him?
How is he going to get by

869
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,562
if he gets fired?

870
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,856
If he gets fired for this,
he won't even get his pension.

871
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,108
He'll get by.

872
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,903
But please let him keep his badge.

873
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:38,199
You should take responsibility
and make sure he doesn't get fired.

874
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,617
Please.

875
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,536
Why

876
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,414
must I take responsibility
for what he did?

877
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,666
-Why?
-Sir.

878
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,959
You little punk.

879
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,005
What's this?

880
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,382
Well, you see,

881
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,343
my wife got it at a duty free shop.

882
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,845
But she doesn't like the fragrance.

883
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,640
I can't use it since I'm a guy.

884
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,976
But I can't throw it away either.

885
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,437
You know I always stick to the principles.

886
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,858
Do you think this is going to make me
break the rules?

887
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,693
Gosh, come on.

888
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,697
I know you're not that strict about
sticking to the rules.

889
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,491
What do you take me for?

890
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,454
You still haven't learned your lesson.

891
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,552
I'm only taking it
because it's exactly what I use.

892
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,512
Don't expect anything from me.

893
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,474
Yes, of course.
I don't expect anything in particular.

894
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,933
It's just

895
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,519
my heartfelt sincerity.

896
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,588
Right before I pulled the trigger,

897
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,675
I suddenly wondered

898
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,053
if I might regret it later on.

899
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,015
I wondered if I'll be embarrassed of it

900
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:28,559
for the rest of my life.

901
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,189
If you didn't shoot him,

902
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,149
I would've died.

903
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:41,197
-Then I did the right thing.
-We're done, right?

904
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,032
You don't have any more questions, right?

905
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,836
Do you remember me?

906
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:59,048
No, I still don't remember you.

907
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,427
Then what do you want from me?

908
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,179
When I called your name,

909
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,183
you remembered me.

910
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,271
-It was as if--
-Listen.

911
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,190
-Detective.
-I just need you

912
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,944
to admit that you killed my dad.
That's all I ask.

913
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,197
You killed him, didn't you?

914
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,200
It was you, right?

915
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,747
No.

916
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,249
I didn't kill him.

917
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,043
You should leave now.

918
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,296
I'm not the culprit.

919
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,048
I wouldn't have

920
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,720
been able to forgive you
if you were living a happy life.

921
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,350
This is your last chance.

922
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:56,647
It's your last chance to ask
the victim's son for forgiveness.

923
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,569
And this will be
the last time we ever meet.

924
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,115
I'm sorry.

925
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,411
I hope you forget about everything

926
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,622
and live a happy life now.

927
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,002
What about my dad?

928
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,007
What do you have to say to my dad?

929
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,594
Your father

930
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,180
was a good man.

931
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,309
I shouldn't have done what I did.

932
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,316
SEOBU DETENTION HOUSE

933
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,331
Why aren't you saying anything?
You were the one who wanted to meet.

934
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,629
Is there something wrong?

935
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:04,924
No.

936
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,010
Nothing's wrong. I'm sorry.

937
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:15,601
I think you should take this.

938
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,103
You carry this with you?

939
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,188
Blow on it if you're upset.

940
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,614
How does it feel?
Doesn't that make you feel better?

941
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,285
It makes you feel like
someone will show up to your rescue.

942
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,043
You're right.

943
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,213
Someone did show up.

944
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,468
I'll be off now.

945
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,928
I have a lot of work to do.

946
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,145
What? What's bothering you this time?

947
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,522
It's frustrating

948
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,984
because there's someone
I can't stop thinking about.

949
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,328
Eun-hye.

950
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,496
What a classy painting.

951
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,626
Doesn't this make our house
seem a lot better?

952
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:25,588
I think this painting will look better
if we move to a better place.

953
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,423
What's wrong with where we live now?

954
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,175
Do-chang, I went

955
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,595
to a show house for a new apartment.

956
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:37,642
And it was just the perfect apartment
for the four of us.

957
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,810
You just need to take out
an additional loan.

958
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,563
You're about to get promoted soon anyway.

959
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:46,776
Gosh, I can't believe
I'm making my team wait.

960
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,195
Jae-ung, Eun-hye needs
to study for college.

961
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,947
Don't steal too much of her time.

962
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,114
Okay, I won't.

963
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:56,702
And if you have time to go to a showroom,
just get yourself a job.

964
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,537
Aren't you ever going to work?

965
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,665
I failed to raise you properly.

966
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,333
Do-chang, I trust you, okay?

967
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,793
-Cut it out.
-I love you, Do-chang.

968
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,378
Stop it.

969
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:07,588
I love you, Do-chang.

970
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,841
What's the matter with him?

971
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,056
Jae-ung, isn't Eun-hye an amazing painter?

972
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,849
Yes, you look so pretty.

973
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,603
Really? You're the best, Jae-ung.

974
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,745
I don't think he's home yet.

975
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,331
His car is parked outside, so he's nearby.

976
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,833
Let's try waiting.

977
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:48,170
Sir, he has a lot of connections,
and he's from a pretty nice family.

978
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,673
There's also a congressman involved.
Will it be okay?

979
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,175
So what if he's from a nice family?

980
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,429
He's a sick pervert who beat up women
and took pictures of them.

981
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,140
We should catch him
and teach him a lesson.

982
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,851
Yes, that's right. We even made
the Minister of Justice step down.

983
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,310
There's no reason to be scared.

984
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,022
Do-chang, are you sure about this?
You're about to get promoted.

985
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,106
Well…

986
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,359
He doesn't care about that kind of stuff.

987
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,988
The name "Kang Do-chang"
means something on its own now.

988
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:17,616
He doesn't need a rank.
His name already says it all.

989
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,245
There's no point in caring about it now.

990
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,789
-Do-chang.
-Hey.

991
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,541
What are you guys doing here?

992
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,085
Gosh, I guess your team is
investigating the same case as ours.

993
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,336
We're on the same case.

994
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,630
You're here to catch Jang Jun-gi,
aren't you?

995
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,842
We've been working hard for a whole month
to catch him.

996
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:39,180
Do-chang, why don't you
give this one to us?

997
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:42,516
You guys have done enough for this year.

998
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,896
You guys don't know much
about Jang Jun-gi, do you?

999
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,567
Jang Jun-gi is… Check him and…

1000
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,863
Like this…

1001
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,282
That's who you're dealing with.
He has a lot of connections.

1002
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,453
Really? I had no idea.

1003
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,830
If you get involved,
things will only get out of hand.

1004
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,082
Look at me.

1005
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,876
My superiors always keep an eye on me
so that I don't act up.

1006
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,962
I've already accepted it, but you should
climb the ladder of success.

1007
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,672
Well, yes.

1008
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:17,468
I guess I'll only get myself in trouble
if I mess with someone like him.

1009
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:20,179
Yes, it's best to be realistic.

1010
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,849
If you don't want to go back so early,
just walk ten minutes from here,

1011
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,311
and you'll find a sundae restaurant.
It's really delicious there.

1012
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,729
Jang Jun-gi is here.

1013
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,524
Go and tell the owner my name.

1014
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,192
I'll pay for your food. See you guys.

1015
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,860
-Do-chang.
-What?

1016
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,738
We'll just get in trouble
and have our names mentioned

1017
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,490
-on the news.
-What?

1018
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,200
Hey, let's go catch Jang Jun-gi. Run!

1019
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,369
-Thanks, guys.
-Jang Jun-gi!

1020
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,288
-Stop right there!
-Hurry up! Run!

1021
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,082
-Run!
-Hey!

1022
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,500
-Run!
-Run!

1023
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,377
-Stop right there!
-Run!

1024
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,504
-Go get him!
-Stop!

1025
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,422
-Go!
-Run!

1026
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,016
