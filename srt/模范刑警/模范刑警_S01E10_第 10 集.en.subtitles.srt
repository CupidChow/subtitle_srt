1
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,379
Hey.

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,506
What do you think you're doing?

3
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,510
You're under arrest
for sexually molesting a minor.

4
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,144
Here.

5
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,856
This is

6
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,110
the CCTV footage of you
going into a hotel room with Jang Yu-na.

7
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,574
And here's a copy of the receipt
that proves you paid for the room

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,326
with your credit card.

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,841
If you plead guilty,

10
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,595
you'll just be charged
with sexual molestation.

11
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,263
But if you deny it,

12
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,682
it could anger the victim.

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,312
Maybe she was too shocked
to remember that she was raped.

14
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,482
But who knows?
She might suddenly remember that.

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,488
I'll think about it.

16
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,410
Okay. Think carefully.

17
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,417
You can either quit being a cop
and live comfortably at home

18
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,755
or wear a prison uniform
and sleep behind bars.

19
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,646
I know you tend to do things differently,

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,108
but why would you do something
that would obviously get you in trouble?

21
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,152
Why do you think?

22
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,362
Why are you asking me?
You're the one who did it.

23
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,572
Why?

24
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,658
The retrial is over,
and they managed to cover up their dirt.

25
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,705
So why provoke me
and give me an excuse to scrutinize them?

26
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,332
Why?

27
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,669
Shouldn't you be worried about yourself?

28
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,255
With that kind of evidence,

29
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,674
you won't be able to get out of this.

30
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,801
Why do you think Captain Nam
offered me a deal?

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,970
He told me if I pleaded guilty,

32
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,930
I'll only have to quit my job.

33
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,682
Isn't it obvious?

34
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,851
He wants you to admit it.

35
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,436
It's bait.

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,730
"Quit your job as a cop."

37
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,648
Once I become a civilian,

38
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,275
Jong-tae

39
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,236
will try to kill me.

40
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,702
Hello? Who is this?

41
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,995
Is it urgent?

42
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,163
Yes.

43
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,792
Okay, I'll send it to you right now.

44
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,170
LIEUTENANT OH SUSPECTED OF
SEXUALLY MOLESTING A MINOR

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,757
Lieutenant Oh of the Violent Crimes Unit?

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,175
LIEUTENANT OH

47
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,177
Oh Ji-hyeok?

48
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,897
He confined a minor in a hotel room.

49
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,815
He didn't confine her.

50
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,652
He just paid for the room
and let her stay there by herself.

51
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,653
So she wasn't confined.

52
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,323
He sexually molested an 18-year-old girl
in a hotel room, right?

53
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,741
What's the matter with you?

54
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,118
I'm a reporter,
and I'm checking the facts.

55
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,204
The victim is Jang Yu-na.

56
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,332
The girl who reported
that Lee Eun-hye went missing.

57
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,752
Detective Oh only used her
to get information.

58
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,047
Is that how their relationship started?

59
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,716
Are you going to use Jang Yu-na
to drive Ji-hyeok into a corner?

60
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,929
I'm sure you already know
who's behind all this.

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,140
I'll let you meet him.
You can ask him yourself.

62
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,309
-Then you'll stop doubting him.
-No.

63
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,896
My personal feelings might get in the way
of my writing an objective article.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,981
I'll be off now.

65
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,485
Ms. Jin, now is not the time
for an article.

66
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,238
If you do, it won't be based on any facts.

67
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,908
"Personal feelings"?
What's that supposed to mean?

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,813
Did you look into it?
What about the victim?

69
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,524
"The Sunflower Center"?

70
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,652
Okay, thanks.

71
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,576
He always acted all haughty,
but look at him now.

72
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,080
How did he get involved in this?
That dumb fool.

73
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,126
Are you sure we can trust the victim?

74
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,962
Yes, I don't think she's lying.

75
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,339
What about Ji-hyeok? Did he plead guilty?

76
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,008
The evidence is loud and clear.

77
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,718
He has no other choice.

78
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,221
What in the world is wrong with…

79
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,810
Just go.

80
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,771
You can deal with it.

81
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,273
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,942
Captain Nam.

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,820
-Yes, sir?
-By any chance…

84
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,291
Hello, sir. Have you been well?

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,098
It looks like you know

86
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,933
why I'm here.

87
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,314
Sir.

88
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,609
-Did you report to the chief?
-Yes.

89
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,112
Should I send a warrant application
to the prosecutor?

90
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,740
-No, let's wait.
-Pardon?

91
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,117
Let's see how things go.

92
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,002
I will

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,797
admit everything.

94
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,801
But can you give me some time
to take care of things?

95
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,886
My son is in the army right now.

96
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,055
I'm worried he might get shocked

97
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,267
if he suddenly finds out I got fired
due to my irregularities.

98
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,852
Let me pay him a visit

99
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,397
and give him a heads up
so that he can prepare himself.

100
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,691
You can do that for me, can't you?

101
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,985
You're making me feel dejected twice.

102
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,280
I went to the location
after I received a report,

103
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,449
and nothing was there.

104
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,536
Did you move your stuff somewhere
because you knew I'd find out?

105
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,371
Or was it a warning

106
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,083
implying that I should be careful
of how powerful you can be?

107
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,923
I know this is irrelevant,
but it's something I really want to know.

108
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,593
Let me ask you something.

109
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,886
That weapon

110
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,014
you lost five years ago.

111
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,351
I heard you told the judge
that you found it in your car trunk.

112
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,107
But from what I remember,
I was the one who found it for you.

113
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,489
How about we call it even

114
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,157
and forget about what we both know?

115
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,287
I guess we have an agreement then.
I'll be off now.

116
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,879
I heard your eldest son

117
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,633
was arrested by the military police
but got released thanks to his father.

118
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,469
Is that correct?

119
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:57,370
CHIEF MOON SANG-BEOM

120
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,010
I talked to the chief.

121
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,431
And he doesn't want this
to become an issue.

122
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,559
Why don't you just volunteer to resign?

123
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,271
I'll talk to the victim
and convince her to drop the suit.

124
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,690
Thank you.

125
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,443
Let's not take this any further.

126
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,570
Thank you

127
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,074
for confirming that I was right.

128
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,578
Jang… Jang Yu-na?

129
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,246
Tell her

130
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,000
to sue me for only for sexual assault.

131
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,420
I'd rather sleep behind bars

132
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,754
than get killed.

133
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,679
Just get him locked up for rape.

134
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,641
Stay in the police force
until he finishes doing time in jail.

135
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,352
After that, you can join our company

136
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,105
and enjoy the rest of your life.

137
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,362
He always makes things difficult for me.

138
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,827
Why did you say that to Guk-hyeon?

139
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,456
The victim's statement is most important
when it comes to sex crimes these days.

140
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,875
You won't be able
to get out of this, you fool.

141
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,959
No one has your back.

142
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,003
You have my back.

143
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,422
Hey!

144
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,424
I got demoted.

145
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,385
I'm stuck at the holding cell all day.
There's nothing I can do.

146
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,012
How do you expect me to help you?

147
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:42,058
You know,
you really tend to underestimate yourself.

148
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,852
But you always get things done
once you put your mind to it.

149
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,646
Have some confidence.

150
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,606
The noodles will get soggy. Eat up.

151
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,233
How do you expect me to eat?

152
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,777
Just shove it in your mouth.

153
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,112
You need to eat up
in order to find yourself a partner.

154
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,323
Why would I do that? Why would I help you?

155
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,532
You caused this mess.

156
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,912
Why do I have to go through this
because of you? Why?

157
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,831
-It's your fate.
-You're crazy.

158
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,999
Do-chang.

159
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,253
I think you're right. It's Jo Seong-dae.

160
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,090
I asked Jang Yu-na's friend,

161
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,675
and she told me he kept looking for her.

162
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,553
That means he set this up.

163
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,391
What should I do?
Should I find him and kick his ass?

164
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,476
That won't make him talk.

165
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,228
I'll do everything I can to make him talk.

166
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,022
There's nothing
you can charge him with right now.

167
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,110
You need to find evidence to prove
that Jo Seong-dae killed Park Gun-ho.

168
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,903
Then I'll find that evidence.

169
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,656
Neither of you can do anything right now.

170
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,575
We need to catch him
in order to prove Ji-hyeok is innocent.

171
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,786
Just leave it to me.

172
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,706
Okay, go get him.

173
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,625
Okay, you got it.

174
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,378
Can I beat the shit out of him?

175
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,004
-My gosh.
-Okay.

176
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,339
That jerk.

177
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,885
That cop told me
I just need to file a report.

178
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,638
But apparently, I need to stay
at the Sunflower Center.

179
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,015
It's so annoying.

180
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,727
If you cheat on me while I'm gone,
I swear I'll kill you.

181
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,229
No, there was no sexual molestation.

182
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,481
He didn't even touch me.

183
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,693
Yes, he's good-looking.

184
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,944
But still, I never would have

185
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,488
let him do anything to me.
I would've punched that jerk.

186
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,367
Do you know where the Sunflower Center is?

187
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,870
Over there. It's that right there.

188
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,954
Oh, I see.

189
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,086
Hey, are you jealous?

190
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,922
-Hello.
-Hello.

191
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,426
Is there a victim who was sent here
from Seobu Police Station?

192
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,927
Her name is Jang Yu-na.

193
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,554
Jang Yu-na?

194
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,638
Yes.

195
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,310
Ms. Jang Yu-na?

196
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,270
Yes, that's me.

197
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,397
Hello, I'm Jin Seo-kyung
from Jeonghan Daily.

198
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,857
I have a few questions…

199
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,442
No, I'm not interested.

200
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,653
Hey, lady. What's your problem?
Your job is to protect me.

201
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,447
Why would you let her talk to me?

202
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,449
-Wait.
-I said I'm not interested.

203
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,035
I've been through enough.
Don't make things worse.

204
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,161
-Ms. Jang--
-I'm sorry.

205
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,330
Reporters aren't allowed inside.

206
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,168
Okay. Thank you.

207
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,258
Detective Kang,
I'm suspicious of Jang Yu-na.

208
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,718
I think she's hiding something.

209
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,180
Come in.

210
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,399
-Do you know Jang Yu-na?
-Yes.

211
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,361
-Can you tell me a little bit about her?
-She did nothing wrong.

212
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,571
I asked her to report to the cops
that I went missing.

213
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,491
No, I'm not going to do anything to her.

214
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,495
She sued Detective Oh
for sexual molestation.

215
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,165
-Really?
-He'd never do anything like that.

216
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,503
She does anything for money.

217
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,548
No one believes her

218
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,966
because she's full of lies.

219
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,551
I see.

220
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,220
Then can you…

221
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,016
The chief is here.

222
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,061
Is there something wrong?

223
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,980
Here.

224
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,440
My goodness, you didn't need to.

225
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,569
I bet Do-chang
badmouths me a lot these days.

226
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,783
It's hard to take care of everyone
when you're the chief.

227
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,537
But deep down in my heart,
I'm extremely fond of Do-chang.

228
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,664
-I really mean it.
-Okay.

229
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,709
-Let me get you guys coffee--
-No, forget it.

230
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,210
He doesn't drink instant coffee.

231
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,129
You should go inside so we can talk.

232
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,966
-Okay then. I'll leave you to talk.
-Okay.

233
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,175
Bye.

234
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,140
What brings you all the way here?

235
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,770
The photos you showed me yesterday.

236
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,816
Did you take them yourself,
or did someone else take them?

237
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,818
Someone else took them.

238
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,156
Listen. If you wanted to screw me over,
you should've done a better job.

239
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,827
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Sang-mi couldn't find anything there.

240
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,883
You were scammed.

241
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,051
This is a fake.

242
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,313
What in the world

243
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,565
do you want from me?

244
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,359
Admit it.

245
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,196
Admit you were wrong back then
and that you're still wrong.

246
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,489
So what?

247
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,575
Do you think Lee Dae-cheol died
because of me?

248
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,702
It's not solely your fault.

249
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,457
We're all at fault for hiding what we knew
just so we could protect ourselves.

250
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,917
And you're one of them.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,251
Doing this

252
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,545
won't bring Lee Dae-cheol back to life.

253
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,675
He may be dead,

254
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,260
but we still need to soothe his soul.

255
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,064
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

256
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,900
What do you want me to do now?

257
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,570
Should I go to his grave
and get on my knees?

258
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,490
Yes, you should get on your knees
and apologize.

259
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,826
Eun-hye, come out here for a moment.
Eun-hye!

260
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,107
I'm

261
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,651
sorry.

262
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,530
Why are you sorry?

263
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,160
Tell her.

264
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,539
I…

265
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,292
I didn't carry out

266
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,295
a proper investigation due to my greed.

267
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,840
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,343
I'd like to apologize

269
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,304
to your late father

270
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,933
from the bottom of my heart.

271
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
Why…

272
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,273
Why did you do that?

273
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,610
Why?

274
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,362
I was a fool.

275
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,033
I only cared about my future.

276
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,577
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,788
I owe both you and your father

278
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,165
an apology.

279
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,611
It's the list of items I found.

280
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,822
Write down who you gave each item from.

281
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,325
I'll meet them in person

282
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,077
and return every single one.

283
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,958
This is embarrassing.

284
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,878
But I honestly feel a lot more relieved.

285
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,341
Thank you, Do-chang.

286
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,655
I'm sorry too, Dad.

287
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,577
I couldn't do anything to help you.

288
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,877
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,569
All the other places are covered in dust,
but this place was wiped clean.

290
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,030
The same goes for there and over there.

291
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,659
Someone obviously came
and got rid of all the footprints.

292
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,205
He really did his best
to cover up for Jo Seong-dae.

293
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,541
Man-gu, did you find any bloodstains?

294
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,796
No, it's the same here. I can tell
someone cleaned up, but there's nothing.

295
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,550
Look closer. I'm sure we missed something.

296
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,094
We just need a drop of blood
to identify who it is.

297
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:25,057
Come on. If Captain Nam cleaned the place,
he wouldn't have left anything behind.

298
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,518
He worked as a violent crimes detective
for over ten years.

299
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,145
Guys.

300
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,192
-My gosh.
-My goodness.

301
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,656
His blood must have drizzled down here
after he pushed Park Gun-ho.

302
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,159
Gosh, I guess Captain Nam
failed to check this one.

303
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,467
I got you, Jo Seong-dae, you jerk.

304
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,682
I got a call earlier
from Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae.

305
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,268
He wanted to meet me.

306
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,354
Did you tell him we work together?

307
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,647
No.

308
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,732
Then why does he want to meet me?

309
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,069
Maybe he knows we're working together.

310
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,321
It doesn't matter.

311
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,157
I don't work for him.

312
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,247
Did Hong-du ask you to do this?

313
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,292
I cut ties with him.
I don't meet him anymore.

314
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,920
Did that detective call you?

315
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,590
-You got paid, didn't you?
-What do you mean?

316
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,134
I know that cop.

317
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,594
And you're not his type.

318
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,931
You crazy brat.

319
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,684
You got paid in return
for making him go to jail, didn't you?

320
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,602
What the heck is wrong with you?

321
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,480
Who paid you? Let me in on the fun.

322
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,774
I'm running low on money these days.

323
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,736
By any chance, are you…

324
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,988
-What are you doing?
-Give me your cell phone.

325
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,575
Unlock your phone before I kill you.

326
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,205
Are you happy now?

327
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,545
Do you swear you're not here
to help that cop?

328
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,089
You know how much I hate cops.

329
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,217
I hate that guy even more.
He put me through so much.

330
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,263
Let me also get some money
from that guy who paid you.

331
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,725
You're too naive
to deal with a guy like him.

332
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,313
Does Hong-du know that you got paid?

333
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,901
Do you think he'll forgive you
if he finds out

334
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,486
that you took all the money?

335
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,074
Just tell me
what you had to do to get paid.

336
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,867
I'll give you half the money I get.

337
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,630
Hey, you'd better not tell those people
that I told you this.

338
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,547
Okay?

339
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,176
Don't worry. I won't have to tell anyone.

340
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,190
Hey, did that cop really
sexually molest you?

341
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,735
If he did, those people
wouldn't have paid me.

342
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,534
You bitch!

343
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,871
Do you know whom I despise the most?

344
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:39,835
People who frame innocent people
just for their own benefits.

345
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,336
You got that, you horrible brat?

346
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,719
HOLDING CELL

347
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,352
Jang Yu-na dropped all charges.

348
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,064
Did you find out who made her do this?

349
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,357
You guessed correctly.

350
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,086
Don't try so hard to make me quit my job.

351
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,590
Even if I quit my job,
I'll still come after you.

352
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,595
Is it because it's me?

353
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,808
If you were after someone else and not me,

354
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,727
would you still have been so obsessive?

355
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,353
Don't get mistaken.

356
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,690
It's not because it's you.
I chase culprits.

357
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,025
Because you're a detective?

358
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,944
But tell me something.

359
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,740
Did you find the guy
who killed your father?

360
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,786
You try so hard to catch culprits.

361
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,165
So I don't get why you still haven't
found the guy who killed your father.

362
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,001
You saw him with your own two eyes.

363
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,963
You should catch that guy

364
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,218
so your mother, who committed suicide,
will finally be able to rest in peace.

365
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,722
Your mother died because of you.

366
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,226
Because you failed
to recognize the culprit.

367
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,023
Catch that guy first.
Stop taking it out on me.

368
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,944
You're right. I'm taking it out on you.

369
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,530
I want to arrest all the bad guys
because he's still out there.

370
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:38,078
I'm going to arrest every single person
who commits crimes and acts innocent.

371
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,913
Okay, go ahead and arrest me

372
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,832
if you can.

373
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,836
Do you know why

374
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,883
your father always gave me more credit
than you, his own son?

375
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,974
Because you get your confidence
from your background.

376
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,726
But you see, without your background,

377
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,436
you're nothing.

378
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,442
If you want to kill me, do it yourself.

379
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,697
Don't pay people
with the money you got from your father.

380
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,152
Your mother died because of you.

381
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,487
Because you failed
to recognize the culprit.

382
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,380
Mom.

383
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,135
JANG YU-NA

384
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,306
The phone is turned off.
You will be directed to voicemail.

385
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,850
You will be charged after the beep.

386
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,583
Hey.

387
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,668
Hey.

388
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,337
What did the chief say?

389
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,132
He told me that I can

390
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,175
come back here as of today.

391
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,429
That's great.

392
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,681
What about Ji-hyeok?

393
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,975
He did nothing wrong, so he got released.

394
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,560
Now, we just need to find the guy

395
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,105
who tried to frame Ji-hyeok.

396
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,234
Yes, we should definitely catch him.

397
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,988
He totally made a fool of Captain Nam.

398
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,082
Yes, sir.

399
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,752
There's a detective
who's involved in this.

400
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,921
If you call him,
things will be a lot easier.

401
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,636
I won't hold you responsible for this

402
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,766
because there are many suspects these days
who try to take advantage of detectives.

403
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,603
You also heard this,
so I'm sure you get what I'm about to say.

404
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,105
What really pisses me off

405
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,692
is that this detective
tried to screw over his own colleague.

406
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,494
I want you to be in charge and find out

407
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,789
who this damn detective is.

408
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,268
Ms. Jin.

409
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,646
What…

410
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,689
What brings you here?

411
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,067
I'm not here to see you.

412
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,985
I came to see your editor.

413
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,704
Yes, Detective Oh.

414
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,666
I had an appointment nearby.

415
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,545
But it was canceled,
so I thought I'd drop by to see you.

416
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,422
-Did you eat?
-No, not yet.

417
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,675
But there's going to be
a team dinner tonight.

418
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,470
I wanted to have a drink with you,
but I guess it'll have to wait.

419
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
Congratulations on being acquitted.

420
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,974
There's no need to congratulate me.

421
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,852
It would've been better
if I was acquitted in the second trial.

422
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,728
Now, they have an excuse to pressure me.

423
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,857
If you stay quiet, nothing will happen.

424
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,155
You know Oh Jong-tae, right?

425
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,075
The guy who appeared at the hearing.

426
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,037
-Yes, of course.
-Do you know

427
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,499
that I was the chief prosecutor in charge
of Lee Dae-cheol's case?

428
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,046
It's actually a very interesting case.
There are lots of secrets behind it.

429
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,594
If you're bothered by Oh Jong-tae,

430
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,637
what I know about him
might help you a little.

431
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,057
Don't overanalyze anything.

432
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,810
I'm just doing what I can to survive.

433
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,318
What brings you all the way here?

434
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,196
I wanted to check
if you did your homework while I was gone.

435
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,535
What homework?

436
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,287
The background noise from that recording.

437
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm sorry. I was too busy
helping an idiot get out of trouble.

438
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,586
You were busy with personal matters.

439
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,962
It was nothing personal.

440
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,673
It's something I had to do
in order to check the facts.

441
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,135
So you just did your job as a reporter?

442
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,054
It would've been worse
if I wasn't a reporter.

443
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,765
I would've made sure
he learned his lesson.

444
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,809
I only let it slide
because I feel nothing toward him.

445
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,939
I think it's a pity. If it were true,
I would've gotten an exclusive.

446
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,694
-Do you have time today?
-No, I need to do my homework.

447
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,947
I'm having trouble sleeping again.

448
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,659
I think I'll be able to sleep well
if I drank like I did last time.

449
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,286
Detective Oh,

450
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,457
reporters only drink with people
who give them information for articles.

451
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,877
I can't write about an idiot detective
going to the ER after drinking.

452
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,837
That won't make great news.

453
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,843
Hello?

454
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,222
Oh, right. I forgot about the team dinner.

455
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,640
Okay, I'll be right there.

456
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,312
Nice. I was craving alcohol today.

457
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,773
I should go there and drink like a whale.

458
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,817
I'll see you.

459
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,944
Next time I come,

460
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,154
I'll bring some news for an article.

461
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,242
Thank you.

462
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,872
Did you just--

463
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,876
Call me when you're done
with your homework. It's important.

464
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,719
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

465
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,220
Let's drink.

466
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,562
I feel like I haven't heard much
about Incheon lately.

467
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,479
I don't work there.

468
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:47,525
Oh, right. You work at the head office.

469
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,484
My bad.

470
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,989
Sir, the Economy Team received
an advertisement complaint

471
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,657
and wants us to take care of it.

472
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,160
It's complete nonsense.
Should I raise an issue about this?

473
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,746
Do them a favor just this once.
I have no authority over this.

474
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,248
They bring in money,
so their editor has more power.

475
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,083
I may be the minister's brother,

476
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,669
but so many people at work
talk behind my back for some reason.

477
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,257
How about the series? Is it going well?

478
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,677
Yes, Gwang-hui and I will be in charge.

479
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,512
Will that be enough? It'll be a series.

480
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,224
Well, I guess we could ask Ms. Jin
to join us.

481
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,144
She wrote about the victims
who were killed by death-row convicts.

482
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,522
Oh, right. She also wrote about
Lee Dae-cheol's retrial.

483
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,523
She'll be of help.

484
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,319
"Was it the right choice to carry out
the death sentence?"

485
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,738
That's the main subject of the series.

486
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,533
We're going to check the justification
of the recent death sentence.

487
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,579
"Was it the right choice to carry out
the death sentence?"

488
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,585
Did your brother ask you for help again?

489
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,839
Are you going to use us again
to help your brother?

490
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,428
I know this is a casual dinner,
but don't make groundless comments.

491
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,429
"Groundless"?

492
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,516
Then let me ask you something.

493
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,269
Why did you make me interview
the victims' families?

494
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,022
You wanted to get the public
to agree with the death sentence

495
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,524
before your brother's inauguration

496
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,609
so you could
get rid of the political burden.

497
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,987
But now, you want to question
the legitimacy of the death sentence?

498
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,534
What made you come up with this series?

499
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,286
The President promised to abolish
the death penalty.

500
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,289
You're just playing along with that.

501
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,334
You and the Minister of Justice
are setting things up on purpose.

502
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,877
I'm done

503
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,383
playing the selfish game
that was set up by you and your brother.

504
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,345
I didn't come to the head office
to be your puppet.

505
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,811
Bring her back.

506
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,021
Seo-kyung. Wait.

507
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,273
Let her go.

508
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,900
You guys had enough, right?

509
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,819
Let's have our last shot
and go somewhere else.

510
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,129
It's cold. You'll catch a cold
if you drink something cold outside.

511
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,341
Do you feel better
now that you've let it all out?

512
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,136
No, not yet.

513
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,305
What else is there?

514
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,390
The voice recording

515
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,350
was inside the flash drive
that Gwang-hui found

516
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,186
at the National Police Agency, wasn't it?

517
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,355
You knew everything, didn't you?

518
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,858
You just acted like you didn't know
when I took it to you.

519
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,613
You used that voice recording
for the execution of the death sentence.

520
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,532
And you stopped me
from writing an article to conceal that.

521
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,163
Let's write about the voice recording
toward the end of the series.

522
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,582
What's the point?

523
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,085
Back then, I was worried it might
provoke the police and prosecution

524
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,588
and end up worsening the situation.

525
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,173
I didn't want you to get hurt either.

526
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,799
I'm not scared of getting hurt.

527
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,468
There's a right timing for every article.

528
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,887
And now is the time to write about that.

529
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,189
When you came and asked me
to write about your father,

530
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,191
you cried and gave me a canned coffee.

531
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,945
That coffee is
what made me write the article.

532
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,032
But that wasn't the only reason.

533
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,785
The bigger reason was because

534
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,079
I was a reporter.

535
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,963
They're waiting for me
to join the second round. I'll go now.

536
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,720
Look how far you've come.
You even get angry at your boss now.

537
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,821
SEOBU POLICE STATION

538
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,199
He got rid of everything
that could be of evidence.

539
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,576
But he missed this.

540
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,539
Gosh, I guess Captain Nam
failed to check this one.

541
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,001
When can we get the lab results?

542
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,920
I asked them to hurry,
so we'll get it by tomorrow.

543
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,171
We'll start here.

544
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,133
It would've been difficult for him
to get rid of everything by himself.

545
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm sure someone helped.

546
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,596
-Who took this photo?
-I did.

547
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,181
-Without a tool?
-Yes, with this hand.

548
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,599
-Really?
-Yes.

549
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,726
-I found it.
-You did?

550
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,686
-Yes.
-We almost died.

551
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,690
Hey.

552
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,110
We finished investigating this case.
Why investigate it again?

553
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,945
You admitted you were wrong.

554
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,740
You apologized for what you did

555
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,242
and even got on your knees.
Don't you remember?

556
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,995
My goodness.

557
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,832
You really are using it against me.

558
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,587
Even if we arrest Jo Seong-dae
for Park Gun-ho's murder,

559
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,590
we'll only be able to suspect Oh Jong-tae
for his death.

560
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,426
On top of that, he'll only be charged
with abetting murder.

561
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,886
You need to keep that in mind.

562
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,224
Eun-hye told me that she feels furious.

563
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,144
Her dad died

564
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,981
and she doesn't get why the real culprit
gets to live a comfortable life.

565
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,695
Why are we going
to the interrogation room?

566
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,740
I need to ask you something in private.

567
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,742
I don't feel comfortable there.
Just ask me here.

568
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,579
I'll tell you once we're inside.
My gosh, come on.

569
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,673
What?

570
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,551
Do you think I'm nuts?
Why would I get rid of evidence

571
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,719
from a murder scene?

572
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,098
If Captain Nam tells you to kill yourself,
I bet you would.

573
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,933
What did you say?
Do you have a death wish?

574
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,518
-You darn punk.
-What?

575
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,895
Jae-hong, be quiet.

576
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,439
U-jin, sit down.

577
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,942
I want to get out of here.
I'm really offended by this.

578
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,860
Sit down.

579
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,445
It's best that you sit down.

580
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,407
-We don't want to dig up your dirt.
-What did you say?

581
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,242
Do you want us to do
what your captain does

582
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,287
and do a background check
on a fellow colleague?

583
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,542
I'm giving you a chance to explain,
so just sit down.

584
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:24,213
Sit down and give me an honest answer
to the questions I ask you.

585
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,339
Sit down.

586
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,223
Do you also think it was right
for Park Gun-ho's death

587
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,975
to be concluded as suicide?

588
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,060
We checked all the nearby CCTVs

589
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,147
and confirmed that Park Gun-ho
drove there all by himself.

590
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,316
We gave the NFS every single evidence
we found at the scene.

591
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,484
What more do you expect?

592
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,861
We checked with the NFS,

593
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,281
and they told us they never got
any bloodstains or DNA evidence.

594
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,827
Park Gun-ho had a stab wound on his thigh
when we checked the crime scene photos.

595
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,081
But why weren't there
any bloodstains at the crime scene?

596
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,459
You handed in all the evidence
to the NFS, right?

597
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,128
-You hid the evidence, didn't you?
-What do you think you're doing?

598
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,798
Are you guys teaming up
so you can make a fool of me or what?

599
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,676
You guys are talking bullshit.
Get out of my way.

600
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,430
I'm glad you're here, sir.
These guys are blaming me

601
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,724
for something I didn't even do.

602
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,643
I heard everything from the other room.
You don't need to explain.

603
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,437
Sit down.

604
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,856
Pardon?

605
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,693
Sit down, you punk.

606
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,784
You see,

607
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,997
it's always best for you
to quickly admit to your mistakes.

608
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,418
If you try to cover things up,
you'll only end up in a bigger mess.

609
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,837
I didn't do anything wrong, sir.

610
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,839
-U-jin.
-Yes, sir.

611
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,132
Think about it carefully.

612
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,138
This is going to be your last chance
to tell me that what you did

613
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,723
was just a mistake.

614
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,767
If you cross this line,

615
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,561
your mistakes will snowball
and become too big of an issue.

616
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,982
Then I won't be able
to turn a blind eye to it.

617
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,569
I've made a few mistakes lately,

618
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,697
so it's going to take me some time
to become the inspector general.

619
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,784
In other words, that means I'll be

620
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:21,539
spending a really long time
working with you at this police station.

621
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,143
Hey, Captain.

622
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,646
I'm off to submit the evidence to the NFS
regarding Park Gun-ho's death.

623
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,190
Pardon? Oh, right now?

624
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,111
Okay, sir. I'll check
with the administration division.

625
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,155
Yes, sir.

626
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,912
SEOBU POLICE STATION

627
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,512
Why did Guk-hyeon
secretly go inside your car?

628
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,265
When I arrived at the NFS,

629
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,145
the cigarette butts and bloodstained rocks
we found at the scene were missing.

630
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,023
I brought them from the police station,

631
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,858
but they were gone.

632
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,486
Then why didn't you report that
to the higher-ups?

633
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,487
It's obvious.

634
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,782
He wanted to cover up his mistake.

635
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,745
Captain Nam told me it won't matter
because we're going to end it

636
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,497
as a suicide case.

637
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,708
-You left the evidence in your car, right?
-Yes.

638
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:34,463
Then this must be when Guk-hyeon
took the evidence from your car.

639
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,714
Yes, it looks like it.

640
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,886
Did you call Guk-hyeon?

641
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,432
We haven't been able to reach him.
We'll question him as soon as we do.

642
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,560
I'll make him tell us everything
including what he did with Lee Dae-cheol.

643
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,812
He won't pick up.

644
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,609
He already caught on and left.

645
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,698
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

646
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,576
Park Gun-ho’s death
ended as a suicide case,

647
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,578
but it turns out that might not be true.

648
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,123
Let’s hear more from our reporter.

649
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,416
-Reporter Jung.
-Yes?

650
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,210
Are we talking about the case
where Park Gun-ho committed suicide

651
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,546
after having falsely stated that he killed

652
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,506
-Lee Dae-cheol's daughter?
-Yes, that's right.

653
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:21,468
Didn't Incheon Seobu Police Station
conclude this as a suicide case?

654
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,596
Yes, that's right. But we did
an exclusive interview with a detective

655
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,934
who told us the preliminary investigation
wasn't carried out properly.

656
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,062
He thinks it shouldn't have ended
as a suicide case.

657
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,439
Let's take a look at the footage.

658
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,608
Why did you ask us to do an interview?

659
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,487
As someone who's been working as a cop
for 15 years,

660
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,406
it hurt my conscience to stay quiet.

661
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,908
The preliminary investigation
wasn't carried out properly.

662
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,703
It was wrong to wrap it up as suicide.

663
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,540
And as the detective who was in charge,
I plan to take responsibility and resign.

664
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,714
The chief wants us to form a team

665
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,133
and reinvestigate Park Gun-ho's death.

666
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,384
Great.

667
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,470
Are you excited?

668
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,054
Now that there's no one in our way,

669
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,141
so let's do our best to solve this case.

670
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,977
Okay then. Where do we begin?

671
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,855
Captain, don't worry.
We have everything ready.

672
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,607
You just need to wait until we're done.

673
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,609
I love it when I don't have to do much.

674
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,737
But wouldn't your wife get upset
if you start being busy again?

675
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,365
No, it's okay.
The nights are getting scary these days.

676
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,953
Ji-ung and Man-gu.
Check the CCTVs near the crime scene

677
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,788
and find out where Jo Seong-dae was.

678
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,249
Jae-hong and Dong-uk.
I want you guys to tail him.

679
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,128
We'll go through the case files
we received from Team One.

680
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,463
-Dong-uk.
-Yes?

681
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,757
Call me as soon as the blood test
results are out.

682
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,842
-Okay, you got it.
-Let's go.

683
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,094
Look at you guys.
This is what I'm talking about.

684
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,391
Hey, what's gotten into the chief?

685
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,018
He's acting so differently.

686
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,686
He was never a bad guy.

687
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,189
He just acted that way
because of his rank and position.

688
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,360
HYEON-JU'S MOTHER

689
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,445
Hello?

690
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,114
No, you don't need to come.

691
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,700
I'll just meet you there.

692
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,957
I'm really sorry

693
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,376
about how I acted back then.

694
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,629
No. I asked you for too much.

695
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,839
I put you in a difficult situation.

696
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:27,177
You both think that my late husband
and Captain Nam

697
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,305
framed Lee Dae-cheol
as the culprit, right?

698
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,728
The thing is, I wanted to testify in court

699
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,815
that my late husband
would never do something like that.

700
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,484
The fact that he died
while he was on duty won't change.

701
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,069
It's over now.

702
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,405
No one will ever bring that up again.

703
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,490
No, it's not over.

704
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,537
To be honest, I only cared about myself
and my child after he died.

705
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,039
I didn't care much about him.

706
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:02,421
But I wanted to let people know
that he wasn't the type of guy

707
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,548
to take bribes from criminals.

708
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,260
I felt that's the least I could do

709
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,387
to honor his death.

710
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,432
My late husband

711
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,436
never even gave me enough money
to pay for our living expenses.

712
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,563
I worked to pay for my child's tuition.

713
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,025
There's no way
he would have received a bribe.

714
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,070
All he ever cared about was work.

715
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:32,242
And that day, when he died…

716
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,661
I thought the case was over.

717
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,957
But I have so many things
to discuss with you.

718
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,586
Family matters are also important.

719
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,172
Please come home
so we can talk face to face.

720
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,759
I'm sorry. We found new evidence.

721
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,927
What's the point?

722
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,013
You told me you were sure
that he is the culprit.

723
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,641
No, I think I was mistaken.

724
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,225
Just give me a few more days.

725
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,687
I can't send an innocent man to prison.

726
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,032
If anything strange happens,
call me right away.

727
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,659
I'll come right away.

728
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,994
Okay, thank you.

729
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,829
Bye.

730
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,337
Jin-su died
while trying to uncover the truth.

731
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,923
We were totally mistaken.

732
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,300
I feel so sorry for misunderstanding him.

733
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,137
That means Nam Guk-hyeon was the only guy
who made a deal with the culprit.

734
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:39,434
What if Detective Jang found out
Nam Guk-hyeon fabricated the case?

735
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,269
Then Oh Jong-tae
might not have killed him.

736
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,439
It could be Nam Guk-hyeon who killed him.

737
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,277
Do you think Guk-hyeon would have
killed his own partner?

738
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,864
Would you kill me for money?

739
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,120
What's with that look?

740
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,581
What was that?

741
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,459
This was bound to be revealed anyway.

742
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,128
I just made the first move.

743
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,965
I feel like you only made things worse.

744
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,342
This wasn't a move against the cops.

745
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:13,969
It was a move against you.

746
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,264
I have the evidence we hid

747
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,058
regarding Park Gun-ho's death.

748
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,895
With that evidence, the cops will find out
that Jo Seong-dae was the culprit.

749
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,732
And that will naturally lead them to you.

750
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,609
Then you won't be able to get out of it.

751
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,405
Couldn't you have discussed this with me?

752
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,990
How do you expect me to trust you?

753
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,492
Mr. Oh.

754
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,579
If I ended up getting fired
because of this case,

755
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,583
you would've tried to kill me
just like how you wanted to kill Ji-hyeok.

756
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,502
What do you want me to do?

757
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,046
There are three things I want you to do.

758
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,257
Number one.

759
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,218
Let me live in peace.

760
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,846
Number two.

761
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,851
Pull some strings to prevent
the reinvestigation from going well.

762
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,562
Number three.

763
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,942
Pray to God that I don't get caught.

764
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,460
I'm sorry. I should've called you earlier.

765
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:33,131
No, I understand. I know you have
a lot to take care of these days.

766
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,090
Yes, exactly.

767
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,053
This is a bit embarrassing,
but because I run a business,

768
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,388
I often visit fortune-tellers.

769
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,973
I went to see one earlier this year,

770
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,227
and I was told that I will have
a lot of things to worry about this year.

771
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,603
Oh, dear.

772
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,982
But it wasn't all bad.

773
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,901
Amid all my worries and troubles,

774
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,071
I was told that someone will show up
and help me take care of everything.

775
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,699
Do you think that might be

776
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,203
Yoo Jeong-ryeol and Yoo Jeong-seok?

777
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,372
I'm not sure.

778
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:10,418
Just because you gave them money
and know their weaknesses

779
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,630
doesn't mean they'll help you.

780
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,217
If you disclose their weaknesses,

781
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,010
they might become
the cause of your worries.

782
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,929
Yes, I know that much.

783
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,974
You need to find a bigger weakness.

784
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,146
-And what's that?
-I only have a hunch.

785
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,815
There's no clear evidence.

786
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,277
But if you

787
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,532
help me confirm just one thing,

788
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,660
I might be able to approach it
with a bit more confidence.

789
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,123
And what may that be?

790
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,169
Lee Dae-cheol got executed
for murdering a college student and a cop.

791
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,799
I don't care who killed
the female college student.

792
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:02,012
But that detective.
What I want to know is who killed

793
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,599
-Detective Jang Jin-su.
-How would I know that?

794
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,519
You just need to help me confirm

795
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,231
that the person
who killed the college student

796
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,358
didn't kill the cop.

797
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,654
Yoo Jeong-seok

798
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,741
and Yoo Jeong-ryeol have me tied up.

799
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,036
I need to know their weakness.

800
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,705
And when I find something,

801
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:32,000
I plan to share their weakness with you.

802
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:42,510
If I were the culprit
who murdered Yoon Ji-seon,

803
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,555
I wouldn't have been dumb enough

804
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,225
to get myself in a bigger mess
by killing the detective in charge.

805
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:54,397
But of course,
this is just based on a hypothesis.

806
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,489
My goodness,
it looks like I might be the guy

807
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,616
to free you from all your troubles.

808
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,118
Yes.

809
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,005
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

810
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,966
INCHEON METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

811
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,551
Why is there so much going on
at Incheon Seobu Police Station?

812
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,345
Aren't you in charge?

813
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,932
The Civil Petition Division
had nothing to do with this case.

814
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,684
How did you deal with Kang Do-chang?

815
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,395
I gave him a warning.

816
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,563
You gave him a warning? That's it?

817
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,774
I checked everything,

818
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,486
but I couldn't find anything big enough
to get him disciplined.

819
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,906
You couldn't find any dirt on him?

820
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,243
Then create it.

821
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,206
-Pardon?
-Don't create what doesn't exist.

822
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,333
If he's clean, search his surroundings.

823
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,127
Parents, siblings, and friends.

824
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,337
I'm sure you'll find something.

825
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:03,091
We need to keep Kang Do-chang grounded.

826
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:07,554
I bet Park Gun-ho's death is
being reinvestigated because of him.

827
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,432
-That's--
-Kang Do-chang

828
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,060
tried to fight against
the organization he works for.

829
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,062
If we don't do anything about that,

830
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:20,191
other people might repeat what he did.

831
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,541
BANK STATEMENT
DEPOSITOR: KANG DO-CHANG

832
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,794
BANK STATEMENT
ACCOUNT HOLDER: KANG EUN-HUI

833
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,508
CALL HISTORY
NAME: KANG DO-CHANG

834
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,306
Let me keep working as a detective.

835
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,726
So please don't take my title
as a detective from me.

836
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,730
Is that enough of an answer for you,
Lieutenant Yoon Sang-mi?

837
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,120
We checked the streets
near the abandoned apartment

838
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,830
where Park Gun-ho was murdered,

839
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,124
the gas station CCTV footage,

840
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,002
and the entrance ramp
that leads to the abandoned apartment.

841
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,505
Hey, that's…

842
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,381
-That's Jo Seong-dae, right?
-Yes.

843
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,800
That means he killed him.

844
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:32,055
But there was another guy
who came to the abandoned apartment.

845
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,520
The owner of the car is Shin Geun-ho.

846
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,856
He used to be a prison guard,
and he worked with Park Gun-ho.

847
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,399
So there was an accomplice?

848
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,529
I have the bloodstain test result
from the crime scene.

849
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,155
Whose blood is it?

850
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,407
Jo Seong-dae's.

851
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,368
Nice.

852
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,162
Do you think you can catch him right away?

853
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,165
The thing is, he completely hid himself

854
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,834
after Captain Nam did that interview.

855
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,002
What about this guy?

856
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,879
I already met him a while ago.

857
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,464
What?

858
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,009
The cops came to see me.

859
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,637
They left after I faked my alibi.

860
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,264
But I think they might come back soon.

861
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,685
It turns out they haven't banned me
from leaving the country yet.

862
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,062
So can you give me some money?

863
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,398
I don't need much.

864
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,275
Just enough to help me stay overseas.

865
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,354
Here.

866
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,649
What?

867
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,585
I thought this might be more exciting.

868
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,088
You made this too easy for us.
It's kind of boring.

869
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,759
You're under arrest
for the murder of Park Gun-ho.

870
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,471
-Hey!
-You punk!

871
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,598
-You jerk. Come on.
-Jo Seong-dae.

872
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,017
-Don't mind me. Just get him.
-Lower your weapon.

873
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,727
-Hey!
-Don't move, you punk.

874
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,104
-Careful.
-Move.

875
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,398
-Just catch him!
-Gosh, move.

876
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,193
-Gosh, that little…
-Come here, you punk!

877
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,820
-My gosh.
-That crazy jerk.

878
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,121
Hey!

879
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,416
You punk!

880
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,762
-Go get him!
-You bastard!

881
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,264
Come here!

882
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,021
Hey, hey!

883
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,899
Hey!

884
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,903
Go!

885
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,825
-Come here!
-Stop!

886
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,034
Hey!

887
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,331
Go left.

888
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,755
You darn punk.

889
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,890
You owe me a fight.

890
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,350
Come on.

891
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,518
Bring it on.

892
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:09,439
You can't use a weapon. That's cheating.
Lose the knife.

893
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,710
Where's Jo Seong-dae?

894
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,087
Gosh, you startled me.

895
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,673
He entered that building
about 30 minutes ago.

896
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,758
-Oh, okay.
-How's your face?

897
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,719
That punk may act tough, but he's nothing.

898
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,471
You did great.

899
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,808
Don't get me wrong.

900
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:30,978
It's not that I couldn't catch him.
I let him hit me on purpose.

901
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,022
Yes, I know. Good job.

902
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,357
Thanks.

903
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,110
When are you going to catch him?

904
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,695
Catching him isn't important.

905
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,406
We need to make him talk.

906
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,158
Hey, there's Jo Seong-dae.

907
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,212
What happened?

908
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,007
I fell for a trap.

909
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,595
It looks like those detectives are
determined to catch me.

910
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,347
Is this place safe?

911
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,433
Yes, it's safe here.

912
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,684
Don't get caught.

913
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,978
That should never happen.

914
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,570
A SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE HYUN-WOOK

915
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,546
You almost had him. Why let him go?

916
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:41,591
We wanted to see how Oh Jong-tae reacts.

917
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,718
Why don't you leave the politics to me?

918
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,636
Why? Because I won't be good as you?

919
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,555
Jo Seong-dae came out of his hideout.

920
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,640
Have a safe trip!

921
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,894
We'll see each other
at the police station soon.

922
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,645
How can we catch Yoo Jeong-seok?

923
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,314
Why don't you try throwing him bait?

924
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,733
Yoo Jeong-seok will reveal
who is behind him.

925
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,943
I heard you're pretty close with Jong-tae.

926
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,238
Why don't you convince him
to pay for what he did wrong?

927
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:08,367
Do you really think my boss
is secretly working with Oh Jong-tae?

928
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,411
I guess we're allies now.

929
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:15,082
