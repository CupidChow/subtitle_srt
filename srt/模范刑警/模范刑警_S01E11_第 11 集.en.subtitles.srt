1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,422
Right here. Watch carefully.

2
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,882
I hesitated here for a moment.

3
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,842
That's when I held myself back.

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,471
I could have smashed him,

5
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,139
but I chose to hold myself back.

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,683
-Do you get it?
-But why?

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,853
-Why did you hold back?
-Because I had to let him go.

8
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,355
You almost had him. Why let him go?

9
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,441
Even if Jo Seong-dae,
that jerk gets caught,

10
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,610
he won't tell us anything.

11
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,279
It was because we wanted to see

12
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,823
how Oh Jong-tae reacts
since he's the one behind him.

13
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,951
For us, the important thing
is to catch Oh Jong-tae.

14
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,745
I understand that.

15
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,747
But why did we get this CCTV footage?

16
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,791
It's just humiliating for us.

17
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,834
We'll make sure everyone sees this

18
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,420
and use it as the means
to pressure Jo Seong-dae and Oh Jong-tae.

19
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,673
So you want people to watch a video

20
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,134
-where a suspect is beating up a cop?
-Yes.

21
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,552
Ji-hyeok. Have you lost your mind?

22
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,430
Jae-hong's face is
clearly seen in the video.

23
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,724
He will be too embarrassed
to keep working as a cop.

24
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,811
We can just blur his face out.

25
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,104
Hey, why would you blur it out?

26
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,816
My face should be shown in the video.

27
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,487
I'm going to be a star soon.
Don't you think so?

28
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,990
Play it again.

29
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,867
Watch it carefully.

30
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,911
Look. I hesitated to let him attack me.

31
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,996
With a merciful heart,

32
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,249
I'm being cruelly considerate.

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,425
I just don't get it.

34
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,053
He'll tell us everything
if we catch him and interrogate him.

35
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,681
I don't understand what we're waiting for.

36
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,518
A grasshopper like you would never
understand what the plans of a master.

37
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,147
It's like we're giving him our flesh
to take his bones.

38
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,314
You fool.

39
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,819
I guess this is why
people should read books.

40
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,195
Hang on.

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,406
Here.

42
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,993
Right here.
This is where the appendix is, right?

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,329
Damn it.

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,001
-Cut it.
-Are you sure about this?

45
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,169
Just cut it
before the ambulance gets here.

46
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,880
Damn it.

47
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,431
Wait. You…

48
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,975
You're not shaking, are you?

49
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,019
Be bold and cut it in one go.

50
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,855
If you give me a squiggly scar,
I'll kill you.

51
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,231
Close your eyes.

52
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,206
Incheon Seobu Police Station,
Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

53
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,541
Detective Kwon Jae-hong.

54
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,877
Your strong sense of duty

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,881
set an example
for all the hardworking police officers.

56
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,262
I, along with your colleagues,
wish you a speedy recovery

57
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,849
and hope you will return to work
as soon as possible.

58
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,690
I simply did my duty as a police officer.

59
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,983
Thank you.

60
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,321
Could you tell us about the situation
where he tussled with the culprit?

61
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,822
Sure.

62
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,703
When Detective Kwon Jae-hong
ran into the culprit,

63
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,374
his appendix had already burst.

64
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,794
But he was determined
to catch the culprit,

65
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,964
so he engaged in a fight against him.

66
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,759
I've always been worried

67
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,594
that he doesn't spare himself.

68
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,471
He goes through fire and water
for his work.

69
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,639
Thank you.

70
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,224
Are you all right?

71
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,769
Yes. I think the cut might get infected.

72
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,187
Really?

73
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,439
Doctor! Doctor!

74
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:38,528
SERGEANT KWON INJURED WHILE
CHASING PARK GUN-HO'S MURDER SUSPECT

75
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,196
When he ran into the culprit,

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,824
-his appendix had already burst.
-Thank you.

77
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,076
But he was determined
to catch the culprit,

78
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,370
so he engaged in a fight against him.

79
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,540
My body doesn't hurt at all.

80
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,418
But the fact that I lost the culprit
when he was within my reach

81
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,547
makes me furious and upset.

82
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,049
He's a real cop.

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,552
This is the prime suspect
in Park Gun-ho's murder case,

84
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,138
which was previously concluded as suicide.

85
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,764
He's Jo Seong-dae.

86
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,683
Incheon Seobu Police Station will

87
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,144
launch an open investigation
and make our best endeavors

88
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,189
to arrest Jo Seong-dae who ran away

89
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,526
after assaulting a police officer
with a burst appendix.

90
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,820
Have you secured
sufficient evidence on the suspect?

91
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,697
We've confirmed Jo Seong-dae's face

92
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,574
in the CCTV footage from the vicinity.

93
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,827
And his blood was found at the scene.

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,871
How is the assaulted police officer doing?

95
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,581
He's still recovering.

96
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,542
With a lot of encouraging comments
on the Internet,

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,003
he is regaining his mental stability.

98
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,131
Have you figured out
Jo Seong-dae's whereabouts yet?

99
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,843
Not yet. But with the open
investigation launched,

100
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,347
I believe it will be difficult for him
to stay on the run from the police.

101
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,310
I swear on my honor
that the police will be sure

102
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,689
to track down and arrest
Jo Seong-dae no matter what.

103
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,527
I'd like to ask the citizens
to work with the police--

104
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,571
Gosh, I'm hungry.

105
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,406
I didn't eat anything all night.

106
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,700
Why do my eyes swell up
whenever I eat something? Hey.

107
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,787
Is Eun-hye up yet?

108
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,916
Is she still sleeping?
You should wake her up then.

109
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,875
Eun-hye.

110
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,711
I'm home.

111
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,631
Where did you go so early in the morning?

112
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,965
Well…

113
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,467
She just got home.

114
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,804
-What do you mean?
-She was out all night like you.

115
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,138
And she just got home.

116
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,974
Is that true? Did you just get home?

117
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,018
-What did you do all night?
-I had something to do.

118
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,562
What is it you had to do all night?

119
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,272
Are you out of your mind?

120
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,942
Why did you stay out all night
when you have your home?

121
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,903
You should've called me if Eun-hye
didn't come home last night.

122
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,823
Why were you doing nothing?
What if something happened to her?

123
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,199
It's a scary world out there!

124
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,243
She called me and said
she wouldn't come home.

125
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,245
Then you should've asked her why.

126
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,038
Why did you not come home?

127
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,875
Do you still hang out
with the guys from earlier?

128
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,087
Why? Do you not want me
to hang out with them?

129
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,174
I only have friends
whom you consider to be bad.

130
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,344
No, that's not what I meant.

131
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,221
I'm just worried.

132
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,722
You can meet your friends.

133
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,433
But I'm still worried,

134
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,185
so I want you to give me
the number of your best friend.

135
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,728
Why would I?

136
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,439
What?

137
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,315
If something happens,
and I can't reach you,

138
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,775
I should call your friend.

139
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,277
I don't think that's what it is.

140
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,487
Eun-hye, I'm just…

141
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,575
The night shift part-timer got sick,
so I filled in for him.

142
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:31,951
Happy now?

143
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,286
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

144
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,663
Eun-hye, let's eat breakfast together.

145
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,706
I'll eat this.

146
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,499
Why would you eat cup noodles?

147
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,834
Eun-hye. Eun-hye!

148
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,213
Gosh, just leave her alone.
You novice single dad.

149
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,466
What's with her? Did you fight with her?

150
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,427
That's just how she lives.

151
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,598
She doesn't think she has to tell us
every detail of her life.

152
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,393
Kids these days don't give
their friends' numbers to their dads.

153
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
And she's comfortable eating cup noodles
because that's what she used to eat.

154
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,648
What's wrong about that?

155
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,734
What do you think is a problem?

156
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,487
I think it's a problem
that you're nitpicking.

157
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,073
Don't try to act like her father.

158
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,203
You should learn more about girls first.

159
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,038
No.

160
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,208
You've never tried to learn anything
your whole life. Forget it.

161
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,294
Just keep struggling as you always have.

162
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,963
Lead a lonely life forever.

163
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,177
Hey, do you think
she happens to be on her period?

164
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,596
How could you… Don't be ridiculous.

165
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,431
Forget it, you wench.

166
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,976
SOCIAL DISINTEGRATION AGGRAVATED
DUE TO FIRST EXECUTION IN 23 YEARS

167
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,064
I think the first article came out well.
It's getting good feedback.

168
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,483
EXECUTION DOES NOT PREVENT CRIME

169
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,152
And Gwang-hui's article looks
nice and clean.

170
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,405
The last one is exclusive.
Why did you not turn it in?

171
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,949
I'll check it with the police first.

172
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,868
- Check what?
-It's the recording of a cop.

173
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,912
I should ask the Civil Petition Division.

174
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,331
Do you think you can?
I'm sure it was illegally recorded.

175
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,458
I'll give it a try anyway.

176
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,336
If it doesn't work out, I'll write
a simple report only with the content.

177
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,428
Hello. I'm Jin Seo-kyung
from Jeonghan Daily.

178
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,846
You're not supposed to be here.

179
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,224
I'd like to talk to the head
of the Civil Petition Division.

180
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,559
Let's talk outside.

181
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,228
This is the audit team,
so it's off-limits to reporters.

182
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,604
It won't take long.

183
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,110
The head of the Civil Petition Division
is not here now.

184
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,696
Please send questions
through the spokesman's office.

185
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,406
-Excuse me then.
-Let me ask you one thing.

186
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,742
You audited Chief Moon Sang-beom
for bribery, right?

187
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,787
You recorded his conversation, didn't you?

188
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,873
Where did you hear that? Who informed you?

189
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,419
-Pardon?
-Identify the informant first.

190
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,712
Then I'll look into it for you.

191
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,714
No. We're supposed to protect our sources.

192
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,007
Ms. Jin.

193
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,385
When you come all the way here
to check something with us,

194
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,429
you should at least tell us

195
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,931
who, where, what, why,
and how you were informed,

196
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,434
then ask if it's correct or not.

197
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,855
Of course, through the spokesman's office.

198
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,946
How could she be so cold?

199
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,699
Gosh, she's so heartless.

200
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,999
POLICE AND PROSECUTION SUSPECTED
OF MAKING A DEAL TO COVER UP EVIDENCE

201
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,502
This is good enough. Post it as exclusive.

202
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,754
Okay.

203
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,923
It still bothers me to say that it was
recorded by the Civil Petition Division.

204
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,259
I failed to confirm it
with the person in charge.

205
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,678
Then make it vague
by saying that it's reported

206
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,513
by a police official.

207
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,765
Then it won't be a problem.

208
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,267
Okay. I'll revise and post the article.

209
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,020
Did it take some load off your mind?

210
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,235
Do you think I'm doing this
for personal reasons?

211
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,489
You said news articles are
all about timing.

212
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,282
That's the bigger reason.

213
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,015
-Where are you?
-He's taking different routes than usual.

214
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,934
-He's heading to the harbor.
-Okay.

215
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,229
Make sure to keep your distance
so that he doesn't notice you.

216
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,192
-Hello?
-It's me.

217
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,027
Jo Seong-dae came out of his hideout.

218
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,155
Yes. He's going somewhere by car.

219
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,948
Jo Seong-dae finally started to move.

220
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,535
Okay. Make sure he doesn't notice you
while you follow him.

221
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,744
Yes, sir.

222
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,752
Stay in hiding for a while.

223
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,963
Then I'll take care of things here.

224
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,091
-I'll call you once it's settled.
-Okay.

225
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,386
You did a good job.

226
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,721
I…

227
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,765
I never forget those who help me.

228
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,768
Guide him.

229
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,826
It might be uncomfortable,
but hang in there for now.

230
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,744
I'll come visit you

231
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,288
in the Philippines when I have time.

232
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,081
I'll see you at the beach.

233
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,335
Let's go.

234
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,090
-Have a safe trip.
-All right.

235
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,444
Come here!

236
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,591
Die!

237
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,986
Get up.

238
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,195
Drop your weapons.

239
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,532
If I shoot from here, the bullet will
bounce off the wall and kill a few of you.

240
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,659
Are you okay with that?

241
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,494
Drop them.

242
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,294
Come here.

243
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,198
Aren't you grateful?

244
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,034
We saved your life, you fool.

245
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,036
Go.

246
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,591
-Hello?
-We'll see each other at the station.

247
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,677
It will be very soon.

248
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,480
SEOBU POLICE STATION

249
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,029
Tell me if it hurts.
I'll send you to the hospital.

250
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,285
Now that you escaped death,
you should live long, right?

251
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,329
Don't even try to get released.

252
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,248
Once you get out, you'll be killed.

253
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,710
You'll live longer in jail.
It's safer there.

254
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,546
-He can't be safe even in jail.
-What?

255
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,299
Oh Jong-tae tried to kill Lee Dae-cheol
when he was in jail.

256
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,967
What do we do then?

257
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,094
You have no way to stay alive.

258
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,764
It's not that he has no choice.

259
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,099
We can put Oh Jong-tae in jail too.

260
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,144
Oh, you're right. That's an option.

261
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,689
That way, you can stay alive and get back
at the jerk who tried to kill you.

262
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,483
Kill two birds with a stone.

263
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,696
Do you know
why Jong-tae tried to kill you?

264
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,740
He's simple.

265
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,367
In his world, you're just a bug.

266
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,662
Something he can just squash.

267
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,634
PARK GUN-HO'S MURDER SUSPECT UNDER ARREST

268
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,303
POLICE AND PROSECUTION SUSPECTED
OF MAKING A DEAL TO COVER UP EVIDENCE

269
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,519
Did I keep you waiting for long?
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,770
No, it's okay.

271
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,941
Jeonghan Daily has recently been
taking the government's side outright.

272
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,611
Is Mr. Yoo Jeong-seok planning
to get into politics?

273
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,156
How can we catch Yoo Jeong-seok?

274
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,034
"Catch" him?

275
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,705
Why don't you try throwing him
the bait I gave you?

276
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,751
Yoo Jeong-seok will reveal
who is behind him.

277
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,882
Prosecutor Jung,
please help me out just this once.

278
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,635
Can you call the civil petition officer
and talk to him?

279
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,679
I have no power.

280
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,306
Do you not remember
Lee Dae-cheol's case from five years ago?

281
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,811
If you didn't ask me for a favor,
I would've let him go.

282
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,814
Chief Moon, what are you talking about?

283
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,775
You asked me to conceal the evidence.

284
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,863
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?
You're unbelievable.

285
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,365
Okay, fine.

286
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,576
Just don't go around
talking about that to anyone else.

287
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,786
Okay, sure. I'll forget about

288
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,583
everything that happened between us
as of this very moment.

289
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,796
The police carried out an internal
investigation on the prosecution

290
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,423
and even committed illegal wiretapping?

291
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,260
That's not true. We were just
inspecting one of our executives,

292
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,845
and it was recorded by accident.

293
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,599
Anyway, a prosecutor's voice was recorded.

294
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,226
It shows how much the police

295
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,520
are looking down on the prosecution now.

296
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,607
I admit that wiretapping is wrong.

297
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,985
But you should also admit that
the prosecution committed irregularity

298
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,362
before criticizing the faults
of the police.

299
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,491
Don't you think we can't reveal
the police's irregularities?

300
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,245
Do you want us to expose everything
pretending it's a mistake?

301
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,123
We also have as much information.

302
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,875
What? Do you want
to turn this into a fight?

303
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,211
Now the police think
they are just as powerful.

304
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,921
Hey, times have changed.

305
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,048
The prosecution can't
look down on the police now.

306
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,717
-Just do as you're told.
-Are you serious?

307
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,595
-That's enough. Be quiet.
-All right.

308
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,222
-This is ridiculous.
-Please keep quiet.

309
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,349
We're here to settle a problem,

310
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,850
not to criticize each other.

311
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,645
The problem is
that once the recording is revealed,

312
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,899
both the prosecution and the police
will face criticism from the public.

313
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,069
And what's more serious is
that the file was found

314
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,656
by a newspaper company, not an insider
of the prosecution or the police.

315
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,326
Mr. Yoo Jeong-seok.
What are you going to do?

316
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,246
You must have brought it here for a reason
instead of writing an article.

317
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,341
Just as you said, I was going
to write an article about it.

318
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,759
It would have made a great story.

319
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,095
But considering the impact it would bring,

320
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,597
I decided I shouldn't prioritize
the article.

321
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,724
Humiliating the prosecution and the police

322
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,184
wouldn't do the public any good.

323
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,435
Then

324
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,229
what do you suggest we do?

325
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,482
We have two options.

326
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,236
The easy one is
that we write articles about it

327
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,698
and you will reinvestigate
Lee Dae-cheol's case.

328
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,659
Things will get complicated
with a retrial and everything,

329
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
but that's not my concern.

330
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,331
The second option is

331
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,168
to expedite the execution.

332
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,130
Then the recording will be of no use.

333
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,009
Of course the choice rests
with this meeting and you, Minister.

334
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,019
After expediting the execution
with the recording file,

335
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,395
you'll reveal it

336
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,106
to find grounds
to abolish the death penalty?

337
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,235
There's one more thing
we can gain by revealing it.

338
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,281
It shows the weakness
of the prosecution and the police.

339
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,658
There are things we haven't written about.

340
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:12,080
And it will give us the power
to lead those two by the nose.

341
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,126
Why don't you

342
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,920
leave the politics to me?

343
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,214
I'd like you to stay as a news reporter.

344
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,842
Why? Because I won't be good as you?

345
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,511
Because you're getting carried away.

346
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,723
You've been like that
for the past few years.

347
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,392
It looks a bit dangerous to me.

348
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,813
I'm just busy. Don't worry about me.

349
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,523
I'll get going.

350
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,331
-Yes, about the article…
-What happened?

351
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,291
We will check and get back to you.

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,379
I'd like you to stay as a news reporter.

353
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,632
It looks a bit dangerous to me.

354
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,813
Yes, Prosecutor General.

355
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,817
The article? Please don't worry about it.

356
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,945
There will be no follow-up.

357
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,655
We should wrap things up here.

358
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,952
No. Please let me treat you to a meal.

359
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,870
Okay.

360
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,082
It's been revealed that the prosecution
and the police

361
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,460
covered up important evidence
while investigating Lee Dae-cheol

362
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,170
who was recently executed.

363
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:46,383
According to the conversation between
a prosecutor and a police executive,

364
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,219
the executive would have
released Lee Dae-cheol

365
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,555
if it weren't for the prosecutor's order.

366
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,431
CHIEF MOON SANG-BEOM

367
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,475
You know Jin Seo-kyung of Jeonghan Daily.

368
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,310
Don't let her in our station.

369
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,771
Say she's broken an embargo or something.

370
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,773
Just find anything on her.

371
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,026
According to a police official,
when the Civil Petition Division caught

372
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,238
the executive's corruption, he asked
the prosecutor for a special favor

373
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,907
regarding Lee Dae-cheol's case.

374
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,410
So we asked the Civil Petition Division

375
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,414
who has allegedly recorded
the conversation to confirm the matter,

376
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,874
but they refused to comment on it.

377
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,552
What do we do about this?

378
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,888
My goodness.

379
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,226
What is this?

380
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,228
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO KILL
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING

381
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,480
DEATH PENALTY IS THE ONLY WAY
TO SEND FELONS TO HELL

382
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,107
THIS REPORTER NEEDS TO WATCH HER BACK

383
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,360
REPORTER JIN LOOKS GOOD IN HER JEANS

384
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,571
AREN'T THEY THE SAME JEANS
SHE WAS WEARING YESTERDAY?

385
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,579
Mr. Yoo. Things have finally
quieted down after the retrial.

386
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,663
Why are you doing this?

387
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,833
Reporters have to write
about what they found out.

388
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,252
And things will be worse
if it's covered by other companies.

389
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,004
It's better to keep things
under my control.

390
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,089
Still, you promised
you wouldn't write about it.

391
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,466
It's already published.

392
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,843
Just listen to me
and find someone to take the fall.

393
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,053
That's your expertise.

394
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,931
What about the prosecution?
They will make an issue of it again.

395
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,683
I will deal with the prosecution.

396
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,102
You just need to find
someone to take the blame

397
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,479
and settle the issue internally.

398
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,105
Okay.

399
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,775
But please make sure this never…

400
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,031
So you think you have
both of us in your hands.

401
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,908
Yes?

402
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,207
-Did you want to see me?
-Yes, Lieutenant Yoon.

403
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,417
Did you read the article
of Jeonghan Daily?

404
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,670
-Yes.
-I heard

405
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,881
Reporter Jin, who wrote the article,
came to see you recently.

406
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,301
What did you two talk about?

407
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,511
No, I didn't…

408
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,056
I didn't say anything to her.

409
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,432
Are you sure?

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,062
I didn't even know
that the recording file existed.

411
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,855
So what could I have told her?

412
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,816
I see. I get it.

413
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,818
What do you mean?

414
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,696
Seriously, I didn't know anything

415
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,114
about the recording file.

416
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,532
I said I get it.

417
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,826
You can get back to work now.

418
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,347
Was the reason you lied at the retrial

419
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,434
to cover up the illegal wiretapping

420
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,102
of the Civil Petition Division?

421
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,021
Is that what you were ordered to do?

422
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,566
I thought you did it
to cover your own mistake.

423
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,859
So I understood you.

424
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,445
Because I knew you became
a cop to be successful.

425
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,739
But is that why

426
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,742
you made Lee Dae-cheol
die a wrongful death?

427
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,537
Just for the convenience of your division?

428
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,873
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

429
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,379
It's just that you and I
have chosen different paths.

430
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,089
But you're still a cop.

431
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,217
I get that you became a cop
to have a successful career,

432
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,886
but you're still a cop.

433
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,512
Just like me.

434
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,224
You also failed to save
Lee Dae-cheol's life anyway.

435
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,978
You recklessly head-butted
against a rock and ended up getting hurt.

436
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,648
You keep blabbing
about how righteous you are,

437
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,400
but you didn't get to change anything.

438
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,443
A cop?

439
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,488
Just because you catch
some thieves and murderers,

440
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,324
do you feel like you're a hero
who saves the world?

441
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,826
When I threatened you
and said I'd get you disciplined,

442
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,289
you begged me not to take away
your police badge,

443
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,916
did you not?

444
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,086
A sergeant
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

445
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,213
That's what you are, nothing more or less.

446
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,965
So know your place and stick to your job.

447
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,177
Yoon Sang-mi.

448
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,680
Don't call me your senior officer
ever again.

449
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,850
I don't have a colleague like you.

450
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,979
Just go.

451
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,788
You still don't have anything to tell me?

452
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,795
Do you actually think
Oh Jong-tae can get you out?

453
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,049
But we have solid evidence
against you this time.

454
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,509
You will never get out.

455
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,178
You'll take the fall for everything.
Are you okay with that?

456
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,271
He's not going to talk.

457
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,022
What do we do?

458
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,567
We should summon Oh Jong-tae as a witness

459
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,694
for a cross-examination.

460
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,529
Do you think he'll come?

461
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,449
We will issue a summons three times.
If he still doesn't come,

462
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,577
we will arrest him without a warrant.

463
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,624
WITNESS SUMMONS

464
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,224
Jo Seong-dae, that punk.

465
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,976
What is he expecting?

466
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,104
He thinks Oh Jong-tae is the only one
he can count on.

467
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,106
Does Oh Jong-tae have that much power?

468
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,234
He has Yoo Jeong-seok
and Yoo Jeong-ryeol behind him.

469
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,237
I think Jong-tae has something on them.

470
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,531
I get that it has something
to do with corruption.

471
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,743
But all they did was receive
some money during the campaign.

472
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,162
Why would they get a murder instigator out
to cover that?

473
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,498
That doesn't sound right.

474
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,417
I guess there's something else
we don't know about.

475
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,838
Oh, I see.

476
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,133
Ms. Jin isn't in the office right now.

477
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,886
Okay. I'm sorry about that.

478
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,350
I guess there's another Jin Seo-kyung
at Jeonghan Daily.

479
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,937
What brings you here?

480
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,564
I guess you are getting
a lot of calls looking for you.

481
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,982
You even turned your phone off.

482
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,860
Things will quiet down in a few days.

483
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,655
There are quite a lot
of threatening comments too.

484
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,572
Are you all right?

485
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,700
You can't be a reporter if you're
going to care about every comment.

486
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,287
Wait. No way.

487
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,249
Are you here because
you are worried about me?

488
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,125
I hardly worry about others.

489
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,045
Then why? What are you doing here?

490
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,840
Your article made things a lot easier
for our investigation.

491
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,008
I didn't write it
to help your investigation.

492
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,553
Anyway, I'm sure you didn't decide
to write it on your own.

493
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,305
Your boss must have approved it.

494
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,435
So I came here to thank him.

495
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,274
Hello, Mr. Yoo Jeong-seok.

496
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,276
Who are you?

497
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,736
He's a detective
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

498
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,738
He's here to thank you for the article.

499
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,075
I'm Oh Ji-hyeok. I heard a lot
about you from Jong-tae.

500
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,953
He's my cousin.

501
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,538
I see.

502
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,332
Detective Oh, why don't we talk outside?

503
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,293
The thing is,
I'm in a tough situation now.

504
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,088
Jong-tae is under investigation
for instigating murder.

505
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,965
So?

506
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,426
Detective Oh, what are you doing?
You can just talk to me.

507
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,137
I heard you're pretty close with Jong-tae.

508
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,099
And he never listens to me.

509
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,517
So when you see him,

510
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,853
why don't you convince him

511
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,398
to pay for what he did wrong?

512
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,610
Why are you saying that to him?

513
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,403
Get out of here. Follow me.

514
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,572
-Please.
-Stop it.

515
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,948
He just blurts things out.

516
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,659
Just go.

517
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,579
Just get out. Come on.

518
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,084
My goodness.

519
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,299
Why did you barge in on my boss like that?

520
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,884
You're just making me look bad.

521
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,012
If we fail to catch Jong-tae this time,
there won't be another chance.

522
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,474
And Lee Dae-cheol's case
will be buried for good.

523
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,558
Detective Oh.

524
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,561
Do you really think my boss

525
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,897
is secretly working with Oh Jong-tae?

526
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,316
-Yes. I'm convinced.
-What about objective evidence?

527
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,026
His brother is the Minister of Justice.

528
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,278
He can get a murderer out if he wants.

529
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,197
He's the head of the Current Affairs Team.

530
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,408
He's not someone
a mere lieutenant can deal with.

531
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,785
And you don't even have evidence.

532
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,329
Let's do this then.

533
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,666
I'll find the evidence,
and you'll find the facts.

534
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,584
Let's get things done
by the end of this week.

535
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,044
Why would I?

536
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,504
Call me as soon as you're done.

537
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,647
The recent article you wrote

538
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,233
regarding the victims' families.

539
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,859
I bet someone asked you to write it.

540
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,028
I want you to interview
the victims' families.

541
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,156
The person he wants dead is Lee Dae-cheol.

542
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,950
Oh Jong-tae wouldn't be the culprit.

543
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,203
It's someone
who's more powerful than he is.

544
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,496
He'd want to protect Jong-tae.

545
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,748
I mean, it's his brother,
the next Minister of Justice.

546
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,375
CANDIDATE YOO JEONG-RYEOL

547
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,670
So he turned out to be Yoo Jeong-ryeol
and Yoo Jeong-seok's weakness.

548
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,879
You'll win?

549
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,507
If Lee Dae-cheol gets acquitted,
does that mean you win?

550
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,265
There's something I'm looking into.

551
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,560
The central office has a drug case

552
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,438
that involves an idol singer,

553
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,897
but they wouldn't share it with us.

554
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,525
Not if we ask for it alone.

555
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,570
Team up with a TV network
and contact them again.

556
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,363
We should be the only newspaper though.

557
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,322
Okay.

558
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,908
And as for the police,
we should wait a little.

559
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,745
-We've been pushing them too hard.
-Okay.

560
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,163
Is there anything else?

561
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,499
Mr. Yoo, we got a complaint
from the advertising department.

562
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,002
Why did they contact you, not me?

563
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,503
What is it about?

564
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,297
It's a big advertisement deal.

565
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,382
And the company is
Incheon Jeil Investment Trust.

566
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,136
CEO Oh Jong-tae wants to meet with you.

567
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,139
-Why would he want to see me?
-Mr. Yoo.

568
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,266
Can I come with you?

569
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:23,936
Why do you want to meet him?

570
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,273
I've tried to contact him a few times
for the case of Seobu Police Station,

571
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,858
but I couldn't reach him.

572
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,694
If you're uncomfortable,
I can meet him in your stead.

573
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,112
Just set up an appointment for me.

574
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,242
That's fine.

575
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,497
Actually, it's better this way since there
won't be any misunderstandings.

576
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,165
Yes.

577
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,878
I'll text you the time and place.

578
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,047
Okay.

579
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,053
Why don't you try throwing him
the bait I gave you?

580
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,848
What are you talking about?

581
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,393
Yoo Jeong-seok was at the scene
five years ago.

582
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,564
On the day Detective Jang Jin-su
was murdered.

583
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,274
Right at the scene.

584
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,194
Why?

585
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,822
What was he doing there?

586
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,782
He went there to meet someone.

587
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,829
And it was quite close
to the murder scene.

588
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,997
It matches the time of the murder as well.

589
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,460
Then are you saying
he murdered Detective Jang Jin-su?

590
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,711
What if he did?

591
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,881
He will probably bite the bait.

592
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,055
Now I can have a real conversation
with this guy.

593
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,724
Thank you, Doctor.

594
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,394
Have a nice day, Doctor.

595
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,068
I don't have to come here anymore.

596
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,778
I'm fine now.

597
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,824
The doctor said
you should keep taking your pills

598
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,325
and take good care of yourself.

599
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,454
More importantly, you need
peace of mind. You heard it, right?

600
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,291
Don't be stressed out.
Don't drink or smoke.

601
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,171
Hey, don't you think
you should quit your job as well?

602
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,424
You can't get stressed out
by some rude customers.

603
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,260
I'll take care of myself. Don't worry.

604
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,137
I'm saying this because of your condition.

605
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,347
A pretty girl like you shouldn't
collapse on the street.

606
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,766
There are a lot of bad guys out there.

607
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,351
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

608
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,354
I've lived alone for a long time.

609
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,524
I'm not used to being nagged.

610
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,194
Okay.

611
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,154
Shall we go eat then?

612
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,198
What do you like?
I'll buy you a nice meal.

613
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,116
-I like eating alone.
-What?

614
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:48,497
Okay. I got some extra pay
for working outside this month.

615
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,250
-I'd like to buy you some clothes.
-Why?

616
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,961
Why would you buy me clothes?

617
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,924
Well, if you don't want clothes,

618
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,884
tell me whatever you want.

619
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,428
I'll save money working part-time
and find my own place.

620
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,389
Until then,

621
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,602
just let me sleep at your place.

622
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,857
Eun-hye, is it uncomfortable
living with us?

623
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,861
You keep reminding me of my dad.

624
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,825
Is that hard for you?

625
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,247
I'm sorry.

626
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,749
I'm working the night shift again,
so I have to go to work now.

627
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,752
Eun-hye, wait.

628
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,641
He said you were his junior,
so I thought you were a man.

629
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,144
If you feel uncomfortable,
we can go somewhere else.

630
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,604
No. It's fine.

631
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,440
I can tell you're a reporter. You're cool.

632
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,819
This is where I drink alone
every now and then.

633
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,571
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not bribing you.

634
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,783
If you don't want to drink,

635
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,535
shall I get you coffee or other beverage?

636
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,828
No. I can drink.

637
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,500
It's nice to meet you.

638
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,553
So you want to help our company.

639
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,432
Yes. I'm planning to start a new business.

640
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,183
I need to promote my business,

641
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,144
and I want to return your favor.

642
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,729
That's why I've asked you to meet me.

643
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,148
Repay me?

644
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,444
I didn't do any favor for you.

645
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,324
I put it the wrong way.

646
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,661
I should say I want to apologize
for my mistake.

647
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,124
Mr. Oh, I have a few questions for you.

648
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,792
Do you mind if I ask them here?

649
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,127
What do you want to know?

650
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,172
A detective came to our office today.

651
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,549
He introduced himself as your cousin.

652
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,717
Did you know about this?

653
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,845
Yes.

654
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:12,183
He says you're a suspect
for inciting murder.

655
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,936
I think that's what Ms. Jin
is curious about.

656
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,816
-He said that?
-You know Jo Seong-dae, right?

657
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,153
He's the prime suspect
for Park Gun-ho's murder.

658
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,530
Park Gun-ho claimed
Lee Dae-cheol's innocence

659
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,824
and got murdered by someone.
I believe you know that.

660
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,827
During Lee Dae-cheol's retrial,
the attorney

661
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,996
pointed you out as the real culprit.

662
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,042
The watch found at the murder scene
turned out to be yours,

663
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,210
and the detective in charge

664
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,796
claimed that he covered up your crimes.

665
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,259
So it's you who wrote the article.

666
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,473
If you are proved to be guilty
of inciting Park Gun-ho's murder,

667
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,017
it will also prove
that you're the real culprit

668
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,685
of Yoon Ji-seon and Jang Jin-su's case.

669
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,230
Do you have anything to say
about these charges?

670
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,194
So you're saying

671
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,613
the person who killed

672
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,657
Yoon Ji-seon, Jang Jin-su, and Park Gun-ho

673
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,618
is me?

674
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,630
If I killed any of those three,

675
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,298
the most probable one is

676
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,592
Detective Jang Jin-su.

677
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,264
Why? Because he kept accusing me
of murder when I was innocent.

678
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,307
It pissed me off.

679
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,562
Are you admitting
that you killed Detective Jang Jin-su?

680
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,523
Tell the detectives to look into it.

681
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,066
Who knows? They might find evidence.

682
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,192
That's enough.

683
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,611
-Mr. Yoo, I'm not…
-I said that's enough.

684
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,074
We will gladly accept your offer
of the advertisement.

685
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,910
-Mr. Yoo.
-Let's go.

686
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,663
You know this conversation means nothing.

687
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,334
We will get going then.

688
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,295
Sure.

689
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,924
Oh, right. Mr. Yoo.

690
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,969
You had a sister, right?

691
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,015
She went through something
unfortunate because of the police

692
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,349
and committed suicide.

693
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,727
Is that true?

694
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,772
You must hold
a lot of grudges against the police.

695
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,151
Ms. Jin.

696
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,238
You shouldn't believe
everything the cops say.

697
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,283
A lot of them are pretty nasty.

698
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,139
Oh Jong-tae was about to say something.
Why did you stop me?

699
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,475
We just met him out of courtesy
for the advertisement deal.

700
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,644
That's it. There's nothing more to hear.

701
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,605
Then I had no reason
to come all the way here.

702
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,233
Oh Jong-tae isn't someone
who'll be fooled by you.

703
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,526
You need to stop here.

704
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,777
I'll see you tomorrow.

705
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,792
Jeong-seon.

706
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,505
MAY 11, 1987, 8 P.M.
YOO JEONG-SEON'S RESIDENCE

707
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,259
Jeong-seon.

708
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,387
Jeong-seon. Jeong-seon!

709
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,931
Jeong-seon.

710
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,599
Jeong-seon.

711
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,103
Please don't go.

712
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,065
Jeong-seon.

713
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,344
So…

714
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,432
Did Oh Jong-tae really kill
Detective Jang Jin-su?

715
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,853
Then why would he talk about it
in front of Mr. Yoo?

716
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,774
Gosh, I don't know.

717
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,030
MESSAGES

718
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,240
WHY DID YOU NOT WEAR JEANS?
YOU LOOK HOT IN JEANS

719
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,533
Damn it.

720
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,827
What an idiot.

721
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,291
DETECTIVE OH JI-HYEOK

722
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,918
Hello? Why are you
calling me at this hour?

723
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,046
Can you come out for a moment?

724
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,213
I have something for you.

725
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,341
Where are you now?

726
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,430
What do you have for me?

727
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,894
I asked my colleague
at the cyber team of the headquarters.

728
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,439
Jeans.

729
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,691
NAME: LEE YEONG-JUN
DATE OF BIRTH: APRIL 23, 1992

730
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,818
You came here to give me this
at this hour?

731
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,488
I was just passing by.

732
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,699
He's well-known in this field.

733
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,910
He leaves malicious comments
about female reporters.

734
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,536
And it always says the same thing.

735
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,331
I already have this much information.

736
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,291
I see.

737
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,629
I thought it probably had
something to do with our case.

738
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,215
I get it. It was a waste of time.

739
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,885
All right then.

740
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,513
It's cold.

741
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,015
Want some noodles?

742
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,019
I'd love that.

743
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,536
Can I have a beer too?

744
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,873
-You said you'd die.
-I'm fine now.

745
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,793
I'm serious.

746
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,172
If you pass out again,

747
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,509
I'll take you out to the street,
not to the hospital.

748
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,302
Okay?

749
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,304
Okay.

750
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,289
Detective Oh.

751
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,542
-You often have crushes on others, right?
-What?

752
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,171
You just hover around a girl
you like for a while

753
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,048
and give up on your own every time. Right?

754
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,180
No.

755
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,349
This is my first time.

756
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,646
Thank you for the food. Bye.

757
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,348
It happens a lot to people with insomnia.

758
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,612
If you have a hard time,
you should show it.

759
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,489
You fool.

760
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,140
Hello.

761
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,937
Hey. I just got off work.

762
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,273
I want to go home with you.

763
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,441
I need to work a little more.
You should go ahead.

764
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,570
I can eat something while I wait.

765
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,239
I'm going to have cup noodles.

766
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,325
Oh, it's right there.

767
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,788
There are so many different kinds.

768
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,124
The one with meat.

769
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,251
It has meat in it.

770
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,753
Cup noodles taste great
at this time of the day.

771
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,047
Hang on. Where's water?

772
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,841
You have to pay first.

773
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,426
Oh, you're right.

774
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,761
What was I thinking?

775
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,726
-Here.
-Thank you.

776
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,477
All right.

777
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,354
You can sit over there.

778
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,981
I'll add hot water and bring it to you.

779
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,691
Okay. Thank you.

780
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,239
Thanks.

781
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,867
Good evening.

782
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,590
Thank you. Bye.

783
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,895
All right. Let's go eat lunch.

784
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,439
Let's go. Mr. Ko, let's go.

785
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,150
Gosh, we're late.

786
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,407
The lunch is on the PR team
of the Police Agency. Let's go.

787
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,368
No. I have plans for lunch.
Go enjoy your meal.

788
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,238
Shall I eat now?

789
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,661
Are you up?

790
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,289
Yes. Why didn't you wake me up?

791
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,791
I felt bad watching you sleep,
so I couldn't.

792
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,919
You felt bad? I slept very happily.

793
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,838
If you're up, get out of there right away.

794
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,132
If you go through my place,
I won't let you be.

795
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,010
It's so messy that I was
going to clean up.

796
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,388
Just get out of there
before I come over and kick you out.

797
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,931
All right.

798
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,475
Where are you? I'll buy you lunch.

799
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,978
I'm eating with my colleagues now.

800
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,146
Just go to work.

801
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,149
Why did you buy this for me?
I wasn't even drunk.

802
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,151
I didn't buy it for you.

803
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,612
I just got it for myself,

804
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,572
but I forgot to drink it.

805
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,326
Call me whenever you need
someone to eat with.

806
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,577
I need to pay for the room.

807
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,621
That's not going to happen.

808
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,665
There are a lot of people
who are waiting to eat with me.

809
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,958
I see.

810
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,877
Call me.

811
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,923
Gosh.

812
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,929
Let me eat.

813
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,014
It looks nice.

814
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,319
-Are you going grocery shopping?
-Yes.

815
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,280
-Where?
-At the market.

816
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,658
You don't have to go to the market.

817
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,577
Just go to the convenience store
in the neighborhood.

818
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,121
Things are expensive there.

819
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,998
It costs twice as much.

820
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,751
It's for kids. Why would I shop there?

821
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,503
Still, now that you're going…

822
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,507
You want me to go to where Eun-hye works?

823
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,176
Things aren't that expensive
at the convenience store.

824
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,427
And they have various options.

825
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,721
They have a wide selection of alcohol.
It's your favorite.

826
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,058
I feed her and let her sleep here.

827
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,436
And now you want me
to increase the sales of her workplace?

828
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,441
Why? What's this all about?

829
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,736
Why do we have to care so much about her?

830
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,530
It's just…

831
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,115
If you have time to worry about her,

832
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,201
why don't you care about your own nephew?

833
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,036
Since I can't see him,

834
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,123
shouldn't you go
check up on him as his uncle?

835
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,875
Why do you think
I'm going grocery shopping?

836
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,421
I'm going to make Jae-ung's favorite food
and send them to him.

837
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,883
You used to adore him,

838
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,593
but are you done with him now?

839
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,847
Now that I'm divorced,
is he not your family anymore?

840
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,476
Gosh, I do care a lot about Jae-ung.

841
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,020
I've just been busy.

842
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,856
He's my son no matter what.

843
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,484
I gave birth to him.

844
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,000
There's a chocolate-flavored one
and a squid-flavored one.

845
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,669
Hey, come here.

846
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,795
Jae-ung!

847
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,006
Jae-ung!

848
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,640
What's with your face?

849
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,980
Are you sure your dad didn't hit you?

850
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,274
Are you sure?

851
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,235
I had a fight with other kids
at school today.

852
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,695
Really?

853
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,865
-Why?
-It's just

854
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,952
they keep picking a fight with me.

855
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,245
I didn't do anything though.

856
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,665
Those darn rascals.

857
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,584
-Did you hit them too?
-No.

858
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,503
They are a lot stronger than me.

859
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,756
Kim Jae-ung. You don't know yourself.

860
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,049
Aren't you your mom's son?

861
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,258
You are Kang Eun-hui's son.

862
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,262
When your mom was young,
she fought against 17 people alone

863
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,514
and beat all of them up

864
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,517
without even getting a scratch
on her face.

865
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,644
-Really?
-Yes.

866
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,855
Your mom is a judo gold medalist.

867
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,565
She was matchless.

868
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,484
Anyone who messed with her

869
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,778
was knocked out by her right away.

870
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,280
You should fight with confidence.

871
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,158
Just blow out those who bully you.

872
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,618
You can do that. Why?

873
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,037
Because you're Kang Eun-hui's son.

874
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:59,379
Don't be disappointed that
you don't get to see your mom lately.

875
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:04,884
You have your judo gold medalist
mom's blood in your heart.

876
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,139
Right in there.

877
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,975
She's always in there. Okay?

878
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,185
Okay.

879
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,273
Go ahead and eat.

880
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,984
If you want to eat more, just tell me.

881
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,694
I'll buy you anything.

882
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,321
Eat this too.

883
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,242
Eat this. And have my coke.

884
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,288
Hey.

885
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,834
Are you sure you sent him
a summons three times?

886
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,544
Did he receive it himself?

887
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,296
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

888
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,215
When you arrest him,
make sure to state the reason clearly.

889
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,508
I heard you.

890
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,094
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Ji-hyeok.

891
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,221
You never follow the protocols.

892
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,057
You just knock the suspects down.

893
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,769
Make sure to follow the protocols.

894
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,313
So Oh Jong-tae's attorney
can't find faults with you later on.

895
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,774
Okay. See you.

896
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,109
-Let's go.
-Protocols, my foot.

897
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,862
-What?
-I'm going to break his back.

898
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,031
What did you say? What is he saying?

899
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,491
Don't you dare!

900
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,086
You do look like a detective in here.

901
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,671
And you look like a culprit.

902
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,647
That jerk.

903
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,858
He doesn't seem nervous at all.

904
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,655
We should give him some time.

905
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,741
So he can get used to this place.

906
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,001
Have some tea while you wait.

907
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,003
We just caught an important suspect,

908
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,547
so they're working on the case now.

909
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,348
-Go inside.
-Curl the ball.

910
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,392
-Good defense.
-That was nice.

911
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,727
-All right. Kick it.
-Let's go.

912
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,896
They won two consecutive matches.

913
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,149
Yes!

914
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,112
Hey, if you're bored,
join us and watch it.

915
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,406
-Okay?
-It's a goal.

916
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,323
Or wait a while.

917
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,160
Hey, just watching the game
isn't so thrilling.

918
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,036
Why don't we make a bet on the game?

919
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,705
-Deal.
-That's good.

920
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,248
-Are you in?
-I'm in.

921
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,541
Come here. Write it down.

922
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,178
Gosh, I'm sorry.

923
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,220
Did you wait for long?

924
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,682
This is our slow season,

925
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,101
but we are having a lot of visitors today.

926
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,561
Please have a seat.

927
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,153
I know you are busy. I'm really sorry.

928
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,114
-Let's just get it over with.
-Okay.

929
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,701
I believe you know why you're here.

930
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,912
The thing is, we arrested Jo Seong-dae.

931
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,248
But he wouldn't come clean.

932
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,376
-You know Jo Seong-dae, right?
-I don't.

933
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,670
I don't know who it is.

934
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,465
Jo Seong-dae says he knows you.
But why do you not know him?

935
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,843
He even said that you two are very close.

936
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,596
You've had a lot of business deals,

937
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,765
and you even drank together many times.

938
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,141
Did I?

939
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,228
Do you think I'd hang out
with someone like him?

940
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,271
A scumbag like him?

941
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,152
If we keep talking,

942
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,238
I might figure out
who's telling the truth.

943
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,405
Hang on.

944
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,952
-Hey, bring Jo Seong-dae in.
-What?

945
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,205
Are you doing a cross-examination
without my consent?

946
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,792
Gosh. Just see his face
and tell me if you don't know him.

947
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,627
Let's make it quick. You waited for long.

948
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,131
Hey, Seong-dae.

949
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,509
Have a seat.

950
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,771
Do you know me?

951
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,359
Jo Seong-dae. You almost got killed
in the freight container at the port.

952
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,819
And we saved you. Do you remember?

953
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,823
Who do you think tried to kill you?

954
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,533
What are you talking about?

955
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,663
I'm just here
to give my testimony as a witness.

956
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,373
A detective is asking you!

957
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,710
Who tried to kill you?

958
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,295
We saw it right there.

959
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,046
Will you deny it?

960
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,856
Why are you staring at him, you idiot?

961
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,609
Do you think he tried to kill you?

962
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,777
Who knows?

963
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,281
How would a scumbag like me know that?

964
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,744
I bet it's the person
who ordered to murder Park Gun-ho.

965
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,622
He was afraid that you'd get caught
and talk about him,

966
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,582
so he tried to kill you.

967
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,085
Why do you keep staring at him?

968
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,088
-We are asking you now.
-Stop it.

969
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,178
You guys really exhaust me.

970
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:42,930
Let me ask him myself.

971
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,523
Hey, did I try to kill you?

972
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,028
And

973
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,699
am I the person
who ordered you to kill Park Gun-ho?

974
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,710
Answer my question now!

975
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,130
Why do I have to put up
with such humiliation here?

976
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,592
Why? Just answer my question.

977
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,552
It is you.

978
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,771
It's what he's claiming.

979
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,108
I told you I don't know this guy.

980
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,317
Yes, you did.

981
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,654
From now on,
you'll have to talk to my attorney.

982
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,656
Sure. We will.

983
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,825
And lastly,

984
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:47,036
let me say one thing
to Detective Oh Ji-hyeok.

985
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,541
I'm aware that you have a bad memory,

986
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,335
but you better remember

987
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,172
what you told me before.

988
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,686
SEOBU POLICE STATION

989
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,106
Remember it.

990
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,150
You better do.

991
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,416
We've finally caught Oh Jong-tae.

992
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,627
We're not there yet.
This is just the beginning.

993
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,965
Gosh, he's such a turn-off.

994
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,314
Was her name Jin Seo-kyung?
She really is something.

995
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,400
Did you talk to her after we met?

996
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,402
Not really.

997
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:05,656
I was quite flustered that day.
I was caught off guard.

998
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,161
Will you keep having your back
turned on me like that?

999
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,581
Will you be okay with me as your enemy?

1000
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,044
Your brother is the minister now.

1001
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,005
I think it's about time you can take over

1002
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,673
his constituency.

1003
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,093
Don't you think I'll be helpful?

1004
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,982
Who knew

1005
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,568
we'd be drinking together?

1006
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,898
Hello?

1007
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,235
The lawyer requested us
for additional photos of the crime scene.

1008
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,698
Okay, I'll file for a warrant
as soon as I'm done with this.

1009
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,782
Bye.

1010
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,699
You can't die now.

1011
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,534
You can die after you pay for your sins.

1012
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,912
I want you gone from my life!

1013
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,789
Like you said, someone must have his back.
That's the only way.

1014
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,542
Oh Jong-tae is a murderer.
Why are you protecting him?

1015
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:25,630
Why do I need to hear these fools
talk nonsense to me like this?

1016
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,214
That darn bastard.

1017
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:30,217
Your glass is way too small
to hold my drink.

1018
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,346
From now on, I'll be extra careful
not to make any mistakes.

1019
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,056
You made a deal with Lee Dae-cheol,
didn't you?

1020
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,265
What did he offer?

1021
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,684
Who is it? Who put you up to this?

1022
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,979
Mr. Yoo, what in the world happened here?

1023
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,941
I want to find the guy
who killed Jang Jin-su.

1024
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:50,071
