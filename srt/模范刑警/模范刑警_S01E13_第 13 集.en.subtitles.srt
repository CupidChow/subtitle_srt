1
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,159
Excuse me, miss.

2
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,537
We're the police. Give us a moment.

3
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,666
All right.

4
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,506
Nice. Let's take these.

5
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,182
Yes, Do-chang. We just collected
Oh Jong-tae's DNA.

6
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,142
We will send it to the NFS immediately.

7
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,185
Okay.

8
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,063
Tell them it's urgent
and ask them to make it quick.

9
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,189
Okay.

10
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,359
Do-chang.

11
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,987
This is the vehicle entry log
of our station

12
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,739
for the day Detective Jang was murdered.

13
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,908
Nam Guk-hyeon's car was parked
that morning,

14
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,368
and it left the following evening.

15
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,370
On the day of the murder,

16
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,123
he said Detective Jang went
to arrest Lee Dae-cheol by himself,

17
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,333
and he was tracking down
Lee Dae-cheol's whereabouts.

18
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,086
So it's possible that Nam Guk-hyeon
gave false testimony about that.

19
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,173
So you're saying Jang Jin-su and
Nam Guk-hyeon moved around together

20
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,424
in the same car that day?

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,804
This is Nam Guk-hyeon's
credit card history from five years ago.

22
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,640
He bought cigarettes at a store
that's five minutes away from the scene.

23
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,892
It matches the estimated time
of the murder.

24
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,980
Did you look into
Oh Jong-tae's alibi from back then?

25
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,567
Yes. He attended the opening ceremony
of Busan Hotel with his father that day.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,818
And there were witnesses.

27
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,445
Also, there's no way he'd leave an event

28
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,281
that involves his father.

29
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,076
Once we get the results from the NFS,

30
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,746
we can confirm that Oh Jong-tae is
the real culprit of Yoon Ji-seon's case.

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,123
All we have left to do

32
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,167
is find out the real culprit
of Jang Jin-su's case.

33
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,554
Let's add the assemblymen's comments
to the article about the prosecution.

34
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,307
Send it to the Politics Team
and ask them to check it.

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,308
Okay.

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,438
Any updates on Kim Gi-tae's retrial?

37
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,481
No. Not really.

38
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,691
Did you meet with him?

39
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,776
I couldn't. I just talked
to him on the phone.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,363
He said he's praying
and asked you to show him your leniency.

41
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,451
I don't understand why he keeps
dragging me into his business.

42
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,328
That's it for today.

43
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,000
I guess you didn't go home last night.
Did you work all night?

44
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,378
Yes. I was personally tipped off
about something.

45
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
Jun-seok.

46
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,600
I have something to ask you.

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,270
CURRENT AFFAIRS TEAM REPORT

48
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,147
Do you remember this report?

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,982
That's when you went to the Police Agency.

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,359
Yes.

51
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,946
Why were you looking for
the man named Jo Seong-gi?

52
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,032
It was when Mr. Yoo was
in charge of the copy desk.

53
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,743
I was told to locate his whereabouts
by the headquarters.

54
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,246
So Mr. Yoo went to Gawol Church

55
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,665
to meet Jo Seong-gi
after the report, right?

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,583
I don't know that.

57
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,210
The Current Affairs Team log says

58
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,587
Mr. Yoo was away on business that day.

59
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,756
So he did go to see him, right?

60
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,218
Why did Mr. Yoo go to see Jo Seong-gi?

61
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,096
Why don't you go ask him?

62
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,807
Why?

63
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,726
Is there a reason you can't
ask him directly?

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,729
No. I'll go ask him myself.

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,317
So did you get the report from the police?

66
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,819
I just need you to confirm it.

67
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,697
Thank you.

68
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,865
I don't know.

69
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,325
I'm not sure.

70
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,702
Do you remember the murder

71
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,954
that happened at the entrance
to the town five years ago?

72
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,039
A body was found in the reeds.

73
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,041
Yes, I remember that.

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,544
Did you see this guy that day?

75
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,045
Who is he?

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,213
He's a reporter.

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,090
A reporter from Jeonghan Daily.

78
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,052
Oh, right. A reporter did come
to see our pastor that day.

79
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,056
But I'm not sure if it was him.

80
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,562
Anyway, I remember him saying
he was from Jeonghan Daily.

81
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,357
I see.

82
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,239
JO SEONG-GI DISAPPEARED

HANKUK UNIVERSITY STUDENT COMMITTED
SUICIDE AFTER POLICE INVESTIGATION

90
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,230
Mr. Baek.

91
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,566
I'm going out for lunch.

92
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,693
Send me the afternoon reports
through the messenger.

93
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,820
Okay. By the way…

94
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,865
Ms. Jin said she has something to ask you.

95
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,871
What is it?

96
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,249
When will you be back?

97
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,168
Around three.

98
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,046
I'll tell you then.
I'm still working on it.

99
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,964
Okay. I'll see you then.

100
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,933
You had a sister, right?

101
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,645
She went through something
unfortunate because of the police

102
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,355
and committed suicide. Is that true?

103
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,949
JO SEONG-GI DISAPPEARED
DURING INVESTIGATION

104
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,408
Jo Seong-gi.

105
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,202
Yoo Jeong-seon.

106
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,335
I don't know what to do.

107
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,256
Where should we begin?

108
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,385
There are 45 residents in this town.

109
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,637
And there are 17 people
who could've passed by

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,931
or witnessed the scene
on the day of the murder.

111
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,436
Eight of them are children
or too old to move around.

112
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,688
I've checked the addresses
of the other nine residents.

113
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,232
So we'll probably find something
from the witnesses.

114
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,277
Hey, when did you do all the work?

115
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,490
And I found something strange
in the reports made in this town.

116
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,202
There's a pastor named Kim Gwang-hun
who worked at Gawol Church over there.

117
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,163
He was reported missing after the murder.

118
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,708
We need to find out if it has
something to do with this case.

119
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,502
Let's go to the church first.

120
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,629
Hey, do you not even sleep at night?

121
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,923
You think about the cases
day and night, right?

122
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,050
-Yes.
-You're so strange.

123
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,143
What are the guys from Team Two up to?

124
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,228
I don't know the details.

125
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,231
Apparently, they found new evidence
regarding Lee Dae-cheol's case.

126
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,691
Evidence?

127
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,401
What evidence?

128
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,154
They've been going
to the NFS a lot lately.

129
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,323
I bet it's physical evidence
like DNA or something.

130
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,074
I see.

131
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,661
Can you find out more about the evidence

132
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,413
they sent to the NFS?

133
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,165
Do you remember

134
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,335
the name of the detective
who just came to see you?

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,379
I don't know. I did see his ID though.

136
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,050
I guess it was Nam something.

137
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,927
-Nam Guk-hyeon?
-That's right.

138
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,762
What did he ask about?

139
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,349
He showed me a picture
and asked about a man.

140
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,768
Yes. Is this Pastor Kim Gwang-hun?

141
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,439
Did you work at Gawol Church
in Incheon by any chance?

142
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,738
I see. Okay. Thank you.

143
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,076
He's been working at a church
in South Gyeongsang for ten years.

144
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,702
He will send us the records.

145
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,789
So there's no more pastor
named Kim Gwang-hun out there, right?

146
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,207
No.

147
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,210
Does that mean he used a fake name?

148
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,045
It's highly possible that he's a criminal.

149
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,132
Then why did Yoo Jeong-seok go to see him?

150
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,053
And why did he go to the scene on the day

151
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
Jang Jin-su was murdered?

152
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,768
And why is Nam Guk-hyeon looking
into the case after all these years?

153
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,314
Insomniac Detective Oh Ji-hyeok
who thinks about the case day and night.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,733
What do you think this is all about?

155
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,532
Let's find out
the missing fake pastor first.

156
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,494
Once we find him,
things might start to work out.

157
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,083
Yes, Ms. Jin. What's the matter?

158
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,961
I have a favor to ask. Can you do
a background check on someone?

159
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,755
His name is Jo Seong-gi,
and he used to be a cop.

160
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,008
Please email me when you find something.

161
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,384
Why are you looking into him?

162
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,636
I'll explain later.

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,597
-Please check as soon as possible.
-Okay.

164
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,850
Why did Seo-kyung call you?

165
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,394
She wants to do a background check
on a man named Jo Seong-gi.

166
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,979
What for?

167
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,315
I don't know.

168
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,442
You can't hand over

169
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,028
police information
without knowing what it's for.

170
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,988
Considering our relationship,
I can do this much.

171
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,282
"Our relationship"?
What's your relationship with her?

172
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,534
JO SEONG-GI

173
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,286
Hey, tell me.

174
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,663
What is it? A reporter and a cop?

175
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,874
Or a man and a woman?

176
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,004
I knew something was going on.

177
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,591
I noticed you were acting strange.

178
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,717
You rascal.

179
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,385
BACKGROUND CHECK REPORT

180
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,970
-Hey.
-Do-chang.

181
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,682
What's strange is the relationship
between these two.

182
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,810
Jo Seong-gi and Jo Seong-dae.

183
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,146
They are brothers.

184
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,273
JO SEONG-GI

185
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,735
BROTHER JO SEONG-DAE, MARCH 11, 1973

186
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,081
-I have something to tell you.
-Is it urgent?

187
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,459
-Let's talk inside.
-No.

188
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,838
It'll make you awkward
if we talk about it in the office.

189
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,139
Where are we going?

190
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,850
You know. You went there five years ago.

191
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,813
What is it you're trying to tell me?

192
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,147
I'll tell you when we get there.

193
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,733
Just say it now. Don't make things weird.

194
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,277
I hope what I'm thinking is not true.

195
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,531
But I don't think I can judge it
only with your words now.

196
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,826
I need someone else to confirm the truth
so I can change my mind.

197
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,452
Who?

198
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,663
One of the two people
who brought me all the way here.

199
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,565
Did you get my email?

200
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,900
I guess that's why you came here.

201
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,402
Yes, I did.

202
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,156
But that was just part of my daily task.

203
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,450
November 9, 2015.

204
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,410
Yoo Jeong-seok from Jeonghan Daily

205
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,079
went to some place in Incheon
to report a case.

206
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,249
I guess that was one of the reports
you received that day.

207
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,295
Do you remember writing a memo
on the report?

208
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,880
"Jang Jin-su."

209
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,716
November 9.

210
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,052
That's when Detective Jang is
presumed to have been murdered.

211
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,015
Mr. Yoo visited this church that day.

212
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,477
It's less than a five-minute walk
from where Detective Jang was murdered.

213
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,190
You were the prosecutor
in charge of the case back then,

214
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,485
and you made a connection between Mr. Yoo
and Jang Jin-su's case based on that.

215
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,612
In such circumstances,

216
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,114
I'm sure anyone would
have the same suspicion.

217
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,491
Mr. Yoo.

218
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,412
Do you remember giving me the documents
about Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae's corruption?

219
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,624
And do you remember telling me
to find the real culprit

220
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,626
saying Lee Dae-cheol is innocent?

221
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,633
Seo-kyung, why did you set this up?

222
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,551
What are you trying to get from this?

223
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,512
You two have something in common.

224
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,555
You both used me as a tool.

225
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,476
One used me to get rid
of a chief prosecutor

226
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,770
who was in the way of his brother
becoming a minister.

227
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,897
And the other used me to get something

228
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,608
on a reporter who dug into his corruption.

229
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,236
The problem is,
while the tool was busy doing her job,

230
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,571
she has come closer to the truth.

231
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,906
You know Jo Seong-gi, right?

232
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,743
I'm sorry to bring up
your painful memories again.

233
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,371
But you know

234
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,873
that a reporter has to play
a villain at a time like this.

235
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,041
I hope you'll understand.

236
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,630
In 1987, when Minister Yoo Jeong-ryeol
was the student president,

237
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,216
his younger sister was taken to the police
because of her brother,

238
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,468
and she killed herself
after being sexually tortured.

239
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,637
The police officer who tortured her
was Jo Seong-gi.

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,557
On November 9, 2015,

241
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,642
you met with Jo Seong-gi who was using

242
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,519
a fake name of Kim Gwang-hun
at this church.

243
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,274
You must know him too.

244
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,236
He's the older brother of Jo Seong-dae
who ran your errands.

245
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,699
Jo Seong-gi is missing now.

246
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,409
What happened between you two that day?

247
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,412
He's wanted by the police.

248
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,585
When someone like him disappears,
you can't say that he's missing.

249
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,794
Why did you

250
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,130
have Jo Seong-gi's brother,
Jo Seong-dae under your order?

251
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:46,010
Isn't it that you wanted to use him
to find out the truth about the day

252
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,346
when Yoo Jeong-seok and Jo Seong-gi met?

253
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,141
That was my plan at first.

254
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,227
But he knew nothing
about his older brother.

255
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,396
I just had him work for me

256
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,191
because it was easy to control him
since he was a criminal.

257
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,277
Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae.

258
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,952
So you're the one
who set up the whole thing.

259
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,456
You revealed the evidence of
Lee Dae-cheol's innocence

260
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,665
to prompt a reinvestigation.

261
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,584
And you revealed that I was involved

262
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,046
to get back at me and my brother.
Am I right?

263
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,341
So what is it

264
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,552
that you've found out so far?

265
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,555
Did I really kill someone?

266
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,942
I don't think

267
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,154
you're the kind of person
who would commit murder.

268
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,157
I've known you since you were little.

269
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,617
Then why?

270
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,121
What I wanted to find out
isn't who killed whom.

271
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,124
It's who's behind
Lee Dae-cheol's execution.

272
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,210
If that was revealed,

273
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,796
Yoo Jeong-ryeol wouldn't have
become the minister,

274
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,674
and your career would've come to an end.

275
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,690
So did you get what you wanted
from this gathering?

276
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,572
I guess this will complicate my trial
even more.

277
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,958
Seeing how you have cornered me this far,

278
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,002
you must be confident
about your conclusion.

279
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,712
So what's your conclusion?

280
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,047
You're helping Oh Jong-tae.

281
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,632
Why is that?

282
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,094
Are you afraid that if he's revealed
to be the real culprit,

283
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,139
Jang Jin-su's case
might attract attention again?

284
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,436
Why should I answer that question?

285
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,479
An innocent man died.

286
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,566
I knew Lee Dae-cheol was innocent.

287
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,152
But I didn't do anything as a reporter.

288
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,864
I know it's too late,
but I want to reveal the truth.

289
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,283
Who the real culprit is.

290
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,534
Find them.

291
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,495
Find out who it is by all means.

292
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,833
I'll put it on the front page
with your name on it.

293
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
-Hello?
-Are you with Ms. Jin?

294
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,933
No. I'm alone.

295
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,477
Don't get me wrong.

296
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,521
I had to make things up like that earlier.

297
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,815
What do you want from me now?

298
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,859
I have no choice
but to be on your side now.

299
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,652
I just want you to know that.

300
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,280
Let's talk in person later.

301
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,093
How did it go? Can we visit Jo Seong-dae?

302
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,427
Yes. We can go now.

303
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,763
What were you doing here?

304
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,556
Let me ask you one thing.

305
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,018
Who do you think killed
Detective Jang Jin-su?

306
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,986
Why do you think it's Nam Guk-hyeon?

307
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,073
We've confirmed Oh Jong-tae's alibi
for the day of the murder.

308
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,783
And we've also confirmed

309
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,285
that Nam Guk-hyeon was
with Detective Jang that day.

310
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,370
What's the motive?

311
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,040
Jang Jin-su had evidence
that Oh Jong-tae was the real culprit.

312
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,836
Nam Guk-hyeon killed Jang Jin-su
after he found that out.

313
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,547
And there's a chance Oh Jong-tae had him

314
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,966
kill Jang Jin-su to cover up his crime.

315
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:59,138
Did you know that Mr. Yoo was
near the scene that day?

316
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,559
-How did you know?
-So you knew about it.

317
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,102
I confirmed it there earlier.

318
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,437
I'm sure Mr. Yoo was there.

319
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,189
And I have evidence that he was there.

320
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,899
Did Mr. Yoo admit it?

321
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,028
-Yes.
-Did Mr. Yoo tell you

322
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,407
why he met with that pastor called
Kim Gwang-hun at Gawol Church?

323
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,576
His name is not Kim Gwang-hun.
It's Jo Seong-gi.

324
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,452
He was using an alias.

325
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,581
The man you asked me
to do the background check on?

326
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,582
Yes.

327
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,251
He became wanted
for sexual torture 30 years ago.

328
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,796
Yoo Jeong-seok's older sister
was the victim.

329
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,762
LATE YOO JEONG-SEON

330
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,224
Yoo Jeong-seok's sister who died in 1987?

331
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,935
Yoo Jeong-seon?

332
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,023
SEOBU DETENTION HOUSE

333
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,774
Jo Seong-gi is your brother, right?

334
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,277
He used to be a security officer,
and he's missing now.

335
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,489
How did you first meet
Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae?

336
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,825
Did Prosecutor Kim come to you

337
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,577
knowing that you are
Jo Seong-gi's brother?

338
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,412
It was Kim Gi-tae's order, right?

339
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,789
To look into Lee Dae-cheol's case

340
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,125
because it has something
to do with your missing brother.

341
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,754
Then you found out
that Oh Jong-tae was the real culprit.

342
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,300
You used it to get money from Oh Jong-tae,
and that's how you two became allies.

343
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,512
That explains why Oh Jong-tae tried
to kill Lee Dae-cheol in prison.

344
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,973
When you found out
that Oh Jong-tae was the culprit,

345
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,101
Jong tae-was afraid
that the truth would be revealed.

346
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,231
That's why he tried to kill
Lee Dae-cheol in prison, right?

347
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,818
We have evidence
that Oh Jong-tae killed Yoon Ji-seon.

348
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,029
The results from the NFS

349
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,658
will prove that Oh Jong-tae had a motive
to instigate the murder of Park Gun-ho.

350
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,535
It's a matter of time
before you two meet in court.

351
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,996
Now, if you cooperate with us,

352
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,915
you can reduce your sentence.

353
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,962
Impressive.

354
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,339
You figured it out.

355
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,177
Where's your brother, Jo Seong-gi?
Are you in touch?

356
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,305
He's dead.

357
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,934
He might be in hiding because he's wanted.

358
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,605
I owe him some money.

359
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,857
Why do you think he hasn't
contacted me the whole time?

360
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,235
When all he cares about is money.

361
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,989
It means someone killed him.

362
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,158
He's done so many bad things.

363
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,536
When did you last contact him?

364
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:33,667
It was when he worked
as a pastor at a church.

365
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,795
I told him I'd pay him back,

366
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,922
and he said he would
call me back after opening

367
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,841
a new bank account to receive the money.

368
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,969
And that was the last time
I heard from him.

369
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,429
Do you remember the exact date?

370
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,474
That day

371
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,311
when he died.

372
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,605
I mean your fellow detective.

373
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,572
When Jo Seong-gi went missing,

374
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,949
why didn't the police
do anything about it?

375
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,411
He was reported missing under
his fake name, so they couldn't find him.

376
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,706
What if Jo Seong-gi died that day
as Jo Seong-dae said?

377
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,168
That makes Yoo Jeong-seok
the prime suspect.

378
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,005
We need to find Jo Seong-gi first.

379
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,258
Then we will be able
to solve Jang Jin-su's murder case.

380
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,887
Then the culprit of Jang Jin-su's case…

381
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,889
If it happened at the same place,

382
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,224
it's highly likely to be the same person.

383
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,935
Let's not jump to a conclusion yet.

384
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,229
Not just yet.

385
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,732
Darn it.

386
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,859
Hey.

387
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,029
It's already hard enough
to deal with Oh Jong-tae.

388
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,907
Why would you drag a reporter
of Jeonghan Daily into this?

389
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,284
Don't you think you're going too far?

390
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,995
We've already come a long way.
It's no big deal.

391
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,830
-We need to take it to the end.
-To the end?

392
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,335
All right then. Let's have
the Criminal Investigation Division

393
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,088
take care of Yoo Jeong-seok's case.

394
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,217
It's not something a sergeant from
a station in the country can handle.

395
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,469
That's why they can do this.

396
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,141
Those smarty-pants wouldn't
even want to start it.

397
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,896
That's what only a reckless guy
like Do-chang can do.

398
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,942
Are you holding up well?

399
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,279
Sure. You know I've worked
really hard to come this far.

400
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,740
Right. Now that you're here,

401
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:33,161
you should go all the way up
and get back at those who did this to you.

402
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,956
Anyway, this is a crisis.

403
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,669
You need something big
to overcome this crisis.

404
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,258
It'd be better for you to keep
a low profile without doing anything

405
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,051
for the time being.

406
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,681
Do you know why I transferred
to the Civil Petition Division?

407
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,893
Because it has all the information
about the organization.

408
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,271
What makes the weak strong

409
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,357
and the strong weak is information.

410
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,194
But having information alone
doesn't solve everything.

411
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,238
What matters is timing.

412
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,614
Make it easier to understand.

413
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,869
You should go ahead recklessly
with your plan no matter what.

414
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,079
I'll make the chance.

415
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,915
-I told you to make it easy.
-You don't have to understand.

416
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,085
What you need to know is
that I'm here to help you.

417
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,170
Why?

418
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,423
You know that no good
can come from helping me.

419
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,676
Is it because you want to be loyal to me?

420
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,969
Loyal?

421
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,597
I don't care about that stuff.

422
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,224
I'm just doing it for my sake.

423
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,978
Don't let them overpower you.

424
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,022
Just push ahead.

425
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,984
So you're saying I just need to do
what I like to do.

426
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,654
Do-chang.

427
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,325
You should come to the office.
There's something you need to see.

428
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,618
Okay.

429
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,038
-So are you done?
-Yes.

430
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,584
Do-chang.

431
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,669
Good luck.

432
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,258
Are you losing your mind
because you're shocked by what happened?

433
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,761
My mind has never been clearer.

434
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,429
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

435
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,974
You freaked me out
because you're acting differently.

436
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,103
Hey, if you think you're not well,

437
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,189
make sure to go see a doctor.

438
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,984
To make sure your brain is okay.

439
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,865
It's not near Gawol Church.

440
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,493
I got this from the patrol station
that's quite far from it.

441
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,204
It was found on the day
after Jang Jin-su's murder.

442
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,374
Did you check what kind of car it was?

443
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,334
Yes. It belonged to Gawol Church.

444
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,252
And where was it?

445
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,796
About 30 minutes away from Gawol Church.

446
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,841
I think we might find something
if we look into this.

447
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,928
Jae-hong. Call Ji-ung and Man-gu

448
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,222
and tell them to come
to the place in the picture.

449
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,141
Dong-uk, go to the officer
who gave this to you

450
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,686
and ask him to bring
all the officers at the station here.

451
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,896
-Okay.
-You should ask

452
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,941
the riot squad for backup just in case.

453
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,778
Let's work in a small team
as quietly as possible.

454
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,446
We never know what might come up.

455
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,699
Speak louder. This isn't a secret.

456
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,076
Fine. I'll try
to handle things by ourselves.

457
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,870
Okay. I'm not saying we shouldn't do it.

458
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,123
GAWOL CHURCH

459
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:27,627
NOVEMBER 10, 2015, 12:20 A.M.

460
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,931
JEONGHAN DAILY

461
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,945
GAWOL CHURCH

462
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,704
-Who took this picture?
-It's me.

463
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,123
Did you find anything else in the car?

464
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,625
No. Everything was burnt,
so there was nothing left.

465
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,419
They got rid of the evidence.

466
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,589
He carried the body in the car

467
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,966
and buried it somewhere
before getting rid of the evidence.

468
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,510
Then we need to find the body.

469
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,181
Do-chang, how would we find a dead body
at this hour?

470
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,767
It's been five years, so there won't be
any traces left. But how…

471
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,685
Someone just told me

472
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,604
to push ahead recklessly.

473
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,565
Let's do this then.

474
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,651
-Let's do this.
-Aren't you going to say it?

475
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,945
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

476
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,113
-Louder.
-Okay.

477
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,948
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

478
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,033
All right.

479
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,418
I knew Lee Dae-cheol was innocent.

480
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,837
But I didn't do anything as a reporter.

481
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,883
I know it's too late,
but I want to reveal the truth.

482
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,552
Who the real culprit is.

483
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,813
YOO JEONG-SEOK
JEONGHAN DAILY

484
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,035
How are we supposed to find it
when we can't even see anything?

485
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,455
Darn it. He just wants to make us work.

486
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,791
This isn't something
we can push ahead with.

487
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,626
Darn.

488
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,962
Hey. Did you find anything yet?

489
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,964
Yes. Come over here!

490
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,341
-Why?
-What is it?

491
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,178
-Did you find any lead?
-What is it?

492
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,724
-What is in there?
-What's that?

493
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,977
I found a herb root.

494
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,230
I told you I was smelling a herb root.

495
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,899
Gosh, I can smell it.

496
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,610
This is at least ten years old.

497
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,321
This is really good for your stamina.

498
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,116
That's not what you're supposed
to be doing right now.

499
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,870
Hey, all we can find here
is some herb roots like this.

500
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,080
It's too late to find anything.

501
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,458
I think Ji-ung is right about that.

502
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,420
If there was a dead body,
we would've found it already.

503
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,839
Hey, just dig up more herb roots.
We can cook them.

504
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,091
It's hard to find something this big.

505
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,426
It's at least ten years old.

506
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,140
-Look. I found another one.
-This is even bigger.

507
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,651
What are you doing?

508
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,863
If Yoo Jeong-seok
really killed Jo Seong-gi,

509
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,283
would he have moved around
as we predicted?

510
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,828
Yoo Jeong-seok has been a reporter
for over ten years.

511
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,831
He's covered a lot of murder cases.

512
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,170
He wouldn't have buried the body
at a place that others can easily find.

513
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,922
If it's not near here,

514
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:03,718
he would've had to carry
the body around without a car.

515
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,553
Do you think that makes sense?

516
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,222
He couldn't have gone that far.

517
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,689
I'm sure Yoo Jeong-seok was there
the day Jang Jin-su was murdered.

518
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,484
So are you saying Yoo Jeong-seok
killed Jang Jin-su?

519
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,652
Yes.

520
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,072
-That's what I think.
-On what grounds?

521
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,826
Considering the circumstances
I've found out,

522
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,995
I'm pretty sure he killed Jang Jin-su.

523
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,831
Can you find the evidence?

524
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,419
It happened five years ago.
It's impossible to find evidence.

525
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,421
So it's just your speculation.

526
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,091
You can't be so sure about that

527
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,427
unless you were at the scene that day.

528
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,472
You should go ask him yourself.

529
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,602
Go talk to him and sound him out.
Then you will sense something.

530
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,895
"Right.

531
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,357
This man killed Jang Jin-su."

532
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,824
I still think Yoo Jeong-seok didn't have
a good enough reason to kill Jang Jin-su.

533
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,534
Let's say

534
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,787
you killed a person.

535
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,874
And there's someone who saw it.

536
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,877
What would you do then?

537
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,753
And what if the witness is a detective?

538
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,591
The person Yoo Jeong-seok
went to meet with that day.

539
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,968
He's currently missing.

540
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,763
You did a good job.

541
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,985
Thank you for your hard work.
You may leave now.

542
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,778
Okay. We will get off then.

543
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,822
-Bye.
-Okay. See you.

544
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,381
Do-chang, it's been five years.

545
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,008
There can't be any visible traces.

546
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,386
We should bring in more people

547
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,307
or turn over the whole mountain
with an excavator to find something.

548
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,519
Since the car was found here,
I'm sure the body is around here.

549
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,146
But still…

550
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,942
By the way, is it okay
to make a fire here like this?

551
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,654
This is where the significant evidence

552
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,489
was burnt down after all.

553
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,824
Aren't we supposed to preserve the scene?

554
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,701
Who cares? It's already been five years.

555
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,619
The scene?

556
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,205
The principles of preserving the scene.

557
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,417
When a clue to a case is found,
we must preserve the scene as it is.

558
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,755
Any reporters who have covered
murder cases would know that.

559
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:51,469
The police would never damage
a crime scene no matter what.

560
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,729
I guess you didn't go home last night.

561
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,817
-Jun-seok, come here.
-Yes, sir.

562
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,611
Isn't the location wrong?

563
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,780
Don't make our readers complain
over a trivial thing.

564
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,490
How can the captain not check this?

565
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,534
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,329
Hello?

567
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,082
Is it confirmed?

568
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,006
Mr. Yoo, I think I should step out.

569
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,050
-Why?
-I got a call from the police.

570
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,470
They found skeletons that are presumed
to be a murder victim.

571
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:36,973
Where?

572
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,269
Okay. You should go.

573
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,256
Did you identify the body?

574
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,924
No.

575
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,385
Who do you think it is?

576
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,846
Jo Seong-gi?

577
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,568
What did you find
in the evidence storage room?

578
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,986
What Detective Jang found

579
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,364
right before Oh Jong-tae's car
was scrapped.

580
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,576
If Yoon Ji-seon and Oh Jong-tae's DNA
was found in the car,

581
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,622
it would prove that Oh Jong-tae
killed Yoon Ji-seon.

582
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,961
NOVEMBER 9, 2015, 11:15 P.M.

583
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,838
I told you there's no need to go there.

584
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,216
What other on-site evidence
do you need now?

585
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,927
We already have enough evidence
to arrest Lee Dae-cheol.

586
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,679
I'm not trying to find
traces of Lee Dae-cheol.

587
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,349
-What is it then?
-Oh Jong-tae.

588
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,769
Oh Jong-tae?

589
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,564
Why him all of a sudden?

590
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,650
Oh Jong-tae is the real culprit.

591
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,528
What makes you say
that he's the real culprit?

592
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,321
You know that too.

593
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,828
What the hell are you talking about?

594
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,249
Darn, this is crazy.

595
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,003
Damn it!

596
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,714
Why all of a sudden?

597
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,968
What is it that you found out?

598
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,138
What makes you change
the direction of the investigation?

599
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,558
I know you've been in contact
with Oh Jong-tae's father, Oh Jeong-su.

600
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,438
Have you been digging around your partner?

601
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,024
Lee Dae-cheol has a solid alibi.

602
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,277
You have something, right?

603
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,362
Be honest with me.

604
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,947
Did you get something from Oh Jeong-su?

605
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,283
Did he ask you to keep his son
out of this case?

606
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,951
Tell me, you punk.

607
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,328
Come on, Jin-su.

608
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,248
You are mistaken.

609
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,209
Lee Dae-cheol, that jerk is the culprit.

610
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,170
I have evidence
that Oh Jong-tae is the culprit.

611
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,464
I will send it to the NFS right away.

612
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,591
Once the results are out,

613
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,926
it will prove
that Oh Jong-tae is the killer.

614
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,055
But why did you frame Lee Dae-cheol
for the murder when he was innocent?

615
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,765
-Why is that?
-Jin-su.

616
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,979
Lee Dae-cheol is a bad guy.

617
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,773
He would've ended up
killing a person anyway.

618
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,860
-What?
-I was going to tell you this later.

619
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,698
Jin-su, if this goes well,

620
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,911
-our lives will change.
-What did you say, you idiot?

621
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,873
-Come here.
-Jin-su.

622
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,962
Come here.

623
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,173
You idiot.

624
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,968
I had no idea you were such a jerk.

625
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,678
Just hear me out.

626
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,766
Forget it. You're worse than a murderer.

627
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,353
How could you frame
an innocent man for murder?

628
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,396
How can you call yourself a cop?

629
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,176
Fine.

630
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,304
I'm sorry.

631
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,139
Jin-su.

632
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,351
I must have lost my mind for a bit.

633
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,646
I…

634
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,983
I will put things back
to the way they were.

635
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,236
So please…

636
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,698
Please forgive me this once.

637
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,534
Guk-hyeon. This isn't like you.

638
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,203
Why would you…

639
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,956
Damn it!

640
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,216
Guk-hyeon.

641
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,803
I don't think we can do anything more.

642
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,974
-What?
-Almost everyone from Team Two is here.

643
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,768
They will soon find out the truth
behind Lee Dae-cheol's case.

644
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,062
And they will reveal what you did
with the case.

645
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,024
What did I do?

646
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,485
I thought Do-chang was making
a false charge against you at first.

647
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,821
But that wasn't the case.

648
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,948
Do-chang seems pretty determined now.

649
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,325
He is going to reveal the truth

650
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,745
no matter what.

651
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,705
What do you think they will reveal?

652
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,958
Do you think they can mess with me?

653
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,752
How dare they?

654
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,379
Me?

655
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,262
How did you find the remains?

656
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,182
He doesn't get along with
people that are alive,

657
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,726
but I guess he's pretty close
with the dead.

658
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,436
He's so good at finding bodies.

659
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,774
So how are you going to move forward
with this case?

660
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,026
We have to find out
why Jo Seong-gi died first.

661
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,528
Once we solve this case,

662
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,199
I think it will reveal the truth
behind Jang Jin-su's case.

663
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,700
What are you going to do?

664
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,036
Will you write an article about this?

665
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,706
Once the DNA results are out,
we'll know who it is.

666
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,168
If it's Jo Seong-gi, we will soon
find out who killed him.

667
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,045
Do you think you'll be able to
write about it?

668
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,506
I have to.

669
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,217
It will be a Jeonghan Daily exclusive.

670
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:51,305
Now, I understand
why Yoo Jeong-seok has been trying

671
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,849
so hard to cover up the case.

672
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,728
But do you think he really

673
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,439
killed Jang Jin-su?

674
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,858
If he killed Jo Seong-gi,

675
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,861
he wouldn't have been in his right mind.

676
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,780
So it's possible.

677
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,615
Let's write the report
and submit it first.

678
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,701
And let's not talk to the prosecution yet.

679
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,787
Okay.

680
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,374
Hello?

681
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,211
Go ahead.

682
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,046
It's me, Nam Guk-hyeon.

683
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,674
Where are you now?

684
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,884
Why…

685
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,720
Why do you keep bothering me?

686
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,764
We've found out what you did. Come here.

687
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,766
Let's talk in person.

688
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,644
Come here and explain yourself
if you want.

689
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,397
I'm too busy to go there.

690
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,610
You can do whatever you like,

691
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,863
but stop messing with me.

692
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,450
No good can come from touching
your colleague on a sore spot.

693
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,286
-Nam Guk-hyeon, just come here and…
-Do-chang.

694
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,497
You said you hate it when someone else
gets hurt because of you.

695
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,040
Right?

696
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,710
Let's be careful
so things like that won't happen.

697
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,212
Hey, Guk-hyeon. You… Hey.

698
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,014
What did you say?

699
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,311
Just take a break
until your punishment is decided.

700
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,440
I will accept any decision
made by the higher-ups.

701
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,775
I won't file any complaints.

702
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,321
But please give me one last chance.

703
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,781
I already gave you a chance.

704
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,910
And what have you gotten
from Seobu Police Station?

705
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,079
You said everything was fine.
You didn't do anything.

706
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,831
I've just been waiting

707
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,876
for the right time
to reveal something huge.

708
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,170
And things have finally started to add up.

709
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,050
No one knows
Seobu Police Station better than I do.

710
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,136
I ended up like this
because of the people there.

711
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,139
I want to get back at them.

712
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,478
If you fail to find anything again,

713
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,396
you'll be disciplined more severely.

714
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:06,982
Keep that in mind.

715
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,034
It's 1,500 won, sir.

716
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,455
You look familiar.

717
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,666
Where did I see you?

718
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,879
When you get home,
tell the person you live with

719
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,840
that some guy told you to be careful

720
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,426
because your pretty face draws attention.

721
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,721
Bye.

722
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,229
Excuse me. Wait.

723
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,616
Sir.

724
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,160
It's you, right?

725
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,164
The man who put the evidence
in my dad's car.

726
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,166
It's you, right?

727
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,836
I know it was you.

728
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,713
Well…

729
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,216
I don't know what you're talking about.

730
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,013
You made my dad die.

731
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,974
My dad died a wrongful death
because of you.

732
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,562
You're being ridiculous.

733
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,607
Don't go around saying things like that.

734
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,650
You'll get hurt.

735
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,237
Sir, please. Please!

736
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,205
Sir, please. Please, I beg you.

737
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,167
It's not too late. Please tell them
my dad is innocent.

738
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,044
Please.

739
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:54,131
I'm begging you. You know that it's true!

740
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,924
Hey!

741
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,474
You jerk!

742
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,726
Bring my dad back to life!

743
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,271
Tell them my dad is innocent!

744
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,416
UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS FOUND
PRESUMED TO BE FORMER DETECTIVE JO

745
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,463
JO WAS ON WANTED LIST
FOR TORTURING SUSPECTS

746
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,465
I didn't include it in the report,

747
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,426
but a burnt car was found
before the remains.

748
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,304
The car belonged to Gawol Church.

749
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,514
Jo was working

750
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,767
as a pastor at Gawol Church
under an alias back then.

751
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,771
He went missing
right after the burnt car was found.

752
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,315
The circumstances confirm
that these are the facts.

753
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,275
Did the police reveal Jo's full name?

754
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,653
They will do it after the autopsy is over.

755
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,531
Is this really our exclusive?

756
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,326
Yes. If we don't write about it,
the police will have the press briefing.

757
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,787
Why would the police do this for us?

758
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,956
I was at the scene
where the body was found.

759
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,167
So I asked them to let us cover the case.

760
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,380
Mr. Yoo, this sounds big.

761
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,132
Let's write an exclusive.

762
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,601
Let's publish it tomorrow.

763
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,610
-Where's Eun-hye?
-In her room.

764
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,908
Eun-hye, are you all right? What happened?

765
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,162
Mr. Kang, I remember the man.

766
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,623
The man who put the evidence
in my dad's car and framed him for murder.

767
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,917
Who is it?

768
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,129
It's him. I saw him
on the screen in court.

769
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,215
The detective who was in charge
of my dad's case. I'm sure.

770
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,633
Nam Guk-hyeon?

771
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,511
Yes. He came to
the convenience store earlier.

772
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,890
I remembered his face when I saw it.

773
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,142
I remembered him.

774
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,311
That bastard.

775
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,645
Mr. Kang.

776
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,356
Can we have a retrial now?

777
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,735
If I say that it was him at the trial,

778
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,070
will my dad be found innocent?

779
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,406
Please let me have a retrial.

780
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,658
Eun-hye. The thing is…

781
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,536
Why? There has to be a retrial.

782
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,247
I finally remembered his face.

783
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,792
I have to prove Dad's innocence.

784
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,879
Eun-hye.

785
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:43,342
It's not like we can have a retrial
just because we want it.

786
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,053
Do-chang. Can I talk to you for a second?

787
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,305
Okay.

788
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,696
Why did you not tell me?

789
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,615
She has epilepsy.

790
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,576
It's not serious.

791
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,328
The doctor explained earlier.

792
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,206
She may lose her sight.

793
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,626
What? Why?

794
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,419
If she keeps collapsing…

795
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,048
What did he say?

796
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,551
When her blood pressure suddenly rises,
her optic nerve will…

797
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,012
Anyway, you can't say it's no big deal.

798
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,099
What were you thinking
when you brought her here?

799
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,977
It'd have been hard enough
to live with a healthy kid.

800
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,145
What are you going to do
with someone like her?

801
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,732
What if something goes wrong
and she loses her sight?

802
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,026
Do you think you can support her for life?

803
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,736
That shouldn't happen.

804
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,448
She's going to go to an art school.

805
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,826
She can't lose her sight.

806
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,537
An art school?
Does she want to go to an art school?

807
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,041
Do you even know how much it costs?

808
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,501
You can't afford it.

809
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,462
I'll have to look after her
no matter what.

810
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,590
Why? Why would you have to do that?

811
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:08,051
Gosh. I promised Lee Dae-cheol.

812
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,263
I promised him that I would walk her

813
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,931
-down the aisle.
-Why?

814
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,310
Why did you make such a promise? Why?

815
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,478
Because I made Lee Dae-cheol die.

816
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,063
I made her dad die a wrongful death.

817
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,189
Is that your fault?

818
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,776
It's not. It's not your fault.

819
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,196
But why do you have to
take care of her for life?

820
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,867
Eun-hui.

821
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,453
Every time

822
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,122
I think of Lee Dae-cheol,

823
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,209
I feel a stinging pain in my heart.

824
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,131
Even if she runs away from me,

825
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,593
I have to hold on to her.

826
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,056
So that I won't be in pain.

827
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,769
It's not that I'm looking after Eun-hye.

828
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,147
She's looking after me.

829
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,286
We can't help it.
That's how retrials work.

830
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,164
Once it's held and dismissed,

831
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,125
we can't hold it again
for the same reason.

832
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,461
Then what am I supposed to do?

833
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,131
I couldn't remember his face,

834
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,593
so my dad died a wrongful death.

835
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,263
How am I supposed to live with that?

836
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,226
My dad died because of me.

837
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,561
I told you it's not your fault.

838
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,481
Stop…

839
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,986
Stop blaming yourself.

840
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,032
Don't lock yourself up
in the hell you made up.

841
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,702
That's the only way you can live.

842
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,344
Nam Guk-hyeon, that jerk
called me earlier today.

843
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,847
I didn't understand what he said,

844
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,642
but he meant he would mess with Eun-hye
if I kept coming after him.

845
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,978
It means he's feeling very nervous now.

846
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,981
Because we're closing in on him now.

847
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,484
I will never let him get away with this.

848
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,906
Eun-hye might go blind
because of that jerk.

849
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,995
Her dream is to become a painter.

850
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,956
You don't need to worry about that.

851
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,333
You can treat her eyes

852
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,461
and send her to an art school
so she can be a painter.

853
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,045
It's easier said than done.

854
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,298
It's just that reality is in the trash.

855
00:50:56,428 --> 00:51:00,098
I paid so much property tax

856
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,601
and interest income tax this year.

857
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,189
Look at you.

858
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:10,734
Are you bragging about your wealth
by complaining about tax now?

859
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,654
I hate you. Go away, you punk.

860
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,531
My accountant says

861
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,410
if I make donations, I can have
the amount deducted from my taxes.

862
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,457
But I don't know
where I should donate my money.

863
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,458
That's my concern.

864
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,922
Why is it… Where do you want to donate to?

865
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,633
You don't have to look far.

866
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,551
There's one right there.

867
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,971
You can find people in need around you.
There's one right there.

868
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,682
-You don't have to go far.
-You're right.

869
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,478
It didn't occur to me.

870
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,647
Gosh, you fool.

871
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,442
You're a decent guy
with an upright mindset.

872
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,903
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.

873
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,280
How you… My gosh.

874
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,199
-Do-chang, you're getting a call.
-What?

875
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,242
Your phone is ringing.

876
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,202
How did you hear it when I didn't?

877
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,038
What is it?

878
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,332
I see.

879
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,336
Request Oh Jong-tae's
arrest warrant right away.

880
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,298
SEOBU POLICE STATION

881
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,342
Did you get a call from the prosecution?

882
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,677
Not yet, sir.

883
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,221
What if they dismiss it again?

884
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:25,183
Don't worry. I'll go to
their office and make a scene then.

885
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,228
Hey, they wouldn't even bat an eye

886
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,022
at a sergeant making a scene.

887
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:32,816
I'll go.

888
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,486
At least a senior superintendent should go
to make them move.

889
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,614
Really? Would you do that for us?

890
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,743
How are things going
with the body from Gawol Church?

891
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,661
Well, the thing is…

892
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,955
Once the body is identified,

893
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,999
we'll be able to specify
the suspect immediately.

894
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,710
-Who's the suspect?
-That's…

895
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,128
Yoo Jeong-seok

896
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,046
from the Current Affairs Team
of Jeonghan Daily.

897
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,467
Minister Yoo Jeong-ryeol's brother,
Yoo Jeong-seok?

898
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,844
Yes, that's him.

899
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,512
-Is that true?
-Yes.

900
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,515
We found that out while reinvestigating
Jang Jin-su's case.

901
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,433
What's with you?

902
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,519
Do you chase after people
like them on purpose?

903
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:14,232
Hey. A small station like this
should catch small fry.

904
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,693
But why do you keep going after a whale?

905
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,446
So I was thinking we should hand
the case over to the headquarters.

906
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,323
-We have no choice.
-I see.

907
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,284
If a whale came into our net,
we would have to catch it.

908
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,997
But our net might end up
getting ripped off

909
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,292
or our boat might sink.

910
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,627
You should remember that.

911
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,838
But our captain is so good
at steering a boat,

912
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,048
so I believe it won't happen.

913
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,091
You silly fool.

914
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,598
We got Oh Jong-tae's arrest warrant.

915
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,563
-We should hurry.
-Okay.

916
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,107
Oh, hello.

917
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,485
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

918
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,028
Is Chief Moon in there?

919
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:03,031
-Yes. What is this about?
-I just need to talk to him.

920
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,532
Go on ahead. Don't mind me.

921
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,867
Wait.

922
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,415
Where are you now?

923
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,838
I reported it to my superiors,
so the Civil Petition Division will advise

924
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,925
the headquarters regarding
the disciplinary action against you.

925
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:26,680
I thought we made a deal
about my son's case the other day.

926
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,016
Gosh, that wasn't part of the deal.

927
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,355
Do you really have to do this
to feel better?

928
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,733
You should resign before you get fired.

929
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,278
Then we'll say that you were dismissed
from your position.

930
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,365
Seriously, you are…

931
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,372
Chief Moon admitted to it? Are you sure?

932
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,292
Yes. He also said he'd accept
the dismissal.

933
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,298
Why did he accept it so easily?

934
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,717
He had a condition though.

935
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,094
He asked us to end it at his level

936
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,762
and stop harassing his subordinates.

937
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,557
Is he trying to protect his subordinates?

938
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,019
But I believe his people will
learn something.

939
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,938
They know that their chief is
getting fired because of them.

940
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:20,775
I guess Kang Do-chang will
know his place now.

941
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,071
If he is a sensible man,
of course he will.

942
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,633
Hello? This is Lieutenant Yoon Sang-mi
from the Civil Petition Division.

943
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,761
I'd like to meet with you.

944
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,348
I'll be there then.

945
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,226
I said no one's in here.

946
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,691
-When did he leave?
-Just a moment ago.

947
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,236
What? Did he know we were coming?

948
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,781
-Did he not tell you where he was going?
-No.

949
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,204
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

950
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,747
He's not answering. It's turned off.

951
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,499
So he knew.

952
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,667
What if he goes off the grid?

953
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,339
Hey, we lost Oh Jong-tae.

954
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,466
Check his credit card history

955
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,385
and call the places he frequents.

956
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,638
Also, request a phone location tracking.

957
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,598
Let's go to his house first.

958
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,809
He might not know
that we have the arrest warrant yet.

959
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,768
Okay.

960
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,862
What's the evidence they found?

961
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,532
They got it from your car
before it was scrapped.

962
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,076
It'll serve as direct evidence
for Yoon Ji-seon's murder.

963
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,079
But there won't be a trial
for Yoon Ji-seon's case.

964
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,540
The judge issued an arrest warrant.

965
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,709
It means the evidence was accepted
for instigation of Park Gun-ho's murder.

966
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,045
So?

967
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,882
Do I really have to run from the cops?

968
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,050
It's humiliating.

969
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,387
Did you read today's issue
of Jeonghan Daily?

970
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,848
No. Not yet.

971
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,695
You must've been here before.
It's your uncle's house.

972
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,113
I lived here for long.

973
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,450
I spent my childhood here with Jong-tae.

974
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,203
-Why?
-My parents passed away when I was little.

975
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,498
My dad was murdered.

976
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,001
And my mom took her own life

977
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,752
because she was depressed.

978
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,131
When a murderer is not caught,

979
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,801
the victim's family blames themselves
for what happened.

980
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,220
If I hadn't called my dad

981
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,098
and asked him to come home early…

982
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,394
If I had screamed
when the culprit showed up…

983
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,355
Then he wouldn't have died.

984
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,194
If I recognized the man who killed Dad,

985
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,570
Mom wouldn't have died.

986
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,824
We have to find the person
who made Lee Dae-cheol die.

987
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:19,829
So that Eun-hye stops blaming herself
for her dad's wrongful death.

988
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,209
I see. I didn't think of it that way.

989
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,379
That's what we can truly do for Eun-hye.

990
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,300
You should've told me this sooner.

991
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,844
All this time, I thought
you were just a lunatic.

992
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,681
Do you think differently now?

993
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,476
Yes. You're not a complete lunatic.

994
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,103
It's just that you're a little crazy.

995
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,273
And by any chance,

996
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,360
is that because of my donation?

997
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,364
Gosh, you know me so well.

998
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,742
All human relationships are about money.

999
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,288
Hello?

1000
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,291
We're in front of Oh Jong-tae's house.

1001
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,043
What about you guys? How did it go?

1002
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,672
We found the places Oh Jong-tae frequents

1003
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,257
and had their CCTV cameras connected.

1004
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,593
Okay. I'll call you once we spot him.

1005
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,158
Over there. Pull up the screen over there.

1006
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,410
Okay.

1007
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,037
Let's go.

1008
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,082
CONTROL ROOM

1009
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,756
Hurry.

1010
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,968
We spotted Oh Jong-tae at a cafe
he frequents.

1011
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,637
We got his plate number
and called the patrol car nearby.

1012
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,639
Okay.

1013
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,855
Oh Jong-tae showed up
at a brunch cafe he frequents.

1014
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,859
Does he not know what's going on?

1015
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,611
Yes, he does.

1016
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,322
He was trying to buy time.

1017
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,116
The fact that we spotted him means

1018
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,160
that he's done preparing for this.

1019
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,100
I just want the patrol car to chase him.

1020
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,852
Tell them to wait until we get there.

1021
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,520
Okay.

1022
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,689
He's in Jangheung-dong.

1023
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,983
He pulled his car and entered a building.

1024
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,526
Okay.

1025
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,125
Did you eat, Minister?

1026
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,544
MINISTER OF JUSTICE YOO JEONG-RYEOL

1027
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,176
-Ms. Kim Myeong-seon?
-You know her, right?

1028
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:24,806
When I met her, she said
she recently gave you a tip-off.

1029
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,142
-And?
-Did you look into the case?

1030
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,561
No. Not yet.

1031
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,315
Ms. Kim has filed
a lot of complaints to us.

1032
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,903
When I looked into them, I realized
it wasn't just an assault case.

1033
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,448
Someone powerful is behind it.

1034
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,784
I guess that's why she had a hard time.

1035
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,788
You know what Detective Kang Do-chang
has been up to, right?

1036
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,832
Yes. A little.

1037
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:54,961
It's not something he can deal with alone.

1038
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,297
They have too much power.

1039
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,969
So I'd like to help him with that.

1040
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,389
Would you care to join me?

1041
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,558
What power are you talking about?

1042
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,148
Minister of Justice, Yoo Jeong-ryeol.

1043
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,572
JEONGHAN DAILY

1044
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:27,034
UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS FOUND
PRESUMED TO BE FORMER DETECTIVE JO

1045
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,955
Lee Dae-cheol's case has

1046
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:34,167
already been concluded at the retrial.

1047
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,963
As you know, since the retrial is over,

1048
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:43,426
they have no legal ground to punish
the real culprit even if they find one.

1049
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,678
But what if

1050
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,389
the culprit

1051
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,808
comes clean?

1052
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,728
"Lee Dae-cheol isn't the killer.

1053
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:58,065
I'm the real culprit of the case."

1054
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,985
People will go crazy.

1055
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,739
"The law is wrong.
We have to change the law.

1056
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,325
Replace the police and the prosecution."

1057
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,245
The whole nation will be in chaos.

1058
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,666
And all the blame will be put
on the current Minister of Justice.

1059
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,671
The problem is that the murders

1060
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:24,133
Lee Dae-cheol was blamed for
weren't committed by one person.

1061
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,221
If one of them comes clean,

1062
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:35,019
people will pay attention
to the other culprit.

1063
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,316
Minister, don't you think
we should stop the culprit

1064
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,361
from confessing the truth?

1065
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,090
Hello.

1066
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,551
Is this the building?

1067
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,719
Yes. He went in about 30 minutes ago.

1068
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,971
Are there any other entrances?

1069
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,890
I've placed some people there too.
I think he's still in there.

1070
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,976
Let's go in.

1071
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,480
Hello.

1072
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:28,906
Dong-uk.

1073
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,246
You're under arrest
for instigating Park Gun-ho's murder.

1074
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:40,209
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

1075
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,837
I bet you know this better than I do.

1076
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,214
Let's go.

1077
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:44,023
You don't think I killed
Detective Jang Jin-su too, right?

1078
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,483
Catch him and let me talk to him.

1079
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,778
Circumstantial evidence won't be enough
to turn me into a suspect.

1080
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,530
Don't stop just because I got fired.
Arrest every single one of them.

1081
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,534
What do you want me to do?

1082
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,203
You're a reporter. Isn't this appealing?

1083
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,913
Let's give it a try.

1084
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,583
If you have any questions, just ask me.
Don't try to find out through the police.

1085
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,418
I'll let you know through my article.

1086
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,046
I'm willing to accept
whatever you choose to do.

1087
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,382
Just walk your path.
That's all you can do for me.

1088
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,510
Lunatics from Violent Crimes Unit Team Two
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

1089
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,553
Let's go catch the whale.

1090
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,348
This is Jeonghan Daily.

1091
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,558
Let me warn you. You'd better be careful.

1092
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:25,272
