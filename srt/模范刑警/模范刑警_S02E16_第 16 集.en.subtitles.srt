00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,505
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,624
Is your current address
Leeyong Apartment in Hannam-dong?

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,877
The ownership changed
to your name recently.

5
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,089
It was built by
a TJ-affiliated construction company.

6
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,675
And recently,

7
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,511
your wife bought a three-story building.

8
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,682
Isn't she a stay-at-home mother?

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,685
Where did she get
such a large sum of money?

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,063
Who gave her this money?

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,398
Choi Yong-geun?

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,275
Cheon Na-na?

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,445
-Who was it?
-Detective Jang Gi-jin.

14
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,697
As the senior detective,

15
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,076
let me ask you straight up.

16
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,078
Why did you do it?

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,416
We have to verify
the investigative report either way.

18
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,504
If it's incorrect, just say "Incorrect."

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,467
Occupation.

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,969
Team Leader of the Seoul Criminal
Investigation Division. Correct?

21
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,933
You were a detective at the Busan East
Police Station for 15 years.

22
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,311
You caught the real serial killer
of the Ocheon-dong case in Busan

23
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,772
and the murderer of the Haeundae family.

24
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,274
You were promoted to inspector
and three years ago,

25
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,943
moved to the Seoul Division.

26
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:50,944
Is that correct?

27
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,489
You were recently trying
to catch Lee Seong-gon

28
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,075
with a dedicated task force
and wasted three months.

29
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,536
You wanted to catch him.

30
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,748
You wanted it so bad
so you tried everything.

31
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,461
But you failed and lost the case
to some random guys.

32
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,631
And that's how you got involved
with Jung Hui-ju's murder case.

33
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,674
Is that correct?

34
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,469
I said, is that correct?

35
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,057
You were trying to catch a killer.

36
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,936
You worked your ass off
to catch Lee Seong-gon.

37
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,023
You were trying to catch
the culprit that killed innocent people

38
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,360
so you stayed up nights with your team
members pouring over the case.

39
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,778
Is that correct?

40
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,573
I'm asking if that's correct, you asshole.

41
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,702
That's enough.

42
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,246
Everything is correct.

43
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,628
Get him something to eat.

44
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,838
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,971
What would you like?

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,017
The doenjang jjigae combo is good here.
I recommend it.

47
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,865
I don't feel like eating.

48
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,663
After you left the room,

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,333
Jang Gi-jin asked me for a favor.

50
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,335
He says he'll admit to all charges.

51
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,130
But he asked that the motive on the report

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,799
say it was for money.

53
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,638
Right. Money.

54
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,682
For money.

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,937
Let's make sense of it that way.

56
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,480
As a police officer,

57
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,776
he wanted to tell you and me
something for the last time.

58
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,654
Throughout my entire career,

59
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,741
do you know
what the most painful thing was?

60
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
Knowing exactly who did it,

61
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,122
but not being able to arrest the culprit.

62
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,794
It drove me crazy.

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,381
I was so mad.

64
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,051
I even thought about
biting my tongue to kill myself.

65
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,058
I'll let you feel exactly how I felt…

66
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,228
back then as a detective.

67
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,398
Jung Hui-ju was…

68
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,527
murdered by Cheon Na-na.

69
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,700
That asshole doesn't think
we can get Cheon Na-na.

70
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,744
He's not completely wrong.

71
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,581
Cheon Na-na's bloodstain
on Jung Hui-ju's clothing

72
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,083
is the only evidence we have.

73
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,378
A motive for murder, crime scene evidence,
we have none of these.

74
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,172
Even a rookie lawyer
fresh out of law school

75
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,591
would be able to prove her innocence.

76
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,262
I don't care about those things.

77
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,181
Cheon Na-na killed Jung Hui-ju.

78
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,269
I just need that to be
ingrained in my head.

79
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,106
As Jang Gi-jin said,
even if I have to bite my tongue and die,

80
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,817
I will never forget that.

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,805
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,101
Forget about everything,

83
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,312
and live a happy life.

84
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,692
My father…

85
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,156
What about my father?

86
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,493
Your father was…

87
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,912
a good person.

88
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,999
I was wrong back then.

89
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,306
This is a fun game.

90
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,978
Are you coming back from exercise?

91
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,024
Su-yeon,

92
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,734
-Yes?
-This is Grandpa.

93
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,069
Do you want to say hi?

94
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,696
Who is this?

95
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,200
Your granddaughter.

96
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,538
She's Sang-woo's illegitimate child.

97
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,747
Like me.

98
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,250
That's why I feel closer to her.

99
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,379
Her mother is a woman
he met at a bar a long time ago.

100
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,256
And the assault case from two years ago

101
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,466
-was because of her mother--
-That's enough.

102
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,552
I don't need further explanation.

103
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,972
Tell me why you brought her to my house.

104
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,641
I have to bring her home. She's my niece.

105
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,435
Says who?

106
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,311
I expected you to be against it.

107
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,189
It will injure Sang-woo's image
while he's in prison.

108
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,483
If people find out he beat up
the child's mother,

109
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,194
they will be disgusted with him.

110
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,905
I am worried about that.

111
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,408
I heard from the head of McQueen.

112
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,911
He recommends you as the CEO
instead of Sang-woo.

113
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,622
But it's only possible
if you give me your support.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,962
If you're so against it,
I will reconsider bringing Su-yeon here.

115
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,756
If I expose this,

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,386
Sang-woo may not have a place
even if he comes back.

117
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,015
Send her away.

118
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,025
ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY

119
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,362
Chief, did you want to see me?

120
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,832
Bong-sik.

121
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,629
I love you, Bong-sik!

122
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,890
Gather around, everyone.

123
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,308
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

124
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,231
Our chief is …

125
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,484
on the list of candidates…

126
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,656
to be promoted to Superintendent General!

127
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,001
I would like to introduce who will

128
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,630
assume my position
and lead TJ after today.

129
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,924
Come in.

130
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,901
Take your seats.

131
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,578
I'm Cheon Na-na.

132
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,371
From now on,

133
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,958
TJ does not exist
for one person or one family.

134
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,627
It will be a community

135
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,131
where everybody is the leader
and everybody takes responsibility.

136
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,925
I will stand in the back.

137
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,594
Please move on.

138
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,973
One step by one step,
move on towards the summit.

139
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,060
I will applaud you from the back.

140
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,231
I will not decide the future of TJ.

141
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,983
It will be decided by you.

142
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,903
-That's right.
-We agree.

143
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,375
I did everything I could.

144
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,295
Now, it's your turn to keep your promise.

145
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,174
We will work hard
to prepare for the trial.

146
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,760
Working hard won't be enough.

147
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,220
You have to give me assurance.

148
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,016
We are sure
Gi Dong-jae didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

149
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,184
We can prove that.

150
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,936
Who is the real killer?

151
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,271
If you have the real killer,

152
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,191
isn't my son's innocence proved?

153
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,153
I don't think we can go that far
at this trial.

154
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,364
Is Na-na the killer?

155
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,700
There is a big possibility she is.

156
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,498
They are both my children.

157
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,334
Can't you save both of them?

158
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,671
If you hadn't helped us this time,

159
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,633
it would've been impossible
to investigate your daughter.

160
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,552
You have already…

161
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,555
chosen one over the other.

162
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,698
There was a summon
from the prosecution a while ago.

163
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:44,453
It looked like I would be released
on probation at the next hearing.

164
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,873
That's good news.

165
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,375
If they will release me,

166
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,920
that means they will release
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo as well.

167
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,007
Will that be possible?

168
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,843
The Honorary Chairman is on the move.

169
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,137
If he works with the detectives,

170
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,098
it will be very possible.

171
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,142
That can't happen.

172
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,936
There is clear evidence
of conspiring to murder.

173
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,646
It's actually quite simple.

174
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,317
As long as the detectives
present the evidence that Gi Dong-jae

175
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,653
didn't actually commit the murder.

176
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,531
Even if the real killer isn't found,

177
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,617
Cheon Sang-woo will be acquitted.

178
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,619
From what I was able to find out,

179
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,456
the detectives have
enough evidence to prove that.

180
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,000
You will have to prepare for that.

181
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,461
Nothing changes
even if my brother is released.

182
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,881
Things are very different than before.

183
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,716
But the detectives are a problem.

184
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,303
What I'm really concerned about,

185
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,223
is not my father, my brother,
or even the detectives.

186
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,725
It's you, Mr. Choi.

187
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,647
Who do you think killed Jung Hui-ju?

188
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,569
Cheon Sang-woo killed Jung Hui-ju.

189
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,155
Believing that is all you need to do.

190
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,782
Isn't that what you believe?

191
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,501
Of course.

192
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,467
-This is so good.
-Eat all you want.

193
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,471
I should have treated you more often.

194
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,640
Today, it's only chicken.

195
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,517
When my promotion is confirmed,

196
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,227
it won't be chicken but…

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,979
Moo… It will be beef!

198
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,900
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

199
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,026
Congratulations!

200
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,361
Congratulations!

201
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,618
I think I like this better than beef.

202
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,537
Ji-ung,

203
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,747
are you still hoping for a jackpot?

204
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,791
I'm not.

205
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,711
But I had a dream last night
that Detective Oh appeared

206
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,882
and rattled off six numbers
out of the blue.

207
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,259
That makes sense.

208
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,595
He gave you the lottery numbers
instead of a building in Gangnam.

209
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,848
The thing is, I remember
all of the numbers,

210
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,601
but can't remember the last one.

211
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,644
What about 18?

212
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,020
Eighteen?

213
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,564
Detective Oh gave you the numbers.

214
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,774
If the chief is promoted,

215
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,235
your dream of being a
Gangnam landlord is gone.

216
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,905
That number suddenly comes to mind…
Eighteen.

217
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,908
That's not bad.

218
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,368
Quit it.

219
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,122
Over here!

220
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,250
If everyone moves over,
we can make two more seats.

221
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,086
I think we need another store.

222
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,422
This isn't even mine.

223
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,340
Some seats will open up soon.

224
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,259
I'm so envious.

225
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,345
Do-chang, take the call.
It's a call for a delivery order.

226
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,556
Enjoy.

227
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,977
I don't know…

228
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,104
Hello, this is the chicken restaurant.

229
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,816
Yes, we deliver.

230
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,943
Where? Seoul?

231
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,778
Well…

232
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,489
We're in Incheon.

233
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,283
What?

234
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,286
One moment.

235
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,414
It's to the main office of TJ.

236
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,249
They ordered chicken.

237
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,667
What does this mean?

238
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,421
They want us to deliver it.

239
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,929
Cheon Na-na…

240
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,015
What is she thinking?

241
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,437
All of the things happening
around you, Detective Oh,

242
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,440
are happening because of you.

243
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,362
It's a warning.

244
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,530
Cheon Na-na's warning.

245
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,451
If we keep provoking her,
she'll mess with your family.

246
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,748
The doors are closing.

247
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,342
This is good.

248
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,136
You knew my sister owned
a chicken restaurant.

249
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,057
Is that why you ordered
delivery from Incheon to Seoul?

250
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,811
I will spread the word about it.
Her business will really take off.

251
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,938
The business is fine right now.

252
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,856
You don't have to trouble yourself.

253
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,942
I am indebted to you too.

254
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,151
It's the least I can do.

255
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,196
What is that debt, exactly?

256
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,698
Is that a good thing

257
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,158
-or is it a bad thing--
-It's good.

258
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,369
But I don't eat much.

259
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,207
I looked into my brother's trial.

260
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,210
I saw Detective Oh was
a witness for the defense.

261
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,838
Aren't you supposed to be
a witness for the prosecution?

262
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,215
Gi Dong-jae didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

263
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,721
CHAIRWOMAN CHEON NA-NA

264
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,472
It's you, Chairwoman Cheon Na-na.

265
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,103
Of course I have to testify
and release him.

266
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,816
-Hey.
-I want you to stay quiet.

267
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,028
Even if you're against it,
I am going to expose it.

268
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,448
That I am the killer?

269
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,081
Do you believe that too, Detective Kang?

270
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,875
I am the only one who thinks that.

271
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,920
You are the killer.

272
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,547
Hey.

273
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,633
We don't have any evidence--

274
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

275
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,845
I don't trust you either.

276
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,057
-What?
-Wait and see.

277
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,228
I'll prove that I'm right,
even if I have to do it alone.

278
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,815
-Won't you regret it?
-Never.

279
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,568
-So you'll release my brother.
-I'm just following the law.

280
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,070
I want you to think it over.

281
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,489
Is releasing my brother
the right thing to do?

282
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,991
If you go against me,

283
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,286
you might get played again
by the rules I set up for my game.

284
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,580
Don't fool yourself.

285
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,542
You will be the one being played, not me.

286
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,221
Before Dong-jae died,

287
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,681
he said he didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

288
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,391
He said he even had evidence.

289
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,851
What was that evidence?

290
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,063
He said he left it with his brother.

291
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,649
Dong-jae didn't exactly give it to me.

292
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,610
He had it hidden.

293
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,613
Did you check what it was?

294
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,490
Yes.

295
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,618
They were bloody clothes and shoes.

296
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,579
Thank you.

297
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,165
Please play the recording.

298
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,043
While disposing of Jung Hui-ju's body,

299
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,920
Gi Dong-jae talked
to Choi Yong-geun on the phone.

300
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,713
And Gi had recorded the conversation.

301
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:57,177
Drive the car you transported her in
for a while then sink it in water.

302
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,846
DNA remains even if you scrap it
or burn it,

303
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,264
so get it underwater.

304
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,809
Check thoroughly for evidence
before you do it.

305
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,437
Burn all your belongings to ashes.

306
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,106
Yes, sir.

307
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,359
Following Choi Yong-geun's orders,

308
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,279
Gi Dong-jae erased his evidence
as he was disposing of the body.

309
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,239
But why did Gi Dong-jae

310
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,994
keep the clothes and shoes of the victim?

311
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,664
Before he died, Gi Dong-jae said
that he kept something hidden.

312
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,833
He said if he used it to threaten someone,

313
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,751
he could get a lot of money.

314
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,128
Thank you.

315
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,256
If he had killed Jung Hui-ju,

316
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,009
would he have saved the victim's
clothes and shoes,

317
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,846
the most critical evidence,
and use them to threaten someone else?

318
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,141
Isn't that contradictory?

319
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,447
Among the evidence we collected
during the investigation,

320
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,534
no evidence directly connects
Gi Dong-jae as the killer.

321
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,454
What is he talking about?

322
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,414
-What does that mean?
-No way.

323
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,582
What will happen then?

324
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,668
I heard the Violent Crimes Unit Team 2
of Incheon Seobu Police

325
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,296
is still investigating the murder case
of Jung Hui-ju.

326
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,297
What is the reason?

327
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,924
It's because…

328
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:23,388
we have doubts as to
whether Gi Dong-jae killed Jung Hui-ju.

329
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,765
I see.

330
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,936
Does that mean you acknowledge

331
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
that the prior investigation was flawed?

332
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,190
Yes.

333
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,319
It is rather difficult

334
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,863
for the detective in charge to admit

335
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,531
that the investigation was flawed.

336
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,243
It must have been a big burden.

337
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,452
What was the reason

338
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,247
to acknowledge your mistake?

339
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,837
Back then,

340
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,965
I didn't think I had made a mistake.

341
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,341
Now,

342
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,719
I believe I was wrong.

343
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,596
Now…

344
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,601
I believe I was wrong.

345
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,566
-What did he say?
-I don't understand it.

346
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,235
This is unbelievable.

347
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,570
What is he saying?

348
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,166
Are you satisfied with the hearing?

349
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,918
Please say something to the people.

350
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,006
I caused trouble as a leader
with social responsibility.

351
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,174
I sincerely apologize.

352
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,178
I will admit my mistake
and reflect deeply.

353
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,100
And…

354
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:55,230
I express deep appreciation to the judges
who conducted a fair trial.

355
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,440
Today,

356
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,819
I was reminded that the law
is equal for everyone.

357
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,154
Thank you.

358
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,155
Also…

359
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,823
TJ GROUP'S CHEON SANG-WOO
ACQUITTED AT SECOND HEARING

360
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,702
…I would like to thank the detectives
again for admitting to their mistakes

361
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,205
and speaking up courageously
to prove my innocence.

362
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,959
What?

363
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,419
Why watch that crap?

364
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,796
Damn it! I want to quit.

365
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,549
Why the hell did he mention us at the end?

366
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,634
We didn't do it so he'd thank us!

367
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,969
That's not a thank you.

368
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,139
-He's outright insulting us.
-The comments are already coming in.

369
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,391
"The principle of law hasn't changed."

370
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,810
"Innocent by Money, Guilty by Poverty."

371
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,312
They're all criticisms.

372
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,397
-There is one compliment.
-What does it say?

373
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,525
"Staunch protectors of rich assholes,

374
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,903
our beautiful police officers."

375
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,112
Damn.

376
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,282
We are going to be trolled
on the internet for a while.

377
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,493
I think it has already started.

378
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,369
What? Where?

379
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,748
A group of garbage pigs
"who released the chairman

380
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,833
after a payout from a conglomerate."

381
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,629
Can they show our faces like this?

382
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,257
With our faces so visible,
it won't be strange if we get stabbed

383
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,551
just walking down the street.

384
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,428
-We should wear our uniforms.
-Hello.

385
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,059
What brings you here?

386
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,894
STATEMENT OF COMPLAINT

387
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,271
COMPLAINANT KIM MIN-JI

388
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,941
THE ACCUSED CHEON SANG-WOO

389
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,943
Your complaint has been submitted.

390
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,945
We'll start the investigation soon.

391
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,072
I will go home, then.

392
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,490
Yes.

393
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,786
Keep up the good work.

394
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,830
Goodbye.

395
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,332
Goodbye.

396
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,131
Cheon Sang-woo admitted
to the Kim Min-ji assault case.

397
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,008
We would've investigated
even without the complaint.

398
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,844
It doesn't hurt us.

399
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,513
If we have a complaint from the victim,
the investigation can move faster.

400
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,099
I know that, but why now?

401
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,351
It's right after
Cheon Sang-woo was acquitted.

402
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:00,397
That's Cheon Na-na's specialty.
She beats us to the punch.

403
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,074
I was thinking of raising Su-yeon.

404
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,659
What?

405
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,454
Wouldn't it be better
to send her to us for her future?

406
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,248
No.

407
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,916
No way.

408
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,793
Never.

409
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,128
If he sues for paternity,

410
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,714
it will work against you.

411
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,257
Please…

412
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,342
Let me raise Su-yeon.

413
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,012
Please…

414
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,972
My brother is released.

415
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,308
It would be different
if he were still in jail,

416
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,602
but now we have no reason
to give up on Su-yeon.

417
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,897
What…

418
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,568
do you want me to do?

419
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,492
Thank you.

420
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,829
Let's go to Mommy's car.

421
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,248
My pretty baby.

422
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,417
Thank you.

423
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,376
Let's go.

424
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,297
Su-yeon,

425
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,426
you only have Mommy.

426
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,930
You don't have Grandpa or Aunt.

427
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,016
And you don't have Daddy.

428
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,145
There is only Mommy for Su-yeon.

429
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,231
Do you understand?

430
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,654
Su-yeon, you will live only with Mommy.

431
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,988
Yes.

432
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,699
-Don't go anywhere else, okay?
-Yes.

433
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,273
TJ GROUP'S CHEON NA-NA
IN WCN'S 50 BEST FEMALE CEOS

434
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,692
SHE IS THE ONLY KOREAN
TO BE NAMED ON THE LIST

435
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,943
She's doing great,

436
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,279
our Na-na.

437
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,032
Let's have her take
the reins for the time being.

438
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:21,329
Frankly, her way of business
is not bad for the company.

439
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,083
Dad,

440
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,920
Na-na's blood was found
on Jung Hui-ju's clothes.

441
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,797
Na-na killed her.

442
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,092
She framed me as the conspirator
to hide that fact.

443
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,969
Now that I know it,

444
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,596
how can I just sit on that?

445
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,639
So,

446
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,727
are you going to put on a show
of a sibling death match again?

447
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,397
Will you be satisfied to end
TJ in your generation?

448
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,941
Why would I end it?

449
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,569
I have no plans to do that, Dad.

450
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,447
Actually,

451
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,201
I plan to go to Na-na
to bow my head and beg for her mercy.

452
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,496
I'll say "I will live quietly,
so do what you must do."

453
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,333
"Don't mind me."

454
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,542
I'll say that.

455
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,004
To be honest,

456
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,965
I am no match for Na-na right now.

457
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,467
I admit it, Dad.

458
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,101
Stop the biased police investigation!

459
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,978
Stop it! Stop it!

460
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,689
Arrest Cheon Sang-woo again!

461
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,608
Arrest him! Arrest him!

462
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,234
The killer is Cheon Sang-woo!

463
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,153
Arrest Cheon Sang-woo!

464
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,821
Arrest him! Arrest him!

465
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,324
Why are they doing this?

466
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,034
Make him pay! Make him pay!

467
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,870
-Turn the car around.
-The police chief should apologize!

468
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,163
Apologize to the people!

469
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,175
Be careful, Chief!

470
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,137
As of yesterday,

471
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,557
the chance of my promotion
to Superintendent General was 100 percent.

472
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,102
-Bong-sik.
-Yes.

473
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,562
What is my percentage
under these crummy situations?

474
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,190
Even so, the credit for solving

475
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,901
the escape case doesn't go away.

476
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,986
So what is the percentage?

477
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,197
Maybe 12 or 13 percent?

478
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,990
Be honest and objective.

479
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,784
Objectively… about seven?

480
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,161
-Do you want to die?
-That is, 0.7…

481
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,501
Thanks to you guys,
I'm back to being an SGC.

482
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,837
I am just going to settle for SGC.

483
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,172
So you guys should be bulldozers.

484
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,590
Ram them like bulldozers.

485
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,927
Search the TJ main office
without search warrants,

486
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,264
if you need someone's testimony,
drag them in and give them hell.

487
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,766
Beat them up until they talk.

488
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,686
We're going to go back
to the police of the old days.

489
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,564
Tear everything down.

490
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,607
Ruin everything.

491
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,694
Kang Do-chang,

492
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,739
Aren't you excited?
This is your specialty.

493
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,701
I am not that terrible.

494
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,161
What are you talking about?

495
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,246
You guys are perfectly capable.

496
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,539
You guys are…

497
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:14,085
the lunatics that will go down
in police history.

498
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,713
So…

499
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,842
Let us unite

500
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,803
and get fired.

501
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,930
And,

502
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,392
until the day we all become
landlords in Gangnam,

503
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,854
we will unite our minds
and raise some hell.

504
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,647
What do you say?

505
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,650
I'm not joking. I'm being serious.

506
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,236
We see what you're saying.

507
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:45,158
We will raise hell without regret.

508
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,160
Attention!

509
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,288
Salute!

510
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,921
Mr. Landlord, do you have any complaints?

511
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,923
No sir, I have none.

512
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,549
Salute!

513
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,304
SENDER INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION
RECIPIENT TJ MAIN OFFICE

514
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,264
REQUEST FOR ATTENDANCE

515
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,434
REQUESTING CHEON NA-NA'S ATTENDANCE
CONCERNING JUNG HUI-JU'S MURDER CASE

516
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,109
FROM OH JI-HYEOK

517
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,403
If you fail to attend,
we'll send another request.

518
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,865
If you fail to attend after
the third request, you will be arrested.

519
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,292
Can I come in?

520
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,471
-Congratulations.
-What is there to congratulate?

521
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,976
It is all thanks to the chairman.

522
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,443
You left my office intact.

523
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
Thank you.

524
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,992
You suffered a lot.

525
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,077
Come back any time and help me.

526
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,330
Your advice is always welcome.

527
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,124
Sure.

528
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,086
Of course, I will help you.
You're doing such a wonderful job.

529
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,046
It all worked out.

530
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,381
-So we should--
-Yes.

531
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:28,094
Now there is no reason
to claw each other's eyes out.

532
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,099
I had it too good.

533
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,979
What happened helped me
think about my life.

534
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,397
That's good.

535
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,568
And for beating up Min-ji, no…

536
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,739
I will pay for the crime
of assaulting Kim Min-ji.

537
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,657
I think I will feel better if I do.

538
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,869
I really turned a new leaf,
don't you think so?

539
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,126
Now that you're at the top, do a good job.

540
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,630
I will probably have
to leave again for a while.

541
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,550
And…

542
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,094
When I return,

543
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,599
please give me a post.

544
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,227
Can you at least do that?

545
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,104
Of course.

546
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,276
Always be careful.

547
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,530
If you fall too, our TJ is really over.

548
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,283
Okay.

549
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,242
Good.

550
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,703
It's such a relief.

551
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,873
I think what happened
changed you for the better.

552
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,126
I did.

553
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,505
It helped me understand my position.

554
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,148
-Would you like some?
-No.

555
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,858
Keep stuffing your face.

556
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,154
You must not like me.

557
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,867
Anyway, you helped me this time.

558
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,036
So I want to show my gratitude.

559
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,914
-What should I do for you?
-We don't need anything.

560
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,916
Cooperate with the assault investigation.

561
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,168
What you two really want is

562
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,839
to find the real killer
of Jung Hui-ju's murder, isn't it?

563
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,841
I'm sure you already know who it is.

564
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,011
The killer's bloodstains
were on the victim's clothes.

565
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,389
But because of possible tampering,
it can't be direct evidence.

566
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,641
And the charge for Woo Tae-ho's murder,

567
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,020
you have a few fingerprints,
but that's not enough explanation, either.

568
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,482
And there is no convincing motive
for the murder.

569
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,861
It must be a big burden
for a detective, isn't it?

570
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,363
-You did a lot of research.
-I was bored in prison.

571
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:57,243
So I put the pieces of the case
together from the beginning.

572
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,829
The real killer murdered Jung Hui-ju.

573
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,499
And made Gi Dong-jae dispose of the body.

574
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,667
But…

575
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,588
You're not worried the body was found
and the investigation started.

576
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,589
Why?

577
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,008
Because you have the video file

578
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,302
of Cheon Sang-woo ordering the killing.

579
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,139
You can frame Cheon Sang-woo
for the murder later.

580
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,477
The killer's scenario is perfect.

581
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,686
But…

582
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,773
There is one flaw.

583
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,027
The beginning of the scenario
was written by the real killer.

584
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,447
But the latter part of the scenario

585
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,824
was written by someone else.

586
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,494
It was a collaborative work.

587
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,539
What if that person

588
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,294
confesses under circumstances
he can't control?

589
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,841
Are you talking about Choi Yong-geun?

590
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,471
Are you sure you don't want this?

591
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,890
This is really good.

592
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,979
We will write a scenario
with Cheon Sang-woo this time.

593
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,898
We share a purpose with him.

594
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,484
Are you saying we should
work together with that punk?

595
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,069
You once told me.

596
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,446
"Catch a gangster with another gangster."

597
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,823
And you catch a killer,

598
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,158
with another killer.

599
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,995
I verified that a portion
of the borrowed-name account

600
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,331
had been transferred
to Choi Yong-geun's account.

601
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,333
Is that right?

602
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,337
Do you happen to know
anyone in the prosecution

603
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,382
that is in charge of finances?

604
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,260
Yes. I know someone
in the central district.

605
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,013
Report it to that prosecutor
that we have a borrowed-name account.

606
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,060
Really.

607
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,009
This is Choi Yong-geun.

608
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,302
Come see me.

609
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,805
Yes. I will be there.

610
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,937
You should have called me.

611
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,274
You must have known I was released. Shit.

612
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,860
I'm disappointed.

613
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,196
I apologize.

614
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,407
Is everything well?

615
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,830
Something happened,
right before I came here.

616
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,123
What was it?

617
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,585
Was it something dangerous?

618
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,378
Don't you already know?

619
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,588
Me?

620
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,840
Why?

621
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,426
Are you suspecting me?

622
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,221
Do you think I would have
ordered you dead?

623
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,183
Then again, that's possible.

624
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,353
Considering what you did
to me at the trial.

625
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,104
Totally.

626
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,110
But wouldn't Na-na be more desperate?

627
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:22,114
Everything will be buried if you die.

628
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,116
So,

629
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,452
try and make a choice.

630
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,247
Me? or Na-na?

631
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,415
Who do you want to be killed by?

632
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,625
Chairman,

633
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,962
you are going overboard.

634
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,258
The money that Na-na gave you
has already been discovered.

635
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,344
If I send a document to the prosecution,

636
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,597
your money will disappear into thin air.

637
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,810
Confess the hidden truth

638
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,895
about Na-na.

639
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,022
If you do that,

640
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,442
not a penny will leave your account.

641
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,407
That girl Na-na…

642
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,910
She even killed her own husband.

643
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,498
If the investigation continues,
you'll end up like Woo Tae-ho.

644
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,798
Why are you looking around?

645
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,972
Do you think I'm secretly recording?

646
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,559
It's okay. Don't worry.

647
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,938
The CCTV you installed
in my office for Na-na

648
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,940
has already been removed.

649
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,819
Wait, why am I whispering?

650
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,413
I saw the news.

651
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,249
They started investigating
TJ's borrowed-name accounts.

652
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,002
Does that mean our accounts
will be exposed?

653
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,546
Cheon Na-na rose to become the chairwoman.

654
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,715
She will protect it no matter what.

655
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,467
I became a president, too.

656
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,926
Don't worry.

657
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,138
That Cheon Na-na…

658
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,474
She shouldn't be trusted.

659
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,144
Cheon Sang-woo prompted the investigation.

660
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,645
It wasn't Cheon Na-na.

661
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,816
The way I see it,
Cheon Na-na is all we've got.

662
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,693
That's what I mean.

663
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,153
So let's wait.

664
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,448
No one can touch that money.

665
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,826
Just figure out how to get out of there.

666
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,746
I will make sure your money is safe.

667
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,122
Don't worry about me.

668
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,334
Cheon Na-na gave me something else.

669
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,796
I can't get out that easily.

670
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,509
I will give that to my family.
That's enough for me.

671
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:50,054
Cheon Na-na gave you money separately?

672
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:54,725
She wanted me to know
that I should be loyal to her, not you.

673
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,729
She could betray you someday.

674
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,857
I believe that message was also there.

675
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,195
The incident
with Jung Hui-ju's grandfather

676
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,823
was practically an order
from Cheon Na-na to me.

677
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,699
You should be careful too.

678
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,701
Why should I?

679
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,623
Think carefully.

680
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,210
Four people know the truth
about this case.

681
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,504
Gi Dong-jae, Woo Tae-ho, Cheon Na-na,

682
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,464
and…

683
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,216
you.

684
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,010
Gi Dong-jae and Woo Tae-ho are dead.

685
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,471
Besides Cheon Na-na…

686
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,808
you're the only one that's left.

687
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,483
TJ CHAIRWOMAN CHEON NA-NA

688
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,945
I am Im Cha-seong,
the new president of Taejoo E&C.

689
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,864
It's very nice to meet you.

690
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,415
PRESIDENT CHOI YONG-GEUN

691
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,128
Hello.

692
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,299
I am Choi Yong-geun. I will be in charge
of TJ's Logistics and Distribution.

693
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,343
I have much to learn.

694
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,388
I look forward to your help and advice.

695
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,373
I can't bear to look.

696
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,500
Can you take a look?

697
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,542
NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT CHOI YONG-GEUN
PRESIDENT OF LOGISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION

698
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,960
Damn!

699
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,378
Let's see.

700
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,007
Detective Oh.

701
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,550
-We got a package for you.
-Thanks.

702
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,346
-Damn!
-Why?

703
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,516
No way.

704
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,518
I missed by one number again?

705
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,727
I got lucky again?

706
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,312
You didn't miss one number.

707
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,731
You missed the five numbers
that Detective Oh gave you.

708
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,817
You matched the number 18
that Jae-hong gave you. Just that one.

709
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,572
Shit.

710
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,200
What? What did I do wrong?

711
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,622
-What is that?
-It's a stab-proof vest.

712
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,082
You can apply for it here.

713
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,336
This one is worn by special agents
of America's FBI.

714
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,546
I got it delivered.

715
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,047
You're showing off.

716
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,340
But why all of a sudden?

717
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,925
The captain said

718
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,303
it won't be strange if we get stabbed
walking down the street these days.

719
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,763
I should be ready.

720
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,976
Let me see.

721
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,852
Shit.

722
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,188
Harder.

723
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,523
-Harder?
-Yes.

724
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,568
Dong-uk, try stabbing him.

725
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,820
You will do great.

726
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,156
Don't worry and do what you have to do.

727
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,284
Yes, I will.

728
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,453
Now we don't have to deal in secret.
You run a subsidiary company.

729
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,541
I just need to increase
your holdings at my discretion.

730
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,001
Thank you.

731
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,337
Me too.

732
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,549
I am here with much thanks to you.

733
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,344
I am all the more grateful
if you think that way.

734
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:23,225
To be honest, I only gave you
the title of president.

735
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,605
Keep being my shadow
as you have done so far.

736
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,774
That way, I can keep my seat
with peace of mind.

737
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,153
I was under the same understanding.

738
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,906
Okay. You can go. See you often.

739
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,617
Yes.

740
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,038
Mr. Choi,

741
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:52,046
being a detective is a hard job,

742
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,505
isn't it?

743
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,758
You were one, so you should know.

744
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:59,136
A detective has to risk his life.

745
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,597
Yes.

746
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,308
Has any of your colleagues died?

747
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,979
Yes.

748
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,274
Yes, that's right.

749
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,152
You can make a lot of enemies on the job.

750
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,908
There must be a lot of people
who want to kill a detective, right?

751
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,637
Try and make a choice.

752
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,932
Me or Na-na?

753
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,393
Who do you want to kill you?

754
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,286
This is Oh Ji-hyeok with the Incheon
Seobu Police Station.

755
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,622
Yes, this is Choi Yong-geun.

756
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,125
Yes, hello.

757
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,460
What is it?

758
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,671
I have something to give you.

759
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,674
What is it?

760
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,677
A voice recording of Cheon Na-na.

761
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,263
It will have everything
that you would like to know.

762
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,767
-Why all of a sudden?
-To survive.

763
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,395
This is the way for me to survive.

764
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,815
Okay. Where should we meet?

765
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:39,278
When we used to work together,
we chased a guy named Park Ji-gwang.

766
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,197
Do you remember
where we caught that lunatic?

767
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,533
Yes, I remember.

768
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,903
This is not the way to the station.

769
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,991
Oh Ji-hyeok, where are you taking me?

770
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,743
Yes.

771
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,620
I looked into Park Ji-gwang.

772
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,998
He was released recently

773
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,041
and went back to the junkyard
he was working at before.

774
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,418
Okay. Thank you.

775
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,299
Do you remember
when we caught Park Ji-gwang?

776
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:10,053
He fought back like hell. He said
he would kill me when he was released.

777
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,681
Somehow you remembered that.

778
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,641
You were going to kill me

779
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,644
and frame Park Ji-gwang for it,

780
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,813
disguised as a murder out of a grudge.

781
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,985
Why do you use the knowledge
you learned as a detective like that?

782
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,202
Battery of an officer is a big offense.

783
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,913
The sentence will be greater
because you were on probation.

784
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,087
Where is Cheon Na-na's voice file
that you promised me?

785
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,300
There's no such thing.

786
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,722
Then make one.

787
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,517
I will let you go for old times' sake.

788
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,512
What is it?

789
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,441
I got beat up trying to get Oh Ji-hyeok.

790
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,611
I barely escaped.

791
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,949
They're looking all over for me.

792
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,868
My face was seen.

793
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,829
Why are you telling me this?

794
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,963
Anyway, I think I need
to lay low for a while.

795
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,300
I know how detectives think,
so I won't be caught by them.

796
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,929
The problem is you.

797
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,641
Because you will find me no matter what.

798
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,441
I need a safety net.

799
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,653
I want you to say

800
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,866
you killed Jung Hui-ju in your own voice.

801
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:41,663
I will take that as a promise
that you won't find me and kill me.

802
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,626
I killed Jung Hui-ju?

803
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,879
What?

804
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,839
You gave me

805
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:56,052
the dead body of Jung Hui-ju.

806
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,432
I told you.

807
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,310
I didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

808
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,562
I didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

809
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,689
I told you I didn't kill her!

810
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,487
I'm so tired.

811
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,575
Then I guess I'll turn myself in.

812
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,453
I will have to go to prison,

813
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,956
but maybe that will be better.

814
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,169
Because both of us will be in prison.

815
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,881
There is no evidence
that I killed Jung Hui-ju.

816
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,509
I won't be arrested,
no matter what you say.

817
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,970
Shall we see
whose story is believed in court?

818
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,558
If my testimony is added, the motive
for the murder, the place of killing,

819
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,311
and your bloodstains
from Jung Hui-ju's clothes,

820
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,773
will all be nicely explained.

821
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,654
Why?

822
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,448
Why don't you believe me?

823
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,325
So,

824
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,703
please help me believe you.

825
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,584
You never once told me
who killed her and how.

826
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,671
Did you?

827
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:18,093
You have to share something
in order to trust each other.

828
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,011
I told you before.

829
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,981
It was an accident.

830
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,568
She brought it onto herself.

831
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,618
I was a detective.

832
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,621
Even with a quick scan,
it wasn't an accidental injury.

833
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,416
Someone…

834
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,920
hit her from behind with a blunt object.

835
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,307
I killed her.

836
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,853
You and I are the only ones

837
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,232
who know about this.

838
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,484
Is that enough?

839
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,697
Now we have to trust each other.

840
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,867
Yes.

841
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,036
So we do.

842
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,040
Okay.

843
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,419
It's not quite enough,

844
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:38,089
but I will believe you one more time.

845
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:44,095
If anything suspicious happens to me,

846
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,057
I will immediately go to the police.

847
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,767
Good night.

848
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,242
I will kill him.

849
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,244
I will kill him!

850
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,248
I will kill anyone who comes at my throat.

851
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,170
I will kill them all!

852
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,673
Every single one of them!

853
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,527
CHEON SANG-WOO

854
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:44,990
What is it?

855
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,995
What are you doing at the office so late?

856
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,122
Do you have a lot of work?

857
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,583
What a shame.

858
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:00,338
Anyway, I should buy Mr. Choi
a new cell phone.

859
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,969
Na-na,

860
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,932
Throwing things, stomping, killing

861
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,185
just because you're unhappy…

862
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,813
You shouldn't do that.

863
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,440
Right?

864
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,548
Where is it?

865
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,760
Where is it?

866
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,817
You!

867
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,612
You…

868
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,700
It's too loud.

869
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:23,254
CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

870
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:28,927
FAITHFUL WARM AND TRUSTY POLICE

871
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,844
Yes.

872
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,013
Thank you. Okay.

873
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:40,021
We have a search and seizure warrant
for TJ headquarters.

874
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:46,653
How are we getting every warrant
approved right away?

875
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,155
It's not fun this way.

876
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,616
It's more fun to break things
and barge in.

877
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,743
What if we don't get fired?

878
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,162
Shut up and prepare
for search and seizure.

879
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,540
-Yes, sir.
-Did you give them a notice?

880
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,708
They won't be blocking us
at the door, right?

881
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,710
They'll be waiting for us with open doors.

882
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,643
This is a search warrant.

883
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,186
Please cooperate.

884
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,730
Please feel free.

885
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,495
I killed her.

886
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,541
You and I are the only ones

887
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,795
who know about this.

888
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,922
Is that enough?

889
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,385
Now we have to trust each other.

890
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,097
Didn't she say everything we needed?

891
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,266
Choi Yong-geun, that punk.

892
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,685
He really was a detective.

893
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,354
He got everything that was needed.

894
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,442
Hand this file over to the prosecutor

895
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,737
and arrest her
as soon as the warrant is issued.

896
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,552
CHEON SANG-WOO

897
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,473
I killed her.

898
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,144
You and I are the only ones

899
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,439
who know about this.

900
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,107
Is that enough?

901
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,317
CHEON SANG-WOO

902
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,889
-The person you have called…
-She knows.

903
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,725
She knows we have the video.

904
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,230
What if she just left
her cell phone at the vacation house?

905
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,440
Perhaps to evade us?

906
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,942
That's not Cheon Na-na's style.

907
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,361
She wouldn't have run away.

908
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,739
The place she's at right now
is where her mother died.

909
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,409
It's also the place
where she committed murder.

910
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,037
We should prepare for every possibility.

911
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,189
What do we do? Should I force it open?

912
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,567
Is she in there for sure?

913
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,447
Where are you?

914
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,492
We have a warrant for your arrest.

915
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,037
We need you to come with us.

916
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,913
You can say what you want there.

917
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,417
Why should I?

918
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,878
It wasn't me.

919
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,048
Cheon Sang-woo killed Jung Hui-ju.

920
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,300
It was Cheon Sang-woo, not me!

921
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,348
I tried to save Jung Hui-ju.

922
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,642
I tried to save her.

923
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,445
Kill Jung Hui-ju!

924
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,824
I will give you enough
for generations to come.

925
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,951
Kill Jung Hui-ju!

926
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,205
Mr. Choi will take care of the rest.

927
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,290
All you need to do, Gi Dong-jae,

928
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,543
is to kill her.

929
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,212
Got it?

930
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,091
I will tell you how you can live.

931
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,426
Take this to the police.

932
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,012
Then the police will protect you.

933
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,351
I'm saving your life.

934
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,645
Instead, you--

935
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,043
Why are you giving this to me?

936
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,464
Send the document on this laptop
to the Blue House using your email.

937
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,759
-What?
-It's the least you two could do.

938
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,106
Wouldn't you need this to stay alive?

939
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,412
What is it?

940
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,707
Let's meet. I have something to tell you.

941
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,793
Today isn't good for me.
It's too late to go.

942
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,672
Are you, by any chance,

943
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,217
at that place where mom croaked?

944
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,719
Why?

945
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:32,141
Do you want to conjure up her ghost
and ask her to curse me?

946
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:39,649
What do you want to tell me?

947
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,775
It's you, isn't it?

948
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,654
You're the one who made
Jung Hui-ju flip out at me like that.

949
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,448
You gave her the idea, didn't you?

950
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,159
Is it in your blood?

951
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,496
Are you losing your mind like your mom?

952
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,250
Do you want to die like your mom,
you lunatic?

953
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,429
It's done.

954
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,322
Please give it to me.

955
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,315
I'm sorry.

956
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,400
About what?

957
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:08,029
What do you have to be sorry for?

958
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,406
Director Woo…

959
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,785
truly loved you.

960
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,124
Don't forgive me.

961
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,630
But please forgive Director Woo.

962
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,214
I beg of you.

963
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,847
Also, congratulations.

964
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:40,811
Director Woo will make a great father.

965
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,152
You…

966
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,452
What did you see?

967
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,664
I hope you will be happy.

968
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,794
Happy?

969
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,840
You hope I will be happy?

970
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:41,998
Why do I have to hear that
from a slut like you?

971
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,651
You were supposed to die anyway.

972
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:18,159
That bastard
Cheon Sang-woo killed you, not me.

973
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,163
It wasn't me.

974
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:24,957
It wasn't me.

975
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,753
It wasn't me.

976
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,089
You were supposed to die.

977
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,302
Cheon Sang-woo killed you, not me.

978
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,929
It wasn't me.

979
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,432
It wasn't me.

980
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,923
Are you okay?

981
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,718
Are you sure you can make me the killer?

982
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,596
Yes. More than enough.

983
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,223
Do it then.

984
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,438
Cheon Na-na, you are under arrest
for the murder of Jung Hui-ju…

985
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,573
and…

986
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,743
the murder of Woo Tae-ho.

987
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,838
You're wrong again.

988
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,757
It wasn't me.

989
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,050
It was you.

990
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,554
I'm right this time.

991
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,372
Is he getting any better?

992
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,919
What good is solving the case?

993
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,006
What good is catching the real killer?

994
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,759
Nothing has changed.

995
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,470
Did you catch the real killer?

996
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,639
Who cares?

997
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,142
He won't even hear us.

998
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:51,812
We should have caught her earlier
and told him loud and clear.

999
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,481
I feel so bad for Mr. Jung.

1000
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,192
You are blaming yourself again.

1001
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,986
You caught the real killer.

1002
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,363
Then you did everything
you could as a detective.

1003
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,699
I didn't catch the killer
because I'm a detective.

1004
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,662
I did it because it hurts.

1005
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,500
Every time I think about Jung Hui-ju,

1006
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,253
it hurts so much.

1007
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,966
Every time I think about
Mr. Jung being in so much pain,

1008
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,094
it hurts me so much.

1009
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,976
Because it hurt me so much,

1010
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,564
I went around like a madman
to catch the real killer.

1011
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:40,027
Tell Mr. Jung.

1012
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,197
Tell him you caught the real killer.

1013
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,241
It's no use.

1014
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,159
No, he will hear you.

1015
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,745
He will know your heart.

1016
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:53,958
He will know that you suffered
as much as he did.

1017
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,306
Mr. Jung…

1018
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:16,438
I caught the person
who killed your granddaughter.

1019
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,818
It was Cheon Na-na.

1020
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,030
Did you hear me?

1021
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,367
Now…

1022
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,415
You can stop suffering.

1023
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,709
I'm sorry.

1024
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,093
Let's go.

1025
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,053
Okay.

1026
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,904
Let's go.

1027
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,691
You don't have to take me home.

1028
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,443
It's nothing.

1029
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:48,822
Of course I have to.

1030
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,408
I thought about it.

1031
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:56,663
I think I can make some time next week.

1032
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,583
So I think we can have dinner…

1033
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,002
Just one minute.

1034
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,504
What?

1035
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,340
Take that.

1036
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,927
Hey.

1037
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,845
-Did you hit me?
-Shit.

1038
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,472
Hey!

1039
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,015
What are you doing?

1040
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,850
Wait.

1041
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,520
Come at me, punk!

1042
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:22,439
You, son of a bitch!

1043
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,277
You can't do this on the side of the road.

1044
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,238
Let's go to the station and talk.

1045
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,740
-Let go!
-You!

1046
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,102
Yeah?

1047
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:02,354
Why?

1048
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,564
Nam-guk!

1049
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,482
Damn.

1050
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,359
Nam-guk!

1051
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,361
Nam-guk!

1052
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,114
-Damn.
-Nam-guk!

1053
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,740
The dog's name is "Nam-guk"?

1054
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:14,867
Apparently.

1055
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,120
Don't you think we looked enough?

1056
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,372
-Let's give up.
-We can't.

1057
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,916
The owner refuses to eat
after he lost the dog.

1058
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,086
Why do we have to look for the dog?
We're detectives.

1059
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,089
The owner is the wife of an official
at the main office!

1060
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:33,218
Chief is still hopeful
about the Superintendent General position.

1061
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,136
Nam-guk!

1062
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,263
Here!

1063
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:38,265
-We found him!
-We found the dog!

1064
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,019
That's Nam-guk?

1065
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,395
Great job!

1066
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,607
Good work, guys. Let's see.

1067
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,525
-Let's see him.
-It's the right one.

1068
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,735
This is him.

1069
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,529
So cute.

1070
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,032
This is not him.

1071
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,701
He has a mark on his back,

1072
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,454
but this one doesn't have one.

1073
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,164
What?

1074
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,459
Wouldn't he look similar
if we dyed the fur over here?

1075
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:09,254
Don't be ridiculous and go find him!

1076
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,048
Where did you find this one?

1077
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:14,218
And where is Man-gu?
Is he marking his territory again?

1078
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,054
He said he smelled deodeok over there.

1079
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,805
-He should be digging them up.
-Hey!

1080
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,101
Hurry!

1081
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,312
-Help me!
-What is wrong with him?

1082
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,396
Is it a boar again?

1083
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,523
I don't see a boar.

1084
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,066
What is he doing?

1085
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:30,734
What's wrong with his face?

1086
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:33,153
His face looks swollen.

1087
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,990
What is he doing?

1088
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,909
Hey, what are you doing?

1089
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,787
What's wrong with your face?

1090
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,163
Bees!

1091
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:07,062
Bees!

1092
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,522
Bees!

1093
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:12,359
Bees!

1094
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,285
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

1095
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:52,959
