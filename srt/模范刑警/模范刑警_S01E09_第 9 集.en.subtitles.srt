1
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:48,506
NOVEMBER 2, 2015, 11 P.M.

2
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,563
You drank. You shouldn't be driving.

3
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,356
There's no checkpoints when it rains.

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,566
Don't worry.

5
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,402
-Please drop me off.
-Here?

6
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,738
I'll call a taxi.

7
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,157
We'll reach downtown soon.
I'll drop you off there.

8
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,202
-Please, Mr. Oh.
-Why?

9
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,163
Do you not even want to spend
another second with me?

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,083
No, it's not like that.

11
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,292
Why then?

12
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,878
What did I do wrong?

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,340
I have a boyfriend.

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,135
I don't want to do anything
that might give him the wrong idea.

15
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:45,063
Why should I care about that lowlife jerk?

16
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,523
Please let me go.

17
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,532
Go.

18
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,276
You can just go. I will call a taxi.

19
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,321
What are you going to do
if I don't let you go?

20
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,532
Mr. Oh, please.

21
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,326
Don't step back. You'll get wet.

22
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,415
You know what?

23
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,961
I've never let anyone take
the things I like from me.

24
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,801
What would you like to do
with this painting?

25
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,263
Should we throw it away?

26
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,057
Keep it in the warehouse.

27
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,059
I might want to see it again sometime.

28
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,991
LATE LEE DAE-CHEOL

29
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,037
-Let's go now.
-Just a little longer.

30
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,914
Let me stay a bit longer.

31
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,415
I'll be waiting outside.

32
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,272
LATE YOO JEONG-SEON

33
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,942
We don't have time.

34
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,652
Secure the CCTV footage from the vicinity.

35
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,655
Don't rely too much on it.
Make sure to interview the witnesses.

36
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,657
That's the basics of investigation, okay?

37
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,866
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

38
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,369
All right. Let's go catch the culprit.

39
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,328
Okay.

40
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,542
All right. Let's go.

41
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,467
Hello.

42
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,390
Did we not get any cases today as usual?

43
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,727
If you're bored, why don't you
go get yourself one?

44
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,563
What's the use of snagging a case?

45
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,523
It will be assigned
to another team right away.

46
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,108
Why on earth are they doing this to us?

47
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,944
Hey, do you really not know why?

48
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,697
Because they want to give us
a negative performance review.

49
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,824
We can't work if we don't
get assigned to any cases.

50
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,910
And if we don't work, we will get an F.

51
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,662
But what did we do wrong?

52
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,331
Is this about Do-chang?

53
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,791
All right then.
What did Do-chang do wrong?

54
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,921
Three, two, one. Time's up.

55
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,465
It's time. Let's go home.

56
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,844
My wife loves it
that I come home on time these days.

57
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,345
Good for you.

58
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,932
Even if we go home early,
we don't have a wife to welcome us.

59
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,142
It has side effects though.

60
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,936
I found out about a secret

61
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,522
she's been keeping from me all this time.

62
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,735
She has this big mole on her butt.

63
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,570
She's kept it from me for 16 years.

64
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,654
Gosh.

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,578
As I've told you,
my father laid most of the groundwork.

66
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,996
Have you not given up yet?

67
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,581
-If any stage
-It's all over now.

68
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,666
-of the process
-You go home first.

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,918
turns out to be unjustified,

70
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,462
-I will give up
-I still have a lot of work to do.

71
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,340
on all of my business.

72
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,636
If you find any evidence
that I broke the law,

73
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,887
WITNESS

74
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,349
I will readily accept any punishment.

75
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,985
Do you like your new office?

76
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,403
Yes.

77
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,574
All the buildings in that area
are run by our company.

78
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,120
So if you don't like it,
you can always move to another one.

79
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,914
You don't have to worry about the rent.

80
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,082
Thank you.

81
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,044
The cops from Seobu Police Station
don't bother you anymore, do they?

82
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,673
At least not yet.

83
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,508
They will quiet down.

84
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,094
They must have learned something
from the trial results.

85
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,640
No matter how hard they try,
they are in the palm of my hand.

86
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,935
Do you know Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?

87
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,980
-Yes.
-He bothers me a little.

88
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,900
Don't worry about him. He's nothing.

89
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,320
Apparently, he's not the kind of guy
who gives up easily.

90
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,823
There's a possibility he'll keep digging.

91
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,706
-Leave him be.
-I'll keep an eye on him.

92
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,542
If he bothers you that much,

93
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,086
kill him.

94
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,300
Why? Because he's a detective?

95
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,636
Wouldn't it be more thrilling
to kill a detective?

96
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,223
Killing a detective

97
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,309
is dangerous.

98
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,273
You're the expert. If you say
it's dangerous, it is.

99
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,901
Let's just keep an eye on him
for the time being. Go.

100
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,743
I'm not a professional killer.

101
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,001
No one can kill a person easily.

102
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,755
You know

103
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,675
how hard it is to kill someone.

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,723
You should be careful

105
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,647
so that Detective Oh Ji-hyeok doesn't find
anything that leads to you.

106
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,875
Can you at least say hello?

107
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,295
Hello, Chief Moon.

108
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,422
You got turned down for a promotion.

109
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,926
It's not my fault.
You brought it on yourself.

110
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,763
Who would want to promote you
when you gave such testimony in court?

111
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,641
I'll get going then.

112
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,647
You'd better stay quiet from now on
if you want to keep your job.

113
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,573
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2
KANG DO-CHANG

114
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,592
YOON SANG-MI

115
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,891
Shall we lower the heat now?
I think it's ready.

116
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,527
Actually, I used to even hate
the smell of tripe.

117
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,280
But it's strange.

118
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,199
You kept forcing me to eat it,

119
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,951
so I came to like it.

120
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,494
For me, it's the opposite.

121
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,539
I find the smell of tripe disgusting now.

122
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,463
The Civil Petition Division was ordered

123
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,008
to deal with you as we see fit.

124
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,054
-So?
-If someone asked me

125
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,350
whom I think is the most
exemplary detective in Korea,

126
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,518
I'd say it's you.

127
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,856
The prosecution says
you might have given false testimony.

128
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,776
I think I can put a stop to it.

129
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,403
It's not like they're entirely blameless.

130
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,072
What do you want from me?

131
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,451
Are you playing with me or what?

132
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,827
Like I said,

133
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,247
it is entirely up to me
to decide what to do with you.

134
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,878
Let me keep working as a detective.

135
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,589
There's

136
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,716
something I need to do.

137
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,926
So I'm asking.

138
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,137
What are you going to do now?

139
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,477
From now on,

140
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,439
I'll turn a blind eye to what I see.

141
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,568
I will cover my ears
and pretend I didn't hear anything.

142
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,821
If you want,

143
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,116
I'll keep my mouth shut as well.

144
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,912
So please don't take my title
as a detective from me.

145
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,999
Is that enough of an answer for you,
Lieutenant Yoon Sang-mi?

146
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,339
I'm glad you think that way.

147
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,134
I will tell my boss accordingly.

148
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,011
I'll get going then.

149
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,305
I heard I wanted to hear.

150
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,279
Thank you. Bye.

151
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,700
Hello.

152
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,994
This is so heavy.

153
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,955
-This is your bag, right?
-Yes.

154
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,665
Hong-du asked me to bring this to you.

155
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,877
He also asked you not to say hello to him
even if you see him again.

156
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,253
Tell him I won't.

157
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,256
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

158
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,258
May I see your ID?

159
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,844
Are you pretending to be a goodie?

160
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,889
You can't change who you are
no matter how hard you try.

161
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,506
What did you draw?

162
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,758
Let me see.

163
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,303
No way. I'll show it only to Ms. Yoon.

164
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,014
Come on. Don't be like that.

165
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,933
Let me see it just once.

166
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,351
It's my wish.

167
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,229
Then you can see this one.

168
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,606
It's me.

169
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,446
Even someone as ignorant as I can tell
this is really something.

170
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,324
How could this be a drawing
of a middle school girl?

171
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,326
Give it back if you're done.

172
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,995
Oh, okay.

173
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,459
Eun-hye, if you become a famous artist,

174
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,836
-you should say you don't have a dad.
-What?

175
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,923
You'll be embarrassed to say

176
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,175
that a guy like me is your dad.

177
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,595
I wouldn't be disappointed at all,
so do as I say.

178
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,724
Let's go eat.

179
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,285
Is anyone in here?

180
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,288
Please give me a minute.

181
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,196
Why are you still up?

182
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,699
You used to sleep
as soon as your head hit the pillow.

183
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,868
What's with you these days?

184
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,662
Give me some soju if you have any left.

185
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,873
You shouldn't drink at this hour.

186
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,168
-Aren't you going to work tomorrow?
-Then forget about it.

187
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,836
Just go get some sleep.

188
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,005
It's four in the morning now.

189
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,466
You go ahead and sleep. Don't bother me.

190
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,134
What's wrong with you?

191
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,639
Because life is so shitty.

192
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,642
It's so shitty

193
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,437
that I can't sleep. Damn it.

194
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,734
I'll bring some soju.
Let's drink together.

195
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,986
Forget it.

196
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,072
If I drink with you,

197
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,532
my life will feel even more pathetic.

198
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,368
What do you want me to do then?

199
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,745
Don't worry about me and go to sleep.

200
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,501
He's acting like he's carrying
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

201
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,586
Are you in agony?

202
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,588
It's something only brainy people do.

203
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,342
Why is he being so ridiculous
talking out of his ass?

204
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,770
Look. There he comes.

205
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,065
You were acquitted at the first trial.
How do you feel?

206
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,733
The prosecution says they will appeal.

207
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,443
How will you prepare for the second trial?

208
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,278
You're acquitted
of only some of your charges.

209
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,738
Do you admit to the other charges?

210
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,906
Did you expect this?

211
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,533
-Please say a word.
-Let me through.

212
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,911
-Do you admit to your charges?
-How are you feeling?

213
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,913
-Please answer us.
-Did you expect all this?

214
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,374
-Please say a word.
-Do you admit to your charges?

215
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,334
- How do you feel?
-Please say something.

216
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,378
Please say a word about the ruling.

217
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,880
MINISTER OF JUSTICE YOO JEONG-RYEOL

218
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,228
The result is out. He's been acquitted.

219
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,647
I talked to the prosecutor in charge.

220
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,150
They expected it and are preparing
for the second trial.

221
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,486
Gi-tae will grovel. He's been warned.

222
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,447
He will have to.

223
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,703
This is the retrial record
of Lee Dae-cheol's case.

224
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,999
It's highly likely
that Oh Jong-tae is the real culprit.

225
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,501
That's why

226
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,670
he pounced on us.

227
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,923
The retrial is over,
and the execution has been carried out.

228
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,508
There will be no problem.

229
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,096
Did you help Oh Jong-tae?

230
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,515
It just happened to be at the time
the hearing was held.

231
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,767
Why would I do that?

232
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,727
I see.

233
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,105
If it's just coincidence, he's very lucky.

234
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,193
Let's go. We're running late.

235
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,319
Okay.

236
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,738
By the way,

237
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,743
did Oh Jong-tae kill
the detective as well?

238
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,872
The way I see it, he doesn't
seem that reckless.

239
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,416
Well, I guess he thinks

240
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,419
he has enough power
to cover up a detective's death.

241
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,505
You better distance yourself from him now.

242
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,923
You don't want to mess with him.

243
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,633
Okay.

244
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,892
Ms. Jin, you worked so hard on my case.

245
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,435
I'm sorry it all went down the drain.

246
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,646
Don't be disappointed though.

247
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,439
There will be second and third trials.

248
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,441
Considering the competency
of your council,

249
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,069
I don't think the result will change.

250
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,282
A trial doesn't take place in court.

251
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,993
It's all about

252
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,995
who comes up with the best plans.

253
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,665
Just like Lee Dae-cheol's trial.

254
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,630
But why wasn't the recording
mentioned at the trial?

255
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,259
If it was accepted as evidence,
it would've helped.

256
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,011
It's the sore spot
of the prosecution and the police.

257
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,388
It wouldn't have been much help.

258
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,600
Did you let Yoo Jeong-seok

259
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,436
hear the recording as well?

260
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,568
I see. That's why.

261
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,655
"If you reveal the recording,
your career will be destroyed."

262
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,449
This is how he convinced you, right?

263
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,494
It has nothing to do with Mr. Yoo.
It was my decision.

264
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,079
Ms. Jin Seo-kyung.

265
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,707
You had no intention
to save Lee Dae-cheol, right?

266
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,836
I understand.

267
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,838
You can't kill yourself
to save someone else.

268
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,174
It'd be such a foolish thing to do.

269
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,563
Red light. Green light.

270
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,857
Red light. Green light.

271
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,117
Red light. Green light.

272
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,953
Red light. Green light.

273
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,165
Red light. Green light.

274
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,376
Red light. Green light.

275
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,087
I got you.

276
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,149
I like the facilities here,

277
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,360
but I'm not happy with the sauna.

278
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,820
Do they turn off the heat halfway or what?

279
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,280
It's just not hot enough.

280
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,915
My brother is having
a hard time these days.

281
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,959
He can't even sleep.

282
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,086
So?

283
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,215
And I'm not in my right mind
because of my kid these days.

284
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,301
With my brother losing his mind,

285
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,887
our place is such a mess.

286
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,806
Will you come over and clean it up?

287
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,351
You don't have to pay for rent or food.

288
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,560
Why would I?

289
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,563
When things are tough,
having someone around

290
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,607
is more helpful than being alone.

291
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,611
It's tough for you too.

292
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,741
I'm fine.

293
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,869
I went to see my son today.

294
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,581
That bastard got me a restraining order,

295
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,084
so I just saw him from a distance.

296
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,089
Screw the law. I just want to run to him
and hold him in my arms.

297
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,218
But if I do that, my dear son,

298
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,763
Jae-ung will miss me even more.

299
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,476
That's what being a parent is like.

300
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,106
I'm too busy dealing with my problems
to care about my son's.

301
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,276
But what really breaks my heart is

302
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,613
that when Jae-ung goes
through a hard time,

303
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,535
he has no one to talk to

304
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,331
about his suffering.

305
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,127
I will listen to you.

306
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,715
It might comfort me as well.

307
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,172
Ms. Jin Seo-kyung.

308
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,841
You had no intention
to save Lee Dae-cheol, right?

309
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,760
I understand.

310
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,762
You can't kill yourself
to save someone else.

311
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,680
It'd be such a foolish thing to do.

312
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,574
Gosh, Jae-hong. You should
quit drinking and start exercising.

313
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,742
He runs fast,
but he's not good at anything else.

314
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,912
You were lying about being a taekwondo
instructor in the military, right?

315
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,622
Of course it was a lie.

316
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,541
And how could you be so slow?

317
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,751
You should've let him hit you
to be nice to him.

318
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,296
-You're so clueless.
-What the hell are you talking about?

319
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,548
Do it right.

320
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,925
If you go easy on me, I'll kill you.

321
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,531
-Hey, stop it.
-Gosh.

322
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,909
-Gosh.
-Are you all right?

323
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,330
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

324
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,623
You're bleeding.

325
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,834
Jae-hong, you can't beat him up for real.

326
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,252
Did you break your nose?

327
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,462
Oh, dear.

328
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,547
I didn't kick that hard.

329
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,258
You should've dodged it.

330
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,551
Okay. One more round.

331
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,470
What are you talking about, you fool?

332
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,096
Good going.

333
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,307
You should have done this at work.

334
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,393
We can't do this even if we wanted to.
We have no work.

335
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,897
We have nothing to do. That's why
we are fighting against one another.

336
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,274
You're all free today, right?

337
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,110
It's something important,
so you have to make time for it.

338
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,615
Let me check your teeth.

339
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,283
Another round.

340
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,369
-Your nose is bleeding. You lost.
-What?

341
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,372
I'm not available today.

342
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,625
Can we grab a drink sometime later?

343
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,293
What about the other guys?

344
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,337
I see.

345
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,216
All right then. Okay.

346
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,136
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

347
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,307
Do you have time?
Do you want to drink with me?

348
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,976
I have plans tonight.

349
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,353
I see. All right.

350
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,313
Hello?

351
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,441
Yes. What's the matter?

352
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,528
Okay. I'll see you there then.

353
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,406
Hey, you said you had plans.

354
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,659
You didn't have plans.
You just got one now, right?

355
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,037
The person who just called me is a woman.

356
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,456
See you.

357
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,752
Fine. A woman.

358
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,171
I can do that too.

359
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,549
Let me see. A woman…

360
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,468
Darn it.

361
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,095
Women hold up half the sky,

362
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,805
but there's none on my phone.

363
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,099
A woman…

364
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,774
-I'll have the same.
-Okay.

365
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,573
Someone is lucky that he passes out
after only one drink.

366
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,200
No matter how much I drink,
I never get drunk.

367
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,327
I know.

368
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,079
So what made you blow the whistle again?

369
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,759
Why…

370
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,804
Why do you think Detective Kang
gave such testimony at the trial

371
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,891
when he knew he'd be sacrificing himself?

372
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:25,935
Why is that?

373
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,355
He was trying to save
Lee Dae-cheol at all costs.

374
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,275
So he thinks he's something.

375
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,777
He wasn't the only one who tried it.

376
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,613
Park Gun-ho, who's dead now,
did the same thing.

377
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,047
Listen to this and see
what they're talking about.

378
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,596
Prosecutor Jung,
please help me out just this once.

379
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,349
Can you call the civil petition officer
and talk to him?

380
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,518
I have no power.

381
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,813
Do you not remember
Lee Dae-cheol's case from five years ago?

382
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,858
If you didn't ask me for a favor,
I would've let him go.

383
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,454
-Congratulations, Do-chang!
-Congratulations.

384
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,457
What's going on? It's not my birthday.
What is this for?

385
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,001
The thing is… We're here to celebrate…

386
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,963
It's the 4,000th… 6,400th…

387
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,674
-It's the 6,428th.
-Right. It's the 6,428th.

388
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:42,387
Today marks the 6,428th day
since you got your police badge!

389
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,640
What the hell are you talking about?

390
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:50,103
-Blow out the candles.
-Blow out the candles.

391
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,020
I'll blow them out.

392
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,734
Congratulations.

393
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,404
You've worked so hard
for the past 6,428 days.

394
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,030
Hey, did you…

395
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,949
Stop thinking and just drink.

396
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,076
We only have soju.

397
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,578
-Okay.
-If you need anything else,

398
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,122
go to the convenience store
and get it yourself.

399
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,749
-Okay.
-Come here.

400
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,917
That's unbelievable. 6,428 days?

401
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,171
-Thanks, anyway.
-Let's sit.

402
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,798
-Gosh.
-How could you even think of this?

403
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,218
When did you get this?

404
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,222
I got it from Chief Prosecutor Kim Gi-tae
before the last trial.

405
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,976
-But why…
-It's my mistake.

406
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,563
If this had been revealed,

407
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,107
Lee Dae-cheol could've lived, right?

408
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:44,240
Don't look at me like that.
I'm already angry at myself.

409
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,416
He was executed because of this.

410
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,586
Lee Dae-cheol had to die

411
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,047
so the prosecution and the police
could forever bury the fact

412
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,840
that they manipulated the case.

413
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,176
We did all that for nothing.

414
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,178
They had decided

415
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,014
to sacrifice Lee Dae-cheol
from the get-go.

416
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,808
But if I had…

417
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,185
Do you know what the most
common mistake reporters make is?

418
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,230
They think they can change everything
in one blow.

419
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,689
A reporter isn't the protagonist.

420
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,983
You're being sarcastic.

421
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,777
A mere reporter doesn't
need to feel guilty.

422
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,904
Isn't a reporter supposed
to work with fact?

423
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,990
What can you do
only with this recording file?

424
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,742
Who did this and why?

425
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,704
Why did he give you this before the trial?
You should look into all those things.

426
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,958
Instead of wasting your time
on useless feelings

427
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,876
like guilty conscience.

428
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,296
You are being brutally straightforward,
not sarcastic.

429
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,090
Send this file to me.

430
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,092
I think it will help
the investigation a lot.

431
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,180
If you find out anything about this file,

432
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,890
please call me right away.

433
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,769
I have an important plan,
so I should get going.

434
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,521
Don't drink too much.

435
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,610
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

436
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,487
Please keep this for me.

437
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,322
I'll have a 24-year-old one instead.

438
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,533
The smarty-pants over there will pay.

439
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,742
Okay.

440
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,879
I think Ji-hyeok wants
to keep digging into Oh Jong-tae.

441
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,840
But there won't be another retrial.

442
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,842
Even if he's the real culprit,
we can't catch him.

443
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,051
You know that.

444
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,554
Eun-hui. Where's soju? Eun-hui!

445
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,472
She must be tired. Leave her alone.

446
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,850
We can get it ourselves.

447
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,977
-Hi, come on in.
-Have a seat.

448
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,896
You said you had plans with a woman.

449
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,274
I ended it early to be here.

450
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,444
End it early? What did you do?

451
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,780
I guess you're seeing someone.
I'm so jealous.

452
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,116
It'd be strange if he wasn't
seeing anyone with that face.

453
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,034
What about me?

454
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,703
Why am I single with this face?

455
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,787
Hey.

456
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,790
Do you care about a woman’s looks or not?

457
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,043
Of course I do. Everyone does.

458
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,795
That's why you can't find a woman.

459
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,714
Put yourself in the woman's shoes.

460
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,424
If the woman has your face,

461
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,551
would you date her or not?

462
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,094
I totally get it now.

463
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,930
Of course not.

464
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,556
Gosh, I just pictured it.

465
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,516
Me too.

466
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,477
Gosh.

467
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,440
Do-chang, does Eun-hui have a boyfriend?

468
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,567
-Why do you ask?
-She's my type.

469
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,153
Gosh, stop it.

470
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,155
She's divorced and she's older than you.

471
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,490
So what?

472
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:34,202
Hey, Eun-hui is a judo gold medalist.

473
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,454
If you act up, she will
throw you down immediately.

474
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,874
Eun-hui reminds me of my mom.

475
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,461
My mom used to punch me
whenever she got upset.

476
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,922
She's just like my mom.

477
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,844
Oh, no. I should get going.

478
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,846
My wife is calling me.

479
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,390
It's too early. Why are you leaving?

480
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,766
Just let him go.

481
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,102
They're in their honeymoon phase again.
Things are so hot.

482
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,437
I'm sorry. You don't have to get up.

483
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,147
Make sure to come to work on time.

484
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,774
As long as you come on time,

485
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,235
you can go to a sauna or take a nap.

486
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,695
I won't even care. Okay?

487
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,946
-Okay. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

488
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,614
-Bye.
-Go home safely.

489
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,034
Well,

490
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,663
about Jo Seong-dae.
You caught him before, right?

491
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,249
Yes. Why do you ask?

492
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,377
I have to catch that scumbag.

493
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,964
What was he arrested for back then?

494
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,342
-For murdering Park Gun-ho.
-That's good.

495
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,387
So it has nothing to do
with Lee Dae-cheol's case, right?

496
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,722
Right.

497
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,307
If you catch Jo Seong-dae,

498
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,435
you'll be able to catch Oh Jong-tae
who's behind him.

499
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,568
Hello? What's up?

500
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:52,238
But Team Two concluded that
Park Gun-ho's case was a suicide.

501
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,323
Why does it even matter?

502
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,119
I'll catch him no matter what
and kick his ass.

503
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,913
What?

504
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,665
Han Dae-seong?

505
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,751
He's a conscripted policeman
at our station. Why?

506
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,063
I'll go in and see what's going on.

507
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,272
You guys wait here.

508
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,565
Okay.

509
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,319
Isn't Han Dae-seong Chief Moon's orderly?

510
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,655
Won't the chief take care of this
if we tell him?

511
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,199
He's his orderly.

512
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:40,328
There's no way he'd do that.
He'll try to put him in the guardhouse.

513
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,954
Goodness.

514
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,753
Gosh, it hurts.

515
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,506
-Goodness.
-Are you busy?

516
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,341
-Can we talk?
-Sure.

517
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:07,480
You didn't tell them
that he's a conscripted policeman, right?

518
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,357
-No.
-Good.

519
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,484
So why did it happen?

520
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,903
He was drinking alone,
and he got into a scuffle with them.

521
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,864
Dae-seong is a decent guy
who's preparing for the police exam.

522
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,450
Is there any way
he can get away with this?

523
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,578
He beat them up
without getting hit even once.

524
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,705
It's hard to say that
both parties are at fault.

525
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,166
It's a complicated situation.

526
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,292
Who are the victims?

527
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,129
They don't have
any serious criminal records.

528
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,798
They were let off with a warning
for a few minor offenses.

529
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,217
They are just some town bullies.

530
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,845
We can scare them a little
to shut them up.

531
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,265
Give me all the cash you have.

532
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,358
My goodness.

533
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,028
How would I settle with this?
Do you have only 2,000 won?

534
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,406
And you have nothing?

535
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,409
It's so crumpled. Darn it.

536
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,662
Go withdraw some cash.

537
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,706
-Cash?
-I have no money in my account.

538
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,876
Get a cash advance as much as you can.

539
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,305
Cool.

540
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,266
Doesn't everyone have
this much money in their wallets?

541
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,477
He's so cocky.

542
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,113
Gosh.

543
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,207
Take this.

544
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,342
-Are you kidding me?
-Isn't it enough?

545
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,887
Of course not. Not even close.

546
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,102
POLICE AGENCY

547
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,190
Go easy on me. This is all I have.

548
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,400
Good evening.

549
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,617
Don't be afraid.

550
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,453
We're just his co-workers.

551
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,121
Look at your faces.

552
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,874
I guess we will get to see
each other quite often.

553
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,460
We will treat you nicely.
Come visit us anytime.

554
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,844
Did you hear
what Detective Kwon said earlier?

555
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,763
He said he'd catch
Jo Seong-dae no matter what.

556
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,309
No one has been charged
for Park Gun-ho's case yet.

557
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,560
If we work on the case,

558
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,438
we can catch Jo Seong-dae and Oh Jong-tae.

559
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,232
Chief Moon wouldn't

560
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,859
let us work on the case
that Nam Guk-hyeon closed.

561
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,904
Then we should drag Chief Moon down first.

562
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,033
Lieutenant Oh,
he's a senior superintendent.

563
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,078
No matter how much you try,
you can't get any dirt on him.

564
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,705
Yes, I can.

565
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,957
I'll tell you more about it tomorrow.

566
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,794
What is it that gives you
this baseless confidence?

567
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,587
It's you, my partner.

568
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,674
If things go wrong, you'll
put the blame on your partner

569
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,883
and run away, right?

570
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,178
Now you know me.

571
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,975
It's so hard to like you.

572
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,561
-Hang on. Pull over.
-Why?

573
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,364
Eun-hye.

574
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,286
What are you doing here?

575
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,915
I'm going home.

576
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,793
Home?

577
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,753
Yes.

578
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,423
Move over.

579
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,634
Don't flush toilet paper down the toilet.

580
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,219
The water pressure is low.

581
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,805
And make sure to fold the blankets

582
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,932
and put them in the closet in the morning.

583
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,643
Stop nagging and leave her alone.

584
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,853
Shut it.

585
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,614
You must have

586
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,574
been through a lot.

587
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,079
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

588
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,663
No, it's not.

589
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,460
Dad and I are very grateful to you.

590
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,253
I can't

591
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,007
tell you to forget the whole thing.

592
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,133
But

593
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,387
at least we can try.

594
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,638
I'll forget all about it.

595
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,224
That's what Dad wants.

596
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:55,935
But…

597
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,854
I'm still furious.

598
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,982
The man…

599
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,069
The man who killed Ms. Yoon Ji-seon.

600
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,323
He must be living at peace somewhere.

601
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,743
He must be punished for his crime.

602
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,497
My dad died in his place.

603
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,002
You will catch him, right?

604
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,676
Sure. I will catch him.

605
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,054
I will catch him and punish him.
That's my job.

606
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,140
Promise me.

607
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,274
If I ever

608
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,653
seem to get weak,

609
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,322
you have to tell me

610
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,242
to keep my promise.

611
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,578
Okay?

612
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,914
Seal.

613
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,503
Copy.

614
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,802
SEOBU POLICE STATION

615
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,521
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

616
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,398
What did the chief say?

617
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,734
I was wrong.

618
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,695
-It can't be helped.
-What the hell…

619
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,369
What is it?

620
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,624
Are you in the wrong office?

621
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,043
Dae-seong didn't do anything wrong.
Don't punish him.

622
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,670
I heard everything from him.

623
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,881
You always let him drive
when you're drunk.

624
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,591
He even tutored your kid.

625
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,885
He even waited over three hours
at the airport

626
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,803
for your mother-in-law yesterday.

627
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,097
He got upset over it,
so he drank and made a mistake.

628
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,518
Who do you think is at fault here,
Chief Moon Sang-beom?

629
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,104
All right. Fine.

630
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,190
I'll let him get away with it.

631
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,778
But do you think you'll be okay
after doing this to me?

632
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,197
I wouldn't do this
if you did your job right.

633
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,200
Fine. I'll do my job and tell you this
as a chief.

634
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,119
You will never be back
on the Violent Crimes Unit again.

635
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,206
I'll make you clean up

636
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,084
after some minor offenders
until you retire.

637
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,798
Do you think that will make me quit?

638
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,176
No, I won't.
There's something I have to see.

639
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,803
I will make sure I see you
shed tears of blood.

640
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,438
Good job.

641
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,274
-Did you check your email?
-Yes.

642
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,235
Yes, sir. I'll send it to you right away.

643
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,404
He was executed because of this.

644
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,447
Lee Dae-cheol had to die

645
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,117
so the prosecution and the police
could forever bury the fact

646
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,660
that they manipulated the case.

647
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,748
FORMER CHIEF PROSECUTOR KIM GI-TAE

648
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,084
Hello, Ms. Jin.

649
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,086
Hello. I have a question.

650
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,379
What is it?

651
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,673
Where did you get
the recording file? And when?

652
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,760
I'm not sure. It was a long time ago.

653
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,138
The execution was carried out
because of that, right?

654
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,059
Oh, right. I remember it now.

655
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,688
I think I got it
from the Ministry of Justice.

656
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,149
I think that's when Lee Gyu-jo was
the Minister of Justice.

657
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,236
I'm with an important visitor,
so I can't tell you the details now.

658
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,990
Okay. I'll call you back later.

659
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,800
Okay, fine. Just don't go around
talking about that to anyone else.

660
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,428
Okay, sure. I'll forget about

661
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:04,224
everything that happened between us
as of this very moment.

662
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,065
Moon Sang-beom, that jerk.

663
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,984
What should I do to destroy him
to my satisfaction?

664
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,362
We still need to get some work done.

665
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,740
If we reveal this, Chief Moon
and Prosecutor Jung will be over.

666
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,408
This must have been recorded by someone

667
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,702
at the Civil Petition Division
who was going after Chief Moon.

668
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,873
The police dug out the prosecution's
corruption while digging into their own.

669
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,625
Once this is disclosed,

670
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,128
the police and the prosecution who are
on bad terms will bite at each other.

671
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,340
Then they'll realize it's hurting them
both and try to come to a settlement.

672
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:41,261
"Let's put an end to it by crushing
everyone involved in this."

673
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,265
Chief Moon, Prosecutor Jung, and even us.

674
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,267
I don't care if we all go under together.

675
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,063
But if we get dismissed, we won't
be able to catch Oh Jong-tae.

676
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,316
Where did you get this file?

677
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,194
If we revealed this at the trial,
it would have helped us.

678
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,490
It's too late. What can we do?

679
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,909
First, we need to find out more about

680
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,828
Chief Moon's corruption
mentioned in the file.

681
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,954
That's our first priority.

682
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,083
That's easy once I put my mind to it.

683
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,045
He let me take care
of his personal business.

684
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,756
I see. Is that what you mostly did?

685
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,509
-It's officially known as that?
-Yes.

686
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,261
Mostly after work…

687
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,891
Thank you. It helped a lot.

688
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,934
Okay.

689
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,562
Detective Kang.

690
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,981
Why? Is there anything else to say?

691
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,066
Once this is revealed,

692
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,444
Chief Moon will be dismissed, right?

693
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,281
He's done a lot of mean things to me,

694
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,867
but when my mom was sick in the hospital,

695
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,703
he came to see her and offered
some words of comfort.

696
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,080
Hey, he still needs
to pay for what he did.

697
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm preparing for the police exam
because I want to be a cop.

698
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,294
And Chief Moon is a cop too.

699
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,719
Make sure to pass the exam.

700
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,929
You'll be a good cop.

701
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,474
Thank you.

702
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,434
Thank you.

703
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,620
Hello, Chief.

704
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,790
I thought you'd at least
make the inspector general.

705
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,251
So why did you…

706
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,046
Never mind. It's too late anyway.

707
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,798
You shouldn't bite off
more than you can chew.

708
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,842
And an evil deed will be discovered.

709
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,933
Are you saying all that to me?

710
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,392
Gosh, no.

711
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,187
I was talking to myself. Never mind.

712
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,275
That little…

713
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,865
What's wrong with him?

714
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,423
Is he trying to dig up dirt on me?

715
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,809
I heard your team is not getting any cases
from the Detective Division.

716
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:34,977
Well, right.

717
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,480
You guys didn't do anything wrong.
Why are they being so petty?

718
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,608
I'll talk to Mr. Kim and take care of it.

719
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,610
We're already short-handed.

720
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,280
We can't leave experienced cops like you
sit around.

721
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:53,537
So do you guys still hang out
with Kang Do-chang and drink together?

722
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,998
I know you're close.

723
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,088
You should've put it on vibrate.

724
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,840
-Please excuse me.
-Take it. It's okay.

725
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,717
-Make it short.
-Yes, sir.

726
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,386
What is it?

727
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,472
Just think about it.

728
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,975
If you were me, would you talk
about the station you work at?

729
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,520
Hey, you've changed since you
transferred to the headquarters.

730
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,149
Is Chief Moon listening?

731
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,109
Forget it. I'm in a meeting.
I'm hanging up.

732
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,652
Just hang up.

733
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,950
We planned this together,
but his words still hurt my feelings.

734
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,621
Who were you talking to
at the headquarters?

735
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,041
A friend of mine
from the Civil Petition Division.

736
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,376
Why? What's wrong?

737
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,424
He was informed that someone
is taking bribes at this station

738
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,718
-and was asking me about it.
-What?

739
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,847
-Like what?
-He didn't tell me the details.

740
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,059
I guess it's from the executive level.

741
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,063
My goodness.

742
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,566
Chief Moon, you should call the executives
and warn them.

743
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,500
Hello. I'm Reporter Jin Seo-kyung
from Jeonghan Daily.

744
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,418
-I'm busy right now.
-Let me ask you something.

745
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,837
Why did you approve the executions
before your resignation?

746
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,839
Let's do this later, okay?

747
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,802
Did you do it to help
Minister Yoo's political position?

748
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,304
-Where are you from again?
-Jeonghan Daily.

749
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,932
Are you doing this
with your boss's permission?

750
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:37,974
Not really.

751
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,520
Sir.

752
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,813
Sir.

753
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,667
You look very kind.

754
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,337
You look very nice too.

755
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,966
You'd need a lot of money at your age.

756
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:15,220
There are a lot of things
you want to buy and do.

757
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,305
Then why don't you give me some?

758
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,349
Only those who work get money.

759
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,310
If you want me to give you money,

760
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,771
you should do some work for that.

761
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,404
Do you know Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?

762
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,781
All right.

763
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:39,369
Then can you tell me what that punk

764
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,621
did to a nice girl like you?

765
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,679
Do you not remember
Lee Dae-cheol's case from five years ago?

766
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:02,517
If you didn't ask me for a favor,
I would have let him go.

767
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,604
Chief Moon, what are you talking about?

768
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,565
You asked me to conceal the evidence.

769
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,360
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?
You're unbelievable.

770
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,203
Jin Seo-kyung speaking.

771
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,372
What is this? Why did you
send me this email?

772
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,124
Did your boss make you do it?

773
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,793
No. It's not that.

774
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,586
What is Jeonghan Daily
trying to pull here?

775
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,213
Sir, I was just--

776
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,298
Yoo Jeong-seok, that jerk set it all up.

777
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,884
And now he's trying
to put the blame on me?

778
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,845
Because I'm no longer a minister?

779
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,182
Sir, I must've been mistaken.

780
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,975
What?

781
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,811
I should've checked the facts first.

782
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,604
If you let it slide this once,

783
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,316
I will talk to my boss
and get it off my hands.

784
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,692
I apologize.

785
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,747
Is this everything?

786
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,598
What Han Dae-seong saw at his place
was just the tip of the iceberg.

787
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,977
He's been hiding a lot.

788
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,479
Let's go.

789
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,458
Those rats.

790
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,344
Turn around at the intersection
after the tunnel.

791
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,638
-What?
-He's been in the Violent Crimes Unit

792
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,807
for over ten years.

793
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,975
He knows we're after him.

794
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,314
It's me.

795
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,691
We're at
the Seowon-gu Office Intersection.

796
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,860
He's heading to Gahyeon High School.

797
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,404
Yes. You know the plate number, right?

798
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,322
Yes.

799
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,672
Good job.

800
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,091
How much is it? I should pay the meter.

801
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,926
No, it's okay. I'll get going.

802
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,804
No. I have to pay.
Did you not turn on the meter?

803
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,847
Hey, I only have 20,000 won.

804
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,183
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

805
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,231
-Thank you.
-Bye.

806
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,401
Who is he?

807
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,986
An ex-con mugger.

808
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,239
After he was released
and got his own taxi,

809
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,199
I got him a job at a taxi company.

810
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,330
Take pictures.

811
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,546
-Done.
-Okay.

812
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,017
My gosh.

813
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,146
Lie close in here.

814
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,709
Hey.

815
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:42,422
Make sure to get me
the car rental receipt.

816
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,424
I'll get it reimbursed from our budget.

817
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,426
-Gosh, it's okay.
-No, it's not.

818
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,054
I can't stand it when you show off
your wealth.

819
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,556
That's my car.

820
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,309
You have two cars?

821
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,436
The other one is for commuting.

822
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,147
This one is my second car. For leisure.

823
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,107
I see.

824
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:06,196
Only rich guys like you
should be police officers.

825
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,491
Then they wouldn't do
anything pathetic like him.

826
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:11,701
That sick bastard.

827
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,459
Okay. He's leaving.

828
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,359
-Is this real?
-Yes, it is.

829
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,967
And Chief Moon is a cop too.

830
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,347
Damn it.

831
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,538
103-3 SAEMTEO-RO, HANJUNG-DONG,
SEOHEUNG, GYEONGGI

832
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,474
-Hello.
-Good morning.

833
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,850
Hello.

834
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,477
Okay.

835
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,604
JEONGHAN DAILY

836
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,606
POLICE OFFICER FOUND DEAD,
APPEARS TO BE SUICIDE

837
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,569
POLICE OFFICER FOUND DEAD,
APPEARS TO BE SUICIDE

838
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,198
REPORTER SONG GWANG-HUI

839
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,741
-Hello.
-Hello.

840
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,160
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

841
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,460
Mr. Song.

842
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,797
Do you remember the suicide case of a
police officer from Incheon Police Agency?

843
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,257
Oh, that one.

844
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,259
It took a lot of work.

845
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,802
They kept trying to hide things,

846
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,639
so I assumed there was something
and even ran through their trash.

847
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,723
But there was nothing.

848
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,308
Did you find anything though?

849
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,311
I did find a discarded flash drive.

850
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,605
Did you check what was on the flash drive?

851
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,232
No. It was damaged.

852
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,068
Mr. Yoo checked it first
after it was restored.

853
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,403
He said there was nothing. That's it.

854
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,739
Why do you ask?

855
00:58:56,324 --> 00:59:00,370
There's a case I want to cover,
and it happened around the same time.

856
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,288
So I was wondering if they were related.

857
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,998
-Thank you anyway.
-No problem.

858
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,378
A restored flash drive?

859
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,718
He was executed because of this.

860
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,263
I think I got it
from the Ministry of Justice.

861
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,390
Yoo Jeong-seok, that jerk set it all up.

862
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,809
And now he's trying
to put the blame on me?

863
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:27,981
Okay. Let's do that.

864
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,570
All right.

865
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,284
Mr. Yoo already knew
about the recording a long time ago.

866
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,758
You rat.

867
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:00,638
Those photos have already been
sent to the Civil Petition Division.

868
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,684
Now, you can go and grow vegetables
in that greenhouse.

869
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,145
Honestly, I'm still not satisfied.

870
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,732
You fabricated the weapon
of Lee Dae-cheol's case.

871
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,568
And you colluded with the prosecutor
to conceal all the real evidence.

872
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,780
Considering all the crimes
you've committed,

873
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,325
letting you rot in prison
for life isn't enough.

874
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,748
So this is about
Lee Dae-cheol's case after all.

875
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,791
Why did you do that? Why?

876
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,919
Who bribed you? And how much did you get?

877
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,840
Why did you let Lee Dae-cheol die
when he was innocent?

878
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,175
Why?

879
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,843
I didn't get any money.

880
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,346
I swear to God.

881
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,307
That doesn't make sense.
There must be a reason.

882
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,851
I just did what I believed was right.

883
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,604
I was convinced that Lee Dae-cheol
was the real culprit.

884
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,022
I still am.

885
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,359
Did I fabricate the weapon?

886
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,402
Yes, I did.

887
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,655
But if we didn't find
anything at the scene,

888
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,907
Lee Dae-cheol would've been acquitted.

889
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,619
He's the one who killed Jang Jin-su.

890
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,623
That jerk killed a man who was
my junior and your co-worker.

891
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:14,420
All I did was make a murderer
the culprit of the case.

892
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,299
Really?

893
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,053
Are you sure that's the only reason?

894
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:27,350
Bring all the detectives in this country
and ask them.

895
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,896
Ask them if I'm the only one who presented
fabricated evidence at trial.

896
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,398
Are you serious?

897
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,403
Do you still believe
Lee Dae-cheol is the murderer?

898
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,488
My opinion hasn't changed.

899
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,534
It's been 6,428 days.

900
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,579
I've served

901
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,625
in the police force for 6,428 days.

902
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,336
After all these days,

903
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,632
do you think I can't even
recognize a murderer?

904
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,217
Do you think that's why

905
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,846
I risked my whole career trying
to prove Lee Dae-cheol's innocence?

906
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,267
Please.

907
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,979
It's still not too late.

908
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,857
Just admit it.

909
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,609
We were both wrong back then.

910
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,696
But now, you're wrong.

911
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:24,907
And I'm right.

912
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,134
What did he say? Did he admit
to fabricating the evidence?

913
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,763
So who was behind him?

914
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,515
The thing is…

915
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,607
Hey.

916
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,692
What do you think you're doing?

917
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,616
You're under arrest
for sexually molesting a minor.

918
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,843
Once Oh Ji-hyeok gets fired,

919
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,887
kill him.

920
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,102
Here.

921
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,781
This is

922
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,369
the CCTV footage of you
entering a hotel room with Jang Yu-na.

923
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,085
And here's a copy of the receipt
that proves you paid for the room

924
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,004
with your credit card.

925
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,457
Lieutenant Oh of the Violent Crimes Unit?

926
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,459
-Oh Ji-hyeok?
-Tell her

927
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,461
Sue me only for sexual assault.

928
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,047
-No one has your back.
-Do you swear you're not here

929
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:26,964
to help that cop?

930
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,800
You know how much I hate cops.

931
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,677
If you wanted to screw me over,
you should've done a better job.

932
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,056
How about we call it even
and forget about what we both know?

933
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,558
Gosh, I guess Captain Nam
failed to check this one.

934
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,811
Now we just need to find the guy
who tried to frame Ji-hyeok.

935
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:41,771
Come here, you jerk.

936
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,689
Can I beat the shit out of him?

937
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,650
If you're bothered by Oh Jong-tae,

938
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,610
what I know about him
might help you a little.

939
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,528
Don't try so hard to make me quit my job.

940
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,656
Even if I quit my job,
I'll still come after you.

941
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,616
Arrest me if you can.

942
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:59,121
