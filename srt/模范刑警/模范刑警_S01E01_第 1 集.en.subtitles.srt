1
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:48,506
NOVEMBER 3 2015, 3 A.M.

2
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,954
-We've found the body!
-What?

3
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,539
Will you move over a little?

4
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,082
You've missed a spot.

5
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,208
To the right.

6
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,502
NOVEMBER 3 2015, 4 P.M.

7
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,337
DO NOT ENTER

8
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,718
Did you find anything there?

9
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,303
-Look that way.
-Okay.

10
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,471
-Watch carefully.
-Yes, sir.

11
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,265
Come over here.

12
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,766
What is it?

13
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,351
Is something there?

14
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,895
Move over that way.

15
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,578
NOVEMBER 13 2015, 3 P.M.

16
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,663
-The door.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,296
You're under arrest.

18
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,465
Eun-hye.

19
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,343
-Cuff him in the car.
-Okay.

20
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,477
I've bought you some mandarins.
They're on the table.

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,230
Eat them and play games just for an hour.

22
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,441
By the time you're done, I'll be home.

23
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,651
Let's have dinner together then.

24
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,238
Go.

25
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,670
Defendant Lee Dae-cheol
murdered a female college student

26
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,130
and abandoned the body.

27
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,300
Then he premeditatedly murdered
the detective in charge of the case

28
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,385
and abandoned the body again.

29
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,305
Since the victims
have all been murdered brutally,

30
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,141
the nature and the extent of his crimes
should not be treated lightly.

31
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,479
Therefore, the court sentences
the defendant Lee Dae-cheol to death.

32
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,322
Why?

33
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,450
Why me?

34
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,579
I didn't do anything.

35
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,125
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

36
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,961
Why?

37
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,046
Why?

38
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,685
5 YEARS LATER

39
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,311
Today's item is

40
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,607
a very valuable piece
that isn't easy to find in Korea.

41
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,485
I believe this will be
a good opportunity for you.

42
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,780
The opening price is 400 million won,
and the bid increment is 10 million.

43
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,782
Anyone for 400 million won?

44
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,492
There. What about 410 million?

45
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,452
We have 420 million. 430 million.

46
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,788
440 million, 450 million, 460 million.

47
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,291
We have 470 million. There's 480 million.

48
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,293
There's 490 million.
We now have 500 million.

49
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,003
Now the increment is 20 million.

50
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,630
540 million. 560 million. 580 million.

51
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,550
We have 600 million.
Now the increment is 30 million.

52
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,051
We have 630 million. 650 million.

53
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,095
It's 680 million.

54
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,013
We have 700 million.

55
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,390
Starting again from 730 million.

56
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,351
We have 750 million. 760 million.

57
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,145
We have 780 million.

58
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,606
All right. We have 800 million now.

59
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,775
Will you be bidding 830 million?

60
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,154
It's 830 million. We're waiting
for a bid through the phone.

61
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,489
The highest bid is 800 million now.

62
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,868
It's 830 million. Are you giving up?

63
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,454
The highest bid is 800 million.

64
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,748
It's 800 million.

65
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,002
Sold to the client with paddle number 48
at 800 million.

66
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,086
Congratulations.

67
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,687
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

68
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,714
Oh Ji-hyeok, Incheon Seobu Police Station.

69
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,049
A murder case?

70
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,552
Did you witness it yourself?

71
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,054
I was driving,

72
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,308
and I saw someone throwing
something down the road from a distance.

73
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,351
I thought it was a mannequin at first.

74
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,897
But on second thought,
I realized it was a person.

75
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,774
A person. I'm sure it was a person.

76
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,472
It's already time for the last song.

77
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,016
It's good to hear his voice again.

78
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,783
LEE DAE-CHEOL MADE DELIVERIES UNTIL 3 A.M.

79
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,826
THE POLICE ON THE TRAIL OF MURDER SUSPECT

80
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,995
A FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT
IN HER 20S IS MURDERED

81
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,333
LEE DENIES THE CHARGES

82
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,378
CONTACT DETECTIVE KANG DO-CHANG
AT SEOBU POLICE STATION

83
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,214
LEE DAE-CHEOL SENT TO THE PROSECUTION

84
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,759
CHECK WILDLIFE OBSERVATION CAMERAS
TO SEE WHERE HE WENT

85
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,053
LEE DENIES THE CHARGES
WHILE REENACTING THE CRIME SCENE

86
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,974
THE LOCATION WHERE
YOON JI-SEON'S BODY WAS FOUND

87
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,674
MINISTER OF JUSTICE LEE GYU-JO

88
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,726
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

89
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:06,939
ORDER OF EXECUTION

90
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,775
MINISTER
LEE GYU-JO

91
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,154
LEE DAE-CHEOL

92
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,618
Yes.

93
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,788
-Hey.
-Sir.

94
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,418
I'm glad you're here.
I was going to give you a call.

95
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,629
How did it go?

96
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,256
We've completed the legal procedures
for the execution.

97
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,925
Now we need the VIP
to make the final decision.

98
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,927
It must've been a tough decision to make.

99
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,227
This is 112 Emergency Center.

100
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,147
My friend has been
out of touch for three days.

101
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,232
Do you live with her?

102
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,819
No, but I see her every day.

103
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,113
I think something bad has happened to her.

104
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,074
Are you reporting a missing person?

105
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
Exactly. A missing person's report.

106
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,620
Attention.

107
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,831
This is Lieutenant Oh Ji-hyeok.

108
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,209
He was at the
Seoul Criminal Investigation Unit

109
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,710
before taking a year off.

110
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,213
He's from the Police University.

111
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,883
Darn it, I hate how
the Administration Division works.

112
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,134
I want to swear at them.

113
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,969
What's your problem?

114
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,388
You know how it is.

115
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,516
They should've sent us someone
who can actually help us.

116
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,267
He's been a detective for nine years

117
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,645
with the highest service record
in the investigation unit.

118
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,730
He'll take our team to a higher level.

119
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,691
We need someone
who will actually work in the field,

120
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,820
not someone who will raise our level.

121
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,739
Hey, how could you say that to his face?

122
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,744
-Kwon Jae-hong. Nice to meet you.
-I look forward to working with you.

123
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,914
Gosh, I just feel bad for Dong-uk.

124
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,209
He was so excited
to finally have someone below him.

125
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,128
-I'm fine.
-Don't worry.

126
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,505
He's from the Police University.
He won't be here for long.

127
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,882
-I'm sure he'll leave.
-That's enough.

128
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,969
You know how rough violent crimes can be.

129
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,012
Don't take it personally
and just let it go.

130
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,515
Do-chang.

131
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,684
Give him a tour and show him what's what.

132
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,269
If you…

133
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,649
If you ever get promoted,
I'm going to put him on the desk job.

134
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,484
You know me, right?

135
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,070
Captain, I need to talk to you.

136
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,155
Okay.

137
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,031
Go sit over there.

138
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,626
You know I have a lot on my mind now.

139
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,544
So?

140
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,797
I have a sense that things will get
even more complicated because of him.

141
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,799
What do you want me to do?

142
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,219
If you get promoted,
who else is there to take the desk job?

143
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,722
He always makes spelling mistakes

144
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,141
so his documents are always rejected
by the prosecution.

145
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,895
And he can't even find his way home
whenever he gets drunk.

146
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,731
There's no way we can
put them in charge of our schedule.

147
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,649
But we have Kwon Jae-hong.

148
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,818
He thinks he's the captain.

149
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,696
What if something goes wrong after
he puts everyone on insane schedules?

150
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,281
I'll have to take responsibility.

151
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,617
Still, you can't put him on the job.
You saw what happened.

152
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,784
They won't listen to him.

153
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,830
And he's a lieutenant. I can't partner up
with someone who outranks me.

154
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,873
He won't listen to me.

155
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,417
I don't know.
You will figure it out somehow.

156
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,045
As they say, he won't be here for long.

157
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,006
So let him stay in the office
and write some reports.

158
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,925
Why are you being like this?

159
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,218
Why is that?

160
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,428
Did he betray you or something?

161
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,473
I have a feeling he will.

162
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,187
They'll be announcing the results
of my promotion examination soon.

163
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,356
I can't ruin anything at the last minute.

164
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,441
You know what I mean, Captain.

165
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,568
Please.

166
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,362
I don't know. Your phone is ringing.

167
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,988
-Just think about it.
-Answer the phone.

168
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

169
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,828
Stay still.

170
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,461
It's for your partner.

171
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,380
You should take it.

172
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,268
Oh Ji-hyeok, Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

173
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,479
A missing person's report? Please hang on.

174
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,024
Go ahead.

175
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,820
Her name is Lee Eun-hye, 18 years old.

176
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,905
What's the report…

177
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,867
Go ahead.

178
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,160
How did you like our team?

179
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,122
-I like how they are straightforward.
-Wait.

180
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,709
Look.

181
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,003
You know what this is.

182
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,464
-A bald spot.
-You know what causes it, right?

183
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,591
Yes.

184
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,385
So you can tell
how I must be feeling now, right?

185
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,178
I guess so.

186
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,598
An elite lieutenant like you
would know better than I do,

187
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,474
but here's the deal
with missing persons cases.

188
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,853
Let's say you worked your butt off,
but it ends up that it was a runaway.

189
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,440
You'll be told off
for wasting manpower over nothing.

190
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,609
And let's say you handled it as a runaway,

191
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,360
but a dead body is found.

192
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,864
They'll make a big fuss
saying there was a problem

193
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,742
in the preliminary investigation
and that's why the victim was killed.

194
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,535
It will be a three-ring circus.

195
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:16,498
What if such misfortune comes
on top of what I'm going through already?

196
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,127
I will end up dead.

197
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,504
It will be the death of me.

198
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,758
You get it, right?

199
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,760
You get in there and tell them

200
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,262
that you're new here
and you can't work on this case.

201
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
That's all you need to do. Okay?

202
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,100
-Understand?
-Okay.

203
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,310
All right.

204
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,654
Hello, Lieutenant Yoon Sang-mi.

205
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,115
You must be busy.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

206
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,116
We need to meet.

207
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,910
Me? Why?

208
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,204
Do you want me to
make a scene at the station?

209
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,915
Or do you want to talk quietly in private?

210
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,291
Where are you?

211
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,127
Okay. All right.

212
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,590
Good luck with that.

213
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,593
Just remember that you and I
are like a married couple from now on.

214
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,222
Go get them.

215
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,475
CONTROL ROOM

216
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,192
I can't stand this anymore.

217
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,236
That darned idiot.

218
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,996
Should I not have called
the Criminal Division?

219
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,541
It might be a runaway case.

220
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,084
Was I being too hasty?

221
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,752
What's the phone number of the reporter?

222
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,962
Hold on.

223
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,484
Hey, you surprised me.

224
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,570
-You're here.
-You've become so pretty.

225
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,530
It's unbelievable.

226
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,533
You look so amazing
that I almost didn't recognize you.

227
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,412
When I arrived,
I thought an actress was sitting here.

228
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,623
I was like,
"Are they shooting a movie here?"

229
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,626
Do you talk to female officers
like that all the time?

230
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,005
Not all of them. It's just that
we have a special bond.

231
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:34,386
Earlier this year, you had a gathering
with your college alumni at a wine bar.

232
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,807
And Mr. Yoon Dong-pil, the manager
of a law firm, took care of the bill.

233
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,226
It was 1,275,000 won in total.

234
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,229
It was just between us alumni.

235
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,357
Later on, Mr. Yoon's law firm
got three cases

236
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,236
which you were in charge of.

237
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,531
-Oh, I didn't know.
-And you went on an overnight trip

238
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,700
to Baengnyeong Island

239
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,994
and stayed in a hotel
with your colleagues.

240
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,454
The reservation was under the name

241
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,124
of the president of Incheon Fisheries
Cooperative Association.

242
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,918
I didn't get anything from him.

243
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,878
Check my bank book.
They are all overdrawn.

244
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,423
-Do you admit to the charges?
-Hey, what charges?

245
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,553
I handed over the cases to the manager

246
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,807
because the suspect said
he couldn't afford a lawyer.

247
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,017
So the firm took the case
at a giveaway price.

248
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,019
And I went to the hotel with my team

249
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,814
during the Lunar New Year holiday
for an undercover operation.

250
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,902
I was afraid we would run out of budget,
so we borrowed some empty rooms.

251
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,570
What's the big deal?

252
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,322
Have you recently

253
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,950
bought your colleagues drinks
with your own money?

254
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,618
What? What did you say?

255
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:44,248
Having someone else pay
for your bill counts as bribery too.

256
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,292
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

257
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,057
Can I order a drink?

258
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,434
-Sure.
-Beer?

259
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,728
You'll have to pay for it.

260
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,442
So your friend who went missing
is Lee Eun-hye?

261
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,154
-Yes.
-Can I see her picture?

262
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,907
Do you not have a picture together?

263
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,876
The girl in the dress with yellow stripes.

264
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,377
That's Eun-hye.

265
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,464
Give me that.

266
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,135
-Give it back to me.
-What else?

267
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,095
I'll kill you if you see other pictures.

268
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,346
Give me that.

269
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,978
Where did she buy this yellow dress?

270
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,315
Where does Eun-hye do her shopping?

271
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,568
I already told them everything
when I reported her missing.

272
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,653
If you keep bothering me,
I'll just go home.

273
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,657
Do you want to go somewhere else

274
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,075
where we can talk in private?

275
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,172
-Are you sure you're a cop?
-What do you have to lose?

276
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,132
You're not going to get caught.

277
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,180
Can you postpone the investigation?

278
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,890
I'm not denying anything.

279
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,892
I just want you to take some time.

280
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,810
That's the least you can do for me.

281
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,064
We were quite close, right?

282
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,192
Sure. We had some chemistry between us.

283
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,319
If I put off the investigation,

284
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,238
it'll show that we're close.

285
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,075
The higher-ups would want
an even more thorough investigation.

286
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,162
Once everything is over,

287
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,874
why don't we have some soju and gopchang
at the bar we used to frequent?

288
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,292
I'll see you around then.

289
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,092
That darn wench. Gosh.

290
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,469
Since when did she…

291
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,429
JEONGHAN DAILY

292
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,098
I'm in front of your office.

293
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,641
What are you doing there? Come on in.

294
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,978
-Can't we meet outside?
-Why?

295
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,605
No reason. I just don't want to go in.

296
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,816
Come in. I have something to show you.

297
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,901
Okay.

298
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,645
-Hurry.
-Mr. Park.

299
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,272
My gosh.

300
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
Mr. Jang, did you check it?

301
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,609
-I did.
-What about you?

302
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,194
-I sent it.
-All right.

303
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,779
Thank you.

304
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,949
Hello? You can't stab the prosecutors
in the back like this.

305
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,827
They won't give us any stories.

306
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,997
We're about to be left out as it is

307
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,291
because of
the chief prosecutor's imprisonment.

308
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,375
Just let it go.

309
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,252
-Mr. Yoo.
-You're here.

310
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,629
What do you mean you'll take care of it?

311
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,215
I'm saying this because it might harm us.

312
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,925
-Let's go to the meeting room.
-Okay.

313
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,220
Don't be greedy.

314
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,433
Just know your place and do your job.

315
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,769
Don't you dare act up.

316
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,480
You know Im Jong-pil who used to
be a reporter, right?

317
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,026
He recently moved to a cable TV network
so it's not looking good around here.

318
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,778
I hope you understand.

319
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,905
Then why did you call me in here?

320
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,950
And why should we be in here alone?

321
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,578
People would think you have my back.

322
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,747
But I do have your back.

323
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,583
Is that what you really think?

324
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,086
Take a look at this.

325
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,921
Answer me. Do you?

326
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,799
Ms. Jin Seo-gyeong, this is about work.

327
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,509
Whatever.

328
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,182
What do you think you're doing?
Put it down.

329
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,934
Don't be ridiculous.

330
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,144
Don't tell me what to do.

331
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,522
Come on if you want a fight.

332
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,316
What's the matter? Are you afraid

333
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,444
because Dae-cheol only killed two people
and I snuffed eleven?

334
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,154
Come on, you idiots.

335
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,282
You'll be number 12,
and you'll be number 13.

336
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,118
You'll be number 14, 15, and 16.

337
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,702
Remember your numbers.

338
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,538
I'll cut your throats one by one.

339
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,583
I'll draw your blood
and cut you into little pieces.

340
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,001
You jerk!

341
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,465
You can't put me down.

342
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,761
Just kill me here and now, you bastards.

343
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,059
You know him.

344
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,646
He's Cho Byeong-gil who was put in jail
for killing 11 people 7 years ago.

345
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,731
The Minister of Justice
signed the order of execution

346
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,359
for 12 death row inmates
including Cho Byeong-gil this morning.

347
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,320
They're awaiting
the President's final approval.

348
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,781
Does the current administration
want to perform executions?

349
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,659
It's still off the record.

350
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,870
I want us to get a head start
before anyone reports it.

351
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,123
I want you to interview
the victims' families.

352
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,294
Why me?

353
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,338
This isn't something
for a local newspaper.

354
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,841
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

355
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,093
I'm already on the blacklist,

356
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,679
so you think it's okay for me
to be blamed again.

357
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,557
If that's the case, I'm in.

358
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,560
Do the interview by the end of today
and have the article ready by tomorrow.

359
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,605
I'm doing this because
I appreciate your skills as a reporter.

360
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,690
So don't get the wrong idea.

361
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,013
Her father is Lee Dae-cheol?

362
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,806
Okay.

363
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,061
All right. Thank you, sir.

364
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,145
Bye.

365
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,196
Hey, I'm sleepy.
Can I take a nap before we do it?

366
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,575
I paid for two days.

367
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,036
Make yourself at home here for two days.

368
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,082
I can't believe this.
You really must be loaded.

369
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,292
Did Eun-hye

370
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,795
ever talk about her dad?

371
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,880
We never talk about the old farts.

372
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,634
You just barely know her, right?

373
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,262
You weren't close enough with her
to report her missing.

374
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,055
You never went shopping with her.

375
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,060
You didn't even care if Eun-hye
was wearing a dress or shirt.

376
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,272
I'm leaving. I hate talking
about complicated things.

377
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,564
A month.

378
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,903
You can stay here for a month if you want.

379
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,031
I'll even pay for breakfast here.
Or you can order room service.

380
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,909
What is it that you want?

381
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,453
Where's Eun-hye?

382
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,539
I wouldn't have reported her missing
if I knew.

383
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,708
If you don't know, find out.
You have two days.

384
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,794
It's entirely up to you
how long you can stay for after that.

385
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,841
The Chinese restaurant
on the 12th floor is really good.

386
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,969
They don't do deliveries though.

387
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,810
Damn it.

388
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,229
I'm going to be bald at this rate.

389
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,816
That's because you have low testosterone.

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,193
What? What nonsense is that?

391
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
It's not nonsense.
That's what a doctor said.

392
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,699
Are you saying I lack testosterones?

393
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,992
I'm a homicide detective.

394
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,785
And I'm still young.

395
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,455
It's just stress. It's a temporary thing.

396
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,081
That's a relief then.

397
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,708
Relief my ass.

398
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,962
I'm losing hair because of stress.
How is it a relief?

399
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,173
-Then it's a misfortune.
-Hey.

400
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,674
What are you playing at?

401
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,594
Are you trying to put me down

402
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,721
so you can get the upper hand?

403
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,016
Hey.

404
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,268
Who am I talking to? Hey!

405
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,568
NOVEMBER 17 2015
CRIME SCENE REENACTMENT

406
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,736
I didn't do it.

407
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,279
I was driving,

408
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,282
and I saw someone throwing
something down the road from a distance.

409
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,118
I thought it was a mannequin at first.

410
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,205
But on second thought,
I realized it was a person.

411
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,664
-Put it in there.
-A person.

412
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,042
I'm sure it was a person.

413
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,713
PERSONAL INFORMATION REPORT

414
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,965
LEE DAE-CHEOL

415
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,842
WIFE YOON JI-SUK, DIVORCED
DAUGHTER LEE EUN-HYE

416
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,012
The girl in the dress with yellow stripes.
That's Eun-hye.

417
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:08,311
You and I won't be
working together for long.

418
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,482
So let's not get on each other's nerves.

419
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,860
Let's just keep things quiet
and end it on good terms.

420
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,947
And let's not put salt
over each other's wounds.

421
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,824
Okay.

422
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,368
Darn it. My entire life,

423
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,746
no one's ever told me
that I lack testosterone.

424
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,624
It's a problem that I have too much of it.

425
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,792
Why would I lack it?

426
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,169
MALE MENOPAUSE
CAUSED BY LACK OF TESTOSTERONE

427
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,549
HAIR LOSS, FATIGUE,
DEPRESSION, AND MOOD SWINGS

428
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,509
My goodness.

429
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,014
Kang Do-chang,
Incheon Seobu Police Station.

430
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,433
What?

431
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,017
You witnessed a murder?

432
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,228
Where is it?

433
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,233
A false report?

434
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,277
I got the same call this morning.

435
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,405
Was it the same guy?

436
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,364
Yes.

437
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,283
But he reported a different location then.

438
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,910
So it's a prank call.

439
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,036
We don't have to go then.

440
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,707
-It's not a prank.
-Then what?

441
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,127
The earlier report mentioned the location

442
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,880
where Lee Dae-cheol killed the girl
and dumped her body five years ago.

443
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,134
-Lee Dae-cheol?
-And the location

444
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,219
where he killed Detective Jang
and dumped his body.

445
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,305
That's where we're headed now.

446
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,725
What kind of a lunatic would do that?

447
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,686
And the person reported missing
this morning was Lee Eun-hye.

448
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,482
-Lee Eun-hye?
-Lee Dae-cheol's daughter.

449
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,029
The day he was sentenced to death,

450
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,073
I was glad to hear
that they decided to do what's right.

451
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,284
But then…

452
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,413
It's been five years,
but he's still alive.

453
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,957
Can you believe that?

454
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,085
Why did they sentence him
to death in the first place?

455
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,879
He will never repent his sins

456
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,048
until the last moment of his life.

457
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,551
What's the use
of killing a scumbag like him?

458
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,347
It's those who have passed
who suffer the most.

459
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,937
Do you know how he killed my sister?

460
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,565
He hung her upside down.

461
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,653
When their eyes met, he asked her
why she was looking at him funny.

462
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,863
And her eyeballs were…

463
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:30,119
She still wanted to live,
so she begged for her life.

464
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,163
Then her tongue…

465
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,624
Her tongue…

466
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,884
I see her in my dream every night.

467
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,679
With her eyes pulled out

468
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,640
and her tongue cut off,

469
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,559
she says it hurts.

470
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,853
That she's in so much pain.

471
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,880
NOVEMBER 11 2015, 11 P.M.

472
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,923
All right. We have to hurry.

473
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,800
Please move over.

474
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,343
-Hurry.
-This way.

475
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,971
-Go that way.
-Hurry.

476
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,307
Search thoroughly!

477
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,641
Come over here.

478
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,560
-Slow down.
-Move over.

479
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,520
Is there anything?

480
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,855
Over here.

481
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,024
-To the left. Hurry.
-Okay.

482
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,817
-Come here.
-Go.

483
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,153
We did our job. Let's go.

484
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,032
Okay. I'll stay here
until we find the body.

485
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,158
Hey!

486
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,660
Those bastards
at the criminal investigation unit.

487
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,703
Hurry up and find it.

488
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,955
They always want to jump on the bandwagon.

489
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,123
-Damn.
-Keep searching.

490
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:10,428
Once the body is found,
we will put your name on the report.

491
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,889
So just go home.

492
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,101
-Over there.
-What's there?

493
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,394
Go that way.

494
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,812
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

495
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,607
Step backward. Keep your distance.

496
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,900
There it is.

497
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,527
Stand back. Don't touch it.

498
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,367
My goodness.

499
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,746
How am I supposed to interpret this?

500
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,207
I don't know.

501
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,501
There must be a meaning behind this.

502
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,211
So what is it?

503
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,006
it's as if he's giving us a puzzle.

504
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,425
"How are you going to solve it?"

505
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,470
So you don't know either.

506
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,765
That's right. For now.

507
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,267
Give it to me straight from now on.
Stop talking in riddles.

508
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,688
I'm losing my hair already.

509
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,773
Why do you have to talk like that?

510
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,131
You shouldn't take
a case like this too seriously.

511
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,800
You need to keep calm
in situations like these.

512
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,677
What I mean is…

513
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,305
That jerk. That stupid idiot!

514
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,808
What the hell does he want?

515
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,310
He's giving me such a headache.

516
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,025
I saw some wildlife
observation cameras there.

517
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,068
I'll ask for the video footage.

518
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,904
Aren't you hungry?

519
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,490
Let's go eat.

520
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,831
The food is good here.
You will like this place.

521
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,755
We are partners, right?

522
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,674
We should be honest with each other
and not hide anything.

523
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,010
That way, we'll work better together.

524
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,553
Yes. I agree.

525
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,930
It's not like we're in the military.

526
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,641
Just drop the honorifics
and talk casually.

527
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,935
You can call me Do-chang.

528
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,313
Actually, you outrank me.

529
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,565
That way, I'll feel
more comfortable around you.

530
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,109
All right. I'll do that.

531
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,196
All right. I think it's done.

532
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,907
They are very generous with meat.

533
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,660
This place is perfect for us
to reinvigorate after doing fieldwork.

534
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,080
-Try this.
-Thank you.

535
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:53,049
I recently made the list
of candidates for promotion,

536
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,510
and the result will be announced soon.

537
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,347
I'm not the kind of guy
who's obsessed with promotion.

538
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,642
But I really need that promotion this time
for personal reasons.

539
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,274
I was in charge of the Lee Dae-cheol case.

540
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,111
If we reopen the case
because of today's reports,

541
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,446
it won't do me any good.

542
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,158
It might affect my promotion negatively.

543
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,828
Do you know what I mean?

544
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,164
I'm not telling you to cover up the case.

545
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,167
I just don't want you to make a big deal

546
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,795
before we can really be sure.
Just keep it quiet for now.

547
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,088
Okay?

548
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,136
-Do-chang.
-It's good you call me that.

549
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,971
It sounds a lot more friendly. Drink.

550
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,313
If you feel uncomfortable
working on this case,

551
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,149
I'll just do it on my own.

552
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,234
So…

553
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,280
Are you asking me to stay out of your way
whatever you do?

554
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,614
Yes.

555
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,201
Since we'll each be doing our own thing,
let's split the bill.

556
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,713
SEOBU POLICE STATION

557
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,715
What is Oh Ji-hyeok's reputation like?

558
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,384
I see.

559
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,261
What about his working style?

560
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,557
Is he obedient to his superiors?

561
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,021
Okay.

562
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,818
So what do you think?

563
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,696
Do you think you can
get along with Ji-hyeok?

564
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,656
His nickname was Nutjob.

565
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,202
Not just a nutjob. A Big Nutjob.

566
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,038
You know how homicide detectives are.

567
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,081
Once he makes up his mind,

568
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,335
he won't let things go before blowing out
at least three people's brains.

569
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,920
I like that. He sounds passionate.

570
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,630
He's a real homicide detective.

571
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,049
He once changed his partners
twice in a year.

572
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,801
One was hospitalized because of an injury
and quit his job,

573
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,720
and the other was disciplined

574
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,097
and became a traffic officer
in a suburban area.

575
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,641
Which should I pick?

576
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,853
My shoulders are busted these days
so I can't raise my arm.

577
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,731
I don't think I can be a traffic officer.

578
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,069
I think I'd be better off
being hospitalized.

579
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,780
He took a year off.
I'm sure he's a new person now.

580
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,574
He's been saving his energy
to cause a bigger problem.

581
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,994
Hey, how did it go?

582
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,871
Did you meet the victim?

583
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,499
I'm almost done being a sergeant,

584
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,001
but I just stepped on a land mine.

585
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,920
Geez.

586
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,839
-It's not going to be easy.
-What's wrong?

587
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,008
He met the suspect by chance
and drank with him.

588
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,760
He didn't even know who he was.

589
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,345
But they drank together.

590
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,138
There must be security cameras at the bar.

591
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,975
They do but they were just for show.
They don't work.

592
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,559
It's been broken for over two months.

593
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,229
What about the owner?
Doesn't he remember anything?

594
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,523
The owner is an alcoholic.

595
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,025
He couldn't even remember
what I asked him a minute ago.

596
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,152
I have a hunch.

597
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,697
What? A hunch?

598
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,781
Are you sure?

599
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,534
Yes. I have a strong hunch
that we will waste a couple of months,

600
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,869
only for the case to remain unsolved.

601
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,829
Are you kidding me?

602
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,337
They can't take care of this case.

603
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,548
I'll do it.

604
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,342
I mean, I will work on it with Ji-hyeok.

605
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,845
Right. Sure.

606
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,571
Who are you?

607
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,115
-Pardon?
-Who are you?

608
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,577
I'm new here.

609
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,121
My name is Oh Ji-hyeok.
I'm with the Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

610
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,833
I see.

611
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,544
I'm Nam Guk-hyeon, Captain
of the Violent Crimes Unit Team 1.

612
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,795
I see.

613
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,924
About your watch.

614
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,223
You're a detective.
You shouldn't wear a fake watch.

615
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,939
Is this fake?

616
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,691
I just bought it because I liked it.

617
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,612
That watch is way out of your league.

618
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,824
It might cause a misunderstanding.
Just throw it away.

619
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,092
It's one of the 80 limited edition watches

620
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,677
designed by Jaeger June,
a Swiss watchmaker.

621
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,971
Since there are only two in Korea,

622
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,682
it's the rarest of all rarities.

623
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,566
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

624
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,952
I guess we're going to be quite busy.

625
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,703
It's an assault case,

626
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,872
but the victim is seriously wounded.

627
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,209
He broke seven ribs and an arm.

628
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,627
He also has head trauma.

629
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,546
There's no word yet
if he has internal injuries.

630
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,800
The doctor says
he might even end up crippled.

631
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,968
That's serious.

632
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,303
The problem is
there's no security footage,

633
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,556
and the witness has
a mental and physical disorder.

634
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,765
It's going to be difficult.

635
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,269
We should meet the victim
and visit the crime scene

636
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,271
Since we lack evidence,

637
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,940
we'll need to stake out the place
for over a week.

638
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,236
We better strike while the iron is hot.

639
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,238
Let's start a stakeout tonight.

640
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,739
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

641
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,824
What's the victim's name?

642
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,576
The victim's name? What?

643
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,077
-Park Do-cheol.
-Park Do-cheol.

644
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,287
Age?

645
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,831
He was born in 1997, so…

646
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,499
-He's 23.
-23 years old.

647
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,877
We need to stop by the hospital.
We can ask there.

648
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,879
Hang on. I need to make a call.

649
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,297
A call? Why? Who are you calling?

650
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,674
Do you know who he's calling?

651
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,679
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

652
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,640
Park Do-cheol, born in 1997.

653
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,018
His address is Bangseok-dong,
Namdong-gu, Incheon.

654
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,061
-Is that right?
-Yes.

655
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,273
He took insurances
from five different companies last month,

656
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,859
-totaling to over 150 million won.
-What?

657
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,695
It must be an insurance fraud.

658
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,071
How did you find it out?

659
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,241
Isn't this basic stuff?

660
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,997
There's been a lot of similar crimes
in Seoul.

661
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,750
The methods seemed similar,
so I did some digging.

662
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:47,046
He says it's basic stuff, you fools.

663
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,549
Stop wasting time playing billiards
and study.

664
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,010
You need to study cases from other cities.

665
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,261
-Okay.
-All right.

666
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,098
We still need to meet the victim though.

667
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,350
It might be a coincidence.

668
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,270
It's better to let the insurance company
investigate the case.

669
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,814
They have a lot of experts
who are more experienced than us.

670
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,777
If a problem comes up,
they will consult us about the case.

671
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,448
You're so lucky
to have him as your partner.

672
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,742
Thanks to him,
you'll get a good performance review…

673
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,789
What are you waiting for?
Do some research.

674
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,251
Frauds like him are still at large
because of stupid cops like you.

675
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,794
You didn't know that either.

676
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,712
-How dare you…
-We're sorry.

677
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,257
It's because we're so stupid.

678
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,424
We are dumb.

679
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,101
Is your late husband

680
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:46,355
Detective Jang Jin-su who was
murdered by Lee Dae-cheol five years ago?

681
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,858
Yes.

682
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,819
You must still be in a lot of pain.

683
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,656
I'm sorry for bringing this up again.

684
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,408
Then why…

685
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,202
Why do you want to write an article
about that?

686
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,998
-Pardon?
-You know I'm suffering.

687
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,792
When you know that the article
will be throwing salt on my wound,

688
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,838
why would you write such an article?

689
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,092
I just don't understand
what it is that you're trying to do.

690
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:20,014
I won't force you to have this interview.
You're welcome to refuse it.

691
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,768
GUK-HYEON
I'M HERE. FINISH IT OFF AND COME OUT.

692
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,730
I should get going.

693
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,858
-Yun-hui.
-Yes.

694
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,696
I'm leaving. Close the shop on time.

695
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,656
-Yes, ma'am.
-Bye.

696
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,804
Captain Nam Guk-hyeon?

697
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,933
We've been evaluated

698
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,269
as the least friendly station
in all of Incheon.

699
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,814
Make sure to be kind
when answering complaint calls.

700
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,524
Especially you, Ji Man-gu.

701
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,443
Why did you talk down
to a civil petitioner?

702
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,612
When did I ever talk down to them?

703
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,613
I mean, sir.

704
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,199
Use honorifics even to young citizens.

705
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,993
And make sure to be polite
even when you talk to an ex-con, okay?

706
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,536
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

707
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,207
And there will be a regular inspection
for internal security.

708
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,043
Another inspection?
They do that all the time.

709
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,045
Catch the convenience store thief.

710
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,048
If another store gets robbed,
they'll be on our asses.

711
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,135
-And lastly…
-You said you'd make it quick.

712
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,554
We have an order from the chief himself.

713
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:47,101
I guess we're the only team
who gets orders from the chief.

714
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,146
Fine. Let's call it a day.

715
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,650
Now that Detective Oh joined us,
let's go out for a team dinner.

716
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,987
What for? It's not like he's a big deal.

717
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,157
Still, we have someone new.
We should drink together.

718
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,867
Forget it. You guys go ahead and drink.

719
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,579
My body is nothing like it used to be.

720
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,581
I'll go home and get some rest.

721
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,668
Do-chang, can you take a look at this?

722
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,088
Why would you need me?
Just do whatever you want.

723
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,339
Lee Eun-hye is in the footage.

724
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,196
Why? What's the matter?

725
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,866
It's a case.

726
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,120
A shitty, twisted case.

727
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,172
TAXI

728
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:23,989
What is this?

729
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,658
The girl who just walked into the reeds

730
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,661
is Lee Eun-hye, who was reported
missing this morning.

731
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,996
Lee Eun-hye?

732
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,289
She's Lee Dae-cheol's daughter.

733
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,957
Lee Dae-cheol?

734
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,169
That Lee Dae-cheol you arrested
five years ago?

735
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,344
Detective Kang, this man says
he has something to report.

736
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,929
We're a little busy now.

737
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,139
Detective Choi, are you sleeping?

738
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,475
-What?
-We have a report.

739
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,936
Take care of it for us.
We're busy with something else.

740
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,396
Okay. This way, please.

741
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,906
Please have a seat here.

742
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,324
Thank you.

743
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,495
What is this about?

744
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,039
What on earth happened in the reeds?

745
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,250
I kidnapped a girl and killed her.

746
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,671
-Are you saying you committed murder?
-Yes.

747
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,464
-You killed a girl?
-Yes.

748
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,676
She was in her late teens.

749
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,721
I heard her name was Lee Eun-hye.

750
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,682
Lee Eun-hye? Hang on.

751
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,519
What's the victim's name?

752
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,145
The name of the victim…

753
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,356
What's your name?

754
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,067
Where did you kill her?

755
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,946
You kidnapped and killed Lee Eun-hye?

756
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,408
Yes. I think so.

757
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,035
Say it clearly. Did you kill her or not?

758
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,829
Did you really kill her?

759
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,766
Is this you?

760
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,352
Yes.

761
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,396
-Why did you kill her?
-I don't know.

762
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,482
I was out of my mind, so I don't remember.

763
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,735
Think carefully about it.

764
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,196
What did you do
to Lee Eun-hye in the reeds?

765
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,364
What I'm saying is

766
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,284
I don't even know why I killed her.

767
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,911
And I'm not sure if I really killed her.

768
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,164
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

769
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,249
Shouldn't we test him for drugs?

770
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,876
-Damn it.
-How dare you…

771
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,461
I don't do stuff like that.

772
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,463
I'm sober.

773
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,632
Then why don't you remember
what you did today?

774
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,096
I remember burying her.

775
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,807
Where? In the field of reeds?

776
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,935
She was an idiot.

777
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,814
If she just stayed still, I wouldn't
have done anything. That idiot…

778
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,359
It's all that bitch's fault.

779
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,778
She seduced me.

780
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,072
She was the one who took me there.

781
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,450
I didn't even know she was a minor.
I'm serious.

782
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,203
She looked like she was well in her 20s.

783
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,664
That's not important now.

784
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:23,085
So are you sure you killed
Lee Eun-hye and buried her?

785
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,544
Damn it!

786
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,172
I already told you, didn't I?

787
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,549
I killed her and buried her.

788
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,385
You're being annoying.

789
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,511
You son of a bitch…

790
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,096
Where do you live?

791
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,432
You came here because you live nearby.

792
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,852
You wouldn't have come all this way
just to turn yourself in.

793
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,155
Why? Can't you be bothered?

794
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,074
Should I go somewhere else?

795
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,243
Rape.

796
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,036
Murder.

797
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,163
Disposal of a dead body.

798
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,874
You should bite on a case
like this right away.

799
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,004
I was driving,

800
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,258
and I saw someone throwing
something down the road from a distance.

801
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,260
I thought it was a mannequin at first.

802
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,555
But on second thought,
I realized it was a person.

803
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,182
A person. I'm sure it was a person.

804
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,894
It's him. Can't you tell?

805
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,855
Right? Do you agree?

806
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,733
I think it sounds like someone else.

807
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,319
He changed his tone of voice on purpose
to sound like someone else.

808
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,196
Let's say you're right.

809
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,823
What difference does it make?

810
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,827
He planned the whole thing
and is trying to mess with us.

811
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,456
He wants to remind us
of Lee Dae-cheol's case.

812
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,666
So why? Why would he do that?

813
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,127
How would I know? Damn it!

814
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:55,051
Let's go check out the crime scene
that he told us about.

815
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,136
Then we can talk.

816
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,263
We won't be able to leave before dawn

817
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,766
so go get some shut eye.

818
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,772
Sim Dong-uk, Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

819
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,734
Something's wrong with Park Gun-ho.
I think he's having a seizure.

820
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,320
Okay. Park Gun-ho!

821
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,531
Park Gun-ho!

822
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,116
Park Gun-ho, wake up!

823
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:27,918
Isn't he just fine?

824
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,588
He seemed to be getting worse so I was
going to move him to the infirmary,

825
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,215
but he suddenly got better.

826
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,092
Hey, do you have an illness?

827
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,677
No.

828
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,764
-I don't have any illness.
-Then what was it?

829
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,557
Were you faking it?

830
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,726
Why would I fake it?

831
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,770
I just lost it for a moment.

832
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,731
It can happen, you know?

833
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,236
An acquaintance of mine has seizures
regularly when he doesn't have an illness.

834
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,489
He said it was because of stress.
I guess he was right.

835
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,617
I heard this kind of thing happens
when the going gets too tough.

836
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,370
It really did happen.

837
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:12,087
I could tell how much he was suffering
because of a false accusation.

838
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,297
It's so unfair.

839
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,896
Are you really an evangelist?

840
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,316
The world is coming to an end.

841
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,360
And you used to be a prison officer.

842
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,947
A former prison officer and an evangelist.

843
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,909
Are you sure you killed someone?

844
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,915
The prison he worked at
is where Lee Dae-cheol is.

845
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,920
You must know Lee Dae-cheol.

846
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,630
Lee Dae-cheol?

847
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,382
He was in the prison you worked at.

848
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,468
He was a death row inmate,
and you were a prison officer.

849
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,974
Oh, inmate 1173. I know him.

850
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,728
When a prison officer
becomes intimate with an inmate,

851
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,479
they become friends, right?

852
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,690
Did he ask you to do this?

853
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,234
Are you doing this because of him?

854
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,363
Why would I become friends
with a murderer like him?

855
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,699
He's not even human.

856
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,201
Do you know how despicable he is?

857
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,205
Even a brute like him
cares about his own daughter.

858
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,999
Isn't it ironic?

859
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,960
He killed a girl
who was about his daughter's age,

860
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,421
but why would he worry about his daughter?

861
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,967
A scumbag like him deserves pain.

862
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,763
The same pain that the parents
of the girl he murdered

863
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,641
would feel.

864
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,337
Where is it?

865
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,673
Is it that way?

866
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,143
Lee Eun-hye has a criminal record.

867
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,146
A criminal record?

868
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,663
Everything looks the same here,
so I'm confused.

869
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,041
Think harder.

870
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,553
Released with a warning for two thefts,

871
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,263
dining and dashing,

872
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,348
and working at a karaoke bar as a minor…

873
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,142
Hey, that's enough.

874
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,145
Which station was in charge?

875
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,856
Namdong Station for dining and dashing,

876
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,691
and Yeonsu Station was
in charge of the rest.

877
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,901
Detective Park Seong-gyu was in charge.

878
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,695
Park Seong-gyu?

879
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,031
Oh, right. Park Seong-gyu.

880
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,246
-The phone is turned off…
-Darn it.

881
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,791
Why is his phone off at this hour?

882
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,295
Where did they go?

883
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,006
-Be careful.
-Okay.

884
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,801
There they are.

885
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,264
Hey.

886
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,558
Did you find it?

887
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,311
He says he was so out of it then

888
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,773
so he can't recall where he buried her.

889
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,986
I really don't remember.

890
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,114
Wipe that grin off your face, you…

891
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,491
-Hey.
-Stop it.

892
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,951
Hey.

893
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,828
Are you messing with us?

894
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,372
Do you think the police
are a joke, you jerk?

895
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,294
-Again? He's grinning again.
-Hey.

896
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,296
-Stop smiling!
-Calm down.

897
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,423
-Calm down.
-Look at him. He's still smiling.

898
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,925
-Hey.
-You bastard.

899
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,635
We checked the scene so it's fine.

900
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,429
-Don't be upset.
-Just look at him.

901
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,556
-All right.
-Hey! You idiot!

902
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,891
Calm down.

903
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,480
You were empty-handed in the footage.

904
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,608
Did you dig a hole with your bare hands
to bury her?

905
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,277
I don't know.

906
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,865
I was out of it
so I don't remember how I did it.

907
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,827
And the footage shows that you left alone.

908
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,831
You seemed too calm to be out of it.

909
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,295
I must have picked the wrong station.

910
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,174
They have a pretty smart detective here.

911
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,766
So he killed Lee Dae-cheol's daughter
and buried her body in the place

912
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,269
where Lee Dae-cheol buried his bodies?

913
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,688
How is this a coincidence?

914
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,817
That's why I'm telling you
he has an ulterior motive.

915
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,570
There must be a reason
why he chose the station I'm in.

916
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,613
So what are you going to do?

917
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,408
Think about what he said to us so far.

918
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,952
Does he look sane to you?
He's out of his mind.

919
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,745
Darn it.

920
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,540
We have to find the body
in a situation like this.

921
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,875
We have no choice.

922
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,710
Jae-hong, get started.

923
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,379
Yes, sir. Let's go.

924
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,674
Ji-ung, you call for backup
and come back with them.

925
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,427
Man-gu and Dong-uk will wait here
with me until backup arrives.

926
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,471
Okay. Let's do that.

927
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,764
Take Park Gun-ho back to the office

928
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,516
and keep interrogating him.

929
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,185
I'm not sure what you'd find out though.

930
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,770
What on earth is going on?

931
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,273
What is up with this case?

932
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,111
SEOBU POLICE STATION

933
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,875
It's too salty.

934
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,752
How did you first meet Lee Eun-hye?

935
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,087
Did you go see her on purpose?

936
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,923
How does it affect your performance rating

937
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,716
when you solve a murder case?

938
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,886
The inmates at the prison
seemed pretty curious to know.

939
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,433
This case is different
since the criminal turned himself in.

940
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,393
I see.

941
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,438
I should've been in hiding longer
before letting you catch me.

942
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,068
If you decided to turn yourself in,

943
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:53,071
you don't have to
complicate things like this.

944
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,115
-Let's keep things easy.
-Are you asking me for a favor?

945
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,826
Yes, I am. Please.

946
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,830
All right then.

947
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,667
Go find Lee Eun-hye's body first.

948
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,419
What?

949
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,838
Don't just sit there
and expect me to spoon-feed you.

950
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,759
Go find the body and the murder weapon.

951
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,678
Collect bloodstains

952
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,013
and compare the DNA samples
before coming back to me.

953
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,807
Then I'll tell you everything.

954
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,809
Do you understand?

955
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,403
Hey.

956
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,364
I have something to ask you.

957
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,283
Are you busy?

958
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,951
You should have a minute to talk.

959
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,631
472 Baekgogae-ro, Namdong-gu, Incheon.

960
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,928
212 Unbangsa-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon.

961
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,725
Do you remember these addresses?

962
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,853
The second address is
where you supposedly buried Lee Eun-hye.

963
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,564
If you drove there, you would remember
entering it in the navigation.

964
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,948
So you read the question I gave you
carefully from the top.

965
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,659
Let me give you a hint as a reward.

966
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,954
"You snakes.

967
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,540
You brood of vipers.

968
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,794
How will you escape
being condemned to hell?"

969
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,507
Matthew 23, verse 33.

970
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,973
-Watch out.
-Be careful.

971
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,060
Yes. We haven't identified the body yet.

972
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,021
But she seems like a teenage girl.

973
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,148
I see. Okay.

974
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,819
Can you send me the address
of the scene if you don't mind?

975
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,781
I need to go there to check something.

976
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,783
Thanks.

977
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,212
You told us to find the body ourselves.

978
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,630
Why is that?

979
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,592
You approached the security camera
with Lee Eun-hye on purpose, right?

980
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,177
To fake an alibi.

981
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,889
Where did you

982
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,433
really kill Lee Eun-hye?

983
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,860
212 Unbangsa-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon.

984
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,327
That jerk turned himself in on purpose.

985
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,664
I think you're right.

986
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,541
And he will keep claiming

987
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:55,336
that he killed Lee Eun-hye in the reeds
and buried her there.

988
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,965
And what if the body found at the beach
turns out to be Lee Eun-hye?

989
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,133
What do you think he'd say?

990
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,552
He'd say that he didn't kill her.

991
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,178
That he was mistaken.

992
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,764
That's it. That's exactly what he's up to.

993
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:16,065
"Lord, I love the house where you live,
the place where your glory dwells.

994
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,901
Do not take away my soul
along with sinners,

995
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,529
and my life with those
who are bloodthirsty."

996
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:26,242
Park Gun-ho targeted
Lee Dae-cheol's daughter from the start.

997
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,704
Why do you think he killed Lee Eun-hye?

998
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,791
Probably because of Lee Dae-cheol.

999
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,168
Exactly.

1000
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,379
Why did he take out his grudge against
Lee Dae-cheol on his innocent daughter?

1001
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,632
What an evil jerk.

1002
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:45,011
"Be strong and courageous.
Do not be afraid

1003
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,596
or terrified because of them.

1004
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,271
For the Lord your God goes with you.

1005
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:59,108
He will never leave you nor forsake you."

1006
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,886
Have you ever killed someone?

1007
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,556
-You're no better than an animal. Die!
-Do you know how it feels?

1008
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,059
Why did you kill her?
Tell me why you did it!

1009
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,394
-This case is completely irrelevant.
-Maybe she's changed.

1010
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,521
I said it's not her!

1011
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:40,066
Damn it! It was me. I killed someone!

1012
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,860
I told you to keep things confidential!

1013
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,695
I have something to say to the reporters!

1014
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,532
That damn murderer is my dad?

1015
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,658
I'll do anything.

1016
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:51,285
Do you know Lee Dae-cheol? He's innocent.

1017
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:54,539
Are you certain that Lee Dae-cheol
is the real culprit of that case?

1018
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,667
I'd like to make a report.
Take a look and decide for yourself.

1019
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:03,714
