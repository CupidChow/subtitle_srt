THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,155
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,184
Hey.

4
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,186
Any news?

5
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,855
He's in surgery, but we don't know yet.

6
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,191
What was Kim Hyeong-bok's state
in the ambulance?

7
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,068
The paramedics must've told you something.

8
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,402
Well…

9
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,362
I don't think he'll make it.

10
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,823
Damn it.

11
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:18,912
Hello?

12
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,122
I'm a little busy right now.

13
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,792
I will call you back when…

14
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,797
Sorry?

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,760
It looks like the thief brought it back.

16
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,513
It's nearly the same amount stolen.

17
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,404
You have three days
to return the ginseng you stole.

18
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,323
If you sold it, buy it and return it.

19
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,075
I'll give you three days. Get going.

20
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,076
Pardon?

21
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,995
It's Kim Hyeong-bok.

22
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,040
He brought it back.

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,709
He's just an ordinary thief.

24
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,045
Let's go back to the hospital.

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
We don't have to go back.

26
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,216
I just got the text.

27
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,300
He's dead.

28
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,267
Our guys didn't do
anything questionable, right?

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,768
No, absolutely nothing.

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,770
He got into an accident
while running away.

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,273
Then it's fine.

32
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,869
Shouldn't we…

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,038
tell Kim Hyeong-bok's family?

34
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,749
Of course, we do.

35
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,626
I will call his mother.

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,752
No.

37
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,880
It's a proper courtesy
to tell her in person.

38
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,215
And also explain to her what happened.

39
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,427
Byun Ji-ung and Ji Man-gu,
you two go ahead.

40
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,138
Why do we have to go?

41
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,348
Then should Do-chang the dirty work?

42
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,226
You should have volunteered
even before I asked you.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,729
I know, but I have a stomach ache.

44
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,147
My shoulder feels stiff.

45
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,190
So you don't want to go?

46
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,818
I'm not saying that I don't want to.

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,030
She reminds me of my mom.

48
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,450
Stop it. Jae-hong, we should go.

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,535
Jae-hong and I will go.

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,995
Hey!

51
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,872
I have to write the incident report.

52
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,625
Don't worry about the report.
I'll take care of it. You go.

53
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,627
Byun Ji-ung and Ji Man-gu.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,421
Do you think a senior officer
is your buddy?

55
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,424
You punks need some discipline.

56
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,052
Follow me, you bastards.

57
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,222
Is he pulling rank on us?

58
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,557
What did you just say, you bastard?

59
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,850
Man-gu, are you staring?

60
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,311
Stop staring and close your damn eyes.

61
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,480
-Why would I?
-Stop.

62
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,940
That's enough.

63
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,901
I have to do it anyway. I can go alone.

64
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,779
I will come with you.

65
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,614
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

66
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,825
Attention!

67
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
I heard you guys got Kim Hyeong-bok.

68
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,790
Yes, but Kim Hyeong-bok is a bit--

69
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,751
In any case,
that means you caught a serial killer.

70
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,088
Chief, Kim Hyeong-bok is…

71
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,548
Let's not complicate the matter.

72
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,468
We caught the guy
the Seoul Criminal Investigation Division

73
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,928
couldn't catch for three months.

74
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,054
Good work.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,015
You finally lived up to your name.

76
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,433
Nice work, everyone.

77
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,644
Especially you, Do-chang.

78
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,397
A person died.

79
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,483
Let's show a little remorse.

80
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,694
As expected, Do-chang.

81
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,780
You've got the best charms!

82
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,700
He never loses his humanity.

83
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,746
Dead or alive,

84
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,749
all detectives need to do
is catch the culprit.

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,169
You have to catch them to win.
That's all that matters.

86
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,727
I was too impatient.

87
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,231
I should have waited for the guys
to block his escape route.

88
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,858
It's my fault.

89
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,111
We shouldn't have pursued him.

90
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,574
It could have been better if we let
the investigation division handle it.

91
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,785
We were getting too competitive.

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
Chief,

93
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,628
I'm concerned about
the investigation division.

94
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,048
Shouldn't we let them know?

95
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,382
We will.

96
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,218
Doesn't matter
how they find out though, right?

97
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,388
Reporter Jung,

98
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,974
can you gather all police reporters today?

99
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,101
Take a guess.

100
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,813
Why would the chief call you in person?

101
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,359
Would I have called the reporters
for catching a petty thief?

102
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,112
What is it?

103
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,199
-Is my son--
-Well…

104
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,327
Ma'am, actually…

105
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,039
Kim Hyeong-bok passed away
from a car accident.

106
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,832
What?

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,000
Wait a minute.

108
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,837
What happened to Hyeong-bok?

109
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,007
Actually, we were…

110
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,220
While running away from the police,
he attempted to jaywalk

111
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,222
and was hit by a car.

112
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,641
He was taken to the hospital
but died during surgery.

113
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,063
If there is any doubt about
the cause of death or negligence,

114
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:41,400
we will send you a detailed report
about the incident at a later date.

115
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,027
Enough.

116
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,115
Where is he?

117
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,785
Where is my son right now?

118
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,088
I want all of you to leave.

119
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,760
I have something to tell my son.

120
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,805
Leave.

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,683
I said, get out.

122
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,938
You already caught him as the killer.

123
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,858
Your job is done.

124
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,237
Stop tormenting him and leave. Please.

125
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,624
Hyeong-bok.

126
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,043
You've…

127
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,505
suffered so much

128
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,425
because of your worthless mother.

129
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,429
In your next life,

130
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,266
I hope you meet good parents

131
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,562
and live a happy life.

132
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,485
And never commit crimes.

133
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,737
Okay?

134
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,574
You.

135
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,077
Did you have to talk to her like that?

136
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,747
He died because of us.
Do you not feel guilty?

137
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,207
You shouldn't feel guilty.

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,335
You let yourself feel that way.

139
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,087
Kim Hyeong-bok was just a thief.
He is not the killer.

140
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,714
He didn't deserve to die like that.

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,509
You didn't cause the situation.

142
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,011
Why do you keep blaming yourself?

143
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,807
If I had paid more attention…

144
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,354
Then go back there and tell her.

145
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,147
That you killed him.

146
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:50,196
Stop blaming yourself
for something you didn't do.

147
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,864
That's equal to a cop…

148
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,326
framing an innocent person.

149
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,507
Please accept our apologies.

150
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,634
I'm truly sorry.

151
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,553
There's no need.

152
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,347
He paid for his sins.

153
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,392
I guess he got what he deserved.

154
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,230
Ma'am,

155
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,316
Hyeong-bok is not a killer.

156
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,697
Don't believe the news.

157
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,451
I will make things right.

158
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,580
I don't know.

159
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,541
Do as you want.

160
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,961
It won't change anything for me.

161
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,144
At 2:00 p.m. today,

162
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,023
the suspect of the
White Gown Serial Murder Case,

163
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:11,277
Kim Hyeong-bok, died at a hospital

164
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,531
under the jurisdiction
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

165
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,742
The suspect, Kim Hyeong-bok,

166
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:22,121
was running from the relentless pursuit
of our Violent Crimes Unit

167
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,915
and was hit by a car and died.

168
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,751
Do you have any questions?

169
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,211
Yes.

170
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,089
The Seoul Criminal Investigation Division
put out an APB just today.

171
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,760
How were you able to find the suspect
in such a short amount of time?

172
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,136
Right.

173
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,429
We were pursuing

174
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:42,933
Kim Hyeong-bok on a separate matter.

175
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,561
As a chief,

176
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,774
I was convinced that he
was related to the serial murder case.

177
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,900
Yes?

178
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,528
Based on the information
about Kim Hyeong-bok obtained during…

179
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,447
I'm sorry, we weren't aware.

180
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,575
Anyway, we are gathering evidence.

181
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,745
We'll hold a press conference again
in the name of Seoul Criminal--

182
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,748
-Coffee?
-Let's go.

183
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,960
Next question?

184
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,340
If there are no more questions,

185
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,302
I would like to say

186
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,598
that I will work tirelessly to lead
our team at Incheon Seobu Police Station

187
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,519
to solve violent crimes
and protect the safety of the people.

188
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,355
Thank you very much.

189
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,953
Come in.

190
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,040
Hi.

191
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,584
-Are you studying?
-Yes.

192
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,506
That's right, the GED is coming up soon.

193
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,632
Yes.

194
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,553
Don't worry and do your best.

195
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,096
I have no doubt you will pass.

196
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,224
Don't stay up too late.

197
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,267
Okay.

198
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,938
-Mr. Kang…
-What is it?

199
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,898
Do you need something? Tell me.

200
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,025
Eun-hui told me

201
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,279
you're quitting the Violent Crimes Unit
and moving to another unit.

202
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,823
Eun-hui should stick to fried chicken

203
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,908
rather than gossip.

204
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,952
-That's--
-If you are…

205
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,205
If you are quitting
because of my dad and me,

206
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,374
I wish you wouldn't quit.

207
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,667
You promised me.

208
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,295
You said you will live your own life.

209
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,174
I didn't say I will quit.

210
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,968
I received an offer,
so I was just considering it.

211
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,553
Nothing has been decided yet.

212
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,639
Then you should stay in your unit.

213
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,893
I like you the best as a detective
in Violent Crimes.

214
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,313
And you love doing it.

215
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,483
Then I'll stay
as a Violent Crimes Detective.

216
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,027
I can't disobey you.

217
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,195
Never.

218
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,614
Thank you.

219
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
We could have won the trial.

220
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,508
But I got too greedy in the end.

221
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
It's all my fault.

222
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,306
What did you do wrong?

223
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,685
You didn't do anything wrong.

224
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,521
You fool.

225
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,566
You're innocent.

226
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,861
You didn't do anything wrong.

227
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,447
I don't know.

228
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,450
Do as you want.

229
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,995
It won't change anything for me.

230
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,929
Damn it.

231
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,941
SEOBU POLICE STATION

232
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,192
Certificate of Commendation,

233
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,486
Sergeant Kang Do-chang.

234
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,907
The person above has shown patriotism
and dedication as a police detective,

235
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,119
working hard to protect and serve,

236
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,163
and made a notable contribution
to solving the recent serial murder case

237
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,000
with the members
of the Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

238
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,043
Thereby, this citation is awarded to him.

239
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,628
Incheon Seobu Police Station,

240
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,256
Chief Moon Sang-beom.

241
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,557
Sergeant Kwon Jae-hong,

242
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,059
Sergeant Byun Ji-ung,

243
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,896
Corporal Ji Man-gu,

244
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,607
and Corporal Sim Dong-uk,

245
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,774
same as above.

246
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
Face the crowd.

247
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,114
Salute.

248
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,660
Look at the camera, please.

249
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,414
Shall we do a pose?

250
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,207
-Go Team 2!
-Go Team 2!

251
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,381
Good work, Bong-sik.

252
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,300
I've never gotten this before.

253
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,760
-I'm just jealous.
-Look at this. I'm so jealous.

254
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,054
-Come on. Don't say that.
-Congratulations.

255
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,347
-I'm jealous.
-Goodness.

256
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
-Captain Woo.
-Congratulations.

257
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,975
-Congratulations again.
-Congratulations.

258
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,852
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

259
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,980
They couldn't even get this right.

260
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,149
Do they even care about the award?

261
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,859
What are you complaining about?

262
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,819
SERGEANT JI MANG-GU

263
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,114
If there was a typo,
they should have reprinted it.

264
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,450
What is "Mang-gu"?

265
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,077
Why not "Mango"?

266
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,621
I like "Mango" better. It's cute.

267
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,164
It's a very nice fruit.

268
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,750
Mango is for a smoothie,
not a person's name.

269
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,710
You guys did good work.

270
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,171
Kang Do-chang and Oh Ji-hyeok,
you guys did it all.

271
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,339
Give them a hand!

272
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,970
You know how I feel. Cut it out.

273
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,808
Captain,

274
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,769
do we have to work on a day like this?

275
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,354
We have to keep office hours.

276
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,148
We will also work outside

277
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,484
and a stakeout for two days.

278
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,653
The location will be a bar.

279
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,363
Get out of here!

280
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,075
-Sweet!
-Great.

281
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,661
Excuse me,

282
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,455
is this the Violent Crimes Unit Team 2?

283
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,833
-Yes, it is.
-I see.

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,626
Officers,

285
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,754
thank you very much.

286
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,092
I'm the grandfather of one of the victims,

287
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,219
Jung Hui-ju.

288
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,472
Thanks to you,

289
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,601
my granddaughter will rest in peace.

290
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:05,024
I will live the rest of my days
in deep gratitude to you.

291
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,900
Thank you very much.

292
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,652
Thank you so much.

293
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,362
Thank you.

294
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,286
ALOE VERA JUICE

295
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,679
What did you do to deserve that drink?

296
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,389
I'm going to earn it from now on.

297
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,820
No need to escort me.

298
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,113
It's too much.

299
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,243
Hello, sir.

300
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,372
Were we close enough to greet each other?

301
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,419
My apologies, Chief Secretary.
Could you spare me some time please?

302
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,962
You're so dense.

303
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,800
It doesn't look good for me
to talk to you.

304
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,469
I just want to talk.
I'm not asking for favors.

305
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,055
I'm sorry. I have to run.

306
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,306
Sir,

307
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,808
it won't take long.

308
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,893
No harm will come to you.

309
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,229
We just want you to verify something.

310
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,814
Let go.

311
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,399
I said, let go.

312
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,904
Sir…

313
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,793
-Right.
-I apologize.

314
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,338
I have been so busy that I couldn't even
visit my own father-in-law.

315
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,424
It's fine. You're doing
important work for the country.

316
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,552
You should be busier.

317
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,893
Hello, sir. What can I do for you?

318
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,894
Sorry?

319
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,231
I thought you had already chosen a company
at the beginning of the year.

320
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,774
Sorry?

321
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,235
Is that right?

322
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,698
Thank you very much.

323
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,740
Yes.

324
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,077
What was that about?

325
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,288
Earlier this year,

326
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,958
we lost a supply contract
to another company.

327
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,837
But that company is suddenly in trouble.

328
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,674
So they want to give the contract to us.

329
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,597
Who was the one who called you?

330
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,516
Mr. Park Sang-jun.
The CEO of Taejoo Chemicals.

331
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,852
Are you talking about the company

332
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,354
that is a subsidiary of TJ Group?

333
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,397
That's the one.

334
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,526
Honey, our company is saved.

335
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,446
With this contract, we can take out a loan

336
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,656
and pay our employees now.

337
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,993
It's a miracle.

338
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,828
Wait a minute.

339
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,872
Did you, by any chance…

340
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,498
No, I didn't.

341
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,627
I didn't even know you were struggling.

342
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,961
That's right.

343
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,548
You're good at keeping
business and personal life separate.

344
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,925
How much…

345
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,802
is the contract worth?

346
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,912
Thirty billion won.

347
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,081
You went overboard.

348
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,582
It's a fair contract.

349
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,502
If a subcontractor does well,
TJ also does well.

350
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,171
All we did was find the best company.

351
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,091
It'll be a catastrophe
for the other company.

352
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,884
I guess I'll be a villain to them.

353
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,430
What if that company files a lawsuit?

354
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,933
I'll become a worse villain then.

355
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,353
They won't retaliate knowing that.

356
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,356
How scary.

357
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,692
As if you were talking to me.

358
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
I wouldn't dare.

359
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,409
What do you want me to tell you?

360
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,455
Who gave our information
to the Blue House?

361
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,015
Who gave our information
to the Blue House?

362
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,351
We thought it was you.

363
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,103
Am I wrong?

364
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,065
Hurry up!

365
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,483
Let's get moving!

366
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,609
Hurry.

367
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,819
Get that, too.

368
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,322
-Move quickly!
-Yes!

369
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,075
Yes, Mr. Woo.

370
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,494
I'm in the office. Tell me what you need.

371
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,914
Go to my office. Hurry

372
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,760
Let's go in.

373
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,181
I found the safe.

374
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,268
Hold on.

375
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,690
It's open.

376
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,984
Take the laptop and escape.

377
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,528
Make sure you don't get caught.

378
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,282
You must destroy that laptop.

379
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,243
Burn it so there's absolutely
no trace left.

380
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,465
Wait, please.

381
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,674
What's going on?

382
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,051
-Just keep going.
-Wait…

383
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,304
Don't bother searching elsewhere.

384
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,473
Focus on the office
of the legal team director.

385
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,476
Please stop what you're doing.
Thank you for your cooperation.

386
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,811
Look over there too.

387
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,032
Yes, Ms. Cheon.

388
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,127
Could it be a coincidence?

389
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,015
WE ARE CLOSED FOR PERSONAL REASONS

390
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,560
-Did you go somewhere?
-Yes.

391
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,686
I see.

392
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,108
-Hello.
-Hi, nice to see you.

393
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,486
I brought this for repair,
but are you not working today?

394
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,697
Yes, I am.

395
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,701
I've been coming here for 40 years,

396
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,494
but this is the first time
I saw it closed.

397
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,954
Did something happen?

398
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,789
It's nothing.

399
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,957
Please come in.

400
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,701
Hui-ju…

401
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,955
I will go see you soon.

402
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,875
Wait for me.

403
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,214
Here you go.

404
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,175
-Have some of this.
-Thank you.

405
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,595
How's the chicken?

406
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,181
-It's good.
-What's in the sauce?

407
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,891
I can't stop eating this.

408
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,102
-Really?
-I want to eat this every single day.

409
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,520
-Seriously.
-Hey.

410
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,564
Then quit your job and get a job here.

411
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,650
-Can I do that?
-You want to?

412
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,069
Come on, this isn't chicken.

413
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,987
A fried sponge
would taste better than this.

414
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,739
It tastes fine.

415
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,991
I think this is great for a first-timer.

416
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,868
It's totally edible.

417
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,994
I mean, tasty. Right?

418
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,247
-Of course.
-Yes, it's delicious.

419
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,289
Actually,

420
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,916
it's a bit greasy.

421
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,292
The sauce is too pungent.

422
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,296
Some parts are overcooked,
but at least it's not undercooked.

423
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,048
The skin is a little burnt though.

424
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,385
Ji-hyeok is…

425
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,512
How should I say this…

426
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,930
He's stingy with compliments.

427
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,391
He meant he liked it.

428
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,684
That's right.

429
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,645
I will fry a sponge
and bring it out for you.

430
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,106
Detective Oh, I'll order chicken
from another place for you.

431
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,108
-Okay?
-You can give that to me.

432
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,986
-I can eat it all.
-I loved it.

433
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,779
Don't mind what they say.

434
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,906
I don't.

435
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,367
There are obnoxious customers
in every restaurant.

436
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,164
What's wrong with you guys?

437
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,791
We're here to celebrate.

438
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,712
-Let's see some smiles.
-This is my smiling face.

439
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,755
Should I pull my mouth from ear to ear?

440
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,967
I know you feel uneasy.

441
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,928
But the chief
and the investigation division

442
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,015
made a deal to scratch each other's backs.

443
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,599
We played along and got an award.

444
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,393
Everybody won here.

445
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:47,397
What if we later find out that
Kim Hyeong-bok is not the killer?

446
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,650
Did we try to frame an innocent man?

447
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,694
Was the accident our fault?

448
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,611
Look.

449
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,948
We don't have evidence
that he isn't the killer.

450
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,283
That's right!

451
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,745
Even if Kim Hyeong-bok was not the killer,

452
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,373
the investigation division guys should
take the blame for closing the case.

453
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,083
Why blame us again?

454
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,001
He's right.

455
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,003
We should let it be.

456
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,048
Let's wrap it up with a toast.

457
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,716
All together.

458
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,259
-Cheers!
-Okay.

459
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,510
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

460
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,684
And this time…

461
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,605
let's give all the credit to Do-chang.

462
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,398
-Absolutely.
-Of course.

463
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,401
Let's toast to Do-chang's promotion.

464
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,819
-To his promotion!
-To his promotion!

465
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,496
Come on,

466
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,123
lighten up a little.

467
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,503
Captain,

468
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:56,174
maybe we should take Do-chang
on a vacation or something.

469
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,970
Don't we get a reward vacation
after getting an award?

470
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,180
Am I right?

471
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,932
-We should.
-You're right.

472
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,267
What?

473
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,395
Sure.

474
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,729
That's a good idea.

475
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,564
When should we go?

476
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,529
How about we postpone our vacation?

477
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,200
Kim Hyeong-bok is a thief,
not a serial killer.

478
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,952
So we have to catch the real killer.

479
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,579
Not to mention that it happened
in our jurisdiction.

480
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,669
I thought you wanted to wrap it up.

481
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,129
Wrap up the burglary case.

482
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,923
And open the serial murder investigation.

483
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,092
Oh Ji-hyeok.

484
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,679
What's wrong with you?

485
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,183
These guys were already going to do that.

486
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,351
Who are we?

487
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,562
We are the Violent Crimes Unit Team 2
of Incheon Seobu Station.

488
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,981
If we just let this slide,

489
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,899
we aren't the famous Team 2, right?

490
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,402
-Well…
-I know, Man-gu.

491
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,029
You hide it,
but I'm sure you're upset for screwing up

492
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,115
thanks to the poop and boar incident.

493
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,701
I know you're a good detective.

494
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,287
There will be a chance to redeem yourself.

495
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,705
So, cheers!

496
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,832
Incheon Seobu Station
Violent Crimes Unit Team 2!

497
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,877
Let's show them who we are.

498
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,920
Cheers!

499
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,548
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

500
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,008
-Let's go.
-We got this.

501
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,346
Eun-hui,

502
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,516
the chicken is so good.

503
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,935
It's the best fried chicken I've ever had.

504
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,520
It's so good.

505
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,243

INQUIRY REPORT
NAME: JUNG HUI-JU

508
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,922
PARENTS DECEASED

509
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,595
EMPLOYMENT HISTORY
TJ GROUP LEGAL TEAM EMPLOYEE

510
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,397
This was Hui-ju's desk.

511
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,192
Was everything here removed?

512
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,363
Yes. I believe they were sent to her home.

513
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,573
Look who's here.

514
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,077
-It's been a while, Ji-hyeok.
-Hello.

515
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,829
I heard you were reinstated.

516
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,040
I also heard you were transferred here.

517
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,042
What brings you here?

518
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,546
Are you here for Jung Hui-ju's case?

519
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,965
You could say that.

520
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,179
I thought her case was closed by
the Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

521
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,264
Why are you here?

522
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,561
I'm not trying to open her case back up.

523
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,398
I'm investigating another case
and thought this may be related.

524
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,649
I'm here to make sure.

525
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,733
I see.

526
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,153
What could the other case be?

527
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,323
I will tell you when I'm sure.

528
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,784
-I'll be off now.
-Okay.

529
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,077
Thanks for your help.

530
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,039
Let's have a drink soon
to clear some things up.

531
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,583
Sure.

532
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,218
The statute of limitations
for special assault is seven years.

533
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,179
I'm sure you're aware of that.

534
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,537
They're all gathered here.

535
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,583
Any news on your meeting
with Chief Secretary Heo Gong-seo?

536
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,876
Did he say anything?

537
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,712
Not yet.

538
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,256
What a shame.

539
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,051
So not much was gained
from our investment?

540
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,346
I think it's a start.

541
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,434
Okay.

542
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,395
I'm sure it will help
with my father's trial.

543
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,022
Nice work.

544
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,400
But I do have one question.

545
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:32,325
Why did father call you and Na-na
to the detention center after his trial?

546
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,285
It was to give me orders.

547
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,620
What about Na-na?

548
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,165
He only called for me,
but Na-na insisted on coming with me.

549
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,249
I see.

550
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,922
What is she up to these days?

551
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,091
I'm curious.

552
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,470
It seems like she's hatching a plan.

553
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,395
Should I have asked someone else?

554
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,815
I will look into it
and report back to you.

555
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,858
What if she's cooking something up?

556
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,820
Would you be able to tell me the truth?

557
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,572
You guys are married.

558
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,741
We are.

559
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,119
But nothing more and nothing less.

560
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,956
You can go.

561
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,170
By the way, a girl named Jung Hui-ju died.

562
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,715
That's too bad.

563
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,136
She was too pretty
to be on the legal team.

564
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,018
According to the police reports,

565
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,605
Kim Hyeong-bok had a history
of stalking a nurse a year ago.

566
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,399
They think that was the reason

567
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,776
he put the victims
in white gowns and killed them.

568
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,487
Then why did the suspect

569
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,575
not kill the nurse he was stalking,

570
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,412
but killed unrelated women?

571
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:04,584
There is a misconception
that serial killers act impulsively.

572
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,210
That is absolutely not true.

573
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,338
They are very calculating and rational.

574
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,925
If he had killed the nurse,

575
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,303
-it would've been obvious…
-Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

576
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,807
You worked hard on the serial murder case.

577
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:21,893
Yes.

578
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,811
It's done anyway.

579
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,355
Don't try too hard.

580
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,358
I always have a place for you on my team.

581
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,360
Well…

582
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,404
I'm flattered.

583
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,532
I've come this far as a police officer.

584
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
I should see how far I can go.

585
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,414
I'm indebted to you over this case.

586
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,709
-I'll pay you back someday.
-No need for that.

587
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,086
I'm always grateful to you.

588
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,051
Do you know Oh Ji-hyeok?

589
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,221
I met him once because of the case.

590
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,642
He stopped by the office today.

591
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,730
The serial murder case,
including Jung Hui-ju's murder.

592
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,732
They are closed, right?

593
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,651
Then why?

594
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,530
Why did he come back
to see where Jung Hui-ju worked?

595
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,365
Why?

596
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,412
He's probably onto something.

597
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,499
The funny thing is,

598
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,836
I wasn't a nurse yet
when I was dating Hyeong-bok.

599
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,130
I was studying to become a nurse's aide.

600
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,258
We only dated for a few months.

601
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,552
He never saw me in a nurse's uniform.

602
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,555
Did you tell
the investigation division about this?

603
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,931
Of course, I did.

604
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,934
At the time, he seemed to understand
what I told him.

605
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,353
Then all of a sudden, it was on the news

606
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,897
that he put the white gowns
on the victims because of me.

607
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,441
It's so unsettling.

608
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,027
Did Kim Hyeong-bok stalk you?

609
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,154
Sorry?

610
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,033
Do you know why I broke up with him?

611
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,912
He was cheating on me with another woman.

612
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,248
Why would he stalk me?

613
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,084
He kept calling you
according to the phone records.

614
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,336
-Why was that?
-It was because of the ring.

615
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
He wanted me to return it. What a loser.

616
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,883
I never answered his calls.

617
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,552
Why would I give it back to him?
I'd rather sell it.

618
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,811
What the investigation division claimed

619
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,813
as the motive of the murders is flimsy.

620
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,900
So what are you saying?

621
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,735
Kim Hyeong-bok is not the killer.

622
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,488
Hey.

623
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,657
If you call yourselves detectives,

624
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,160
you should prove that he is guilty.

625
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,288
Why are you guys trying
to prove his innocence?

626
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,497
Why?

627
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,499
Are you his attorney?

628
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,335
Are you?

629
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,047
Listen.

630
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,466
I want to give you a piece of advice.

631
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,510
If Kim Hyeong-bok is not the killer,

632
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,722
then the real killer is getting away
with a perfect crime.

633
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,184
There is very little chance
that he will kill another woman.

634
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,062
Cover it up.

635
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,438
He really is the killer.

636
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,398
I don't have to cover anything up.

637
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,193
There were no objections
from the police or the prosecution.

638
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,904
Who in the right mind
would open that up again?

639
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,658
Oh Ji-hyeok.

640
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:28,079
And his partner, Kang Do-chang.

641
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,874
Those crazy bastards
flipped Lee Dae-cheol's case.

642
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,293
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION
CORPORAL JI MAN-GU

643
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,713
What is this funny business?

644
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,465
Please hold onto them,

645
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,802
and give them back to us
when we find the real killer.

646
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,304
I will consider this a prank.

647
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,099
Please take these back.

648
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,475
I beg you.

649
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,852
Kim Hyeong-bok is not a serial killer.

650
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,647
The investigation division
found the evidence.

651
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,024
They said the button
they found on the scene

652
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,360
was from Kim Hyeong-bok's jacket.

653
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,988
That was a button I tore off of him
as I was chasing him.

654
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,325
You knew I chased him
and caught him near the scene.

655
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,288
The investigation division made it
look like Kim Hyeong-bok was the killer.

656
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,505
I'm warning you,

657
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,758
don't bring that case up again.

658
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,761
Kang Do-chang,

659
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,598
I will make sure your guys
blame you for the rest of their lives.

660
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,934
Try me.

661
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,813
I will show you how merciless I can be.

662
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,817
If you say that, I guess I can't do it.

663
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,445
I don't think it's worth hurting my guys.

664
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,612
But…

665
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,990
Oh Ji-hyeok is a problem.

666
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,158
Why?

667
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:51,078
He doesn't even know
how much his salary is.

668
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,289
It's a chump change to him.

669
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,168
He doesn't have to worry
even if he loses his job.

670
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,128
So what? What about it?

671
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,048
It means I can't control him.

672
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,469
What if he talks to the media
with the new information?

673
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,305
How would that make you look

674
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,890
when you held a press conference

675
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,352
announcing that we caught the killer?

676
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,356
Would Oh Ji-hyeok go that far?

677
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,108
He's family, after all.

678
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,818
Ji-hyeok,

679
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,905
what was your nickname
at the investigation division?

680
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,239
Was it lunatic?

681
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,240
No.

682
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,700
It wasn't just "lunatic."

683
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,869
It was "crazy lunatic."

684
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,330
I'm in no mood for a joke.

685
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,707
I'm not capable of making jokes.

686
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,804
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION
VIOLENT CRIMES

687
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,016
Captain Jang.

688
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,185
Do you have plans tomorrow?

689
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,687
-No, I don't.
-Okay, then.

690
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,816
Let's have dinner with the commissioner.

691
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,442
He only invited me,

692
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,196
but I told him you should also join us.

693
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,364
I see.

694
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,448
Thank you.

695
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,325
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

696
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,922
Nothing leaked?

697
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,134
No. Except for what we sent
to the prosecution, this is everything.

698
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,718
Burn all of it.

699
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,222
And delete everything you have
on your personal computers.

700
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,809
-That's--
-I'll take responsibility for everything.

701
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,353
Get rid of everything without a trace.

702
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,105
Understood?

703
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,523
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

704
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,360
They won't give in
to the pressure from the higher-ups.

705
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,653
There's only one solution.

706
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,906
Make the case disappear.

707
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,368
WHITE GOWN SERIAL MURDER CASE

708
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,042
How can we investigate
without any preliminary information?

709
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,253
What do we do best?

710
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,797
Starting from scratch.

711
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,550
Do-chang,

712
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,470
the chief never gave you permission
for a reinvestigation.

713
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,138
He gave us a week off.

714
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,139
I'm aware.

715
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,432
So that means…

716
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,725
Give me that.

717
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,811
That means not to
reinvestigate this thing.

718
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,731
It means he won't care
what we do for a week.

719
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,649
That's practically permission.

720
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,861
We're going back to square one
if we don't find evidence in a week.

721
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,613
Let's divide up the cases.

722
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,699
Let's find out what
the investigation division couldn't.

723
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,992
Okay?

724
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,913
Don't force the guys.

725
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,331
If you want to leave, leave.

726
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,542
The investigation division
had nothing for three months.

727
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,794
How will we find anything in a week?

728
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,254
Honestly, this is hopeless.

729
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,883
Do you know what was the first thing

730
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,635
I saw at the Central Police Academy?

731
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,138
"Young police officer,

732
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,807
the country is counting on you."

733
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,522
I thought it was cheesy at first.

734
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,024
After my training, I saw that again.

735
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,275
I almost cried.

736
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,153
If any police officer
feels nothing from it,

737
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,821
they can't call themselves a cop.

738
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,782
The country is counting on us.

739
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,575
And I am counting on you guys.

740
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,328
Let's go, young police officers.

741
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,378
You're not young!

742
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,131
You're middle-aged!

743
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,884
I think I really sold it.
I bet the guys were moved.

744
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,761
I think they were.

745
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,477
Honestly,

746
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,522
that tops it all.

747
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,023
It's at the top of the list.

748
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,151
-It was the cheesiest.
-I thought I was hearing things.

749
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,862
I had no idea he was that old-fashioned.

750
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,532
He already knows the investigation
will take a toll on us.

751
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,492
I don't know why he's insisting.

752
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,079
FAITHFUL, WARM, AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE

753
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,008
Where should we go first?

754
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,053
Ji-hyeok,

755
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,805
you were with the investigation division.

756
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,181
Do you have a friend there?

757
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,892
Could we have your friend
sneak some of their files?

758
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,645
They bring in a whole new team
with a new captain.

759
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,607
There is nobody left that I know of.

760
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:31,900
I see.

761
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,571
You probably didn't have a friend anyway.

762
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,659
Hello, this is Kang Do-chang
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

763
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,286
Hello.

764
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,913
I visited the station a while ago.

765
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,625
My name is Jung In-beom,
I'm Jung Hui-ju's grandfather.

766
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,752
Yes.

767
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:54,965
I would like to
visit the place Hui-ju died.

768
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,345
Could you tell me where that might be?

769
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,199
Is this all?

770
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,744
This is all we have on the CCTV
inside the company.

771
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,837
Can we check the cameras outside too?

772
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,173
Well, that would be…

773
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,716
You were a detective.

774
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,635
I'm sure you can find a way.

775
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,845
Okay.

776
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,555
I will check them as well.

777
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,676
Do you have to do that yourself?

778
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,344
I'm used to it.

779
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,054
I don't want others to see me like this.

780
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,560
Are you done? Let's go home together.

781
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,779
I did something today…

782
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,117
that I should apologize to you for.

783
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,248
I had an abortion.

784
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,625
What?

785
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,129
I need to take medicine to stay alive.

786
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,132
Aren't I selfish?

787
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,801
I'm sorry.

788
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,060
We can try again after you get healthy.

789
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,271
Don't be sorry.

790
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,149
Thanks for understanding.

791
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,198
Go home. I want to get some fresh air.

792
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,702
Don't wait up. I might sleep at the hotel.

793
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,634
It's too late today.
You can go tomorrow morning.

794
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,053
I know my store looks run down,

795
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,971
but I have quite a few regulars.

796
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,391
I have to keep regular hours for them.

797
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,394
It would have to be late tomorrow too.

798
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,731
All right then. Let us take you.

799
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,941
No.

800
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,193
Just tell me the address.

801
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,946
We were planning on going there too.

802
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,697
Please don't kill me.

803
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,867
I won't tell anyone.
I will go straight home.

804
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,963
Are we almost there?

805
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,381
Yes, we are.

806
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,632
Excuse me.

807
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,802
Hold on.

808
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,555
-Let's sit down for a while.
-Okay.

809
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,483
How about if you just go back today?

810
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,736
No. I want to go.

811
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,489
Hui-ju probably
didn't leave that place either.

812
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,326
I have to tell her

813
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:36,371
that the killer has been caught
so she can go where she needs to go.

814
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,374
I understand.

815
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,251
Stay as long as you need to.

816
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,295
We can go when you feel ready.

817
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,130
-We will wait for you.
-Okay.

818
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,729
Do-chang.

819
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,522
Did you not hear anything?

820
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,524
What could be here this late?

821
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,526
It's probably a damned boar again.

822
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,905
Let's get going again.

823
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,114
Goodness.

824
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,758
It was that sound.

825
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,719
Please stay here for a minute.

826
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,472
Stay here no matter what.

827
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,848
What's going on?

828
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,017
Please wait.

829
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,705
Watch out!

830
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,049
What's wrong?

831
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,050
I'm a detective.

832
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,553
-Can we see what's in your trunk?
-Yes.

833
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,778
Did you see anyone running

834
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,155
while you were driving?

835
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,200
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

836
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,176
So the real killer wasn't caught?

837
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,560
-Did you burn everything?
-Yes, sir.

838
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,521
They deleted everything on the computer.
And I double-checked.

839
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,857
Good work. You've all done well.

840
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,317
Let's get drunk tonight.

841
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,402
Got it?

842
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,528
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

843
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,737
Good job, guys.

844
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,948
-Nice work!
-Great job.

845
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,325
-What do you crave? Pork belly?
-Hello?

846
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,702
No, I want stew.

847
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,953
-Pork belly.
-Stew isn't bad either.

848
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,122
I want pork belly.

849
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,540
Okay.

850
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,253
Call forensics and tell them to get ready.

851
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,005
What happened?

852
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,215
This damn case is not over yet.

853
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,600
What is going on?

854
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,644
-What?
-What the…

855
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,146
Do-chang.

856
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,902
What should we do?

857
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,904
Standby. I will take care of this.

858
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,993
Can we talk?

859
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,838
Can you tell me

860
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,965
how you guys
came to be the first witnesses?

861
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,467
You must know Jung Hui-ju.

862
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,845
Her grandfather wanted to see the scene.

863
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,680
We came with him and found her.

864
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,390
So someone didn't tip you off?

865
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,600
Not at all.

866
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,520
I heard you were conducting
an investigation alone.

867
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,065
You probably came
because you know something.

868
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,526
I guess you heard something
from Yong-geun.

869
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,028
You two must be close.

870
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,323
Don't change the subject.

871
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,532
Tell me the truth.

872
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,620
You guys knew something
about the killer, right?

873
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,830
If we knew something,
we would have told you.

874
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,458
Why would an officer hide something
from another officer?

875
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,918
The only thing we know…

876
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,796
is that Kim Hyeong-bok isn't the killer.

877
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,048
I think you have to agree now.

878
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,634
The killer is sending us a message
through this incident.

879
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,762
"I'm the real killer, not Kim Hyeong-bok."

880
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,723
Who are you to blabber about this case?

881
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,850
This is my case.

882
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,394
It's not your case!

883
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,146
Don't poke your nose in it.

884
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,025
Kim Hyeong-bok wouldn't have died

885
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,735
had you guys given him over to us.

886
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,446
-What? You bastard.
-Stop.

887
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,864
-You little…
-You little…

888
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,574
-Let go!
-Let go!

889
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,076
-Damn it!
-Stay still!

890
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,703
You messed up too.

891
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,331
You're the one who
framed an innocent man as a serial killer!

892
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,249
That's enough.

893
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,460
We're done with our statement,
so we can go, right?

894
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,546
Take your guys with you.

895
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,006
We'll take over the scene.

896
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,090
Hey.

897
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,759
-What are you talking about?
-Do-chang, leave it to me.

898
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,140
You guys are the ones
who concluded the case.

899
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,516
So this is a new case.

900
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,685
-Why should we hand it over to you?
-Right.

901
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,520
You'll get an official document later.

902
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,980
After reading it,

903
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,649
if you have any objections,
send it through your chief.

904
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,151
Okay. Let's go.

905
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,068
Hey.

906
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,654
Why do I have to listen to this bastard?

907
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,407
He said this is his case.

908
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,578
That means he considers this case
to be the same as the serial murder case.

909
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,706
He said it himself,
so we should hand it over.

910
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,957
Let's go.

911
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,376
Come on.

912
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,713
How is this your case, you bastard?

913
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,924
It's the victims'
and their families' case!

914
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,303
You're rotten to your core.

915
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,055
-Let's go.
-You bastard!

916
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,139
Do-chang.

917
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,141
It's a mess over there too.

918
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,527
Hui-ju.

919
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,405
I think…

920
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,201
I have to join you a little later.

921
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,257
We have to catch the killer first.

922
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,176
The crime scene is under their control.

923
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,303
They will identify the victim first.

924
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,514
They will process the evidence first too.

925
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,058
-They have a head start on us.
-That's irrelevant.

926
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,435
The first one that has
the foot on the ground wins.

927
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,897
Jae-hong.

928
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,526
When you get to the station, make a list
of missing women in their twenties

929
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,112
who went missing in the area
near the murders.

930
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,910
What do we do?

931
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,956
The commissioner
thinks we caught the killer.

932
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,125
We can't prove Kim Hyeong-bok
isn't the killer.

933
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,793
He's dead, you punk!

934
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,838
How can a dead man kill again?

935
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,218
Before you catch the killer,

936
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,264
figure out how we can
get out of this mess.

937
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,016
Think about that first.

938
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,565
Captain, the reporters are here.

939
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,607
What?

940
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,277
Who tipped them off?

941
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,368
They will identify the victim
in about two hours.

942
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,619
Don't worry.

943
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,247
They have something else to deal with.

944
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,754
-What did they say?
-Their daughter called 30 minutes ago.

945
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,382
Her phone died,
so she used her friend's phone.

946
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,342
We checked
every missing person case so far, right?

947
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,011
-Yes, so far.
-Hold on.

948
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,554
We have a new missing person.

949
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,264
A student in her twenties.

950
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,267
The last call was on the way home
after a meeting on campus.

951
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,104
Her address is close
to the scene of the first murder.

952
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,567
Let's split up to save time.

953
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,195
-Why won't they let us through?
-Let us through.

954
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,030
Open the crime scene!

955
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,656
Who is in charge here?

956
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,450
Tell them to brief us about the case.

957
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,744
-Why are you keeping us in the dark?
-Brief us!

958
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,037
Brief us on the case!

959
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,955
-Here he is!
-He's coming!

960
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,418
We were not able to
identify the victim yet.

961
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,254
The victim was wearing a white gown.

962
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,673
She was found with red lipstick on.

963
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,759
-White gown?
-Did he say white gown?

964
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,512
Is it another White Gown murder?

965
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,096
We are still investigating.

966
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,601
Doesn't that mean
Kim Hyeong-bok is not the real killer?

967
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,938
Did you frame a random person
just to close the investigation?

968
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,105
If that's the case,

969
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:50,068
do you acknowledge that the police
lied to the entire country?

970
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,819
The body was found

971
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,614
at the same spot as the fourth murder.

972
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,492
We need to investigate further,

973
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:01,162
but I have never seen a serial killer
use the same location twice.

974
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,580
In my personal opinion,

975
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,209
I believe this is a new culprit's doing.

976
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,713
Are you saying this is separate
from the White Gown Serial Murder Case?

977
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,634
There is a good chance this is a copycat

978
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,720
of the White Gown Serial Killer.

979
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,764
-A copycat?
-Really?

980
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,402
She's not home yet
and her cell phone is off.

981
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,404
I saw her photo.

982
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,073
She looks a lot like the woman
we saw at the scene.

983
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,909
It must be her.

984
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,703
Did you check the CCTV nearby?

985
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,747
There's nothing here.

986
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,260
This is when the victim left
the school at 5:00 p.m.

987
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,681
This is her leaving a cafe near the school
at 7:00 p.m.

988
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,433
And…

989
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,104
she got on the bus
around 7:30 p.m. to go home.

990
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,650
She arrived at the bus stop near her home
around 8:00 p.m.

991
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,235
And then she got off the bus.

992
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,654
Do we have footage from the bus stop?

993
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,574
The situation room checked, but the area
doesn't have CCTV cameras.

994
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,409
None of the abduction sites

995
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,245
of serial murders so far had CCTVs.

996
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,166
That means the killer checked
everything in advance.

997
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,502
Then the crime must have taken place
between the house and the bus stop.

998
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,964
Maybe the dashcams from the nearby
cars might've captured something.

999
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,383
It's a narrow alley
so there weren't that many cars.

1000
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,177
He probably thought of that too.

1001
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,470
Is this…

1002
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,015
all we can find out?

1003
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,155
Let's take it a step further.

1004
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,575
Did you say Seongwol-dong?

1005
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,911
Yes. Before and after 8:00 p.m.

1006
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:11,167
We have it.
13-4 Daeju-ro, Seongwol-dong at 7:20 p.m.

1007
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,712
25-1 Daeju-ro, Seongwol-dong at 8:10 p.m.

1008
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,005
There are two of them.

1009
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,595
There's nothing.

1010
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,264
Is this from 8:10 p.m.?

1011
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,641
Yes.

1012
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:30,311
The victim got off the bus at 8:05 p.m.

1013
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,480
It should have been caught here.

1014
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,899
Let's check the 7:20 p.m. footage.

1015
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,236
Isn't that too far apart?

1016
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,822
Let's check it just in case.

1017
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,408
Okay.

1018
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,965
Go back a little.

1019
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,182
Right there.

1020
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,644
There's no one there.

1021
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,855
Zoom in here.

1022
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,569
What is that?

1023
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,449
It's a backpack.

1024
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,370
I

1025
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,415
Remember

1026
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,834
Our

1027
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,087
first kiss

1028
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,797
I will

1029
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,508
send it

1030
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,219
He was waiting for the victim

1031
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,638
with the murder weapon in his bag.

1032
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,396
I want to tell you

1033
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,941
That I love you

1034
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,058
SPECIAL COMMENDATION CEREMONY
FOR THE ARREST OF A MAJOR CRIMINAL

1035
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,477
Can you sniff the killer out?

1036
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,978
I must catch him with my own hands.

1037
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,689
I'll be humiliated
for the rest of my life if I don't.

1038
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,484
You found something at the scene
that night, didn't you?

1039
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,528
Someone who no one notices

1040
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,696
despite being caught on CCTV all day.

1041
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,615
Who was the bus driver?

1042
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,408
Stop the bus now, damn it!

1043
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,911
It's time for a change in TJ's management.

1044
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,872
I'm sure there's someone on the inside
who's thinking exactly that.

1045
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,165
Find that person.

1046
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,875
This might be a copycat crime.

1047
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,545
I'm concerned
that I may be framing an innocent person.

1048
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,838
You made a mistake.

1049
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,805
