00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,505
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,447
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,162
She left about two hours ago
to head back to the States.

4
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,956
Let's go to the airport.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,959
If she left two hours ago
then we might be able to catch her.

6
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,385
According to the priest,
Laura Caine knew a little Korean.

7
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,597
Meaning she can't speak it,
but she understands some of it.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,140
So she was pretending?

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,434
It means she was able
to communicate with him.

10
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,687
She would've understood a little
of what Lee Seong-gon said.

11
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,815
Laura is suffering from a stress disorder…

12
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,153
after meeting with him, right?

13
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,112
Yes.

14
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,617
If you see her, tell her this.

15
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,996
To keep in mind what I told her.

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,957
My guess is…

17
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,628
Lee Seong-gon told Laura Caine

18
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,048
about his murders.

19
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,641
Do-chang.

20
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,022
We're too late.

21
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,777
She might call us from the States.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,154
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,573
I guess she has no reason to tell us.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,492
That would make her brother a murderer,

25
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,120
and she would be the sister of a murderer.

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,247
Do-chang.

27
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,670
Your father was a barber
when you were a kid, right?

29
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,300
Laura's mother
helped your father with shaving duties.

30
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,178
The reason you put a gown on the victims

31
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,139
was because of your past trauma

32
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,517
from your childhood, right?

33
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,197
This is too unfair, Detective.

34
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,743
All of this happened
because of her and her mom.

35
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,079
Why should I be the only one to suffer?

36
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,124
She gets to live happily in the States.

37
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,336
So why am I the only one suffering?

38
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,852
Hey! You little…

39
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,356
Why are you putting on red lipstick again?

40
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,399
I told you not to.

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,279
Which punk are you running off
to this time?

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,953
Hey, come here.

43
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,207
Why won't you just listen to me?

44
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,178
Where are you going to go now?

45
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,350
You can't go anywhere without me.

46
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,312
I'm going to follow you
to the depths of hell.

47
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,709
Let it all out now.

48
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,504
It's time you escape from your suffering.

49
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,258
Holding on to it will only torment you.

50
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,889
Did you

51
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,142
kill all of them?

52
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,519
All five of them?

53
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,814
Then out of the five,

54
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,609
there was one you didn't kill?

55
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,325
Who's the one?

56
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,255
How would I know?

57
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,303
Isn't that something
only the real killer would know?

58
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,555
You said you killed all of them, you punk.

59
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,015
When?

60
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,684
I never said that.

61
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,646
We need to start recording
our conversations at this rate.

62
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,607
Those words never came out of my mouth.

63
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,617
This is too unfair, Detective.

64
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,954
All of this happened
because of her and her mother.

65
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,332
Why should I be the only one to suffer?

66
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,126
She gets to live happily in the States.

67
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,171
So why am I the only one suffering?

68
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,509
This was your motive.

69
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,513
Can that be counted as a motive?

70
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,184
Is that a reason to kill someone?

71
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,311
No.

72
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,438
It's not.

73
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,107
You're right.

74
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,485
You never had a reason.

75
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,987
You simply wanted to blame
your crippling urge to kill

76
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,697
on someone else.

77
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,368
The murder weapon, your past,

78
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,869
and the traces you left behind.

79
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,705
They all point to you being the culprit.

80
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,334
You can't get out of this.

81
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,628
Whether you killed five or four,

82
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,881
you can never return to society.

83
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,716
Just tell me

84
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,387
that you didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

85
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,014
For her sake.

86
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,892
For the sake of her bereaving family.

87
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:19,772
This is the only way
you can even pretend to be human.

88
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,318
Gosh, you're quite naive.

89
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,445
Think about it.

90
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,698
Just because I say
I didn't kill Jung Hui-ju,

91
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,450
it doesn't mean I killed the rest.

92
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,620
I mean, why should I say that?

93
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,997
Why? Tell me.

94
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,083
You will be forever remembered

95
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,921
as the famed serial killer
that led to copycats.

96
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,051
Instead of a lame copycat killer
who imitates others.

97
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,646
Take him.

98
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,120
Goodness.

99
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,373
Hold on.

100
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:23,252
I won't have the opportunity
to see these men again, right?

101
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,718
Gosh, what a shame. You were a fun duo.

102
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,179
Let's go.

103
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,644
Did Lee Seong-gon say anything

104
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,230
that I should know about?

105
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,481
Ji-hyeok.

106
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,943
Tell him what we heard
from Lee Seong-gon's sister.

107
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,073
What is it?

108
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,993
I'll send you the recording of it.

109
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,455
It'll come in handy
when you're figuring out his motive.

110
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, I'll make sure I write you guys
down as my source.

111
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,420
There's no need

112
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,923
for you to do that.

113
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,427
Just remember
we have that information too.

114
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,898
Darn it.

115
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,276
I'm so embarrassed.

116
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,153
Why?

117
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,738
The fact that I used

118
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,616
Jung Hui-ju's family
to plead with that scumbag.

119
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
It's so embarrassing.

120
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,787
I knew it wouldn't work.

121
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,622
What's wrong with me these days?

122
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,417
-You're going through puberty.
-What?

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,128
You're going through both puberty
and male menopause.

124
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,713
It's a rare case.

125
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,093
Yes, you might be right.

126
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,262
My body has aged,

127
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,972
but I still think like a kid.

128
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,101
How embarrassing.

129
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,105
Captain. Here's the translation
of Lee Seong-gon's sister's testimony.

130
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,859
It's more clear as to why he chose
to kill those women that way.

131
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,569
The judge should buy it.

132
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,487
Are you the judge?

133
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,699
-Pardon?
-It's for me to decide!

134
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,369
Don't get ahead of yourself.

135
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
Keep your mouth shut, got it?

136
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,539
Yes, sir.

137
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,376
MY PARENTS DIED BEFORE MY EYES

138
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,836
MY STEPDAD SLIT MY MOM'S THROAT
WITH A RAZOR

139
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,785
You were haunted
by your childhood, weren't you?

140
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,829
That's why you put a white gown

141
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,915
and red lipstick on your victims.

142
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,669
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

143
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,338
If that's not it,

144
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,508
you coincidentally saw Kim Hyeong-bok's
method for serial murders

145
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,885
and that reminded you of your hidden past.

146
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,889
Which made you commit
a copycat crime following his method.

147
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,435
Which one is it out of the two?

148
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,732
But regardless,

149
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,111
you're just a piece of trash.

150
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,281
But Detective.

151
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,995
First of all, I didn't kill anyone.

152
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,331
And I'm not a copycat.

153
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,584
I was just going to scare her.

154
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,505
Though I'm sure
it'll be more beneficial for you

155
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,174
if I'm a copycat killer.

156
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,260
Since that's what you told the reporters.

157
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,972
Gosh, no need to worry about us.

158
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,600
Then excluding this abduction case,

159
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,312
would you like me to say
I committed one of the previous cases?

160
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,064
Is that it?

161
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,695
But I never killed anyone.

162
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,366
-Is that so?
-Yes.

163
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,452
The thing is though,

164
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,496
I have no intention to get
a confession out of you.

165
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,582
All you have to do is

166
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,543
say you kidnapped someone on drugs.

167
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,461
Okay?

168
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,422
I see.

169
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,674
Mr. Lee Seong-gon.

170
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:42,094
You have the right to remain silent.

171
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,138
You have the right to an attorney.

172
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,685
Right, one more thing.

173
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,440
If you want, we can have an expert
give you a psychiatric evaluation.

174
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,958
That punk.

175
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,879
What if he says
otherwise to the prosecutor?

176
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,508
Punks like him
have a strange need to show off.

177
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,968
He won't do that.

178
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,888
He only has one thought in his head.

179
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,683
"I must find a way out of this."

180
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,520
"That way, I can kill again."

181
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,693
-He's coming out.
-They're bringing him out!

182
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,281
Do you admit to all the charges?

183
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,700
I told

184
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,079
the police

185
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,875
every single crime I have committed

186
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,045
and told them nothing but the truth.

187
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,589
What crimes are you talking about?

188
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,009
I would like to sincerely apologize

189
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,345
to the girl

190
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,682
I caused emotional damage to.

191
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,728
I was only trying to scare her--

192
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,147
-That's enough now.
-How do you know the victim?

193
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,109
-Let us through.
-Are you denying your charges?

194
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,696
SERIAL MURDER SUSPECT LEE SEONG-GON
SENT TO THE PROSECUTION

195
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,407
ADMITS TO ABDUCTION
AND ATTEMPTED MURDER

196
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,994
INTENTION WAS ONLY TO SCARE,
DENIES COPYCAT CLAIMS

197
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,955
Were you really just trying to scare her?

198
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,250
Darn it.

199
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,296
Didn't we all expect he would do that?

200
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,382
The problem is,

201
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,303
do the investigation division guys
intend to investigate him deeper?

202
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,471
They probably made an agreement

203
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,432
to only admit the abduction...

204
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,517
If he's only charged for the copycat case,

205
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,186
that means Kim Hyeong-bok
will remain a serial killer.

206
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,439
What? No way.

207
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,108
I handed everything I found
to the investigation division.

208
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,694
The prosecution will never know
if they don't pass it on.

209
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,614
Captain. Is there nothing we can do?

210
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,034
The investigation results aren't out yet.
Let's wait and see...

211
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,453
What's there to wait and see?
It's obvious.

212
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,038
We know how they roll.

213
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,415
Shouldn't the Chief step in then?

214
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,168
Hey, why would you get him involved?

215
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,504
You said he's your lackey.
And you have him in the palm of your hand.

216
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,298
Go and talk to him.

217
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,468
He's upset at me
for constantly nagging at him.

218
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,095
He keeps trying to avoid me.

219
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,058
Do-chang and Ji-hyeok.
You two go and talk to him.

220
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,603
If you tell him I sent you,
he'll probably listen.

221
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,064
Why isn't he giving us any cases?

222
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,315
Captain!

223
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,027
What should we do, Do-chang?

224
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,783
My brain is overwhelmed
because I'm going through puberty.

225
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,118
Give me time to organize my thoughts.

226
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,538
I'm clocking out first. See you tomorrow.

227
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,627
-Goodnight.
-Bye.

228
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,132
What's up with him?

229
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,843
-What does he mean by puberty?
-You don't know?

230
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,304
It's a tumultuous period.

231
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,642
What?

232
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,188
-Here.
-Is that everything?

233
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,189
Yes.

234
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,693
She's moving.

235
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,453
You need to take this too.

236
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,251
And here.

237
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,005
Eat this in the car.

238
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,230
-Let's go.
-That poor woman.

239
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,946
FOR THE YOUNG DIABETIC PATIENTS

240
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,742
Diabetes is not exclusive to adults.

241
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,662
It's a disease that children also suffer

242
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,622
due to hereditary or congenital reasons.

243
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,791
They don't know at first.

244
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,420
But questions start
to arise as they grow up.

245
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,797
"Why must I only watch

246
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,925
when other kids are running around?"

247
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,678
"Why was I born

248
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,264
with a devil inside of me?"

249
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,936
That devil demands insulin shots
every single day.

250
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,813
It also…

251
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,776
robs you of your happiness.

252
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,488
Every day,

253
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,115
I asked the devil inside me
countless times.

254
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,077
"Why me?"

255
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,037
"Why...

256
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,502
did you have to choose me?"

257
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,714
I ask that

258
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,051
you answer that question
for the children suffering

259
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,053
from the same disease as me.

260
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,639
That they didn't do anything wrong.

261
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,559
That you will

262
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,938
plant hope inside their bodies.

263
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,816
Thank you.

264
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,864
Thank you so much for coming.

265
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,282
Thank you.

266
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,368
-Thank you.
-That was great.

267
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,162
Isn't it so obvious what Na-na wants?

268
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,497
-Thank you.
-Great speech.

269
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,457
-Really?
-This event is for herself.

270
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,001
-Thank you.
-Her first step to standing alone.

271
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,419
I hope it helps the children.

272
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,088
The public doesn't like the Chairman.

273
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,757
She's simply trying to change that.

274
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,221
Sacrificing herself
by revealing her disease?

275
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,267
If that's the case, that's beautiful.

276
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
Goodness.

277
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,689
Goodness.

278
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,691
What brings you here, Chief Secretary?

279
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,109
Hello.

280
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,737
Thank you for making time
to come despite your busy schedule.

281
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,614
I had to. It's for a good cause.

282
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,283
Should I get a picture of you two?

283
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,450
I would love that.

284
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,412
No, take pictures of me
with the crowd from afar.

285
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,329
Yes, sir.

286
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,043
I thought you had
grown closer to our group.

287
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,045
Was I mistaken?

288
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,255
I'm picky about people.

289
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,133
My guard goes up
to those who come charging at me.

290
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,302
It's clear they have an agenda.

291
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,389
What to do then?

292
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,934
I guess we'll have a strained relationship

293
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,978
until your term is over.

294
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,233
Call me once you complete your term.

295
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,819
I get a feeling
I'll become a useful asset to you then.

296
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,116
Hey, Im Chang-su.

297
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,328
Be honest with me.

298
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,413
Are you here to see me or Na-na?

299
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,167
Did you check?

300
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,086
Yes, it wasn't easy,
but I was able to get the edited version.

301
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,880
I have it.

302
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,966
It'll air an hour later
on the current affairs program.

303
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,343
And the program's producer?

304
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,387
I met him briefly
and tried to give some hints,

305
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,555
but he's a tough one.

306
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,681
Okay.

307
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,727
Text me the number
of someone at the executive level.

308
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,895
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,944
You're leaving already?

310
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,656
Yes, you're busy.
I figured I should at least go check.

311
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,532
Okay, thanks for coming.

312
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,786
But are you sure about the piece
you bought? It's a pricey one.

313
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,999
I'll call you later.

314
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,345
Hey, how big is our segment on TJ?

315
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,889
It's 4 minutes and 58 seconds long.

316
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,934
Can we air it though?
The backlash is going to be intense.

317
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,353
Don't be scared.
Trust me on this and just air it.

318
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,232
Mr. Cha.

319
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,241
I think you already know,
so I won't beat around the bush.

320
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,493
Call them and cancel the program.

321
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,745
What is this all of a sudden?

322
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,706
It won't do either of us any good.

323
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,708
The Chairman is serving jail time.

324
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,335
Our stocks will plummet
if the Vice-chairman's case sees light.

325
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,837
Why?

326
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,089
Did the Vice-chairman do something wrong?

327
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,342
It must be very serious
if it's enough to affect the stocks.

328
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,014
Did you inform
McQueen's headquarters about this?

329
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,852
Using cheap tricks like this
will only provoke us.

330
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,607
You love your wife, right?

331
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,861
I think you do.

332
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,238
Na-na told me

333
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,825
that her husband would do anything

334
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,660
and give up everything for her.

335
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,295
Will the news even cover this?

336
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,632
You barely called
any reporters to this event.

337
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,803
I didn't do this for media coverage.

338
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,225
Shouldn't as many people know
about this if it's for the Chairman?

339
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,935
It was purely for the cause.

340
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,562
I had no other intentions.

341
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,814
Really?

342
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,984
Tae-ho lied to me then.

343
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,321
Vice-chairman.

344
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,573
Can I talk to you privately?

345
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,160
Sure.

346
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,372
What is it?

347
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,000
How did you find out?

348
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,336
The branch in Japan contacted me.

349
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,672
A producer is covering your fraud case.

350
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,757
Damn it.

351
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,052
A current affairs program
will cover it an hour from now.

352
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,474
Who is the bastard that keeps
digging into me?

353
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,018
McQueen.

354
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,939
I'm going to lose it.

355
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,108
Forget the humiliation.

356
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,693
If my father finds out,
he'll treat me like an animal.

357
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,571
Hey, Tae-ho.

358
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,532
Help me out.

359
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,621
Come on, I'm pleading with you.

360
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,957
We were struggling to get commercials.

361
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,043
There's no reason for us to decline.

362
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,755
Please rethink this
for the company's sake.

363
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,508
Please help us out.

364
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,350
What did the Director say?

365
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,477
Did they threaten
to pull all the commercials?

366
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,523
-We'll have to cut it short.
-What?

367
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,526
TJ suddenly added a ton of commercials

368
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,444
to our preceding program.

369
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,739
We have to cut at least five minutes
to not go overtime.

370
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,623
Thanks.

371
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,792
This incident helped me make my decision.

372
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,878
As long as you don't have
a change of heart,

373
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,548
you and I will be a team until the end.

374
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,384
Goodnight, sir.

375
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,345
Bye, then.

376
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,699
Only this piece didn't get sold.

377
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,285
Did I price it too high?

378
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,788
It's such a great piece though.

379
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,332
I stopped it.

380
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,420
I had to.

381
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,465
-Why?
-Na-na.

382
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,886
Do you think
you're capable of handling this?

383
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,766
You think Sang-woo
will back off if you stop him?

384
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,894
The Chairman will never
betray Cheon Sang-woo.

385
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,606
I know better than anyone.

386
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,817
Don't tell me

387
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,988
it wasn't Sang-woo you were after,

388
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,615
but the Chairman?

389
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,161
Na-na.

390
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,789
That's insane.

391
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,920
Why are you here?

392
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,338
What?

393
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,006
Isn't it because you're my husband?

394
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,720
As his sister,
I appreciate you helping my brother.

395
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,807
Cheon Seong-dae's son-in-law,
Cheon Sang-woo's brother-in-law.

396
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,059
They will all be proud of you.

397
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,895
And you're Cheon Na-na's husband.

398
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,818
Do you know why I chose you?

399
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,781
For the first time,
my brother lowered his head.

400
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,366
It was to you, the prosecutor.

401
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,912
You looked so cool.

402
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,581
I can't forget it.

403
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,085
Help me to hold onto that image.

404
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,718
We're having dinner to celebrate.
I want you to accompany me.

405
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,990
You arrested Lee Seong-gon, right?

406
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:58,908
Yes.

407
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,495
So is he the culprit?

408
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,457
Or is he a copycat

409
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,208
like the news is saying?

410
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,296
I think he's the culprit.

411
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,426
Did he kill my Hui-ju too?

412
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,680
I'm not sure yet either.

413
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,142
You must've arrested countless criminals.

414
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,813
Didn't you catch him
because you were sure he was the culprit?

415
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,318
I'm sure you didn't frame
an innocent person as a murderer.

416
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,366
You must have caught him for a reason.

417
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,619
I'm asking you to tell me
that he's the culprit.

418
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,163
That he killed Hui-ju.

419
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,124
Please tell me that.

420
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,087
I don't know. I have no idea either.

421
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,716
How would I know
if he killed your granddaughter or not?

422
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,051
I don't know either!

423
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,512
Only the killer knows that.

424
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,765
Detectives aren't that great.

425
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,893
Unless one witnesses the crime,

426
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,187
nobody, not a single person,

427
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,024
can say that he is the killer,
even if he is!

428
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,825
It seems

429
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,744
I have burdened you too much.

430
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,373
I think…

431
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,167
I was being selfish.

432
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,086
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,635
-Thank you for the tea.
-No problem.

434
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,514
Eun-hye. Hurry up and give him
the food I packed for him.

435
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,598
-Okay.
-No, please.

436
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,268
I no longer wish to be a nuisance.

437
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,606
-Eun-hye, go after him and give it.
-Okay.

438
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,609
Sir.

439
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,700
Sir!

440
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,537
Take this with you.

441
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,915
Please don't do this.

442
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,627
Stop making me a shameless old man.

443
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,089
Okay.

444
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,467
Go home safely.

445
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,851
Thank you.

446
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,667
What's wrong with you?

447
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,211
What? What did I do?

448
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,546
You could've said it nicer to the old man.

449
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,925
Can you imagine how heartbroken
he must be losing his granddaughter?

450
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,804
"We caught the culprit, so be at peace
and don't worry anymore."

451
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,764
That's all you had to say.
Did you have to--

452
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,765
That's enough!

453
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,267
Why should I be responsible
for people like him too?

454
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,229
I'm sick of it. My head might explode.

455
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,731
Let me find my peace first. Please!

456
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,567
Why did you become a detective then

457
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,486
if you're going to be so selfish?

458
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,574
I don't know
why I should live this way either.

459
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,411
Listen.

460
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,499
Where did all your confidence go?

461
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,042
You said you were born for this.

462
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,544
No, it's not for me.

463
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,795
Not even a little bit.

464
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,340
Then why did you go catch a culprit
in the middle of your wedding?

465
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,884
Hey! What does that have to do with this?

466
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,178
You told me back then
that you don't regret it.

467
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,348
The fact you caught the culprit
and gave the victim's family peace.

468
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,808
How that was enough for you.

469
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,269
That's the real Detective Kang Do-chang.

470
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,646
Hey, I didn't know anything back then.
I just…

471
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,899
Mr. Kang. You had a wedding?

472
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,404
Let me tell you how foolish this man is.

473
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,114
It was his wedding.

474
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,075
-And he saw the culprit--
-Hey, stop it.

475
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,078
You better not tell her.

476
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,998
I'm going to kick you out
onto the streets.

477
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,916
Eun-hye, take the alcohol.

478
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,085
He'll go crazy if he drinks anymore.

479
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,753
-Okay.
-I only had a sip, Eun-hye.

480
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,132
Mr. Kang. Stop drinking
and go home, please.

481
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,175
Gosh.

482
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,761
I warned you. Don't you dare tell her.

483
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,347
Do-chang.

484
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,100
I thought about it,
but you can't do desk duty.

485
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,478
You don't get travel expenses
and barely get paid for overtime work.

486
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,147
We have a lot of debt

487
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,190
thanks to moving and this store.

488
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,068
There's no choice
but to work your butt off in Team 2.

489
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,531
Darn brat.

490
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,663
Hey.

491
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,290
Aren't you curious?

492
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,752
Why he's still a single pathetic loser?

493
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,546
He told you not to tell me,
or you'll get kicked out.

494
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,589
Come on.

495
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,801
He only won bronze at a local competition.

496
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,970
I'm a national gold medalist.

497
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,348
So who do you think
will end up on the street?

498
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,975
I guess you can tell me then.

499
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,228
Here comes the bride.

500
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,457
Hey!

501
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,981
Do-chang!

502
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:52,947
What are you doing right now?

503
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,191
Hye-ok!

504
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,666
Hye-ok.

505
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,044
I'm really sorry.

506
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,131
So many people fell victim to him.

507
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,718
We had to catch him as soon as possible.

508
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,555
I guess his acquaintance got married here.

509
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,682
Anyway, I locked eyes with…

510
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,229
Please try to understand, Hye-ok.

511
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,606
I'm so…

512
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,484
Get lost.

513
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,278
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

514
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,785
Hye-ok.

515
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,168
Hye-ok.

516
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,294
Hye-ok!

517
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,974
I was seriously out of my mind back then.

518
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:48,980
What?

519
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,523
Are you home?

520
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,150
No. What's up?

521
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,193
I need to show you something
at the office.

522
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,237
Don't come if you're tired.

523
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,907
If you knew I'd be tired
you shouldn't have called at all.

524
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,660
Do you find joy in sucking me dry?

525
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,036
You darn leech.

526
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,809
Do I look so pitiful to you?

527
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,145
No, you don't.

528
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,856
I'm not upset at all.

529
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,441
Don't worry, you can go.

530
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,234
Thank you for the mandarins.

531
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,195
Keep pestering Mr. Kang.

532
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,364
He'll probably look into what you want.

533
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,451
I know he's a good person.

534
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,828
I don't want to bother him
with my problems.

535
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,747
He's already busy as is.

536
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,917
I had no one to talk to either.

537
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,337
But he listened to me.

538
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,341
He proved my dad's innocence.

539
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,427
It wasn't his job to do so.

540
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,888
No one would've blamed him.

541
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,392
But he did it anyway.

542
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,978
So what?

543
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,397
I should depend on him too?

544
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,608
If you're struggling, yes.

545
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,277
That's what the country pays him for.

546
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,570
Goodness.

547
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,782
Fine. I'll think about it.

548
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,785
It's so late. Hurry up and go home.

549
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,871
Okay, goodnight then.

550
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,457
Hold on, wait right there.

551
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,293
-Here you go.
-What about you?

552
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,296
Don't worry about me and just take it.

553
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,467
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

554
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,196
JUNGIN SHOES

555
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,869
What is it?

556
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,830
I bought one from the convenience store.

557
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,207
You'll get rained on if I take this.

558
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,128
It wasn't expensive.

559
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,464
Why should you get rained on
because of me?

560
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,384
You'll blame me if you start coughing
from catching a cold.

561
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,346
You know I'm scared
to fall asleep without you, right?

562
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,099
So stop working and hurry back home.

563
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,017
Okay?

564
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,484
You're getting wet. Get back in.

565
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,777
Okay, go ahead first.

566
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,778
You're getting wet.

567
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,655
-All right.
-I'll get going.

568
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,383
FAITHFUL WARM AND TRUSTY POLICE

569
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,595
What will we gain from doing that?

570
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,013
How will it benefit us?

571
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,266
We're not salespeople.
We don't calculate profits and losses.

572
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,060
Hey, Captain Woo.

573
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,271
What do you think is the probability
of Lee Seong-gon talking?

574
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,981
About ten percent?

575
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,943
What about me getting promoted
to Superintendent General?

576
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,779
Gosh, it's not my place to predict…

577
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,238
No, be honest.

578
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,908
I won't get mad even if you say it's zero.

579
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,745
If I'm being honest,
I wouldn't say it's zero.

580
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,290
Maybe nine percent?

581
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,459
Okay, I like your honesty.

582
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,505
Then let's say Lee Seong-gon talks.

583
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,466
And he totally screws over
the headquarters guys.

584
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,636
Then what's the chance of me
becoming a Superintendent General?

585
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,598
Around three percent?

586
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,892
Tell me the reason

587
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,979
why I should get involved
despite that fact, Do-chang?

588
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,398
Captain.

589
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,317
How about the probability
of this case working out

590
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,861
and the Chief staying
as a respected Senior Superintendent?

591
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,863
That's…

592
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,617
It's 99 percent.

593
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,537
You wicked bastards.

594
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,582
Gosh.

595
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,461
You must be busy,
but thank you for meeting with us.

596
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,964
Why in the world are you here?

597
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,757
Welcome, sir.

598
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,176
Our detectives wanted
to show you something.

599
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,262
We finished the investigation.

600
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,180
We gave his files to the prosecution.

601
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,560
It doesn't mean much if he decides
to change his statement now.

602
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,811
I doubt he will though.

603
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,773
I don't get why those guys are

604
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,150
obsessing over this.

605
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,444
Me, neither.

606
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,489
Are you saying you have trouble

607
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,200
keeping your men under control?

608
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,787
That guy, Kang Do-chang.

609
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,665
He's the guy

610
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,210
that abandoned his wedding midway
to catch a culprit.

611
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,800
No one in our police force
can keep him under control.

612
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,387
Listen to this.

613
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,557
Listen to what your sister said.

614
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,080
This crazy bitch.

615
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,141
What is she talking about?

616
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,478
What are you doing right now?

617
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,981
Did you think showing me this

618
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,734
would make me confess
to committing all the murders?

619
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,071
I didn't kill anyone.

620
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,740
You told Laura Caine

621
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,575
that you killed people because of her.

622
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,162
So?

623
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,499
What can she do about that?

624
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:27,211
Bring her back. Go ahead.
Have her come blabber her mouth.

625
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,130
All I have to do is say I didn't do it.

626
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,715
That won't happen.

627
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,968
Of course. She won't come.

628
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,886
Why would she come from the States?

629
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,680
It's a hassle.

630
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,098
It doesn't concern her.

631
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,683
She will never come.

632
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,435
No, she won't.

633
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,395
Actually, she can't.

634
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,604
She can't come.

635
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,815
Because she's dead.

636
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,319
She took her own life.

637
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,116
What?

638
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,869
What do you mean?

639
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,022
Why?

640
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,024
Why!

641
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,822
Why did she do that?

642
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,658
You don't know?

643
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,369
She sacrificed herself for you.

644
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,622
To try to stop you.

645
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,764
That crazy bitch.

646
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,227
How dare that bitch die at her will?

647
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,730
That bitch. This is all because of her.

648
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,858
This all happened because of her!

649
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,736
It's all because of her

650
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,322
that this happened to me.

651
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,994
I murdered people because of her.

652
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,663
It's her fault.

653
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,793
"Sacrifice"?

654
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,878
That's nonsense.

655
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,841
If it weren't for this bitch and her mom

656
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,510
my father wouldn't have died,
and I wouldn't have killed.

657
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,972
This all happened because of this bitch!

658
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,433
She didn't sacrifice anything,
so cut the crap.

659
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,356
What a relief.

660
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,691
It's a great relief.

661
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,819
The crazy bitch died

662
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,072
knowing why I killed people.

663
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,198
I'm glad.

664
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,044
Kang So-jeong,

665
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,797
twenty years old,

666
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,424
a job seeker.

667
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,094
Jung Hye-jin, 26 years old,

668
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,304
a banker.

669
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,724
Choi Yun-a, 25 years old,

670
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,309
a preschool teacher.

671
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,979
Park Seon-mi,

672
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,857
a 21-year-old university student.

673
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,983
Lastly,

674
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,570
Jung Hui-ju.

675
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,697
A 28-year-old employee.

676
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,201
Kang So-jeong, Jung Hye-jin,

677
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,577
Choi Yun-a,

678
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,662
Park Seon-mi,

679
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,457
and Sung Ju-ri which was attempted murder.

680
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,835
All five of them took the bus you drove.

681
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,170
But…

682
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,092
Jung Hui-ju never took that bus.

683
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,552
Why?

684
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,306
Why is she the only one different?

685
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,268
Am I Jung Hui-ju?

686
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,399
She doesn't look good with red lipstick.

687
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,610
Some other punk killed her.

688
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,621
-Captain Woo.
-Yes, sir.

689
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,250
This was all recorded, right?

690
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,376
Yes, of course.

691
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,170
Then hand over the files to these men.

692
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,630
Yes, sir.

693
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,342
If you're too busy,
we can take it to the prosecutor.

694
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,969
What do you say?

695
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,398
Good job.

696
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,569
I hope you do this
for the rest of your lives.

697
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,115
Darn cops.

698
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:54,079
After much denial,
Lee Seong-gon has admitted

699
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,999
to committing the crimes.

700
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,503
Did he commit all five crimes?

701
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,132
No, he's denying the fourth murder.

702
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,219
The victim's name is Jung Hui-ju.

703
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,681
Is he simply claiming it
or was it proven to be true?

704
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,600
That's under investigation.

705
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:18,770
Then did the supposed culprit,
Kim Hyeong-bok, has no relation to this?

706
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,941
No, not at all.

707
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:27,696
On behalf of the entire police,
I would like to express

708
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,406
our sincerest apologies

709
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,451
and deepest condolences
to the late Kim Hyeong-bok,

710
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,330
who was wrongfully charged
for a period of time.

711
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,546
SEOUL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION'S
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR APOLOGIZES

712
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:50,385
The police admit Kim Hyeong-bok's death

713
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,889
was caused by the detectives

714
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,768
on the front line who over-investigated

715
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,770
the investigation.

716
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,524
We will thoroughly investigate
his cause of death

717
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:09,237
and have the one at fault
take full responsibility.

718
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,114
Hey.

719
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:16,662
What are we going to do about this?

720
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,038
What else?

721
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,499
We have to find the culprit
in Jung Hui-ju's case.

722
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,210
That's not the issue.

723
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,505
They're making it seem like
we're at fault for over-investigating.

724
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,257
-It's not all wrong.
-What?

725
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,761
Come on, that happened
because he was running away.

726
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,720
Why would we--

727
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,056
If the inspection unit comes,
just blame me.

728
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,517
Just say you were following my orders.

729
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,396
Aren't you in debt from the move
and opening the store?

730
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,190
If you get your pay cut,
how will you manage?

731
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,819
Just worry about saving yourselves
instead of me, you punks.

732
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,946
Then how about this?

733
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,991
Why don't we have
the most financially capable person…

734
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,787
Yes, good thinking.
There's someone in our team

735
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,373
that doesn't even know
how much he gets paid. What if he…

736
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,502
It's not the pay cut.
The issue is regarding promotions.

737
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,422
Honestly, don't you all
want to get promoted?

738
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,924
That only affects those with dependents.

739
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,885
Jae-hong. We all have a family to support…

740
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,096
I guess not everyone.

741
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,141
I was the first to find out
Kim Hyeong-bok's whereabouts.

742
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,060
If anyone should be held responsible,
it's me.

743
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,438
You're humiliating me.

744
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:28,191
Others might think I'm letting
my subordinate take the fall for me.

745
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,819
What do you mean he's your subordinate?

746
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,238
You're a sergeant, and he's a lieutenant.

747
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,323
Don't get the hierarchy mixed up.

748
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,744
Ranks don't matter for detectives.
Experience does.

749
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,495
It's final. I'll take responsibility.

750
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,206
-As expected.
-You're the best.

751
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,750
Respectable, as always.

752
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,712
Hey, I don't need you to save me.

753
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,590
I mean I outrank you in every sense.

754
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,259
Rank, money, education, and looks.

755
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,762
Unlikeable, as always.

756
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,312
Did the exhibition go well?

757
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,396
Yes.

758
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:11,151
The intention was good but people
may think we have too much free time.

759
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,611
She put a lot of effort into it.

760
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,863
Try to be more positive about it.

761
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,160
Tae-ho, you get ahead
of yourself too much.

762
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,328
Pardon?

763
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:25,123
Stop trying to control the press
with only money.

764
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,418
They have their limits too.

765
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,213
If you go over it,
they'll drag you down along with them.

766
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,632
It was so sudden.
I wasn't able to think it through.

767
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,385
But I believe the warning
was delivered clearly to McQueen.

768
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,264
As for the press,
I'll go console them personally.

769
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,728
I think I made you fall into a bad habit.

770
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,106
At the very least, I should've made you

771
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,983
make your own bed.

772
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,986
You're at fault, Na-na.

773
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,239
Sorry?

774
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,366
Let your brother take care of himself.

775
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:03,787
He goes on causing more problems
because you keep covering for him.

776
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,082
Yes, I understand.

777
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:10,919
Don't try to save me from now on.

778
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,297
What's more urgent is TJ.

779
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,676
TJ will fall alongside me.

780
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,181
It's time to change the leadership of TJ.

781
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,517
From Cheon Seong-dae…

782
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,190
to Cheon Sang-woo.

783
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,281
That's the only way TJ will survive.

784
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,966
He decided on this path from the start.

785
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,635
It's just that it happened sooner.

786
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,054
I don't care.

787
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:09,436
I never existed
on that path of his anyway.

788
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,399
Na-na.

789
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,069
This is the only path we can take.

790
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,115
"We"?

791
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,745
If you were on the path
the Chairman paved,

792
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,414
"we" would no longer exist.

793
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,758
Why should we take on Jung Hui-ju's case?

794
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,510
That's for the guys
at the investigation division to solve.

795
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:46,181
Captain. We're the ones
who caught Lee Seong-gon.

796
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,266
We got his confession too.

797
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,519
Shouldn't we find the missing piece
to complete the puzzle?

798
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,730
Don't you agree, idiots of Team 2?

799
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,273
-We agree.
-We agree.

800
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,359
Good grief.

801
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,071
Let's first put an end to the issue

802
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:04,282
regarding us over-investigating
Kim Hyeong-bok's case.

803
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,576
We might have a solution
for the punishment,

804
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,871
but if Kim Hyeong-bok's family saw
the news, they may file a complaint.

805
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,040
Then this will become a serious problem.

806
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,667
-Captain.
-Yes?

807
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,878
Someone sent a package to our unit.

808
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,630
Who sent it?

809
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,050
It's Kim Hyeong-bok's mom,
Ms. Park Geum-sun.

810
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,885
FRAGILE

811
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:46,574
DONGSAN CHURCH
MAIN HALL

812
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,203
Gosh, my pretty baby.

813
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,251
My dear Hyeong-bok.

814
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,214
I'm sure you went to a good place.

815
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,635
I truly believe it.

816
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:11,349
Gosh, I miss you.

817
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,896
My kind Hyeong-bok.

818
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,712
You sure you want to drink?

819
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,299
It's just a symbol of celebration.

820
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,053
Is this something to celebrate about?

821
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,721
That's the nature of our job.

822
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,434
We sometimes give carrots
and sticks at other times.

823
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,021
We didn't give the carrot this time.

824
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,315
Hyeong-bok's mom did.

825
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,613
This carrot is too sweet.

826
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,200
You are a grade-A jerk.

827
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,050
Na-na.

828
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,052
Na-na!

829
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,888
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

830
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,724
Leave me alone!

831
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,770
Don't stop me.

832
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,816
Why are you acting like a child?

833
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,319
What?

834
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,406
I can't eat or do what I want?

835
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,201
Why not?

836
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,871
Why!

837
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,422
Na-na.

838
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,094
Can't you be satisfied
with who you are now?

839
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,764
You can easily find happiness.

840
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,226
Are you in pain?

841
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,895
Yes.

842
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,231
I'm in pain.

843
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,442
Am I also

844
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,736
a source of your pain?

845
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,710
Tell me.

846
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,506
I want you to say it.

847
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,012
That I am

848
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,390
not alone in this world.

849
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,436
That I'm not the only one
living a lonely life.

850
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,814
And that…

851
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,112
I shouldn't live alone in pain.

852
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,174
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

853
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,181
Don't be in too much pain.

854
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,818
Yes, okay.

855
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,279
We'll talk again. Let's meet up soon.

856
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:58,117
Now that you have a lot of free time,
let's go drink at some place nice.

857
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,245
Okay.

858
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,335
I don't think
the investigation division can help us.

859
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,420
The captain has been put on the waitlist.

860
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,297
What about Jung Hui-ju's case?

861
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,467
Back to square one.
It'll be handled in its jurisdiction.

862
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,261
-Incheon Seobu Station?
-Yes.

863
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,638
Is there anyone you know there?

864
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,725
For now, there is no one
who would benefit us.

865
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:28,189
That guy, Oh Ji-hyeok
is still a troublemaker, right?

866
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,399
Yes, sir.

867
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,614
Jung Hui-ju's case is separate.

868
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,242
He might use this

869
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,744
to dig up the case from two years ago.

870
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,289
Don't let him in the building.

871
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,915
Yes, sir.

872
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,625
But if he comes with a warrant--

873
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,294
A warrant will never be issued.

874
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,671
Understood, sir.

875
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,423
-You can leave.
-Yes, sir.

876
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:08,229
WHO KILLED THE MYSTERIOUS VICTIM,
JUNG HUI-JU?

877
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,947
This was sent from Hui-ju's company.

878
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,532
It was her belongings at work.

879
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,535
Did you check what's inside?

880
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,498
Okay. We'll return right back
once we're done with it.

881
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,292
-Take it to the car.
-Okay.

882
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,687
I got a little annoyed at you last time.

883
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,439
I'm sorry.

884
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,776
You are such a foolish man.

885
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,654
-Pardon?
-You could've said this.

886
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,405
That Lee Seong-gon killed her.

887
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,534
Then you wouldn't have to look for
the one who killed Hui-ju.

888
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:08,247
You're a very foolish man
who goes looking for more work.

889
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,796
Eun-hye told me that I can depend on you.

890
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,881
She said that's what you're paid to do.

891
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,426
Gosh, why did Eun-hye say that?

892
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,722
Thank you for choosing the hard path.

893
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,477
I know what you want, sir.

894
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,022
You just need to hold on a little longer.

895
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,524
Okay.

896
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,836
MR. WOO SUMMONED BY THE PROSECUTION

897
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,340
GATHER DESIGN LAWSUIT INFORMATION
AND REPORT TO MR. YOO

898
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,143
You're very beautiful.

899
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,230
I guess that job
only attracts pretty people.

900
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,192
Your predecessor was
just as pretty as you.

901
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,071
You mean Ms. Jung Hui-ju, right?

902
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,115
The one who recently passed.

903
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,575
Does it bother you?

904
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,493
If it does, I can transfer you.

905
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,913
No, not at all.
That has nothing to do with the job.

906
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,251
This is your first time working
on the legal team, right?

907
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,794
Yes.

908
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,881
Then why did Mr. Choi
recommend you for this position?

909
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,382
I…

910
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,845
I heard a family member
of yours works in a related field.

911
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,638
My father is the chief of police.

912
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,474
I see. Which station?

913
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,392
At Incheon Seobu Police Station.

914
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,144
Is that so?

915
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,689
Then do you know Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?

916
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,442
Yes, a little.

917
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,359
How?

918
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,820
I didn't know him

919
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,323
until I joined the legal team.

920
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,949
Isn't he so handsome?

921
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,994
I'm not sure.

922
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,664
If you two are close,
can you maybe tell me about him?

923
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,249
Pardon?

924
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,668
Just out of curiosity.

925
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,631
Okay, I'll look into him.

926
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,469
I had a question about something.

927
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,765
I found out that
the station my father works at

928
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,518
is in charge of my predecessor,
Jung Hui-ju's case.

929
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:37,438
Is that the reason why I got this job?

930
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:43,194
Am I meeting
with an important executive like you

931
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,029
because of that too?

932
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:45,988
How old are you?

933
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,199
I'm 24 years old.

934
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,284
Then you're old enough to know.

935
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,787
Coincidences are rare in life.

936
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,539
Make the judgment yourself.

937
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,123
But,

938
01:03:56,207 --> 01:04:00,086
the company wants loyal employees.

939
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,421
Just keep that in mind.

940
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,006
Okay.

941
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,008
I will.

942
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,219
You're an interesting one.

943
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,644
MR. WOO SUMMONED BY THE PROSECUTION

944
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,938
These marks are
from the page that was ripped.

945
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,898
What do you think it means?

946
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,650
Looks like a passcode to me.

947
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,487
MR. WOO SUMMONED BY THE PROSECUTION

948
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,031
Yes, thank you. Bye.

949
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,785
The prosecution summoned Mr. Woo.

950
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,414
A search and seizure of TJ's legal team
was conducted while he was gone.

951
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,793
They timed it so the team's director
would not be present.

952
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,921
It must've been very chaotic.

953
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,383
She urgently wrote something down
and ripped it off.

954
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,679
What did this number open?

955
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,349
You know the prosecution and the police
aren't a team, right?

956
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,350
Yes, I'm aware.

957
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,353
I'm a cop,
but I'm with the prosecution now.

958
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,105
Don't put me in a difficult spot.

959
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,357
We won't tell anyone. Thank you.

960
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,404
Here.

961
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,659
Did you open this before?

962
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,119
Yes, I checked it.

963
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,787
We can't open this up for you.

964
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,123
-There's no need.
-The passcode…

965
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,851
DETAILED CALL LIST

966
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,609
Woo Tae-ho called Jung Hui-ju that day.

967
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,653
Almost exactly during the search.

968
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:52,239
It means Woo Tae-ho
told Jung Hui-ju the passcode.

969
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,743
And she took something out of the safe.

970
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,827
I see…

971
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,789
a very familiar name on his call list.

972
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,248
Who is it?

973
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,001
Someone I'm not allowed to approach.

974
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,336
What?

975
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,439
INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION

976
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:41,622
She's not picking up.

977
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,958
Is there another suspicious number?

978
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,918
There's an unlisted number.

979
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,004
I think it's a burner cell.

980
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,046
Call it.

981
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,093
I don't think I can go.
I'm not feeling too well.

982
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,556
It's been a very stressful time for me.

983
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,558
I'll see you next time.

984
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,490
She died because of me, right?

985
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,949
Because I told her about you?

986
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,118
Did you tell that to the cops?

987
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,286
What is their relationship?

988
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:05,664
He might connect Jung Hui-ju's case
to the case two years ago.

989
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,458
Did you find the culprit?

990
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,210
But there was someone suspicious.

991
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:11,420
Do I have to worry about him?

992
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,798
Where did you get these photos?

993
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,382
These photos could've been edited.

994
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,885
Send Na-na to the States.
She's better off gone.

995
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,387
It's a scheme
to sabotage the investigation.

996
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:23,349
I was willing to make a deal
if you had conclusive evidence,

997
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,934
Detective Oh.

998
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:31,857
