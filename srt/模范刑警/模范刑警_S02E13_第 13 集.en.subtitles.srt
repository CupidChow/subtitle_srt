THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,536
Please forgive Hui-ju.

4
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,958
I'm sure Hui-ju is asking
for your forgiveness from the beyond.

5
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,297
Director Cheon, which tea shall I prepare?

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,716
I will serve him myself.
He's an important guest.

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,052
Is coffee okay?

8
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,013
Yes.

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,015
Please wait a moment.

10
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,314
Yes, it's okay. Go ahead, Director Cheon.

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,572
Yes, I will be there soon.

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,869
Gosh, Hui-ju…

13
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,624
Why aren't you answering your phone?
Is something wrong?

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,631
Director Cheon?

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,425
Yes?

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,972
Are you Director Cheon?

17
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,517
That's what they call me.

18
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,478
Did Hui-ju call you that too?

19
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,687
Yes.

20
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,650
Why do you ask?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,529
I was just reminded

22
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,741
of when Hui-ju addressed someone
as Director Cheon on the phone.

23
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:03,081
Come to think of it.
I remember talking to her on the phone.

24
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,792
Ms. Jung had submitted
her letter of resignation.

25
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,336
I asked to meet
in hopes that I could make her stay.

26
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,757
I didn't want to lose a valuable employee
due to personal matters.

27
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,760
Is that so?

28
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,375
-Who is he?
-This guy?

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,879
You know the billiard club in Cheonma-dong
where the owner got robbed and hit?

30
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,922
This is the punk who did it.

31
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,174
All right. Did you find the weapon?

32
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,344
-Right here, sir.
-Okay, good.

33
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,513
I didn't use that.

34
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,681
You punk!

35
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:06,060
We have CCTV footage of you
striking the owner with this ball.

36
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,062
But this is a billiard ball.

37
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,608
I hit him with a pool ball.

38
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,526
They're the same thing.

39
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,112
It's different.
Pool balls are much smaller.

40
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,114
Stop. Are you two rookies?

41
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,409
Check the CCTV and find the actual weapon!

42
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,744
Hello?

43
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,996
Okay.

44
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,542
What did the prosecutor say?

45
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,002
Will Cheon Sang-woo appeal?

46
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,795
Of course.

47
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,299
What if he wins the second trial?
We'll all be screwed.

48
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,385
Did you not hear what the Chief said?
It's no longer our concern.

49
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,764
How is it not? We'll all be dead
if Cheon Sang-woo survives this.

50
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,892
-Jae-hong.
-My gosh.

51
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,270
Jae-hong. Man-gu and I caught a bad guy.

52
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,980
And it only took us a day.

53
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,523
Okay, good job.

54
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,859
We're mentioned here.

55
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,527
The Violent Crimes Unit

56
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,114
at Incheon Seobu Station played
a big role in exposing Cheon's crimes.

57
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,032
Detective Oh.

58
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,368
They shouldn't have written
only "Violent Crimes Unit."

59
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,412
It should've been made clear
it was Team Two. Those darn punks.

60
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,956
-Where does it say that?
-Hey.

61
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,336
Did you think a smaller ball
would mean a shorter sentence?

62
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,756
You're dead meat. Come on, darn it.

63
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,591
Wait.

64
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,136
CHAIRMAN CHEON SEONG-DAE'S MISTRESS
YOON JI-SUK COMMITS SUICIDE

65
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,558
YOON'S DAUGHTER CHEON NA-NA
WAS ALSO AT THE SCENE.

66
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,103
Catching small fry
no longer cuts it for them.

67
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,563
I guess compared to the bigshot Chairman

68
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,358
our billiards guy
is nothing but a petty thief.

69
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,152
I don't get why they discriminate.

70
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,824
Chairman scum or thieving scum.
They're both the same.

71
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,450
I wouldn't say they're the same.

72
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,911
In my eyes they are.

73
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,081
One just picked up
a better lottery ticket than the other.

74
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,293
Is everything in life
a lottery ticket to you?

75
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,752
That's what life is.

76
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,964
It's Eun-hui.

77
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,135
Wait, who's that? Is she seeing someone?

78
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,847
What the hell? She shouldn't be dating.
She's a mother.

79
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,181
So what if she's a mom?

80
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,309
-She's single. She can date.
-Seriously?

81
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,353
Wow, that's a sick car. He must be rich.

82
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,897
Come on, Ji-ung. Isn't it obvious?

83
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,525
He's clearly a bad guy. How are you a cop?

84
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,194
He does seem a bit sketchy.

85
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,322
We have to run a background check on him.

86
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,034
Don't you think Eun-hui
put on a lot of makeup today?

87
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,203
What's she thinking?
She's in front of her store.

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,090
Are you Director Cheon?

89
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,258
Na-na.

90
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,471
You killed Woo Tae-ho, didn't you?

91
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,306
I want to know

92
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,059
what Woo Tae-ho was thinking
before he died.

93
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,084
You've been released.

94
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,882
I don't plan to intervene
for the time being.

95
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,427
You should go somewhere and rest.
It's been a stressful time for you.

96
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,555
I don't think that's necessary.

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,058
I'm going to stand back and watch for now.

98
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,060
What do you plan on doing?

99
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,064
I don't know what to do myself.

100
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,193
What should I do with you?

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,030
Sang-woo just keeps blaming you.

102
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,200
It seems he thinks
you're to blame for all this.

103
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,993
I'm not in the right.

104
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,705
But I'm not in the wrong either.

105
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,125
It was Sang-woo's doing.

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,837
It was his job to handle it
and take sole responsibility.

107
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,633
Do you think I'm oblivious
to what you did?

108
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,596
Father, I--

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,933
Na-na. Shouldn't you feel grateful to me?

110
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,270
I accepted you as my daughter.

111
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,899
Your role is to take what I give you.

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
As soon as you covet something else,

113
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,447
you lose the right to be my daughter.

114
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,283
Shrink your ego.

115
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,912
Shrink yourself to the ground.

116
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,749
That is the only way

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,293
you can stay as my daughter.

118
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,893
I kept calling him, but he wouldn't talk.

119
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,644
He won't even pick up now.

120
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,855
That's not surprising.

121
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,357
He was the most rigid guy in our batch.

122
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,111
I bet he's not talking because
he may cause harm to other cops.

123
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,865
He was in Traffic Crimes but immediately
got kicked out to the suburbs

124
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,658
after Woo Tae-ho's accident.

125
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,827
I'm sure there's a reason.

126
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,047
-A man?
-Yes.

127
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,509
Eun-hui went somewhere
in his car last night.

128
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,095
She can date if she wants.

129
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
That's none of my business.

130
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,476
You're right.
But I looked up his license plate

131
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,520
and turns out it's fake.

132
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,901
That brat has the worst taste in men.

133
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,569
What should we do?

134
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,321
We have to investigate him.

135
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,907
She might get in trouble if we don't.

136
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
Hey, we're back.

137
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,204
Did you meet him?

138
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,498
-Yes, we talked to him.
-What did he say?

139
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,584
Woo Tae-ho didn't commit suicide.

140
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,836
What's the news?

141
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,968
Why do I get the crappy feeling
it's not going to be hopeful?

142
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:17,181
Ji-hyeok and Dong-uk
met a police officer today.

143
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,184
His name is Kim Chang-seo.

144
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,854
He used to be in Traffic Crimes.

145
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,775
In the unit in charge of investigating
Woo Tae-ho's car crash case.

146
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,153
He got kicked out and is working at
a local Patrol Division now.

147
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,073
You want to dig up
Woo Tae-ho's case again?

148
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,284
Good lord.

149
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,706
Why is it that I can always sense
bad news? So what?

150
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,792
Dong-uk, tell him exactly
what your friend told you.

151
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,086
Yes, sir. They assessed the car that

152
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,255
Woo was driving
at the time of the accident.

153
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,591
They found two sets of fingerprints.

154
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,843
Woo Tae-ho's
and his passenger, Cheon Na-na.

155
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,512
Well, of course. What about it?

156
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,515
They found Cheon's fingerprints
on the driver's seatbelt buckle,

157
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,766
and steering wheel.

158
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,144
Woo Tae-ho was driving
when the accident happened.

159
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,896
She's his wife. Maybe they shared the car.

160
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,565
What's the big deal about that?

161
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,276
Cheon Na-na was drunk
at the time of the crash.

162
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,404
The hospital she was admitted to
confirmed it.

163
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,114
She was in no state to drive.

164
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,324
But that's not enough

165
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,702
for us to dig up the case again.

166
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,954
This is our best option.

167
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,081
Please listen to me this time.

168
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,334
I'll take care of it.

169
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,962
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,256
I can't trust you.

171
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,134
You heard something unclick, right?

172
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,886
It's his seatbelt unfastening.

173
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:41,015
Cheon Na-na testified that Woo
voluntarily unfastened his seatbelt.

174
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,976
But if her fingerprints
were found on the buckle

175
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,978
it means she unfastened it.

176
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,315
Then she grabbed the steering wheel
and changed the direction

177
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,484
toward the truck
that was coming towards them.

178
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,029
That's why her fingerprints
were found on the steering wheel.

179
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,866
Look, Ji-hyeok. It seems that way

180
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,204
because you think Cheon Na-na
killed Woo Tae-ho,

181
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,415
so you're piecing it all together
in a way that verifies your theory.

182
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,541
Only you think that--

183
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,586
It's not just Detective Oh
who thinks that.

184
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,381
My friend also had the same suspicion.

185
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,509
That's why he voiced it to
the Traffic Crimes Unit.

186
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,843
Then got kicked out.

187
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,262
They were being pressured by
an outsider to hide it.

188
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,100
But they transferred him
for questioning the case.

189
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,186
Does this not ring any bells?

190
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,065
Just get to the conclusion.

191
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,611
You've arrested
the almighty Chairman of TJ

192
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,030
on charges of abetting murder.

193
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,827
But now you're saying,
this case will only be over

194
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,872
once we also arrest the daughter
for murdering her husband?

195
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,957
Yes, sir.

196
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,000
Boys.

197
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,504
Chairman Cheon Seong-dae
has been released.

198
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,758
We sent his beloved son to rot in jail.

199
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,093
He has one daughter now.

200
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,012
Do you think that man
will sit back and watch

201
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,765
if we say
we're going to arrest Cheon Na-na,

202
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,268
his one remaining kid for murder?

203
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,896
That man is worth trillions of won.

204
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,108
Paying a hitman ten billion
to have you all killed

205
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,776
is easy money for him.

206
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,236
Are you still in?

207
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,118
All right, fine. Let's vote.

208
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,455
Raise your hand

209
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,916
if you want to reinvestigate Cheon Na-na
even if it puts your life

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,084
on the line.

211
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,254
One, two, three.

212
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,465
There's a total of eight people here so--

213
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,133
What's with you suddenly?

214
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,759
Dong-uk looked into this.

215
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,553
I'm his supervisor.

216
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,222
It would be a little embarrassing
if I don't join him.

217
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,643
All right. That makes four.

218
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,936
Count me in too…

219
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,229
What's your reason?

220
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,273
I'm their Captain.

221
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,317
Now that I think about it,

222
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,987
their claims aren't totally groundless.

223
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,573
That's five. It's more than half, Chief.

224
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,118
But you know
for an important decision like this

225
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,745
we need more than half.

226
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,955
At least two-thirds should agree…

227
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,999
What's the reason now?

228
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:16,086
I hate the number five.

229
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,256
One, two, three, four, five, six.
That's perfect.

230
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,257
Count me in too.

231
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,593
Put your hand down. Six is enough.

232
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,429
I'm a bonus addition.
That's a total of seven.

233
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,947
Even though we have the Chief's approval,

234
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,616
it's not time for everyone to jump in yet.

235
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,661
If we start a full-scale investigation now
it might backfire on us

236
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,371
like the Chief said.

237
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,500
Okay. I'll try digging up more clues.

238
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,710
Once I do,
that's when everyone should join.

239
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,587
Everyone is counting on you.

240
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,673
Give up the moment you hit a dead-end.

241
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,508
For the sake of our team.

242
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,094
Okay.

243
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,513
Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

244
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,573
What is it?

245
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,493
Remember the guy
with the fake license plate?

246
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,120
He's at the store right now.

247
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,496
What?

248
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,017
-Yes?
-I want to see you.

249
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,560
I have a favor to ask.

250
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,105
Where are you?

251
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,528
You have to make time tomorrow.

252
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,032
Okay, I'll make sure to go.
Even if I have to close for a day.

253
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,201
Thank you for the fried chicken.

254
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,120
You're welcome. I hope you like it.

255
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,126
Hold on. I forgot something.

256
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,463
What…

257
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,342
-That darn bastard. He--
-Calm down.

258
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,677
-Just wait a second.
-What a sleazy punk.

259
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,930
-We need him in his car.
-Darn it.

260
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,848
Should we follow him?

261
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,892
He probably parked somewhere there.

262
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,355
Okay. A fake license plate
doesn't mean he's a criminal.

263
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,483
Right. He might've borrowed
his friend's car to impress her.

264
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,484
Right.

265
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,197
I pray that's the case. I truly hope so.

266
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,574
Look at that brat smiling like a fool.

267
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,541
Excuse me.

268
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,378
Is this your car?

269
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,298
Yes, it is.

270
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,925
We're from Incheon Seobu Station--

271
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,721
Hey!

272
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,609
Gosh.

273
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,987
Why did you run?

274
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,323
Tell me why you ran, you scumbag!

275
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,201
Just what horrible crime did you commit?

276
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,787
Can't you just be a good citizen?

277
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,331
Seriously, why?

278
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,751
Why did it have to be a punk like you?

279
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,678
Who are you?

280
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,556
I'm Detective Oh
from Incheon Seobu Station.

281
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,641
We were expecting you. Please go in.

282
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,184
Open the gate for him.

283
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,203
Sit over there.

284
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,753
What was the favor you needed?

285
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,342
Protect me.

286
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,554
I'm asking you to quit your job
and come protect me.

287
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,933
Whatever your conditions are,
I'll meet them.

288
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm sorry. That's a favor I must refuse.

289
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,190
This is a one-time offer.
I won't ask you again.

290
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,900
I made myself clear.

291
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,945
That would make you my enemy then.

292
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,822
Because you know

293
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,826
what might get me killed.

294
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,332
If my dad finds out what I did to Sang-woo

295
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,001
he will kill me.

296
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,377
It's a secret

297
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,631
that only you and I know.

298
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,466
I'll make a promise.

299
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,011
I won't do anything that will harm you.

300
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,847
You shouldn't have refused my offer then.

301
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,349
I must accept my fate then.

302
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,061
If you can't trust me, I become your enemy

303
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,897
like you said.

304
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,069
The nature of our relationship
is clear then.

305
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,987
How disappointing.

306
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,699
I thought you were my only friend

307
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,953
who shares the same past as me.

308
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,041
Your mom died because of you.

309
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,169
I was the reason for my mom's suicide too.

310
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,841
We are both murderers.

311
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,386
Murderers who killed their moms.

312
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,431
Do you really think…

313
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,104
your mother died because of you?

314
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,733
You're not using it as an excuse
to fulfill your ambition?

315
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,362
Your mother, Yoon Ji-suk,

316
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,991
was preparing to file a lawsuit
against Chairman Cheon Seong-dae.

317
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,870
She was about to fight for your rights
as his legitimate daughter.

318
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,123
Cheon Seong-dae and his son
thought she wanted their money.

319
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,833
They intimidated her.

320
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,044
That's why your mother committed suicide.

321
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,047
It was because of me.

322
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,092
She died to save me.

323
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,845
She sent me to the States

324
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,097
and sacrificed herself to protect me.

325
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,311
You were at the scene of her death.

326
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,313
You let her do it.

327
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,940
To you, your mom was
the obstacle stopping you

328
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,234
from being accepted into the family.

329
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,029
I was on a plane going to
the States at that time.

330
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,572
You made up that past.

331
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,910
You did so to hide your ambition.

332
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,578
No.

333
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:10,417
That's a lie my dad and brother
spread to the press to hide their crimes.

334
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,882
Don't tell me

335
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,552
you actually believe the past

336
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,180
you made up.

337
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,313
Detective Oh Ji-hyeok.

338
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,440
I'd like for you to leave now.

339
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,611
I know what you think of me now.
So just get out of here.

340
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,117
Mark my words.

341
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,622
You attacked me first.

342
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,236
Mark my words.

343
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,700
You attacked me first.

344
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,496
"You attacked me first."

345
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,418
So?

346
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,343
Is that why?

347
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,700
Open the door.

348
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,455
Stop playing tricks and open the door!

349
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,542
I know why you're doing this.

350
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,338
I know you're after our money!

351
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,924
You'll never get it.

352
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,843
Never! I know you're in there.
Open the door!

353
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,512
Open it!

354
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,726
Mom.

355
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,148
Na-na.

356
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,027
Do you want to join me?

357
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,742
What do you say?

358
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,964
No, I wasn't here.

359
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,097
I wasn't here.

360
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,439
I wasn't here.

361
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,988
You've been convicted five times. Five.

362
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,658
I've cleaned my act up.

363
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,827
I started a new life
as a business owner now.

364
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,871
Why the fake license plate then?

365
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,208
I did that to save on taxes.

366
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,500
So why did you run?

367
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,671
He's a con
who swindles car insurance companies.

368
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,466
I bet he was working on another scheme
with this car.

369
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,759
Isn't that right?

370
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,386
Did you approach my sister on purpose

371
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,597
because you knew I was a detective?

372
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,224
That's insane.

373
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,310
I just stepped on a bomb.

374
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,020
What did you just say, punk?

375
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,565
-A bomb?
-It's fine as long as he didn't know.

376
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,151
You better not see my sister again.

377
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,487
If she finds out about you,

378
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,074
she'll kill you herself, not me.

379
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,660
Eun-hui is
a national gold medalist in judo.

380
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,579
She can throw punks like you in the air
with one hand, got it?

381
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,916
Really? I had no idea.

382
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,751
She looked very weak.

383
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,381
Eun-hui seemed weak in your eyes?

384
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,051
Yes. I honestly had no ulterior motive.

385
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,511
She looked lonely.

386
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,514
I just wanted to comfort her.

387
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,769
Investigate this punk.

388
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,399
Let's use this opportunity to bust
all the fake license plate businesses

389
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,650
that he's affiliated with.

390
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,068
-Okay.
-I'm going home.

391
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,945
-All right, good night.
-Bye.

392
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,781
Where'd you get the car?

393
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,701
I'm sure you didn't steal it yourself.

394
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,869
I seriously have no clue.

395
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,038
I bought it online.

396
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,498
Hey.

397
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,376
Should I take over
and force your mouth open?

398
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,254
No thank you, sir. I'll talk.

399
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,433
-Did you eat?
-I'm not hungry.

400
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,979
Why didn't you eat until now?

401
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,107
I brought some leftover chicken.
Do you want it?

402
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,821
I arrested that punk.

403
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,657
Who?

404
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,161
The guy you're seeing.
The one who kissed you on the forehead.

405
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,166
Why?

406
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,710
He's a con man with a fake license plate.

407
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,880
Can you be more cautious about
who you date?

408
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,382
Why do you always date such lowlifes?

409
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,635
Are you certain?

410
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,346
He's been convicted five times.

411
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,974
That darn bastard.

412
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,650
I get that you want to date
but isn't it too soon?

413
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,527
Your divorce wasn't too long ago.

414
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,407
I was lonely, okay?

415
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,994
I can't pine for a man?

416
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,790
Must I live as your caretaker forever?

417
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,792
I never asked you to do that.

418
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,337
I'm begging you.

419
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,255
Find a girl.

420
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,841
Let me live my life.

421
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,802
Don't you feel sorry

422
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,971
for our lives?

423
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,311
Welcome home, Uncle.

424
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,730
Hi, Jae-ung. You weren't sleeping?

425
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,194
Why are you drinking again, Mom?

426
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,113
Did you play games in the bathroom again?

427
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,825
Didn't I tell you to play games
for only an hour a day?

428
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,828
Why are you letting it out on the kid?

429
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,622
Let's go out and eat something yummy.

430
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:32,293
Jae-ung is my son. Why are you butting in?

431
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,629
Just mind your own business, Do-chang.

432
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,550
Stop trying to fend for everyone. Please!

433
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,886
Let's head out.
Your mom's in a bad mood today.

434
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,389
Cut back on your gaming.

435
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,016
Your mom allowed you an hour a day.

436
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,231
Is it uncomfortable living with me,
Jae-ung?

437
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,567
It's not, but…

438
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,777
But?

439
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:03,032
Mom said she feels sorry for you.

440
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,035
She said you'll never marry because of us.

441
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,788
Why not?

442
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,458
I'm popular with the ladies.

443
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,210
I'm single by choice.

444
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,628
But…

445
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,468
Mom said you'll only get older and uglier.

446
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,680
And that it's the same for her too.

447
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,603
Right, I never thought about that.

448
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,357
It's because I'm dumb.

449
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,567
What the hell?

450
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,154
-It's 132N1193.
-It's me.

451
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,949
-Can you run this plate?
-There's a car parked out front.

452
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,700
-Okay.
-Hurry on out.

453
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,619
It was stolen yesterday.

454
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,498
Hey, Ji-hyeok. Go and see
how many guys they have.

455
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,459
Okay.

456
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,419
It's not your car?

457
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,797
Gosh, my apologies.

458
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,841
-Come on.
-Is this your car?

459
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,467
-Yes, I'm sorry.
-Just move it.

460
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,593
Okay.

461
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,847
What are you doing? Move the car.

462
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,391
What's his deal?

463
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,060
Why aren't you moving it over?

464
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,984
Hey, run!

465
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,361
Don't move!

466
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,050
Get in.

467
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,303
Do-chang.

468
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,556
Come see this.

469
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,892
Why? What is it?

470
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,810
What's up?

471
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,148
I was looking for traces of
the engine's serial number

472
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,150
but I found something strange.

473
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,320
Isn't this a tracker?

474
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,905
Yes, it's a GPS tracker.

475
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,243
Gosh, I drank too much last night.

476
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,369
Yes.

477
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,663
It's fine.

478
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,291
Everything's going well?

479
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,460
Okay.

480
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,464
Just send it to another team.

481
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,968
I'll personally go talk to
their Captain myself. Okay.

482
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,974
TRUNK IS OPENED

483
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,482
What's going on?

484
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,917
Darn it.

485
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,797
I persuaded a few more owners
of the borrowed-name accounts.

486
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,257
So I had that money delivered to you.

487
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,218
You said you'll send it to my account.

488
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,428
There's a risk of it being tracked.

489
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,514
Dispersing it would minimize the risk, no?

490
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,557
But it would've been caught on camera.

491
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,518
If this comes to light,

492
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,020
the footage will be used
as evidence of bribery--

493
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,566
It was on purpose?

494
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,402
Did Mr. Choi tell you

495
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,445
what deal he made with me?

496
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,157
No, I just trust him and do as he says.

497
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,492
I don't know any details.

498
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,828
He said he'll be my hands and feet.

499
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,288
But he's tied up right now.

500
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,959
Someone will have to fill in for him
for the deal to stay valid, right?

501
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,088
I will do it then.

502
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,259
You're a quick thinker.

503
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,846
I will decide
how to deliver your payments now.

504
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,931
I'll use methods

505
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,058
that only you and I will know.

506
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,394
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,647
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

508
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,779
-Gi Dong-jae?
-It was taken the day he was released.

509
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,950
Three hours later, the same car was filmed
coming from the opposite direction.

510
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,619
Who is that?

511
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,913
Remember Gu Jae-chun?
The boss of Gangnam East Gang.

512
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,498
He's one of Gu's lackeys.

513
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,793
According to the guys we just arrested,
he sold them the car.

514
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,171
So Gi Dong-jae drove the car first

515
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,548
and one of the East Gang members
drove it back?

516
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,550
They killed Gi but took the car.

517
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,011
Trashing the car seemed like a waste
so they sold it.

518
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,764
Gangnam East Gang's Gu Jae-chun
killed Gi Dong-jae,

519
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,515
to avenge the murdered Cho Sang-pil.

520
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,476
I get why he killed Gi.

521
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,812
But there was no reason for him
to voluntarily go see Gu Chae-jun.

522
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,940
Someone handed Gi Dong-jae to Gu Jae-chun.

523
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,359
-Who?
-There was a GPS tracker

524
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,320
in the car Gu Jae-chun was driving.

525
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,946
We analyzed the data

526
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,325
and saw there was a route towards
the detention center Gi was at.

527
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,120
I searched the CCTVs around the area
and found this.

528
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,247
I see.

529
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,167
So Gi Dong-jae received the car here.

530
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,294
The person who gave him the car…

531
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,049
was Jang Gi-jin.

532
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,387
Jang Gi-jin, Captain of
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division?

533
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,141
He put a tracker in the car
and gave it to Gi Dong-jae.

534
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,645
Then he told Gu Jae-chun his location

535
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,438
and had him kill Gi Dong-jae.

536
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,856
Gu was the executioner,

537
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,234
but Jang Gi-jin is the true culprit
behind Gi's murder.

538
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,078
I'm afraid surgery is your only option.

539
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,582
You should've gotten surgery
the last time you were admitted.

540
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,459
It's worsening.

541
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,464
I can't get surgery right now.

542
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,802
I have some unfinished business.

543
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,682
What is this?

544
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,183
Thank you for your hard work.

545
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,812
Treat yourself to a meal
with your fellow detectives.

546
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,273
Absolutely not.
It's illegal to accept this.

547
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,692
Not to mention
I have no right to take this

548
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,777
after all the heartache I caused you.

549
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,946
If you don't take it, I'll owe you a debt.

550
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,323
I'll die a debtor.

551
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,993
I'm giving you this to ease my conscience.

552
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:08,040
Okay, thank you. I'll use it for good.

553
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,589
Did the shoes I gave you not fit well?

554
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,176
Detectives don't wear dress shoes often.

555
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,136
We have to run to catch culprits.

556
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,431
Right, that makes sense.
I didn't think about that.

557
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,144
But I wear them when I'm off duty.

558
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,646
People keep saying I look like a chairman

559
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,482
of a big company whenever I wear them.

560
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,693
I'm glad to hear that.

561
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,157
So Detective Kang,

562
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,827
about my granddaughter's death.

563
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,247
It has nothing to do
with Director Cheon, right?

564
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,875
Do you mean Director Cheon Na-na?

565
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,043
Yes, her.

566
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,046
According to our investigation,
it doesn't.

567
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,549
On the contrary, she helped us.

568
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,595
If it weren't for her,
Cheon Sang-woo would be a free man.

569
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,139
I see. That's a relief then.

570
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:10,394
So the fact that Cheon Sang-woo
ordered Hui-ju to be murdered

571
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,357
and that it was Gi Dong-jae who killed her

572
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,525
doesn't change, right?

573
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,693
That's correct, sir.

574
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,862
-Please excuse me.
-Sure.

575
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,493
Yes. Did you get him?

576
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,287
Okay, I'll be right in. Wait for me.

577
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,165
Goodness, I know you're a busy man

578
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,961
but I kept you away for too long again.

579
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,128
Hurry back to work.

580
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,674
Okay, I'll get going then. Thank you.

581
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,851
Sir.

582
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,522
I'll come by your store
with fried chicken.

583
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,277
I'll tell you a lot of fun stories again
over some drinks.

584
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,530
Thank you. I mean it.

585
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,657
Goodbye then.

586
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,294
Okay, I'm going.

587
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,725
Why did you drive

588
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,477
Gi Dong-jae's car back?

589
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,856
Then Gi Dong-jae vanished completely.

590
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,692
Did you kill him?

591
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,027
That's ridiculous.

592
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,154
Why would I kill Dong-jae?

593
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,573
If you didn't, I'm sure someone else did.

594
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,325
Tell me who killed him.

595
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,577
I don't know.

596
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,246
Then why did you drive his car back?

597
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,000
That's because Dong-jae gave it to me.

598
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,795
He asked me to sell it for him
so that's what I did.

599
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,216
Just recently you guys were planning on
catching Gi to kill him.

600
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,343
But you're saying

601
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,763
he asked the guys that were plotting
to kill him to sell his car?

602
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,139
How does that make sense?

603
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,225
It was Jae-chun, right?

604
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,188
He told you to kill Gi Dong-jae
and get rid of his car.

605
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,773
But it was a waste to trash it.

606
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,902
So you sold it to those crooks
to earn some pocket money.

607
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,321
Fine, I'll admit that I sold the car.

608
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,949
But I don't know anything else.

609
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,618
Be smart about this.

610
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,081
Your flawed loyalty might lead you
to take the fall for everything.

611
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,041
Why don't you think carefully and tell us

612
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,335
where you were,
what you did, and who you met

613
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,670
the day you were caught on camera?

614
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,631
If we detect a lie, we'll look into it.

615
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,093
Did you find Dong-jae's body?

616
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,264
You're not even sure if he's dead, right?

617
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,893
It's clear that he killed Gi Dong-jae.

618
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,895
Why else would he ask about his body?

619
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,355
It's because he's guilty.

620
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,692
But you know very well how hard it is
to prove a crime without a body.

621
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,862
This may as well end with us
working our butts off for nothing.

622
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,906
But his motive for murder is clear.

623
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,283
It's unacceptable
that we do nothing about it.

624
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,577
Gi Dong-jae is a murderer,

625
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,123
but his family still deserves to know why

626
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,625
and how he died.

627
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,420
Gosh…

628
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,671
We need to find out

629
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,466
why Jang Gi-jin led Gi Dong-jae
to Gu Jae-chun.

630
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,385
It was before Cheon Sang-woo's trial,

631
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,095
so it was probably to protect him.

632
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,055
That's not the only reason Gi died.

633
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,725
The day Woo Tae-ho died,
he met Gi Dong-jae.

634
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,020
I think he pegged Cheon Sang-woo
as the culprit until then.

635
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,858
But for some reason after meeting Gi,
he meets with Cheon Na-na.

636
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,153
Then he called us
and said he had something to tell us.

637
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,240
Then he got into an accident.

638
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,993
What in the world
did Gi Dong-jae tell him?

639
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,579
What led him to act that way?

640
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,080
Isn't it obvious?

641
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,624
What else would Gi Dong-jae
have said to him besides,

642
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,543
"I didn't kill her"?

643
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,962
Exactly.

644
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,841
"I didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.
Someone else is the culprit."

645
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,177
Gi Dong-jae died

646
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,262
because he told Woo Tae-ho
about the killer.

647
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,115
Excuse me.

648
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,241
Yes, welcome.

649
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,704
We're from Incheon Seobu Station's
Violent Crimes Unit.

650
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,956
What's the issue?

651
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,542
You're Gi Dong-jae's older brother, right?

652
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,252
Yes.

653
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,837
Are you in contact with him?

654
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,423
You know he's dead.

655
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,509
Then when was the last time you saw him?

656
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,011
I never saw that punk.

657
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,765
I briefly saw him ten years ago

658
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,809
at our father's memorial service.

659
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,062
You never even talked on the phone?

660
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,356
Why would I pick up a murderer's call?

661
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,485
We also think Gi Dong-jae is dead
just like you mentioned.

662
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:13,197
But don't you think
at least his body should be found?

663
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,367
Please tell us anything
that could help with the search.

664
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,328
That way, we can quickly find the culprit
who killed him--

665
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,038
Don't find his killer.

666
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,874
Or his body either.

667
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,335
I beg you.

668
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,380
Sir--

669
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,633
He won't talk, just let him be.

670
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,849
I'll leave my business card here.

671
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,935
Give me a call if you remember anything.

672
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,569
I'm a little confused.

673
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,072
Who are we doing this for?

674
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,242
We need to reveal the truth.

675
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,286
We must dig up the hidden truth.

676
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,829
But it has been revealed.

677
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,331
Cheon Sang-woo is the culprit.
He's the killer.

678
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,293
It doesn't matter who killed him.
Nothing changes.

679
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,968
Don't tell me you think
it wasn't Gi who killed Jung Hui-ju.

680
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,139
Let's be cautious.

681
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,685
If your theory that Gi Dong-jae
didn't kill Jung Hui-ju is true

682
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,770
and we find proof of it,

683
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,648
that makes Cheon Sang-woo innocent.

684
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,616
Let's take those off and try these on.

685
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,576
Try it on.

686
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,536
Does it fit?

687
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,705
Yes, it does.

688
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,875
How'd you know his shoe size?

689
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,754
He can tell a person's shoe size
by taking one glance at their feet.

690
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:56,383
My gosh. Is that true?

691
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,303
Yes, because I make shoes for a living.

692
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,930
Then would you mind guessing

693
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,392
my shoe size?

694
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,435
Let me see.

695
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,773
Why don't you try this on then?

696
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,276
Gosh, are you serious? Okay.

697
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,529
-I'll try it on then.
-All right.

698
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,865
I wonder if it'll fit.

699
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,245
My gosh, no way. It fits perfectly.

700
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,247
Goodness, that's unbelievable.

701
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,458
It slipped right on, sir.

702
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,919
Thank you so much.

703
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,629
It's so pretty.

704
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,342
Jae-ung, get up and thank him.

705
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,469
Thank you, sir.

706
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:44,223
You're welcome. Be a good boy, okay?

707
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,809
If you're a bad boy to your mom

708
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,270
these shoes will shrink and hurt you.

709
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,856
What? Really?

710
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,566
These are magic shoes.

711
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,069
Only good kids can wear them.

712
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,239
Did you hear that?
You have to be a good boy.

713
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:05,035
Or else those shoes
will scrape your heels, got it?

714
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,663
Okay.

715
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,125
I can't thank you enough.

716
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:15,587
Don't mention it.
This was the least I could do for you.

717
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,465
You always gave me free chicken.

718
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,677
You have no idea
how much that meant to me.

719
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,138
Gosh, that was no big deal.

720
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,516
I should get going.

721
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,353
Let me know if the shoes hurt.

722
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,689
You can't just leave.

723
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,483
Eun-hye, make sure he doesn't leave.
Keep him there, okay?

724
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,360
-Okay.
- Wait, where are you going?

725
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,320
Goodness.

726
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,035
Enjoy this chicken first.

727
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,079
I'll go cook up more delicious food.

728
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,205
All right.

729
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,877
Welcome. Table for how many?

730
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,128
Two more will join us.

731
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,838
Okay. You can sit over there.

732
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,427
Gosh.

733
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,055
Why do the detectives
want to see us again?

734
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,515
It's about Dong-jae again.

735
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,518
Regarding the death of that girl,
Jung Hui-ju?

736
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,645
That case is closed though.

737
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,315
Dong-jae didn't kill her.

738
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,441
What?

739
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,902
He drunkenly confessed everything to me.

740
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,445
He didn't kill her.

741
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,323
He just helped clean her body up.

742
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,616
Shit.

743
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,951
What if he's saying that to save himself?

744
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,786
No, he said he has proof.

745
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,289
He left it with his brother.

746
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,460
He said he'll be cleared of his charges
once he reveals everything.

747
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,088
Anyway, don't tell the detectives
what I just told you.

748
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,758
Dong-jae's already dead.
It doesn't matter now.

749
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,801
We'll just get dragged into it.

750
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,386
Hello.

751
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,263
-Welcome.
-Hi Eun-hui.

752
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,681
It's just you two?

753
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,141
No, we're with them.

754
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,018
-I see. Okay.
-All right.

755
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,356
It's been a while.

756
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,358
Have you been well?

757
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,276
Did you miss us?

758
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,569
Why did you call me again?

759
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,614
We're best friends. No reason is needed.

760
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,033
-You lost some weight.
-You're right.

761
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,911
Isn't this nice?

762
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,248
We can talk about Gi Dong-jae
over a few drinks.

763
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,793
He's your boss.
Don't you want to find him?

764
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,004
And also figure out if he's dead or alive?

765
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,508
-You're new.
-I was at the soccer field.

766
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,468
Really? I didn't know.

767
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,887
Hello.

768
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,973
-Gosh, hello.
-Yes, hi.

769
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,810
Excuse me.

770
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:39,189
Is it true that Gi Dong-jae
didn't kill my Hui-ju?

771
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,402
They were just saying
whatever came to mind.

772
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:47,030
But they must have based it off
of something.

773
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,785
We'll ask them to confirm.

774
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,663
Please don't get any other ideas.

775
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,499
We came to that conclusion
after a thorough investigation.

776
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,959
-We had solid evidence.
-Right.

777
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,044
-I saw it at the trial.
-Yes.

778
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,715
But I heard it myself just now.

779
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,258
I'll be honest with you.

780
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,177
If what they're saying is true,
things will be complicated.

781
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,513
It could even lead to
Cheon Sang-woo's release.

782
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,764
That can't happen.

783
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,099
That punk, Cheon Sang-woo

784
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,686
-said to kill Hui-ju. I heard it myself.
-Right.

785
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,771
-That can never happen.
-Exactly.

786
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,778
One of my guys has been arrested by
the cops at Incheon Seobu Station.

787
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,031
They're looking for Gi Dong-jae.

788
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,408
They won't find his body.

789
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,037
But they'll focus their investigation
on us.

790
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,208
We're going up against Oh Ji-hyeok.
He won't stop.

791
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,627
That's your problem.

792
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,048
I have no memory of telling you people
to kill Gi Dong-jae.

793
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,550
You're right.

794
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,305
But we're not the only ones
with motives to kill him.

795
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,141
You needed him dead too.

796
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,313
Gi Dong-jae told me something
before he died.

797
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,650
Please hear me out, Jae-chun!

798
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,611
I hid something.

799
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,572
It could change your life.

800
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:16,161
This better be good, you punk.
Or I'll make sure you die painfully.

801
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,497
Tell me.

802
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,623
Jae-chun.

803
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,461
One of TJ's family members killed someone.

804
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,922
I have evidence to prove it.

805
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,175
So what?

806
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,552
Let me make one phone call to my brother.

807
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,888
He'll bring it over to you.

808
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,100
If you threaten TJ with it,

809
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,061
I guarantee that they'll give you
a ton of money for it.

810
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,900
Call him then.

811
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,004
DONG-JAE

812
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,684
Is he not picking up?

813
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,520
No. Let me try one more time.

814
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,896
Forget it, punk.

815
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,982
You're viler than I thought.

816
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,526
How could you drag your brother in
to save yourself?

817
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,196
You're a scumbag through and through.

818
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,532
Throw this piece of trash away.

819
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,118
Jae-chun.

820
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,162
Jae-chun!

821
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,456
One of the Cheon family members.

822
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,585
That person ordered you
to hand Gi Dong-jae over to us.

823
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,339
Mr. Jang, you're an accomplice.

824
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,847
You're just as foul as Gi Dong-jae.

825
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,359
He's here.

826
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,780
This is where Gi Dong-jae's brother
Gi Dong-su is at.

827
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,822
I see.

828
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,328
Thank you for finding him.

829
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,053
No, he said he has proof.

830
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,056
He left it with his brother.

831
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,267
He said he'll be cleared of his charges
once he reveals everything.

832
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,022
Excuse me.

833
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:49,940
Yes?

834
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,984
What brings you here?

835
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,778
Hello.

836
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,073
I'm Jung Hui-ju's grandpa.

837
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,408
And?

838
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:04,746
I wanted to ask you something.

839
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,623
Are you here for an apology?

840
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,417
My brother committed a grave sin.

841
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,921
I apologize for being related to him.
Is that good enough?

842
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,422
Wait,

843
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,009
I hold no grudges against his family.

844
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,136
Then what do you want?

845
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,764
Did your brother

846
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,017
maybe leave anything with you?

847
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,270
No, he didn't.

848
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,314
I'm not going to use it.

849
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,484
I just want to know.

850
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,696
I'm doing this to find out
who really killed my girl.

851
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,408
That's the only way I can die in peace.

852
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,201
The trial is over.

853
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,371
The police released a statement too.

854
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,582
That bastard, Dong-jae, killed her.

855
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,625
Why are you suddenly doing this to me?

856
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,835
Why…

857
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,630
I don't know why I must be tormented again

858
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,424
because of that vile lowlife.

859
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:03,555
It seems my visit
has caused you pain again.

860
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,640
I forgot it all.

861
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,685
Along with the fact
that he was my brother.

862
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,190
But you're reminding me of him again.

863
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,693
Goodness, I'm truly sorry.

864
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:20,697
I didn't consider
how this would make you feel.

865
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,326
I was too selfish to see that.
I made a mistake.

866
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,369
I'm sorry.

867
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,040
Why are you doing this?

868
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,709
Your granddaughter got justice.

869
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,254
The abettor is behind bars
and Dong-jae is dead.

870
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,174
You can live in peace now.

871
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,927
Why are you tormenting yourself

872
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,970
by filling your mind
with useless thoughts?

873
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,473
I don't want to have any regrets.

874
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,356
"I can die with no regrets now."

875
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,777
I wanted to proudly say that before I die.

876
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,323
All right.

877
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,869
So he didn't leave anything with you?

878
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,830
No, he didn't.

879
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,165
Okay.

880
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,960
I didn't realize

881
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,088
that it's not just
the victim's family that's in pain,

882
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:23,093
but the murderer's family feels pain too.

883
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,013
All right then.

884
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,517
I won't ever come by again.

885
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,878
Dong-jae didn't leave anything with me.

886
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,547
I found what he was hiding

887
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,258
while cleaning out his stuff.

888
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,888
You won't have any regrets
once you open this.

889
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,688
The person who killed your granddaughter

890
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,232
is Dong-jae.

891
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,777
There's no need to question anything now.

892
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,448
Have a safe trip back.

893
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,280
JUNGIN SHOES

894
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,326
Hello.

895
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,996
Goodness. What brings you here?

896
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,123
I have something to tell you.

897
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,755
Gosh, hold on. Give me a second.

898
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,097
We're going to establish

899
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,225
a scholarship foundation
under Ms. Jung's name.

900
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,937
What? Why would you do that?

901
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,482
It's to show that we truly repent
for what happened

902
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,192
and that we'll never forget it.

903
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,945
Do you mean it?

904
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,240
There will be a ceremony
to commemorate it soon.

905
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,660
I came to receive your blessing
before we see to it.

906
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,245
Of course, you have my blessing.

907
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,456
It'll make Hui-ju very happy too.

908
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,500
I'll take that you support it then.

909
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,127
Yes, of course.

910
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:07,048
I had no idea
you cared for Hui-ju this much.

911
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,301
Thank you so much. Truly.

912
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,102
Goodbye.

913
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,492
How can I help you?

914
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,621
Who are you people? What are you doing?

915
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,000
What's the meaning of this?

916
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,210
-What are you doing?
-Close the shop.

917
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,421
What do you want?

918
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,344
What are you doing right now?

919
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,144
Are you Dong-jae's brother?

920
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,190
Answer me, you punk.

921
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,566
What?

922
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,235
You're certain the old man took it?

923
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,448
Okay, give me time to think.

924
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,242
I'll get back to you.

925
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,537
I won't be long.

926
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,181
Thank you.

927
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,019
Did you tell Choi Yong-geun?

928
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,230
Tell what?

929
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,565
That payment
will be delivered differently.

930
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,734
No, not yet.

931
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,946
I guess there's no need.

932
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,242
Is that all you wanted to see me for?

933
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,871
I was curious about something.

934
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,125
The man named Gi Dong-jae
killed Jung Hui-ju, right?

935
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:08,920
Yes.

936
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,716
Did they find the clothes she was wearing

937
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,261
when Gi Dong-jae killed her?

938
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,680
No.

939
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,766
Then why does Jung Hui-ju's grandpa
have it?

940
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,231
How did you know that?

941
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,108
I only just learned about it too.

942
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,778
I saw it myself
at her grandpa's store today.

943
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,782
How did you know
the clothes belonged to Jung Hui-ju?

944
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,204
I met her the day she was murdered.

945
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,582
It was the same clothes she was wearing.

946
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,834
You met Jung Hui-ju that day?

947
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,212
Is it strange that I met with an employee?

948
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,672
No, it's not.

949
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,676
So what are you curious about?

950
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,847
Honestly, I'm a little worried.

951
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,933
What if the verdict gets overturned

952
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,561
because of the additional evidence?

953
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,648
I'm hoping the results don't change.

954
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,568
The fact that Mr. Jung
still has the evidence

955
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,654
means the detectives are unaware of it.

956
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,325
My hope is that
it never gets handed over to them.

957
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:25,163
Who knows what Cheon Sang-woo
will do with that evidence.

958
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,875
If he gets released,

959
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,544
I don't know what he'll do to me.

960
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,422
He'll probably try to kill me.

961
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,258
No, I know I will die.

962
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:43,431
Get rid of that evidence.
Don't leave a single trace behind.

963
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,102
Yes, ma'am. I'll try.

964
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,527
Starting today, you'll be my savior.

965
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,370
Have you ever

966
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,206
killed someone before?

967
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,003
-Pardon?
-Detectives kill people too.

968
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,298
I just asked out of curiosity.

969
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,637
Killing a person
is not any easier for a detective.

970
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,139
I never killed anyone.

971
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,266
Not yet.

972
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,324
You said I'm an accomplice, right?

973
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,992
I was being figurative.

974
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,161
I was simply asking for your help.

975
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,621
Since we got on the same boat.

976
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,335
That's your perspective.

977
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,713
My perspective is that
I let you on the boat

978
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,507
that I'm the captain of. Got it?

979
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,467
Yes, that makes sense.

980
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,594
You're right.

981
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,683
Then do as I command. You hear me?

982
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,576
EUN-HYE

983
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,622
POWER OFF

984
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,999
We have no proof
Gi Dong-jae is not the culprit.

985
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,461
But we also don't have proof
that he killed her.

986
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,215
This was taken
on his way to the murder scene.

987
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,092
Jung Hui-ju isn't there.

988
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,470
So he was driving with her corpse.

989
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,932
That means he didn't kill her
at the place he dumped her body.

990
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:32,892
Take a look at this.

991
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,145
Choi Yong-geun
asks Gi where he is and then says,

992
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,730
"What about her corpse?"

993
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,399
He knew she was dead by then.

994
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,653
He didn't even ask how he killed her.

995
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,031
If we just base everything
on this recording,

996
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,742
we could say Gi's only crime was
that he abandoned her body

997
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,620
and staged it to look like
she was killed by the serial killer.

998
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,915
So it's possible that
someone else killed Jung Hui-ju

999
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,795
and Gi Dong-jae only got rid of the body?

1000
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,879
Yes.

1001
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,561
This is Oh Ji-hyeok
from Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

1002
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:01,230
Jung Hui-ju's grandpa is in danger.

1003
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,858
POLICE FOR THE PEOPLE JUSTICE IN KOREA

1004
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,652
INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION

1005
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,112
You can't reach Mr. Jung?

1006
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,655
No, he's not picking up.

1007
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,449
Is his phone being tracked?

1008
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:12,408
Yes.

1009
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,469
Let's go.

1010
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,449
Mr. Jung. Are you there?

1011
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,452
Mr. Jung?

1012
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,208
Are you inside?

1013
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,222
MR. JUNG

1014
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:01,308
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO, EUN-HYE.
I'M GOING TO SEE HUI-JU. BE HAPPY.

1015
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,441
Do-chang, we got a signal on his phone.

1016
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,525
Where is he?

1017
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,326
Mr. Jung…

1018
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,795
You forced our hands.

1019
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,339
-Gosh.
-What?

1020
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,385
Darn it.

1021
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,430
Don't make it hard.

1022
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,018
Hang in there.

1023
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,979
You'll see your granddaughter soon.

1024
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,228
Why did they hurt him like this?

1025
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,938
He's no longer a cop

1026
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:30,314
but a criminal.

1027
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:33,484
To a place where you're invisible,
where I can't see you,

1028
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,777
that's where you should go.

1029
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,446
So who handed over the corpse to you?

1030
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,656
Woo Tae-ho.

1031
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,658
There's only one reason
for a detective to go to the NFS.

1032
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,160
The blood isn't from one person.

1033
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,787
If there is a problem later,

1034
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,331
he's trying to frame you
for concealment of evidence.

1035
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:50,167
If you stop now, nothing will happen.

1036
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,253
Would the killer stop too?

1037
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,505
If I were the killer, I would.

1038
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:02,096
