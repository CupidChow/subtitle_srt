00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,463
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,363
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,022
Open it.

4
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,978
This is Oh Ji-hyeok
with Incheon Seobu Police.

5
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,359
No one's here.

6
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,444
I think he was here a while ago though.

7
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,946
Still not answering the phone?

8
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,116
I think it was left behind.
It's turned off.

9
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,617
Damn it.

10
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,372
That bus just passed through a toll.

11
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,249
-Which one?
-Near Ganghwa Island.

12
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,167
Let's go.

13
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,324
He left his phone behind

14
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,035
so he wouldn't be tracked.

15
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,330
He's definitely committing another crime.

16
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,457
The bus went through the toll gate
30 minutes ago.

17
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,083
We have an hour at most.

18
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,710
It's him, right?

19
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,046
The bus driver who said
he saw the black backpack.

20
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,173
-Yes.
-I wonder…

21
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,092
why he exposed himself unnecessarily.

22
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,428
He knew we were looking
for the bag's owner.

23
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,388
He was trying to lead us to Choi Ho-jun.

24
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,974
He used the same bag as Choi Ho-jun
in the crime,

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,476
just in case the worst happens.

26
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,086
Don't come in.

27
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,462
Wait outside.

28
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,764
Please, sir.

29
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,934
I am so sorry.

30
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,146
I was too drunk at the time.

31
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,483
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

32
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,030
Please don't kill me.

33
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,665
Get up.

34
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,837
Why are you wearing different lipstick?

35
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,299
I like the red one
you were wearing the other night.

36
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,227
Don't let anyone in
until the forensics comes.

37
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,687
Yes, sir.

38
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,147
Was there anything inside?

39
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,150
Only a few small bloodstains on the floor.

40
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,693
The victim didn't die here.

41
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,696
-Did you call for backup?
-Yes. They'll be here soon.

42
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,991
He left the bus recently.

43
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,576
Let's go before it's too late.

44
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,958
Let's split up here.

45
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,085
Wait.

46
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,422
Be careful. He has a weapon.

47
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,883
The two of us will go this way.
You guys go that way.

48
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,885
-We will.
-Be careful, sir.

49
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,316
Please…

50
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,237
Don't be afraid.

51
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,281
Nothing will happen to you
if you do as I say.

52
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,034
I really am sorry.

53
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,411
Please forgive me.

54
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,958
I'm glad you apologized.

55
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,167
Then…

56
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,671
will you let me go?

57
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,424
I will.

58
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,717
Really?

59
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,305
Thank you.

60
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,517
I am truly sorry for what I did.

61
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,853
I regret every minute of it.

62
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,690
I swear I won't call the police.

63
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,485
Please, let me live.

64
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,823
Stand up, then.

65
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,032
What?

66
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,411
I said stand up. Don't make me mad.

67
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,919
-Turn around.
-What?

68
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,549
Turn around
and tell me what you're sorry about.

69
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,968
If it feels sincere,

70
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,761
I will quietly turn around and leave.

71
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,768
So,

72
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,979
tell me what you did wrong.

73
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,815
Don't ever turn your head around. Begin.

74
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,321
I acted unreasonably.

75
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,741
I pressed the bell too late,

76
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,368
but I blamed it on you.

77
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,538
You stopped the bus for me,
but I refused to get off.

78
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,584
I am so sorry for being rude to you.

79
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,048
What else?

80
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,926
What else?

81
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,678
Tell me how you wasted your life.

82
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,680
Yes.

83
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,518
I was selfish, and I hurt other people.

84
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,481
I will never look down on anyone.

85
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,275
I will be good from now on.

86
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
Please…

87
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,073
Please don't kill me.

88
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,558
Let's go!

89
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,814
This way.

90
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,734
Move quickly.

91
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,653
Move!

92
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,781
-Split up.
-Hurry!

93
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,534
Watch your feet.

94
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,853
Save me.

95
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,397
Help!

96
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,902
Be quiet.

97
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,864
I said shut up!

98
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,544
I should finish what I started.

99
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,300
Lee Seong-gon!

100
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,184
-Do-chang!
-Ma'am.

101
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,602
Are you okay?

102
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,274
-How is she?
-She's still alive.

103
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,485
Take her down right away.

104
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,527
I will.

105
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,657
We found the victim,
and the killer is on the run.

106
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,116
Seal off the mountain

107
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,118
and send in all available men.

108
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,996
Keep searching!

109
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,291
Hold the flashlights high.

110
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,168
Search behind every rock.

111
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,961
Look closely.

112
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,444
Let's go this way.

113
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,696
Jae-hong.

114
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,284
Where?

115
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,788
Who are you?

116
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,126
Come out.

117
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,757
-Who are you?
-Hands up.

118
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,177
What's going on?

119
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,596
Stop and put your hands up, bastard!

120
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,267
"Stop and put your hands up, bastard!"

121
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,936
You crazy bastard.

122
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,230
Okay.

123
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,733
What is the matter?

124
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,818
-I didn't--
-You bastard.

125
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,406
I didn't do anything wrong.

126
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,949
I am innocent.

127
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,744
We have Lee Seong-gon.

128
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,039
-They are coming.
-Get out of the way.

129
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,708
Roll the camera!

130
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,877
Hurry up!

131
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,504
Let us through.

132
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,005
-Get out.
-He's coming out.

133
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,423
-He's coming out!
-He's coming out!

134
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,883
He's coming.

135
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,843
-Let's go.
-Are you the killer?

136
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,762
-Hello.
-Will there be a briefing?

137
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,556
How is he related to the other incidents?

138
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,809
-Tell us why you did it.
-Are you the killer?

139
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,020
Say something.

140
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,823
Lee Seong-gon.

141
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,708
Stop playing tricks. You're sober.

142
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,796
I'm sober.

143
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,798
Are you doing this on purpose?

144
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,097
Where am I?

145
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,890
This isn't my house.

146
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,144
Who are you?

147
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,396
Don't you remember me?

148
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,900
I think I've seen you guys somewhere…

149
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,448
Wake up.

150
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,617
That's cold.

151
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,787
Lee Seong-gon.

152
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,831
Stop putting on a show.

153
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,126
You kidnapped a woman on your bus
and drove to a mountain.

154
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,545
And you ran from us in the mountain.

155
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,007
You couldn't do that
unless you were sober.

156
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,884
Stop playing around.

157
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,678
It seems like…

158
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,850
I did something wrong.

159
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,647
Can you tell me what I did wrong?

160
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,360
You bastard.

161
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,949
It's positive.

162
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,576
He did drugs.

163
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,744
DOA TEST RESULTS

164
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,250
I remember.

165
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,587
It must be because of that girl.

166
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,214
Don't believe what she tells you.

167
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,718
I'm here like this because of her.

168
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,803
To extort money from me.

169
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,140
It's because I look naive.

170
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,559
She's pretending to be the victim.

171
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,229
It's not the first time I got tricked
by conniving foxes.

172
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,442
You scumbag.

173
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,946
Think about
the innocent women you've killed.

174
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,864
How can you say that about them?

175
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,991
You piece of trash.

176
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,743
Easy, Do-chang.

177
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,495
You could get in trouble later.

178
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,163
What about it?

179
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,374
What's wrong with
treating trash like trash?

180
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,584
Why should I treat this scum as a human?

181
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,712
Jae-hong is right.

182
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,132
He's calculating every single move.

183
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,843
He's going to claim

184
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,513
that he was forced to confess
during his insanity.

185
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,268
Let's take our time.

186
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,105
We should…

187
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,233
take our sweet time.

188
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,660
POLICE

189
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,430
Damn it.

190
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,599
That damn detective.

191
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,854
How dare he mess with me?

192
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,733
Damn it.

193
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,780
He's only a lowly street cop.

194
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,241
Damn it.

195
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,745
Damn it.

196
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,255
Damn it!

197
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm Lee Seong-gon!

198
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,142
I'm Lee Seong-gon, you bastards!

199
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,237
Can you make me some coffee?

200
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,918
Do you feel better?

201
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes.

202
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,798
What was wrong?

203
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,509
I was just sick.

204
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,804
What exactly was wrong?

205
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,388
I'm always sick.

206
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,852
Can I not even worry about you?

207
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,522
You know I'm stressed these days.

208
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,234
Why did you meet with Michael Cha?

209
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,153
No special reason.
We didn't talk about anything important.

210
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,948
We just talked about
our days at university.

211
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,954
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

212
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,166
He's the CEO of McQueen Korea.
We have a lot of business with them.

213
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,877
He's just a university friend to me.

214
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,214
The timing is tricky.
You should be careful.

215
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,091
Why should I be careful?

216
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,801
Does someone suspect me?

217
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,680
Is it Sang-woo?

218
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,892
I waited for you all night.

219
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,936
I waited until the morning and called you.

220
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,772
"I'm sick. I can't come in today."

221
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,607
That's all you said.

222
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,484
You told me to wait.

223
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,738
But you showed up two days later.

224
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,907
I deserve an explanation.

225
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,411
It's Sang-woo, isn't it?

226
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,205
Did he tell you to spy on me?

227
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,707
I'm asking you.

228
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,002
Any excuse will do.
Tell me something I can understand.

229
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,505
I'm asking you,

230
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,967
did Sang-woo tell you to spy on me?

231
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,221
No.

232
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,773
He never trusted me.

233
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,568
Even when I was little,
sitting at a table with a fork.

234
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,946
He thought I would kill him with it.

235
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,573
Just because

236
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,368
we had different mothers.

237
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,787
Forget about the past.

238
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,374
It's a critical time.
We have to work together.

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,877
Do you know why

240
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,172
I fled to the States in middle school?

241
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,180
He came to my room every night
and strangled me.

242
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,559
I fled because I feared for my life.

243
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,778
Who could I tell this to in this family?

244
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,823
I can only tell you.

245
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,953
Thanks for the coffee.

246
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,166
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

247
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,296
I was suddenly sick, so I couldn't.

248
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,513
It's a shame that Jung Hui-ju died.

249
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,934
She was a bright and capable girl.

250
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,188
I'm sure you miss her more.

251
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,575
LEGAL TEAM DIRECTOR WOO TAE-HO

252
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,829
She was a bright and capable girl.

253
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,375
I'm sure you miss her more.

254
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,922
Mr. Woo.

255
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,052
Did you get rid of the laptop?

256
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,346
Yes.

257
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,141
I drove out to Han River
and threw it in the water.

258
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,518
Good.

259
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,397
You must not tell anyone about this.

260
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,858
This is just between you and me.

261
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,735
I understand.

262
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,906
I'm sorry I asked you to do this.

263
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,576
Shall we have dinner together?

264
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,869
No, thank you.

265
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,748
I have plans today.

266
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,083
Okay. You may go.

267
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,171
Why did you ask me to do
such an important job?

268
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,133
Because I trust you.

269
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,270
Yes, Mr. Cheon.

270
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,981
I will be right up.

271
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,836
Did you check what Na-na was up to?

272
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,883
She was sick.
She couldn't think about other things.

273
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,969
Says Na-na or says you?

274
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,304
Na-na?

275
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,225
Did Na-na tell you that?

276
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,645
She didn't have to say it.
I'm always watching her.

277
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,731
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I am sure.

278
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,658
Do you really think
you can read Na-na's mind?

279
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,080
Let me tell you about Na-na.

280
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,000
She doesn't even know she's lying.

281
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,630
She believes her own lies.

282
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,175
I didn't know that when I was young.

283
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,928
Whenever I tried to ask her,

284
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,472
I was yelled at
for pestering a sick sister.

285
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,353
Don't believe what she says.

286
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,482
Look at where she goes.

287
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,027
That's what Na-na is thinking about.

288
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,710
Come in.

289
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,925
Welcome.

290
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,844
Do you want coffee?

291
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,807
Thank you.

292
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,277
I wonder if you remember,

293
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,404
it was about two years ago.

294
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,240
My brother was in trouble.

295
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,618
And a detective visited Tae-ho.

296
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,162
Do you know who that was?

297
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,706
Yes, he was with my division.

298
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,084
It's probably who I think it is.

299
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,254
I remember him
because he was good-looking for a cop.

300
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,508
Why is he sniffing around me?

301
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,178
Is he trying to find something about me?

302
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,388
I'll look into it.

303
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,599
Even if he questions me,
I have nothing to say.

304
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,018
But it does bother me.

305
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,188
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

306
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,402
It's a card we must hold onto
until the end

307
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,030
if you want to get what you want.

308
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,118
We can't show it to anyone.
Do you know what I mean?

309
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,536
I do.

310
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,124
Isn't it pretty?

311
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,380
My father bought it for me from Japan.

312
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,342
I don't use it for just anyone.

313
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,262
As you know,

314
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,556
our legal team
takes care of all corporate litigation.

315
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,935
The other important task is

316
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,937
to protect the privacy of the head family.

317
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,356
-I see.
-As it happens,

318
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,651
we have something only you can do.

319
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,154
I still haven't learned everything.

320
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,072
That's fine.

321
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,285
It will be your first job
after the internship.

322
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:23,039
How well you do this job
will let us know how valuable you are.

323
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,003
I don't know if they told you,

324
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,589
but your official transfer
to the legal team is still pending.

325
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,343
They haven't signed off on it yet.

326
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,723
I would be happy to do the job.

327
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,182
I will do my best.

328
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,309
Great.

329
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,353
Don't worry, it's a simple job.

330
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,396
Okay.

331
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,608
The police are still looking for evidence
left behind by the killer.

332
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,901
According to sources,

333
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,945
the suspect tried the same method

334
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,947
as the White Gown Serial Killer.

335
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,993
But there is no official information

336
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,746
on whether it is a copycat crime.

337
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,294
Are you sober now?

338
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,257
Why did you do it?

339
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,052
Why did you brutally kill those women?

340
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,470
What is your reason?

341
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,138
What are you talking about?

342
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,182
I never did such a thing.

343
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,933
I saw you in the forest.

344
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,896
I saw you trying to stab the victim
with my own eyes.

345
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,069
I'm sorry, but I don't remember anything.

346
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,072
I admit that I did drugs.

347
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,865
It was so stupid of me.

348
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,826
I was high, so I don't remember anything.

349
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,454
What a shameless bastard.

350
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,249
He says he doesn't remember
headbutting the cell bars.

351
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,793
When did you start taking drugs?

352
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,586
Well,

353
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,089
to be honest,

354
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,674
I couldn't deal with her sober.

355
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,927
Check the bus security footage.

356
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,929
She was out of control.

357
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,807
Other passengers saw it too.

358
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,809
I put up with her,

359
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,687
but others would have just…

360
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,150
When you see the footage,

361
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,654
you'll be as angry as I was.

362
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:22,283
Girls like that need to be
taught a lesson.

363
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,495
That's how they learn from their mistakes.

364
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,540
So you took drugs and kidnapped her,

365
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,292
to teach her a lesson for being unruly?

366
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,961
Yes.

367
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,214
Then why did you put her in a white gown

368
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,341
and put red lipstick on her?

369
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,887
I did that?

370
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,100
I must have been out of my mind.

371
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,352
Why did I do that?

372
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,148
That's right, I saw it in the news.

373
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,860
I thought if I pretended to be like
the serial killer,

374
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,530
she would get scared.

375
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,160
She ran away

376
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,287
because she thought I would kill her.

377
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,958
I know why you hit your head
on the bar in the cell now.

378
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,503
You were buying time
to come up with this story.

379
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,839
Do you have a change of heart
now that you're caught?

380
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,093
You hated that Kim Hyeong-bok
became the killer.

381
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,638
You dragged Park Seon-mi's body

382
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,057
to the site of Jung Hui-ju's murder
for that reason.

383
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,477
You wanted us to know
that you were the real killer.

384
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,524
You wanted to deserve the credit,

385
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,360
not some random guy.

386
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,446
Am I right?

387
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,034
It's not too late.
Tell the world you did it.

388
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,496
Tell them you are the mastermind.

389
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,832
And that the police were no match for you.

390
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,086
You…

391
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,632
aren't some imposter

392
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,259
who copies other people.

393
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,260
Right?

394
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,393
Did you catch the culprit?

395
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,230
What?

396
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,818
I told you before that
the kid with the backpack is the killer.

397
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,904
You haven't caught him yet?

398
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,409
I guess you haven't.

399
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,331
Do-chang.

400
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,083
The captain of the Seoul Criminal
Investigation Division is here.

401
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,543
What?

402
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,336
Damn it.

403
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,760
What do you think you're doing?

404
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,472
You want to be given credit
for the job we did.

405
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,724
They don't mean to ride our coattails.

406
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,643
They want to take credit for everything.

407
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,104
Watch your mouth.

408
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,772
What?

409
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,026
-How are you managing your suspects?
-He's not a suspect.

410
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,112
He was arrested at the scene.
He's the killer.

411
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,989
I have no time for semantics.

412
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,824
I'll get to the point.

413
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,492
Give us custody.

414
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,911
I won't fault you for his state if you do.

415
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,290
You have some nerve.

416
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,292
You're the investigation division.

417
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,627
-Aren't you ashamed?
-What did you say?

418
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,670
-Stop.
-Why you…

419
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,214
We just want custody.

420
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,884
We don't want to take away
your credit for catching him.

421
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,510
We just want to cross-examine him

422
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,596
before he's transferred
to the prosecution.

423
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,307
We are capable of writing the report too.

424
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,018
All you need
are your fingers and a keyboard.

425
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,395
You can take him.

426
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,314
Do-chang.

427
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,984
When their guys come, pull our guys out.

428
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,321
Go back to the office and send them
everything we have so far.

429
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,073
Why should we?

430
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,410
Anyone would say
that this is absurd behavior by them.

431
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,120
It's fine.

432
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,623
They were also working day and night

433
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,584
trying to catch the killer for months.

434
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
We should give them a chance to save face.

435
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,921
But…

436
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,964
under one condition.

437
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,678
Lee Seong-gon is the real killer.

438
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,513
You have to admit that.

439
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,059
And you have to apologize
to Kim Hyeong-bok and his mother

440
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,728
for falsely accusing him.

441
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,065
Fine.

442
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,027
Let's go.

443
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,166
I heard you were in an accident
two years ago.

444
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,542
Why do you ask?

445
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,045
I heard that you recently suffered

446
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,172
a mental breakdown from the accident.

447
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,925
Our legal team will help you.

448
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,968
Why?

449
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,554
To be honest,
I'm new so I can't tell you the details.

450
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,475
I heard that you know the reason
better than I do.

451
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,229
What do I have to do?

452
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:07,026
Our team will take care
of the legal aspects on your behalf.

453
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,862
Our attorney prepared the complaint.

454
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,490
If you agree and sign the papers,

455
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,826
we will submit them to the court.

456
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,162
It states that you suffered
psychological damage and fear of safety.

457
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:22,208
The complaint is against Oh Ji-hyeok
of Incheon Seobu Police.

458
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,584
Is that correct?

459
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,879
What did the doctor say?

460
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,257
We can't wait that long.

461
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,217
Bring him as soon as possible.

462
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,219
He seems fine to me.

463
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,887
Detective.

464
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,348
What is it, sir?

465
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,516
I saw the news.

466
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,393
They said the culprit was caught.

467
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,769
Is he the killer?

468
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,104
We don't know yet.

469
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,106
We're still investigating.
We'll let you know later.

470
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,524
Go home and wait.

471
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,483
Wait.

472
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,944
Please let me meet him.

473
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,238
I told you we're still investigating.

474
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,532
You're delaying our investigation.

475
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,120
I will wait
until your investigation is done.

476
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,039
We don't know when that will be.

477
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,875
Please go home. We will call you.

478
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,711
This is the only thing I can do.

479
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,921
Please let me wait here.

480
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,339
Darn it.

481
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,801
Do as you will.

482
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,653
Sir, the law prohibits the victim's family
from talking to the culprit.

483
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,947
I won't do anything to him.

484
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,366
I just want to know

485
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,911
if he killed her and why he did it.

486
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,370
I told you that you can't.

487
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,998
Stop being stubborn and go home.

488
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,374
Wait.

489
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,044
What do you think?

490
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,797
Is he the man who killed Hui-ju?

491
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,591
The other families don't do this.

492
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,468
Why are you so demanding?

493
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,179
She is my granddaughter!

494
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,723
She's not the only one that got killed.

495
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,644
We will talk to the press soon.

496
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,395
Just watch that.

497
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,613
Kick him out.

498
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,116
If he resists,
threaten to arrest him for obstruction.

499
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,326
Sir,

500
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,247
this area is not open to the public.

501
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,331
Okay.

502
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,500
I understand.

503
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,968
Damn it.

504
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,137
Do-chang,

505
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,639
Why did you transfer it
to the investigation division?

506
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,391
It was their case to begin with.

507
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,226
Besides, they were making an issue

508
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,186
out of Lee Seung-gon harming himself.

509
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,648
The Chief is so excited that
he's rehearsing his speech to the press.

510
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,024
How am I going to tell him

511
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,110
that we gave away the case?

512
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,444
Pretend you don't know.

513
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,571
What?

514
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,948
Just go along with what I do.

515
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,451
I'll take care of the rest.

516
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,454
Ji-hyeok.

517
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,540
Call me in five minutes.

518
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,252
Nothing wrong
with the investigation, right?

519
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,671
Of course.
We are collecting evidence right now.

520
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,423
We will have the motive soon.

521
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,341
-We'll get his confession too.
-Sure.

522
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,802
Do-chang,

523
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,473
I'm so lucky to have met you
during my career.

524
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,850
Thank you, Do-chang.

525
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,228
I didn't do anything.

526
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,064
It's all thanks to your leadership.

527
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,152
Ji-hyeok.

528
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,487
What?

529
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,032
What?

530
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,411
What the hell are you talking about?

531
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,372
Tell those bastards not to move a muscle.

532
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,749
I can't believe this.

533
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,959
-What is it?
-This is nonsense!

534
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,754
They want to take custody
of Lee Seong-gon!

535
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,880
What?

536
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,798
-What is the reason?
-There is no reason!

537
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,842
They're blinded by special promotions.

538
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,886
I'm going to raise hell.

539
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,387
Calm down.

540
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,306
Let's ask Chief what he thinks.

541
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,143
He is the one
who would be the most embarrassed by this.

542
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,396
Sorry, I was being selfish.

543
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,566
Chief, you need to raise this issue
with the chief of their division.

544
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,736
-Me?
-They must think we're idiots.

545
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,946
That's true.

546
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,865
They think we're pushovers.

547
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,117
You have to raise a complaint yourself.

548
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,788
You are right.

549
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,915
The thing is,

550
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,335
the chief of the investigation division
is younger than me,

551
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,170
but he does rank higher.

552
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,422
Then you should go to the commissioner.

553
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,675
You should report it
directly to the commissioner.

554
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,301
The commissioner?

555
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,512
This isn't just an attack on our unit.

556
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,014
This is an attack
on the entire Incheon Seobu Police.

557
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,475
Whether it's the chief of the division
or the commissioner,

558
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,852
you need to address this issue in person.

559
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,273
I know how you feel.

560
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,860
But it's not like we're transferring
the case to another country.

561
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,821
We are all under the same flag here.

562
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,031
Maybe we shouldn't get
so worked up over this.

563
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,701
You must not back down.

564
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,910
Bong-sik,

565
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,912
we need to keep a cool head.

566
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,997
Chief,

567
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,791
all of our special promotions
are riding on this.

568
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,668
You have to stick up for us.

569
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,295
We believe in you.

570
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,755
I understand.

571
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,425
I got--

572
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,635
I'll take care of this, so leave.

573
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,681
This will taint the reputation
of the Incheon Seobu Police Station.

574
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,391
-History…
-Sir.

575
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,059
Chief said he'll take care of it.

576
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,770
Right.

577
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,356
-We're counting on you, Chief.
-Stop.

578
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,067
-Chief, you're the…
-Stop.

579
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,153
That's quite enough.

580
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,238
We should leave it to him.

581
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,409
We trust that you will take care of it.

582
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,411
Thank you, Chief!

583
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,413
-Okay.
-Sir!

584
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,498
-Go on.
-Okay.

585
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,001
-It's our heartfelt request.
-He heard you.

586
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,753
-You were good.
-I was?

587
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,421
-I was, right?
-Sure.

588
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,927
Those bastards…

589
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,597
They snatched it away from us.

590
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,768
What did the Chief say?

591
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,188
-Did he blow up?
-Of course, he did.

592
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,814
What a nuisance.

593
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,691
I'm sure he'll nag us
until we take it back.

594
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,817
You're wrong.

595
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,986
I have him in the palm of my hand.

596
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,656
I took care of it, so he won't bother you.

597
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,950
If he ever yells at you, tell me.

598
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,120
I have him eating out of my hand.

599
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,623
Did you contact Lee Seong-gon's company?

600
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,833
Someone did come by recently.

601
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,211
-I will get the details in person.
-Go ahead.

602
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,963
Ji-hyeok, it's for you.

603
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,550
This is Oh Ji-hyeok.

604
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,927
Yes.

605
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,720
Is it urgent?

606
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,639
Then I'll stop by.

607
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,808
Where are you? I know that place.

608
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,143
I'll see you in a while.

609
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,980
Who was that? The voice sounds familiar.

610
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,565
Who is it?

611
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,776
Is it someone related to our case?

612
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,277
It's the Chief's daughter.

613
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,446
That was her voice.

614
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,906
-I remember
-I won't be long.

615
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,574
-Give me 30 minutes.
-Go ahead.

616
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,534
Hey.

617
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,994
Behave yourself.
She's the chief's daughter.

618
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,831
If we get on his bad side, we're both out.

619
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,292
Don't do that thing with your eyes.

620
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,545
Those eyes are the most dangerous thing.

621
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,506
Okay.

622
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,924
Crazy bastard.

623
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,342
Come on.

624
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,554
Wait a minute.

625
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,515
The handsome detective
that the Chief's daughter mentioned was--

626
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,851
Hey, she flirted with me,

627
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,436
not Ji-hyeok.

628
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,854
That's right.

629
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,022
She saw Ji-hyeok
at the fried chicken place.

630
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,607
Is that so?

631
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,652
I carried her on my back.
She only saw Ji-hyeok for a second.

632
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,695
And…

633
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,533
She's too shy to ask in person,

634
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,619
so she's asking those around me
about how I feel about her.

635
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,705
I know women well.

636
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,831
That's what they do.

637
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,710
Man-gu, I want you to be honest.

638
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,920
Who's better looking,
Jae-hong or Ji-hyeok?

639
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,797
Ji-hyeok, hands down.

640
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,048
You guys are clueless.

641
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,342
Women prefer guys like me.

642
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,677
That's the reality.

643
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,888
-Crazy bastard.
-He's crazy.

644
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,431
Wake up.

645
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,725
Crazy bastard.

646
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,279
-Hi.
-Hello.

647
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,619
How can I help you?

648
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,664
Are you really Detective Oh Ji-hyeok?

649
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,833
Yes, I am.

650
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,922
I'm in the middle of an investigation,
so I don't have much time.

651
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,465
Can you get to the point?

652
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,597
Please review this.

653
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,893
If you try to contact Kim Min-ji again
in person, by email, or on the phone,

654
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,062
you will face charges.

655
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,028
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

656
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,324
SIGNED BY KIM MIN-JI

657
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,034
I heard you're at TJ Group.

658
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,996
-Did they tell you to do this?
-You said you're busy.

659
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,291
I have no time to give you an explanation.

660
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,504
If you don't go near her,
then everything will be fine.

661
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,299
It won't help you as a detective
to get tangled up in a legal mess.

662
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,801
I don't care about that.

663
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,804
Either way,

664
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,889
you work with my dad.

665
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,725
It puts me in a difficult position,
so please--

666
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,935
Ms. Moon,

667
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,312
what is your job at TJ Group?

668
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,189
I'm with the legal team.

669
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,112
This is strictly business.

670
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,823
I hope you don't get any funny ideas

671
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,617
Is your team director Woo Tae-ho?

672
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,327
And your manager is Choi Yong-geun?

673
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,371
That doesn't matter.

674
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,457
Just don't go near Kim Min-ji.

675
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,210
You said you're busy, so I'm leaving.

676
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,892
SEOBU POLICE STATION

677
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,568
So…

678
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,113
why did Bo-gyeong want to see you?

679
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,489
It's nothing.

680
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,199
Is it personal?

681
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,786
Not at all.

682
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,248
One of the victims, Jung Hui-ju,

683
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,792
worked on the TJ Group legal team.
You're aware, right?

684
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm aware.

685
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,466
Isn't Bo-gyeong working at TJ group?

686
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,218
I think she was hired in place
of Jung Hui-ju.

687
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,554
Could that be a coincidence?

688
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,348
It's made to look like a coincidence.

689
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,644
Somebody hired Moon Bo-gyeong
in Jung Hui-ju's place.

690
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,895
Who would do that?

691
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,397
I'll see you again.

692
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,649
Cheon Na-na.

693
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,944
She's the managing director of TJ Group
and the only daughter of Cheon Seong-dae.

694
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,113
I bet the former captain
of the investigation division,

695
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,615
Choi Yong-geun, is also involved.

696
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,493
He's the manager
of TJ's legal team right now.

697
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,661
Why would they?

698
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,538
It's complicated.

699
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,249
Do I have to explain it to you now?

700
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,376
No, it's fine.

701
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,754
I'm already at full capacity
dealing with Lee Seong-gon.

702
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,718
Yes, sir.

703
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,805
No, it's okay. Please go ahead.

704
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,266
I'm sorry to keep bothering you.

705
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,103
Could we meet now?

706
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,856
I'm on my way out on business.

707
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,567
Then I will wait for you at the station.

708
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,860
Is it urgent?

709
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:01,323
No, I'm just frustrated.

710
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:05,494
I have some questions about Hui-ju's case.

711
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,915
Then I will text you an address.
Let's meet there.

712
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,501
I will come as soon as I'm done.

713
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,336
Thank you.

714
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,217
Jung Hui-ju…

715
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:25,305
Why do I keep getting the feeling
that her case is separate from the others?

716
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,643
He knew what he was doing.

717
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,646
It seemed like

718
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,982
he had a way of doing things in order.

719
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,735
He didn't seem nervous or hesitant.

720
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,369
It felt like murder
was a part of his daily life.

721
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,415
-Detective.
-Yes.

722
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,709
I won't have to see him again, right?

723
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,086
No. You won't have to.

724
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,880
It's terrifying.

725
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,050
He didn't seem any different from
when he was driving the bus.

726
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,929
Even when he held a knife in his hand,
his face was totally calm.

727
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,768
I keep seeing his emotionless face.

728
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,021
I understand.

729
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,232
Please go get some rest.
We'll be in touch if we need more.

730
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,401
What do you think?

731
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,196
You told the press
that it was a copycat crime.

732
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:25,157
Do you think Lee Seong-gon was a copycat?

733
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,994
Before he's sent to the prosecution,

734
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,415
get your story straight
with Lee Seong-gon.

735
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,542
As you suggested,

736
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,754
He has to become a copycat.

737
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,633
I'm sure Lee Seong-gon
would welcome that, too.

738
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,801
Make sure

739
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:46,970
it seems convincing.

740
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,939
-Lee Seong-gon's little sister?
-Yes.

741
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,107
That's what she said.

742
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,902
Lee Seong-gon was an orphan.
He has no family.

743
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,946
That's what I thought too.

744
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:07,449
But she came looking for him
about a month ago.

745
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,745
She couldn't speak Korean well
so someone had to interpret for her.

746
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:15,332
I think she was adopted overseas.

747
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,209
She had an English name.

748
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,461
Do you remember what it was?

749
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,838
I can't remember an English name.

750
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,007
Hold on.

751
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,842
I think I have the number

752
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,970
of the person who interpreted for her.

753
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,266
She asked me
to give her number to Lee Seong-gon.

754
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,564
Do you know Lee Seong-gon?

755
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,865
I'm sorry.

756
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,326
-Can we talk to her alone?
-Pardon?

757
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,496
But she can't speak Korean at all.

758
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,582
We can't communicate with her.

759
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,381
We can just interpret. Such a show-off.

760
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,345
She's being treated for a stress disorder.

761
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,764
Please avoid discussing
anything that might shock her.

762
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,932
I understand.

763
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,748
She said not to ask her
anything that might shock her.

764
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,291
Did you understand what I said?

765
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,376
Are you kidding me?

766
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,548
Killing people.

767
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,677
She's shocked
because you mentioned murder.

768
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,863
What did she say?

769
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,865
I don't think she wants to talk about it.

770
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,548
She heard something from Lee Seong-gon.

771
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,383
She's hiding something.

772
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,178
Do you understand English?

773
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,182
Sometimes the expression gives away
more than words.

774
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,935
Anyway, I think we need more time.

775
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,272
Let's go meet Lee Seong-gon

776
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,357
and talk to him about his sister.

777
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,568
Let's see how he reacts.

778
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,779
Would that be okay?

779
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,156
I thought you were meeting
Mr. Jung In-beom.

780
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,326
Even if I meet him,
I don't have much to tell him.

781
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,996
I will talk to him
when the picture is clearer.

782
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,513
I don't think we will have more customers.

783
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,806
You can go home.

784
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,308
I want to stay and help out.

785
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,895
Do-chang will have my head
if he knew I kept you here until now.

786
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,357
Go home
and help Jae-ung with his homework.

787
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,067
Okay.

788
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,782
Hi, Do-chang.

789
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,950
Him?

790
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,536
He's still here.

791
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,537
Why?

792
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,219
-I'm off.
-Okay.

793
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,806
If Jae-ung wants a snack,
tell him he can't.

794
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,391
He's been eating too much at night lately.

795
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,433
Got it.

796
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,486
Excuse me,

797
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,197
-Sir?
-Yes.

798
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,157
My brother just called.

799
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,703
I think he's too busy.
He asked to meet at another time.

800
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,204
Is that right?

801
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,582
I'm very sorry.

802
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,210
Do-chang felt bad to call you himself.

803
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,297
He promises to call you and see you soon.

804
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,756
I understand.

805
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,553
I pushed him to make time for me.

806
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,055
Tell him I completely understand.

807
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,560
-How much is this?
-There's no need to pay.

808
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,398
Please take this for your family.

809
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:17,027
This is not necessary.
I will also pay for what I ate.

810
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,612
I can't.

811
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,780
My brother will kill me
if I take your money.

812
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,282
Thank you.

813
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,032
You only saved yourself, did you?

814
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,700
I thought you had a detective friend.

815
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,702
Ask him to get Yu-na out too.

816
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,413
Or I'll run over your pretty face.

817
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,925
Try these on.

818
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,178
I can go home in these slippers.

819
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:11,016
These are for the chicken
that the chicken restaurant owner gave me.

820
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,685
I would feel so much better

821
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,396
if you wore these home.

822
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,689
See if they fit.

823
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,204
-Do they fit?
-Yes.

824
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,623
It's amazing. They fit perfectly.

825
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,001
I've spent my life working with shoes.

826
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,170
I can tell what size you are right away.

827
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,340
Are these not your style?

828
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,093
They are very pretty.

829
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,678
Thank you so much, sir.

830
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,805
Make sure you wear them well.

831
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,099
That's all there is to it.

832
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,225
Okay.

833
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,906
I don't have to talk to you guys anymore.

834
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,659
I heard you lost the case
to someone higher up.

835
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,828
You…

836
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,625
You have a little sister
that you were separated from, right?

837
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,339
Your sister seems to know
something about you.

838
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,757
Damn it.

839
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,053
What did that bitch say?

840
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,013
She was different from you.

841
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,390
She was kind.

842
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,601
She seemed like a good person.

843
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,439
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

844
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,735
You don't know about her past.

845
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,153
What about her past?

846
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,864
If you see her, tell her this.

847
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,993
To keep in mind what I told her.

848
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,899
Do you remember me?

849
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,987
I'm sorry.

850
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,699
I don't speak Korean that well.

851
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,703
I understand.
You probably wanted to forget it.

852
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,787
Why are you here?

853
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,081
Nice to meet you.

854
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,374
I asked, why are you here?

855
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,127
Live a happy life in the States.
Why are you here?

856
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,712
I'm sorry.

857
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,840
I don't speak Korean well.

858
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,677
Well, I don't speak English
because I'm uneducated.

859
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,596
Brother.

860
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,638
What?

861
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,766
I'm not your brother.

862
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,227
I missed you.

863
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,689
I'm not your brother, you crazy bitch.

864
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,859
I'm not your brother!

865
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,915
Do you remember this?

866
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,461
It's what the whore you call your mother
used to carry around.

867
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,469
What the hell are you saying?

868
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,845
I don't know what you're saying.

869
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,891
Say something I can understand.

870
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,643
Stop jabbering in English.

871
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,481
You bitch.

872
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,900
Were you happy?

873
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,735
Were you happy living in the States?

874
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,279
Was it a paradise?

875
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,740
I lived in hell.

876
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,450
I wanted to die every minute of my life,

877
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,160
you bitch!

878
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,040
You…

879
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,792
If it wasn't for you,

880
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,961
and your mom,

881
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,588
my father wouldn't have died like that.

882
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,382
And I wouldn't have lived like this!

883
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,301
Stop it!

884
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,803
This crazy bitch.

885
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,024
Do you know why I became a murderer?

886
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,528
I killed countless people.

887
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,115
Every time I saw women,
it reminded me of your mom.

888
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,787
How she wore a white gown and red lipstick

889
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,165
and how she smiled

890
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,668
as she shaved men's faces.

891
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,008
It's good.

892
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,761
It's good that you came looking for me.

893
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,556
I'm not going to kill you.

894
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,516
I'll spare your life.

895
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,519
Remember this knife.

896
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,357
Every time I kill someone with this knife,

897
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,109
you…

898
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,322
you better writhe in pain.

899
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,825
Those women are dead

900
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,579
because you are alive.

901
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,957
Remember that.

902
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,567
How are you getting along
with Tae-ho these days?

903
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,694
We get along great.

904
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,613
That's good.

905
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,616
You wanted to marry him.
So you should stay with him to the end.

906
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,410
The Chairman trusts him more than me.

907
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,745
He doesn't need my help.

908
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,582
Don't you think he has too much power?

909
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,250
He's my husband.

910
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,585
That's true.

911
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,172
I guess you don't mind.

912
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,094
Did you know
before the Chairman was sentenced,

913
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,846
there was a search and seizure
of the legal team?

914
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,643
Tae-ho claims that
the key evidence against Father

915
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,646
came from the Blue House.

916
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,315
But what if the evidence

917
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,776
ended up at the Blue House
from our legal team

918
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:41,823
during search and seizure?

919
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,701
You know he's thorough.
He won't make a mistake like that.

920
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,953
What if it wasn't a mistake?

921
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,122
-Why would he?
-You said it yourself.

922
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,748
He has a lot of power.

923
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,043
Maybe he wants even more power.

924
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:00,299
I met Michael Cha not too long ago.
The CEO of McQueen Korea.

925
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,551
Did you?

926
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,595
We went to university together,
so he was honest with me.

927
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:09,225
He knew that you lost a lot of money
trying to start a business in Japan.

928
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,355
Father doesn't know
that Tae-ho covered for you

929
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,607
for that mess you made two years ago.

930
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,028
If Tae-ho was planning
something against you,

931
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,865
wouldn't father know that already?

932
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,452
Why didn't you say anything
when you know everything?

933
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,580
We're family. We share the same blood.

934
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,421
You're right.

935
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,966
You can only trust family in this world.

936
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,933
This was your mom's favorite cup.

937
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:57,648
Are you holding onto it
because it reminds you of your mom?

938
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,984
It's pretty.

939
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,116
It's been a while since we saw Father.

940
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,953
We should go see him together.

941
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,206
Sure. Let me know when it's set.

942
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,062
-Hi, mom.
-Are you on the plane?

943
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,398
I'm taking off soon.
I'll call you when I arrive.

944
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,525
Na-na.

945
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,486
When you get to the States,
don't come back.

946
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,155
Run away.

947
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,033
Open the door.

948
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:54,038
Stop fooling around and open the door!

949
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,708
I know what you're thinking.

950
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,921
I know you're doing this for money!

951
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,840
You can't get a divorce.

952
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,091
Never!

953
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,510
Give up and open this door!

954
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,762
-Don't ever come back, Na-na.
-Open the door!

955
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,390
Don't come back to this hell hole.

956
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,476
You need to live.

957
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,937
You need to.

958
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,855
Mom.

959
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,731
Are you okay?

960
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,191
Did something happen?

961
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,597
I won't run away like you, Mom.

962
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,646
I'm going to survive…

963
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,150
to the end.

964
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:39,060
Lee Seong-gon told Laura Caine
about his murders.

965
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,478
You will be forever remembered

966
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,940
as the famed serial killer
that led to copycats.

967
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,275
Who is the bastard that keeps
digging into me?

968
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,444
The Chairman will never
betray Cheon Sang-woo.

969
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,029
It's time to change the leadership of TJ.

970
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,865
That I'm not the only one
living a lonely life.

971
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,369
All you have to do is
say you kidnapped someone on drugs.

972
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,538
Nobody can say that he is the killer
even if he is!

973
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,623
I was being selfish.

974
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,125
Jung Hui-ju never took that bus.

975
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
Why?

976
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:11,842
