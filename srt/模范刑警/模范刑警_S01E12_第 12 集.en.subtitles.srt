1
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,517
Hello?

2
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,313
The lawyer requested us
for additional photos of the crime scene.

3
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,609
Okay, I'll file for a warrant
as soon as I'm done with this.

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,693
Bye.

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,411
Do you remember?

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,829
You asked for this.

7
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,416
You told me to kill you myself.

8
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,139
You want me locked up in jail?

9
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,768
No, I'm not going to jail.

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,354
Do you think I'll get locked up
for killing you?

11
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,814
No way.

12
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,025
Because like last time,
no one will find any evidence.

13
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,654
You'll end up dying like your father.

14
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,948
Do you know why?

15
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,284
Because the person who killed you
won't ever get caught.

16
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,703
How dare you look down on me?

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,291
How dare you look down on me
when you lived off me and my family?

18
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,252
How dare you?

19
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,751
Right before my dad died, he told me

20
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,797
that he regrets letting you leave

21
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,261
and that he thinks I'm a disgrace.

22
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,932
Why would he think that
when I'm his biological son?

23
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:10,064
Why did I have to be treated that way
because of a piece of trash like you?

24
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,743
Die, you jerk.

25
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,787
Die!

26
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,762
I want you gone from my life!

27
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,867
Die.

28
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,994
Die.

29
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,997
Die, damn it!

30
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,160
Don't mess with a detective.

31
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,454
Or you'll die.

32
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,343
I'm dying right now. Please help.

33
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,888
I'm at the abandoned apartment

34
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,848
in Eocheong-ro, Gayeon-dong,
Seo-gu, Incheon.

35
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,937
You can't die now.

36
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,608
You can die after you pay for your sins.

37
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,469
Hello?

38
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,971
Who?

39
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,305
Oh Ji-hyeok?

40
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,183
Yes, he's a detective in our team.

41
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,352
What's going on?

42
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,148
-Yes, I think he's lost a lot of blood.
-In three, two, one.

43
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,609
Yes. Fortunately, he's still alive.

44
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,238
Do-chang, where are you going?

45
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,707
OH JI-HYEOK, MALE, 34

46
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,293
GENERAL SURGERY, UNDERGOING SURGERY

47
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,675
Did you operate on Oh Ji-hyeok?

48
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,051
No.

49
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,972
Can you tell me how the surgery is going?

50
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,683
You should wait. His doctor will tell you
once the surgery is over.

51
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,226
Okay.

52
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,269
Let's go.

53
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,202
Hey, Do-chang.

54
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,578
How did it go?

55
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,914
He's still getting surgery.

56
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,917
-How is his condition?
-He'll live.

57
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,504
Thank goodness. I'm so relieved.

58
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,215
Did you find Oh Jong-tae?

59
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,425
Well, the thing is--

60
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,637
I bet he followed Ji-hyeok there
and stabbed him. I'm sure of it.

61
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,639
We need to arrest him.

62
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,185
Hurry up and arrest him
before he runs away.

63
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,062
He's also hospitalized right now.

64
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,356
He got stabbed just like Detective Oh.

65
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,984
-What?
-The paramedics found him

66
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,820
at the crime scene of Park Gun-ho's death.
He's not seriously injured.

67
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,073
It looks like they both
stabbed each other.

68
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,892
What did the doctor say?

69
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,603
His body is in shock
because he lost too much blood.

70
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,607
He told me his surgery went well
and that we don't need to worry.

71
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,986
Did you contact Detective Oh's family?

72
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,529
He doesn't have a family.

73
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,905
What?

74
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,868
I think I'll be able to manage on my own.
You guys should go.

75
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,245
I'll call when he wakes up.

76
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,876
He always acted all tough,
but I guess he was just a lonely soul.

77
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,170
I heard he's rich
thanks to his inheritance.

78
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,463
What's the worry?

79
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,465
What's the use of being rich?

80
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,718
He has no family to take care of him
at times like this.

81
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,012
What do you mean he has no family?

82
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,971
We're his family.

83
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,223
Cut the crap.

84
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,519
Do you think these guys will
worry about me if I end up in that state?

85
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,022
They'll worry about the money I owe.

86
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,232
Wait a minute. Jae-hong.

87
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,485
I paid for the bet you lost.
Why haven't you paid me back yet?

88
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,905
Gosh, we're family.
Don't be stingy with a couple of bucks.

89
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,699
Just forget about it.

90
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,119
You're going to call us family
only when money is involved?

91
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,497
Hey, Ji-ung. You've got some balls
seeing that you're talking to me that way.

92
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,711
Hey, let's pick someone
who can take Do-chang's place tomorrow.

93
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,463
-Who wants to come?
-Me.

94
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,089
You punks.

95
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,424
You just don't want to work.

96
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,800
That's nonsense.

97
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,927
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Scissors.

98
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,138
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Scissors.

99
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,194
You should've studied harder and become
either a prosecutor or a judge.

100
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,073
You're too pretty to become a detective.

101
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,284
You've become even paler.

102
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,538
Once this is over, you should get married.

103
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,165
You should make yourself a family.

104
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,464
Gosh, I'm really not the one to talk.

105
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,183
INCHEON METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

106
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,770
I'm Ko Gyeong-ho
from the Civil Petition Division

107
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,147
at Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency.

108
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,111
I will begin today's briefing.

109
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,073
The voice recording that was reported
by a daily newspaper was recorded

110
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:43,285
following the inspection procedure
according to the current law.

111
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,454
Also, I'd like to point out
that the daily newspaper

112
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,998
distorted the information
by partially editing things out.

113
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,793
Then tell us what's real
or just reveal the entire recording.

114
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,421
We're carrying out an investigation
regarding the recording,

115
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,340
so please understand that we cannot
openly share it with the public.

116
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,175
However, we, the police,

117
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,096
plan to hold the officer in charge
strictly responsible

118
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,890
for having leaked confidential information
to an outsider.

119
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,518
We'd like to sincerely apologize

120
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,980
for worrying our citizens
by leaking confidential information.

121
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,024
We will file a complaint
to the Press Arbitration Commission

122
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,485
regarding the relevant press
and the subsequent news reports

123
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,072
-and follow the necessary procedures.
-When can we hear about the investigation?

124
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,846
Is there a problem?

125
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,639
Why must I take responsibility?

126
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,602
Don't worry. You won't be the only one.

127
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,938
I made myself clear that I knew nothing.

128
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,274
But you did meet Jin Seo-kyung.

129
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,318
How does that make me responsible?

130
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,863
I met her just once
for a very short while.

131
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,490
I told her nothing.

132
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,033
We're already on that.

133
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,702
We'll notify you once we check the facts.

134
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,832
The content of the recording
is a sensitive issue.

135
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,252
So you want people focusing on the fact
that someone leaked information.

136
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,133
You're trying to cover things up
by making me become the scapegoat.

137
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,388
Why can't you just go along with it?

138
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,601
It's always hard to climb the ladder.

139
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,979
If you don't cooperate,
it'll only become more difficult for you.

140
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,905
What? They rejected it?

141
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,534
Darn it. Did they tell you why?

142
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,911
Lack of motive?

143
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,831
Those darn jerks.

144
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,503
Hey, you're awake.

145
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,089
Just lie down.

146
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,716
If you keep moving, your wound won't heal.

147
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,094
-I'm okay.
-You almost died.

148
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,387
You're not okay.

149
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,930
I'm really okay.

150
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,350
My body aches a bit.
But other than that, I'm fine.

151
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,772
What happened?

152
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,524
Did Oh Jong-tae stab you?

153
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,234
Yes.

154
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,196
But it's okay. I stabbed him, too.

155
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,699
You think it's okay
because you both stabbed each other?

156
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,660
Jong-tae stabbed me first,
so he won't make an issue out of it.

157
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,497
-Don't worry.
-Why don't you go live in the jungle?

158
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,541
If someone stabs you, just stab them back.

159
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,459
You should live that way. Why live here?

160
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,712
And why do you have to be my partner?

161
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,630
You crazy punk.

162
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,927
Did you file an arrest warrant
for Jong-tae?

163
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,724
Yes, I asked Jae-hong
to file for a warrant last night.

164
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,601
But this morning,

165
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,686
the prosecutor rejected it.

166
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,564
It got rejected even though
Jo Seong-dae confessed everything?

167
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,568
Like you said, someone must have his back.
That's the only way.

168
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,737
It's Yoo Jeong-seok.

169
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,281
That's the only way to explain this.

170
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,657
Yoo Jeong-seok.

171
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952
Yoo Jeong-seok.

172
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,998
We got a call. They might file a complaint
to the Press Arbitration Commission.

173
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,667
They're taking this seriously.
Let's wait and see if it happens.

174
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,627
That's fine.

175
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,921
But they're fixated on finding
who leaked the information

176
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,797
rather than confirming the truth.

177
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,882
Are you okay with that?

178
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,218
We wrote the article, so someone should
naturally take responsibility.

179
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,554
They're just doing what's necessary.

180
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,518
Kang Do-chang, a violent crimes detective
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

181
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,242
Do you admit that you met Oh Jong-tae?

182
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,121
We requested an arrest warrant,
but it was rejected.

183
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,915
The accomplice confessed to everything,

184
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,377
and he even tried to murder the accomplice
to keep him from talking.

185
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,170
But our request for a warrant got rejected

186
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,047
for some absurd reason.

187
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,132
That's totally up to the prosecution.

188
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,344
Even if it seems unjust,
the press has no power to interfere.

189
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,639
Oh Jong-tae is a murderer.
Why are you protecting him?

190
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,186
I think you just made a mistake.

191
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,021
You're the one who's making a mistake.

192
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,984
He's going to continue murdering people.

193
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,527
And you're encouraging him.

194
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,698
Detective Kang, you're crossing the line.

195
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,907
On what grounds--

196
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,994
My partner is lying in the hospital
because he got stabbed by that jerk.

197
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:41,250
Oh Jong-tae is trying to kill everyone
just to cover up what he did.

198
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,629
I believe you made a mistake
because you didn't know him very well.

199
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,299
It's still not too late.
I'm not asking you for help.

200
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,801
I just want you

201
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:55,431
to leave him alone
so he can get punished for what he did.

202
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,767
Are you saying Detective Oh got stabbed?

203
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,644
Fortunately, he's still alive.

204
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,106
But Oh Jong-tae will
eventually kill Ji-hyeok one day.

205
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,819
I bet he thinks he'll never get punished
for murdering people.

206
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,328
Listen.

207
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
Do I look like a joke to you?

208
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,003
You're free to think however you want.

209
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,590
But the moment you say it out loud,

210
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,010
you become responsible for what you say.

211
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,386
You see,

212
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,806
I'm not that well-educated.

213
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,102
So I tend to have trouble
talking to smart people.

214
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:46,148
But all I want from you is just one thing.

215
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,733
Let me catch the culprit.

216
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,528
I'm just a detective
who wants to catch a murderer.

217
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,363
Is that so wrong?

218
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,823
Seo-kyung.

219
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,326
Are you just letting anyone in here now?

220
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,870
Why do I need to hear these fools

221
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,623
talk nonsense to me like this?

222
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,797
Sir.

223
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,429
I'll take this as evidence
to prove that the police

224
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,474
illegally inspected the press.

225
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,277
That darn bastard.

226
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,530
Where is Detective Oh?

227
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,573
It's nothing to worry about.

228
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,952
I had an argument with my cousin,
and it led to a small accident.

229
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,163
We were both stabbed,
so it won't cause a problem.

230
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,332
Anyway, I'm sorry for worrying you.

231
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,001
I'll keep it short
since you're at the hospital.

232
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,462
You'd better make sure
this never happens again.

233
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,005
I'm really sorry.

234
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,007
From now on,

235
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,261
I'll be extra careful
not to make any mistakes.

236
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,346
I'm going to hang up now.

237
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,520
He's so cold-hearted.
He has no sense of humanity.

238
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,607
Did the cops visit Yoo Jeong-seok?

239
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,986
I wonder how the cops found out
about the two of us.

240
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,904
It's actually for the better.

241
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,365
If they didn't know,
you would've had to make sure they did.

242
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,161
We need to pressure him
to make him stay on his toes.

243
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,497
Now that he feels nervous,
he'll continue to have your back.

244
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,547
I have to say, I feel extremely grateful

245
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,175
that you're helping me.

246
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,261
But I want to know what you want.

247
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,640
What's your ultimate goal?

248
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,396
I want the guys who made me go to court
to be in the exact same situation.

249
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,231
That's my goal.

250
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,486
What if I don't want that to happen?

251
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,324
Then I'll end up
seeing you in court instead

252
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,826
although that's nothing close
to what I want.

253
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,956
You have a way of blackmailing people.

254
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,584
You just had me thinking the same thing.

255
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,338
That was a very nice way of telling me

256
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,090
that you'll have me killed
if I keep crossing the line.

257
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,200
KANG DO-CHANG

258
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,458
-Hello?
-Where are you?

259
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,459
Are you in your office?

260
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,295
No, I'm outside right now.

261
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,214
Seo-kyung told me everything.

262
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,884
I heard your superiors decided
to hold you responsible.

263
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,470
What about that?

264
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,807
Are you going to tell me
that I deserve it?

265
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,891
Is that why you called?

266
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,395
-Do you want to meet up for a drink?
-No.

267
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,772
I'm not upset enough to crave a drink.

268
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,525
Yes, of course. You're a strong person.

269
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,027
Do-chang.

270
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,240
Don't you hate me?

271
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,659
I only hated you for a short while.

272
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,912
You didn't do it because you wanted to.

273
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,499
You only did what you were told.

274
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,336
You're so annoying.

275
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,922
-What do you mean?
-You're annoying.

276
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,216
Why do you live that way?

277
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,010
Why do you have to be so nice?

278
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,055
Why can't you be mean to people
and do bad stuff every once in a while?

279
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,976
That way, I'd be able to tell myself

280
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,228
that it's okay to be like this.

281
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,357
I would've been just like you
if I were also competent and smart.

282
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,942
I'm like this because I'm dumb.

283
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,152
That's not true.

284
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,987
Never mind.

285
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,614
I'm just a fool.

286
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,825
That's why.

287
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,201
Sang-mi.

288
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,245
Cheer up.

289
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,664
You promised your late grandmother

290
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,917
that you'll succeed no matter what.

291
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,086
You need to keep that promise.

292
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,635
Yes, of course.

293
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,806
I totally forgot about that.

294
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,687
Thank you, Do-chang.

295
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,543
Can you do one more thing for me?

296
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,048
If you go to Mr. So's office,
you'll find stuff he used for the retrial.

297
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,133
Can you get that for me?
I'll call and let him know.

298
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,802
-Right now?
-Yes.

299
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,513
Will you be okay on your own?
You can't even pee by yourself.

300
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,433
Oh, hello.

301
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,601
Hello.

302
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,564
Don't worry about me.

303
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,693
Ms. Jin, if Detective Oh tells you
that he needs to pee,

304
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,488
you just need to give him
the urine container beneath the bed.

305
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,073
You… You want me to do that?

306
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,409
Hey, I'll take care of it.

307
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,203
Why would you tell her that?

308
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,081
You're a patient. Don't be embarrassed.

309
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,541
You don't want to wet the bed.

310
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,084
Just go. Leave already.

311
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,127
I'll get going then.

312
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,548
Oh, right. I almost forgot.
He can't bend down yet.

313
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,758
So you need to hold this
and look the other way.

314
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,136
Will you please just go? Get out of here!

315
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,262
Leave.

316
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,264
Anyway, please take good care of him.

317
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,932
I won't take too long.

318
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,566
I can't believe you can't even
go to the bathroom by yourself.

319
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,109
He's just making fun of me.

320
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,318
You don't need to worry.

321
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,779
Are you okay?

322
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,867
I could even get discharged today.

323
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,415
A few days ago,
I met Oh Jong-tae with Mr. Yoo.

324
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,085
And Oh Jong-tae playfully told me

325
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:27,090
that if he had to murder someone,
he would've killed Detective Jang Jin-su.

326
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,635
Why would he say that
in front of a newspaper editor?

327
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,054
So he would protect him.

328
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,599
But why would he say that in front of me?

329
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,643
He used you to send a message to Mr. Yoo.

330
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,855
"I might use a card of my own,
so you'd better watch out."

331
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,445
After that, they probably settled a deal.
And that's what gave him the confidence

332
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,115
to stab a police detective.

333
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,331
I became a reporter because of Mr. Yoo.

334
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,584
He helped me get transferred
to the head office.

335
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,671
To be honest, he's the kind of reporter
I want to become in the future.

336
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,717
You should use this chance
to think outside the box.

337
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,679
It won't be easy.

338
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,182
No, it'll be easier than you think.

339
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,895
You just need to be yourself.

340
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,404
BAEK JUN-SEOK

341
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,491
I need to go.

342
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,871
Don't overwork yourself. Please.

343
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,388
-Yes, we're still checking.
-Are you kidding me?

344
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,599
-No, we don't have anything yet.
-Hello?

345
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,102
-Okay, I'll hurry up and check.
-Okay, bye.

346
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,437
-We need to hurry.
-This is bad.

347
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,398
Mr. Yoo, they won't pick up.
What should I do?

348
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,607
You can't reach them?

349
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,068
Then copy five reports.
We need to fill the empty space.

350
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,320
But we haven't even confirmed
any of them yet.

351
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,239
That's so wrong.

352
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,325
Are you Ms. Jin Seo-kyung?

353
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,244
Yes. How can I help you?

354
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,122
My dad got abused
for something he didn't do.

355
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,416
-Can you please help me?
-I'm sorry but--

356
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,167
I read your articles.

357
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,420
You speak for those
who experience injustice.

358
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,005
Please speak for my dad.

359
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,340
I have no one. No one is on my dad's side.

360
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,342
I'm sorry. I'm really busy right now.

361
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,719
-Maybe next--
-Sorry. Let's go.

362
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,178
-Please hear me out.
-Let's go.

363
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,972
Ms. Jin, let me tell you what happened!

364
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,765
Are you going to leave
the newspaper empty?

365
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,100
-Just do as I say.
-Ms. Jin!

366
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,894
Please listen to what happened to my dad!

367
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,149
She's an informant.
Treat her with respect.

368
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,276
Let's talk outside.

369
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,328
I can't talk for long
because I have to meet a deadline.

370
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,040
Here. Send me what happened via email.

371
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,583
And text me after you send it.

372
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,586
I knew you'd hear me out.

373
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,837
Thank you so much.

374
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,093
You should go now.
I'll contact you after I check my email.

375
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,261
Okay.

376
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,014
Thank you.

377
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,976
Thank you so much.

378
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,854
Thank you.

379
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,648
Thank you.

380
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:40,533
You just need to be yourself.

381
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,129
Why did you help Lee Dae-cheol
with his second trial?

382
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,674
You made a deal with Lee Dae-cheol,
didn't you?

383
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,301
What did he offer?

384
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,679
Did he offer to split the compensation
if he won the retrial?

385
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,474
What do you think you're doing?

386
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,643
Did you help him hoping you'd get paid
millions of won?

387
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,436
Unbelievable.

388
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,438
Do you have nothing better to do?

389
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,649
I heard you're living with his daughter.

390
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,359
Why?

391
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,070
Are you trying to take
the money he left behind?

392
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,033
You know you're being unreasonable, right?
I bet you're embarrassed.

393
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,451
Do you think this makes any sense?

394
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,704
Don't you need money to pay
for your younger sister's divorce suit?

395
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,167
But I wonder why your sister's lawyer
defended Lee Dae-cheol

396
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,419
for his retrial.

397
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,256
Did you agree to split the money
with the lawyer?

398
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,425
You damn…

399
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,178
Just answer my question.

400
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,099
If you don't cooperate,
we'll have to come here often.

401
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,812
Who is it?

402
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,607
Who put you up to this?

403
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,651
Didn't you get caught
pocketing gift certificates

404
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,278
during your last inspection?

405
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,572
I heard Detective Kang helped you
get out of trouble.

406
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,909
Did he use that against you

407
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,580
and ask you to help him win
Lee Dae-cheol's retrial?

408
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,916
I'm asking you. Answer me.

409
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,585
Are you kidding me?

410
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,297
Your question isn't worth answering.

411
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,469
Why do you think Detective Kang
got involved with Lee Dae-cheol's retrial?

412
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,555
He felt a guilty conscience
as a police detective.

413
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,639
That's all.

414
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,768
But still, he suddenly claimed
that the culprit he arrested was innocent.

415
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,603
That's absurd.

416
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,813
-My gosh.
-You guys are the ones

417
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,814
being absurd.

418
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,984
-Look into their bank accounts.
-Yes, sir.

419
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,986
You'll have to give me
a thorough explanation

420
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,363
regarding every penny you received
aside from your paycheck.

421
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,246
I took care of the violent crimes unit
in Incheon Seobu Police Station.

422
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,874
Okay, let's meet up and eat sometime.

423
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,459
Bye.

424
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,298
Mr. Baek.

425
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,382
Yes, sir?

426
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,718
It's ready.

427
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,428
Ask them to enlarge the title.

428
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,139
-And reduce this article by half its size.
-Okay, sir.

429
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,098
By the way,

430
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,977
I think Seo-kyung is having a hard time
adjusting to the head office.

431
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,145
Her articles are off point.

432
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,607
Yes, I felt the same way.

433
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,235
Don't ask her to do anything new.
Let her stick to the usual.

434
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,945
Okay, sir.

435
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,708
Your older brother was treated
for alcoholism.

436
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,170
Isn't that a bit personal?

437
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,297
Why would you even bring that up?

438
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,842
Do-chang helped your older brother
get a job, didn't he?

439
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,218
What?

440
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,804
He asked the labor union for a favor
so they'd hire him, right?

441
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,517
Would you like us to investigate
the labor union

442
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,685
of your brother's workplace?

443
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,827
Hey, you're…

444
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,328
Let's go.

445
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,675
-Good work.
-What did they say?

446
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,843
What did they ask you?

447
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,387
They probably asked him useless stuff.

448
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,265
Don't let it get to you.

449
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,225
It's obvious what they're after.

450
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,477
If we get swayed by them,
that means we're losing.

451
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,062
Just hang in there.

452
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,065
-Captain.
-Yes?

453
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,483
I'm sorry.

454
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,863
I don't feel very well.

455
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,740
Can I let it out a little?

456
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,117
Sure. Go ahead.

457
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,663
Damn it!

458
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,175
Hey… My goodness.

459
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,388
Damn it.

460
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,357
You bastard! Why would you ask me
about my brother, you asshole?

461
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,196
If you mess with my family again,
I swear I won't stay still.

462
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,449
I'm going to kill you all!
You darn bastards!

463
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,746
You assholes!

464
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,921
I feel a lot better.

465
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,926
-I'm okay now.
-Oh, okay. Good job. But…

466
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,720
I'll pay for the damages.

467
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,263
No, you don't need to…

468
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,559
You punk. You don't even

469
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,104
make that much money.

470
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,231
I'll pay instead.

471
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,528
Do you think you're all that
just because you work behind a desk?

472
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,238
Hey, come on.

473
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,698
Gosh, those jerks.

474
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,825
Why are you accusing innocent people?

475
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,744
Why would you do that?

476
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,164
-You darn monkeys!
-Oh, my gosh.

477
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:24,585
You assholes!
All you ever do is talk shit!

478
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,213
-You jerks!
-Hey, that's mine!

479
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,341
Just let him continue.
I'll pay for that much.

480
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,300
Go ahead.

481
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,681
Thank you.

482
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,730
Yes, Chief Moon.

483
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,025
What did you just say?

484
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,700
Do you admit that you fabricated
your abduction with Park Gun-ho recently?

485
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,078
But why didn't the cops
carry out an investigation?

486
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,998
Did Detective Kang help you?

487
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't know.

488
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:09,088
By any chance, did Detective Kang
ever ask you for something?

489
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,299
-What?
-You know what I mean.

490
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,843
He's also a man with desires.

491
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,515
Eun-hye.

492
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:27,023
I want you to repeat
exactly what you just said to her.

493
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,399
If you leave out a single word,

494
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,444
I swear I'll kill both of you.

495
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,655
We just asked her a few things

496
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,449
about Lee Dae-cheol's case.

497
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,326
Eun-hye recently lost her father.

498
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,786
Why would you hurt her again?

499
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,537
Why?

500
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,664
Why?

501
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,544
You really need to calm down.

502
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,298
Is it because you're scared
that your relationship might be revealed?

503
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,302
You guys are unbelievable.

504
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,054
What do you think you're doing?

505
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,981
I asked you what you're doing.

506
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,945
Why are you getting in the way
of our detectives doing their jobs?

507
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,571
This is our job.

508
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,032
Then why didn't you report anything to me?

509
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,701
Have you lost your mind
now that you're at the head office?

510
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,455
You totally ignored
the hierarchy and reporting system.

511
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,666
This is an abuse of authority, you know.

512
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,337
If you're going to mess with my boys,
I want you to write up a detailed report

513
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,798
explaining why you need to inspect them.

514
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,218
And do you think it's okay
to investigate a minor like this

515
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,387
without anyone's permission?

516
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,683
Do you want me to take this
to the Human Rights Commission?

517
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,186
You think our detectives are pushovers.

518
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,567
But while you're busy
looking into your fellow police officers,

519
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,153
they're busy arresting criminals

520
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,780
who fight with knives and hammers.

521
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:01,993
I want you

522
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,122
to remember

523
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,834
the oath you took
when you first became a cop.

524
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,378
Then you'll realize

525
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,715
who's the real cop

526
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,634
between you and him.

527
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,228
SEOBU POLICE STATION

528
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,566
Do-chang.

529
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,651
-Yes, sir.
-Come here for a second.

530
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,114
Do you see that car over there?
The license plate number is 8761.

531
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,033
Wait inside.
I'll unlock the doors for you.

532
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,660
Go on.

533
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,412
Yes, sir.

534
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,874
I want you

535
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,628
to buy her something delicious on the way.

536
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,463
Make sure you tell her I gave you this.

537
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,258
Just take it back.

538
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,136
I feel embarrassed to tell her
that you only gave this much money.

539
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,888
My gosh.

540
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,728
Are you happy now, you thief?

541
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,577
Do you want to listen to music?

542
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,538
There aren't any radio channels
that play my favorite songs at this hour.

543
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,707
Oh, really?

544
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,878
Well… Then… Do you need anything?

545
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,506
Stop trying to do stuff for me.

546
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,882
You already helped me enough.

547
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,134
I'm not the one
who's trying to buy something for you.

548
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,345
The chief gave me money.

549
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,555
I'm not the one
who's trying to get you something.

550
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,934
Well, then…

551
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,604
I guess we'll just buy some meat
and eat it at home.

552
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,276
Well, there is something I want to buy.

553
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,404
What? What is it? Go ahead and tell me.

554
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,531
The chief gave me a lot of money.

555
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,616
What is it? What do you want to buy?

556
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,580
Do you need anything else?

557
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,665
No, I'm good.

558
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,917
I'll carry the plaster cast.
You can wait outside.

559
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,632
-How much is it?
-It's 168,000 won.

560
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,968
-Here.
-Thank you.

561
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,306
Your daughter must be getting ready
to go to an art school.

562
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,474
No, she just enjoys drawing.

563
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:38,357
Are these the stuff people get
in order to get into art school?

564
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,026
Yes, of course.

565
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
I see.

566
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,990
We still have some money left.

567
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,701
Should we buy a cake

568
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,662
and have a party?

569
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,581
Why would we have a party?

570
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,417
Well, I mean…

571
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,420
The weather is a lot warmer.

572
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,213
Sure.

573
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,424
Okay, nice.

574
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,552
There's an amazing bakery up on the hill.

575
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,511
Let's buy it there.

576
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,058
Don't you think you'll freak out
if you wake up in the middle of the night

577
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,434
and see this plaster cast?

578
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,394
Why would that scare you?
You're a detective.

579
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,688
I get scared easily. I'm scared of ghosts.

580
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,523
There are no ghosts.

581
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,360
Ghosts really do exist.
There's one that stalks me.

582
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,819
She's pretty.

583
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,322
I guess ghosts have good taste in men.

584
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,199
That's absurd.

585
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,493
What? My goodness.

586
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,621
You've never been to the amazing bakery
up on that hill, have you?

587
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,955
No.

588
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,833
If you buy three,
they give you one for free.

589
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,461
-Really?
-Yes, really. My gosh.

590
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,921
Why don't you ever believe me?

591
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,005
How generous of them.

592
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,215
You can even collect points.

593
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh, really?

594
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,676
Guess how many points you get
for buying a piece of bread.

595
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,636
Three points?

596
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,308
That's too little.

597
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,811
They should at least give ten points.

598
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,356
SEOBU POLICE STATION

599
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,859
Jong-tae will never confess
that he incited murder.

600
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,362
There are powerful men
helping him from behind.

601
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,030
So he has no reason to confess.

602
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,117
The biggest reason why the prosecutor
rejected the arrest warrant

603
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,285
is because he thinks he lacks
the motive for murder.

604
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,788
If we find clear evidence

605
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,374
behind Yoon Ji-seon
and Jang Jin-su's murder,

606
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,042
that will prove Jong-tae's motive.

607
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,629
But didn't we prove everything
during Lee Dae-cheol's retrial?

608
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,630
No.

609
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,926
We only focused on the fact that we didn't
investigate the case properly.

610
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,929
There wasn't enough evidence to prove
that Oh Jong-tae was the culprit.

611
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,641
Do you think we can find anything
regarding what happened six years ago?

612
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,685
We need to find something no matter what.

613
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,396
My goal isn't to get him locked up
for inciting murder.

614
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,732
We need to prove
that he framed Lee Dae-cheol

615
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,570
so that everyone finds out
that Lee Dae-cheol died innocent.

616
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,823
Yes, you're right.
We should help him rest in peace.

617
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:55,077
During the retrial, we were able to prove
that Nam Guk-hyeon fabricated the case.

618
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,664
Nam Guk-hyeon found Oh Jong-tae's watch
at the crime scene,

619
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:02,001
and that's how they started
working together.

620
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,003
Oh Jong-tae's father,

621
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,173
my uncle,

622
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,051
probably paid Nam Guk-hyeon
in return for covering up the case.

623
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,804
But it would've taken more than that watch

624
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:18,100
to make my uncle believe
that his son committed murder.

625
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,230
It means Nam Guk-hyeon showed him
additional evidence to prove his point.

626
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,359
And you think
Nam Guk-hyeon still has that evidence?

627
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,654
Wouldn't he have gotten rid of it?

628
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,323
Why would he keep it?

629
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,242
He even kept the watch he found
at the crime scene.

630
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,246
If he wanted to use it against Oh Jong-tae
for as long as he could,

631
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,166
it's highly likely that he still has it.

632
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,046
Okay, let's try to find it then.

633
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,256
Don't even miss
the smallest piece of evidence.

634
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,177
We went through so much to get this far.

635
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,304
If Oh Jong-tae gets away again,

636
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,890
it'll be pretty damn humiliating.
Right, guys?

637
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,517
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

638
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,489
Hey, it's me.

639
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,868
Team Two started mentioning Nam Guk-hyeon.

640
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,831
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

641
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,167
Is this Detective Nam Guk-hyeon's house?

642
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,835
Yes. How may I help?

643
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,630
We used to work with him
at the same police station.

644
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,590
We need to investigate a few things.

645
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,217
Can we look inside the house?

646
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,510
What is this about?

647
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,395
We have no choice, ma'am.

648
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,522
Please cooperate.

649
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,194
Thank you.

650
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,491
I can't believe this.

651
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,371
I haven't talked to him in a long time.

652
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,249
Oh, okay.

653
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,253
If Guk-hyeon ever calls you,
please let me know.

654
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,631
Okay, sure.
But why are you looking for him?

655
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,383
Doesn't he work with you guys?

656
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,968
He quit his job.

657
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,221
-Why?
-He's hiding too many things.

658
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,099
He quit his job and went into hiding

659
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,475
so that no one would find out.

660
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,647
Does that mean
he might also be hiding the truth

661
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,567
behind my late husband's death?

662
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,655
It's highly possible
that he knows what happened.

663
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,658
I see.

664
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,203
I guess he was
hiding a lot of things from me.

665
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,709
Hyeon-ju recently asked me

666
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:53,714
if her father was really killed
by the guy who got executed.

667
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,425
I told her "yes"
because I didn't know what else to say.

668
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,594
But I couldn't sleep that night.

669
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,389
I felt really bad

670
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,100
for Lee Dae-cheol.

671
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,355
We'll find the real culprit.

672
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,526
We'll find the culprit no matter what
for Jin-su's sake.

673
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,667
I came in a hurry,
so I couldn't prepare a lot of money.

674
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,543
Gosh, I don't need anything.

675
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,672
I'm just sorry
for making you go through this.

676
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,798
Take it.

677
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,509
I have nothing against you.

678
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,802
I'm

679
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,054
really sorry, Guk-hyeon.

680
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,848
I'll call you from time to time.

681
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,893
Just keep me updated on what Do-chang
and Ji-hyeok are up to.

682
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,272
-Take it.
-Thank you for this.

683
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,488
By the way, why do you think
Do-chang and Ji-hyeok are still obsessed

684
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,573
with Lee Dae-cheol's case?

685
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,701
Is there something we haven't found out?

686
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,667
No, there's nothing.

687
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,420
What you know is all there is.

688
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,839
They're just wasting their time.

689
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,509
Don't worry about it.

690
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,885
Okay.

691
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,392
NOVEMBER 11, 2015

692
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,477
THE PLACE WHERE JANG JIN-SU'S BODY
WAS ABANDONED

693
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:09,308
NOVEMBER 11, 2015
SCENE OF JANG JIN-SU'S MURDER

694
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,144
GAWOL CHURCH

695
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,188
I'm Oh Ji-hyeok,
Criminal Investigation Division.

696
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,983
Did you find Detective Jang Jin-su's body?

697
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,278
-Was it an accidental murder?
-Probably.

698
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,156
Who would've planned to kill
a police detective?

699
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,369
There are CCTVs installed
every ten minutes

700
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,540
at 60km per hour on each side of the road.

701
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,210
The culprit would have buried the body
on the right side of the road

702
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,753
within a ten-minute drive from here.

703
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,297
There's a precinct station on the left
within that distance.

704
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,425
The culprit would have gone the other way.

705
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,514
It took 8 minutes and 20 seconds
to get here from the crime scene.

706
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,309
There weren't any CCTVs on my way here.

707
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,356
The culprit would have
parked the car there.

708
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,192
That’s the only place
where you can park a car

709
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,569
and keep it hidden from the road.

710
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,488
And if the culprit moved the body alone…

711
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,286
It's probably here since there's no slope.

712
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,874
It looks like you studied hard
about crime scenes.

713
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,794
But things are different in real life.

714
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,058
-Hurry!
-Come on!

715
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,727
-Get moving!
-Let's go!

716
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,689
-Hurry!
-Keep searching!

717
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,816
-Search thoroughly!
-Get moving!

718
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,484
Let's go!

719
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,070
-Keep looking!
-Look over there!

720
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,948
We did our job. Let's go.

721
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,285
Okay. I'll stay here
until we find the body.

722
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,869
Hey! Look over here!

723
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,372
Those bastards
at the criminal investigation unit.

724
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,000
They always want to jump on the bandwagon.

725
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,418
-That punk.
-Over here!

726
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:11,638
Once the body is found,
we will put your name on the report.

727
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,016
So just go home.

728
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,978
-Over there.
-What's there?

729
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,147
-Come on!
-Make sure you don't harm the crime scene!

730
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,398
Let's go!

731
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,192
Move back! Don't touch anything
until forensics gets here!

732
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,986
-Come on.
-I told you to move back!

733
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,446
Move. Move aside.

734
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,614
Out of the way.

735
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,324
Move. Get out of the way.

736
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,908
Wait. What's that?

737
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,446
KOREA PRESS FOUNDATION

738
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,490
Hello, Ms. Kim Myeong-seon?

739
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,741
It's me, Jin Seo-kyung.

740
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,660
I read your email.

741
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,039
Yes, I totally understand
why you think it's unfair.

742
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,419
I'll interview the people
who were involved and call you back.

743
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,257
Okay. Thank you for your report.

744
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,802
Ms. Jin.

745
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,971
-Yes?
-It's nice that you're receiving reports.

746
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,141
But shouldn't you focus on
what you've been working on?

747
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,518
What are you talking about?

748
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,186
Kim Gi-tae's second trial is coming up.

749
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,188
You wrote an exclusive,
so you should handle it.

750
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,191
All you need to do is make a few calls.

751
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,484
Exactly.

752
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,529
I want you to make those calls yourself.

753
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,121
Okay, fine. I'll do as I'm told.

754
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,296
It's me, Jin Seo-kyung.

755
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,673
The second trial?

756
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,967
There's nothing I can do.

757
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,010
You have a strong connection
with the prosecution.

758
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,387
What do you think will happen?

759
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,597
Do you think they'll raise an issue
with your acquittal

760
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,974
or come up with a new suspicion?

761
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,144
I go to church these days.

762
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,479
All I can do is pray.

763
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,149
If Mr. Yoo asks how I'm doing,

764
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,526
tell him that I'm praying all the time

765
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,612
and wishes that he'll be merciful with me.

766
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,992
I need to receive a sacrament
of reconciliation. I'll talk to you later.

767
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,293
What's gotten into him?
Why is he suddenly acting so humble?

768
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,733
SEARCH NAME: OH JONG-TAE

769
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,360
The car was scrapped on November 14, 2015.

770
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,612
The car owner was Oh Jong-tae.

771
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,614
Is this the car you're looking for?

772
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:19,826
Yes. Do you remember who came
to scrap the car?

773
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,872
By any chance,
was this car at a crime scene?

774
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,874
Do you remember anything?

775
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:30,378
Yes, some guy drove the car here
and asked us to scrap the car.

776
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:34,132
And on the same day, a detective came
and took evidence from the car.

777
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,345
What happened after that?
Did you hear anything from him?

778
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,556
The detective asked me to leave the car
saying it's important evidence.

779
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,559
But he never called after that.

780
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,978
So we scrapped the car
after about three days.

781
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,315
It was Nam Guk-hyeon.

782
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,111
He used the evidence he found in the car
to blackmail Oh Jong-tae.

783
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,616
By any chance, was it him?

784
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,996
I'm not sure. It was too long ago.

785
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,415
Please try to remember.
It's very important.

786
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,876
Detectives all tend to look similar.

787
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,920
Gosh, I'm sorry.

788
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,088
Okay.

789
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,466
Please call us if you remember anything.

790
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,467
Okay.

791
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,010
-Thank you.
-No problem.

792
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,263
Didn't that detective

793
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,306
get murdered?

794
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,268
I watched the news a few days after that,

795
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,478
and I saw on the news
that he was murdered.

796
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,273
Back then, I still remembered his face.

797
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,193
Jang Jin-su?

798
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:41,116
This means Jang Jin-su and Nam Guk-hyeon
could've been in this together.

799
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,536
Now that we know
that Jin-su took the evidence,

800
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,454
we need to hurry up and find it.

801
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,836
Hey, Jae-hong. Did you find anything else?

802
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,715
I want you to look into
Jang Jin-su's surroundings.

803
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:57,799
Yes.

804
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,765
Did you find any additional evidence
while preparing for the second trial?

805
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,850
No, not really.

806
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,895
Did you forget that I was the one
who gave you the evidence

807
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,688
regarding Kim Gi-tae's irregularities?

808
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,858
If he gets acquitted in the second trial,
it'll make me look like a fool.

809
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,652
Aren't we on the same boat here?

810
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,779
We're trying to find what we can,

811
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,489
but it's not easy.

812
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,951
Tell me what you found.
I don't care if it's minor.

813
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,912
Who knows? I might be of help.

814
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,082
I'll ask for your permission
before we publish an article.

815
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,171
Kim Gi-tae

816
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,340
isn't easy to fight against.

817
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:43,011
All his lawyers used to work
as prosecutors or judges.

818
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,347
And he has great sources.

819
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,103
Back when he was in office,

820
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,438
he even received reports

821
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,732
regarding the executives
of all the major newspaper firms.

826
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,423
I'm showing you because it has information
regarding Jeonghan Daily.

827
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,092
It's for reference.

WENT TO NAMHYEON-GU, INCHEON
FOR AN INTERVIEW

829
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:28,431
ON NOVEMBER 9, 2015

830
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,648
What's your plan for the election?

831
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,526
I promised not to run for office
when I became the Minister of Justice.

832
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,905
-Then what about the local constituency?
-I plan to hand it over to Mr. Nam.

833
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,031
It's time he got a badge.

834
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:50,870
Hello.

835
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,499
My acquaintance told me he saw you guys.

836
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,750
So I came to say hello.

837
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,753
Oh, hello. Have you been well?

838
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,671
Yes, thanks to you.

839
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,174
Can I pour you a glass, sir?

840
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,759
Sure.

841
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,726
I've upset you once, haven't I?

842
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,270
It's all in the past.

843
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,982
It looks like you're not over it yet.

844
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,610
Well, I hope you get over it.
Your brother and I are on good terms now.

845
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,198
How exactly are you

846
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,701
on good terms with my brother?

847
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,287
Relationships tend to become stronger

848
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:36,583
once you forgive each other
after a conflict.

849
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,337
And I believe that my connection
with your brother

850
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,632
also leads to you.

851
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,471
Am I being too greedy?

852
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,902

A VIOLENT CRIMES DETECTIVE
AT INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION FOUND DEAD

861
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,902
A DETECTIVE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER
OF A FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT WAS FOUND DEAD

862
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:51,616
HE WAS BURIED
AFTER HE WAS STABBED TO DEATH ON THE 9TH

863
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,623
I'm sorry. I need to get going now.

864
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,001
Yes, I bet you're busy.

865
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:07,298
I'll stay here and finish the drink
with your brother.

866
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,967
Sure. Go ahead.

867
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,261
I'll see you again, sir.

868
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,846
I'll call you.

869
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,272
He wasn't like that
when he was an assemblyman.

870
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,899
He's very charismatic.

871
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,407
Have a drink.

872
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:33,992
Okay.

873
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,880
Your glass is way too small
to hold my drink.

874
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,014
It looks like we're done with the alcohol,
so I'll be off now.

875
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,368
We couldn't find anything
at Detective Jang's house.

876
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,996
I asked the guys to search
his parents' house in the countryside

877
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,581
including his acquaintances.

878
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,041
They'll call if they find anything.

879
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,376
Where did he hide the evidence?

880
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,545
But wait a minute.

881
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:32,342
The fact that Detective Jang
had that evidence

882
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,595
means he wasn't so innocent either.

883
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,806
It means he and Captain Nam

884
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,392
both used that evidence to receive money.

885
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,395
No, his wife told us

886
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,105
that he never gave her money.

887
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,399
If he really received money,

888
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,402
he wouldn't have made her work
to pay for her daughter's academy.

889
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,740
Maybe she lied to make us think
that Detective Jang is innocent.

890
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,119
No, she's not that type of person.

891
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,414
And Jin-su isn't the type of guy
to receive dirty money from anyone.

892
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,834
Some guy tried to bribe him
a long time ago,

893
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,838
and he accepted it because he was drunk.
But the next morning, he found it

894
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,632
and took it to the evidence room.

895
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,592
So there's no way…

896
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,974
The evidence room.

897
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,310
Do you think it's still here?

898
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,563
It wasn't used in court.

899
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,190
If it wasn't handed over
to the prosecution,

900
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,025
it's probably still here.

902
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,739
It's here.

903
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,425
Here it is.

904
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,296
If this turns out to be

905
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,967
Yoon Ji-seon and Oh Jong-tae's DNA…

906
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,765
It becomes clear
that Oh Jong-tae killed Yoon Ji-seon.

907
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,310
And it gives him a clear motive
to murder Park Gun-ho.

908
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,938
Now, we need to figure out
who killed Jang Jin-su.

909
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,067
Oh Jong-tae could have killed
both Yoon Ji-seon and Jang Jin-su.

910
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,152
Yes, it's highly possible.

911
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,780
But it could have been someone else.

912
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,160
The guy who received money from Jong-tae
and framed Lee Dae-cheol for his crime.

913
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,329
Nam Guk-hyeon.

914
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:12,377
When Jang Jin-su found out
that Oh Jong-tae was the real culprit,

915
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,672
Nam Guk-hyeon killed him
to hide his irregularity.

916
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,884
It's time you accept
that it could be a possibility.

917
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,829
What do you want?

918
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,331
I clearly told you not to call me again.

919
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,418
I didn't want to call you,
but things keep happening.

920
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,754
I want you to help me

921
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,798
just this once.

922
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:05,012
I want to find the guy
who killed Jang Jin-su.

931
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,541
WENT TO NAMHYEON-GU, INCHEON
FOR AN INTERVIEW

932
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,975
Mr. Yoo, what in the world happened here?

933
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,921
Can you do a background check?
Jo Seong-gi. He used to be a cop.

934
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:02,964
You figured it out.

935
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,298
When did you last contact him?

936
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,385
The day your fellow detective died.

937
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,136
Almost everyone from Team Two is here.

938
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,472
They will soon find out the truth
behind Lee Dae-cheol's case.

939
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,100
-Why did you set this up?
-I know it's too late,

940
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,685
but I want to find the real culprit.

941
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,229
You look familiar. Where did I see you?

942
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,481
You made my dad die.

943
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:24,068
You darn jerk! Bring my dad back to life!

944
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,570
We got Oh Jong-tae's arrest warrant.

945
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,990
Do I really have to run from the cops?
It's humiliating.

946
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:33,077
Minister, don't you think we should stop
the culprit from confessing the truth?

947
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,998
You're under arrest
for instigating Park Gun-ho's murder.

948
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:43,421
