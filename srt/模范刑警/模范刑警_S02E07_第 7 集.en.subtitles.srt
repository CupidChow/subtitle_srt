00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,505
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,680
Na-na!

4
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,974
The shot is in the drawer.

5
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,100
The shot…

6
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,650
Will you be okay?

7
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,611
Yes, I'm fine.

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,822
I missed the time
because work was so busy.

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,115
I'll be okay.

10
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,867
This never happened before.

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,119
Let's go get checked at the hospital.

12
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,624
Tae-ho.

13
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,670
I need you.

14
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,299
I'm sure you know better than anyone

15
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,385
that those people…

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,058
will come after me.

17
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,311
Especially my brother.

18
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,065
He's capable of anything.

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,651
I'm scared.

20
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,363
Sang-woo is not our problem, Na-na.

21
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,406
Do you know how scared I was

22
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,868
when I was alone in America?

23
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,288
I couldn't even go home.

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,209
I stayed at a different hotel every day.

25
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,379
In case he came to kill me.

26
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,801
Na-na.

27
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,720
You're just extra sensitive right now.

28
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,888
Once you get some rest…

29
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,230
Let's send Sang-woo.

30
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,193
To where my dad is right now.

31
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,115
Let's uncover the case from two years ago.

32
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,075
The abuse and attempted murder.

33
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,288
It should be enough to send him to jail
for a few years.

34
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,210
That case is already closed.

35
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,714
No. There's a detective
who's still digging into it.

36
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,631
We can do this.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,342
Na-na.

38
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,139
That case is related to me too.

39
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,809
If Sang-woo goes to jail, I will too.

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,603
All you did was help him.

41
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,397
Tampering with evidence at worst.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,525
Aren't you able to get yourself
out of that, Prosecutor?

43
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,155
Everything will collapse.

44
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,408
We will build it again.

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,786
You and me.

46
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,623
Together.

47
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,763
But if we send her away
in this situation--

48
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,389
She's better off gone.

49
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,183
Let's send Sang-woo.

50
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,894
To where my dad is right now.

51
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,938
We will build it again.

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,441
You and me.

53
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,277
Together.

54
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,379
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

55
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,735
-Explain to me the man in the footage.
-Wait…

56
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,570
Who is that?

57
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,740
The man dragging the woman is
Cheon Sang-woo, the vice-chairman of TJ.

58
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,869
The one in this shot is Woo Tae-ho,
director of their legal team.

59
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,954
The son-in-law.

60
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,420
Why would you dig up crap like this

61
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,629
for Jung Hui-ju's case?

62
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,799
I was working on this while
at Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,553
I would've arrested Cheon Sang-woo
if I had this footage back then.

64
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,848
Why don't you go back to
the investigation division then?

65
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,059
Go back and solve this case, okay?

66
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,771
Why would you bring this nuclear bomb
to us when it doesn't concern us?

67
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,481
One thing is for sure.

68
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,984
This video is key to finding the motive
of Jung Hui-ju's murder.

69
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,405
Do you mean one of those two men
could be the murderer?

70
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,364
It's highly likely.

71
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,575
This is on a whole other level.

72
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,035
They're real big shots.

73
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,411
"Real big shots"?

74
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,998
They are the biggest of all the big shots.

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,126
If we act rashly, we could be annihilated.

76
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,796
We can't even be buried.
We'll be turned into specks of dust.

77
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,648
You sent him, right?

78
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,484
Why do you have that?

79
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,235
You said all you did was look at it.

80
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,863
Why do you have that?

81
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,032
Did you send that man to kill me?

82
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,951
I just sent him to check on you.

83
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,371
In case you had something about me
that you didn't need.

84
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,748
Turns out I was right.

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,503
You were trying to stab me in the back.

86
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,463
I kept it as insurance.

87
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,425
I did it to survive.

88
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,515
Did you or did you not
show it to someone else?

89
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,266
I didn't.

90
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,936
I had no reason to.

91
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,693
Anyway, about you getting hurt…

92
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,113
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,282
I never ordered him to do that.

94
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,076
Now you know better.

95
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,703
Don't even think of messing

96
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,206
with me and Su-yeon.

97
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,207
Min-ji.

98
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,877
You were in the wrong first place.

99
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,004
It's all because of your greed.

100
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,008
This could cut your ties to me completely.

101
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,345
Hold onto that string with all your might.

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,098
If you let go,

103
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,393
I'll cut your ties to the child too.

104
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,019
Mark my words.

105
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,613
Look at me. Look!

106
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,615
You lowlife bitch.

107
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,576
You dirty whore!

108
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,411
You filthy bitch!

109
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,249
Please don't kill me.

110
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,917
How dare you…

111
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,421
How dare you…

112
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,756
How dare you!

113
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,009
How is she my kid?

114
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:48,926
How?

115
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,430
It's your kid!

116
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,848
Yours!

117
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,394
Come here. The kid is your filthy blood.

118
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
It has nothing to do with me!

119
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,357
Die. Just die!

120
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,442
Die!

121
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,122
Don't kill me.

122
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,750
Don't kill me.

123
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,461
Please let me live.

124
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,587
Please.

125
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,313
I thought you quit.
Did you fall off the wagon?

126
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,731
Take a seat.

127
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,907
Drinking won't help
with your failing business.

128
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,826
Business is great these days.
We're well established now.

129
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,203
Why are you drinking then?

130
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,081
Drinking when business is good
is much more dangerous.

131
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,085
Earlier today,

132
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,839
I called to ask about Eun-hye's
GED results out of curiosity.

133
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,260
-Did she fail?
-I wish that was the case.

134
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,971
Apparently, she didn't even show up.

135
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,348
She slipped off somewhere else that day.

136
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,142
-What?
-All this time,

137
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,352
she was pretending to study.

138
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,063
That's nonsense.
Eun-hye isn't one to do that.

139
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,523
Why didn't she go then?

140
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,108
Did you ask her why she did that?

141
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,236
If she were my kid,
I would've already beat it out of her.

142
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,862
But she's not.

143
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,242
I can't help but think
if I have the right to get involved.

144
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,916
Gosh, I'm stumped.
I don't know what our boundaries are.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,043
Exactly how much can we demand from her?

146
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,005
We're her parents.
We should scold her when needed.

147
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,507
I think the problem lies with you.

148
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
How?

149
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,551
What did I do?

150
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,387
Making her pick up studying again
was a mistake.

151
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,223
Your high hopes for her

152
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,891
forced her to play along.

153
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,477
I say

154
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,606
we sweep this one under the rug.

155
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,650
We'll have her work at the store
and once she's older,

156
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,110
let's have her move out.

157
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,404
That may be what's best for her.

158
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,907
-Who gave you the right?
-Be quiet.

159
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,077
Who are you to judge her?

160
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,871
Eun-hye is really smart.

161
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,081
She's also a great artist.

162
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,376
-Why let it go to waste?
-Her talent means nothing.

163
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,337
Think about her upbringing.

164
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,173
She grew up far from academia.

165
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,717
It's not something you can force.

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,010
From now on,

167
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,763
if you make her work at your store,
you're dead meat.

168
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,391
Don't let her do anything
but study, got it?

169
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,976
Eun-hye.

170
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,561
Eun-hye!

171
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,563
Darn it.

172
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,649
Eun-hye, what in the world…

173
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,108
Please lower your voice.

174
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,446
Jae-ung, you need to sleep in your room.

175
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,739
Come on, get up.

176
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,616
Get on my back.

177
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,082
Let me take him to his bed. I'll be quick.

178
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,792
Okay, go on.

179
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,063
GED STUDY GUIDE

180
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,783
Eun-hye.

181
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,285
Why didn't you take the GED?

182
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,455
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,626
How will I face your father later
if you keep straying like this?

184
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,129
That punk…

185
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,589
The one who extorted money from you.

186
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,508
It's because you hang with punks…

187
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,552
I heard everything Ms. Kang said.

188
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,220
She was right about everything.

189
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,431
I really don't want to study.

190
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,391
Do you think anyone wants to study?

191
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,685
You do it for your future.

192
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,106
Do I even deserve that?

193
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,860
-Why not?
-Mr. Kang.

194
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:21,240
Living with you, Ms. Kang, and Jae-ung…

195
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,910
I really love it.

196
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,040
But I feel like a burden to you.

197
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,212
That pains me so much.

198
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,301
I'm really not worth it.

199
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,267
I see I've pressured you too much.

200
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,147
You can always take the GED again.

201
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,275
There's another one in six months.

202
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,653
Just one more time.

203
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
Can you give it one more try?

204
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,035
Okay, I'll think about it.

205
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,755
You've shed too many tears until now.

206
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,467
There's no need to cry anymore.

207
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,310
Why are you telling me this now?

208
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,062
How can you keep that from me?

209
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,105
You made me doubt Eun-hye!

210
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,900
I was worried you'd do something stupid.

211
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,655
To hell with investigating.

212
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,031
She tried to frame Eun-hye?

213
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,991
That darn brat, Jang Yu-na.

214
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,743
She's been tried and put in jail.

215
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,287
What about the darn cop
who arrested Eun-hye?

216
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,664
She was heading to the exam!

217
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,625
He's the one who exonerated her charges.

218
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,878
He even got Jang Yu-na
charged with perjury.

219
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,051
Come to think of it,
you piss me off that most.

220
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,887
Why did Eun-hye call you instead of me?

221
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,139
I thought you were a little sketchy.

222
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,184
I found it strange
since she brought you to the precinct.

223
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,936
Why did she reach out to you first?

224
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,438
Gosh! It's because I'm the easy target.

225
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,274
Why are you the easy target?

226
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,943
I should feel more comfortable
and easy for her!

227
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,363
What's with all the shouting?
It's not like you did something well.

228
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,116
Hey.

229
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,495
Did you forget
you're both on the waitlist?

230
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,623
Shouldn't you be keeping your heads down?

231
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,417
If you both continue to run wild,

232
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,335
how would people think of me?

233
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,005
We hear you. I'm sorry.

234
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,593
Hey, Do-chang.

235
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,682
I'm worried sick.

236
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,103
You don't think that punk, Jae-hong
is secretly seeing my daughter, right?

237
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,771
Of course not.

238
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,983
Bo-gyeong is a catch.
She would never like a guy like him.

239
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,735
Right?

240
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,696
You're right.

241
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,742
She might have low standards,
but she wouldn't like that anchovy head.

242
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,790
Wait a minute.

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,753
You were also at the fried chicken store

244
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,213
the day Bo-gyeong got drunk, right?

245
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,801
Yes, but the encounter was brief.

246
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,639
Don't tell me you're the handsome guy
she was talking about…

247
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,682
I have a favor.

248
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,144
I desperately need your help.

249
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,021
What is it? Wait…

250
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,817
How did you get Bo-gyeong
into such an elite university?

251
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,611
If she took after your genes

252
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,112
that should've been impossible.

253
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,740
So how in the world did you do it?

254
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,410
Why all of a sudden?

255
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,997
Are you thinking
of taking the CSAT to go to university?

256
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,207
It's for Eun-hye.

257
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,125
Right, Eun-hye.

258
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,377
All right.

259
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,631
It's not only up to the kid.

260
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,883
The father plays an essential role.

261
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,557
Hello.

262
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,685
Hey, what brings you here?

263
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,521
I'm sorry to barge in,

264
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,565
but the front of these shoes are
a bit tight.

265
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,900
Let me see.

266
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,332
Isn't it tough for you?

267
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,044
Are you here because you're struggling?

268
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,923
What's weighing you down?

269
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,805
I get annoyed and angry at myself.

270
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,059
I wish I could just disappear.

271
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,561
Why?

272
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,647
Because I'm completely useless.

273
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,824
It's all done. Try it on.

274
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,830
Much better, right?

275
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,957
Yes, it fits much better.

276
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,085
I didn't do anything to it though.

277
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,379
I was only pretending to fix it.

278
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,465
-They're exactly the same as before.
-What?

279
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,762
Come to me
if you ever need someone to talk to.

280
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,514
Seeing you makes me happy too.

281
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,391
Seeing me?

282
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,768
Why?

283
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,311
No reason.

284
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,483
If your existence brings joy to someone,

285
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,401
then that's the reason.

286
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,824
I'm so grateful to Hui-ju.

287
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,204
She was always by my side
while she was alive.

288
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,959
Detective Kang lights up
whenever he talks about you.

289
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,254
There's no reason.

290
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,715
It's simply because you're by his side.

291
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,138
This video is from your laptop.

292
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,181
Is this why

293
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,642
Gi Dong-jae came to see you?

294
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,812
You went through my laptop
without my permission?

295
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,148
It was turned on when we arrived.
It wasn't intentional.

296
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,735
Vice-chairman Cheon Sang-woo
found out you had the video,

297
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,780
so he sent him over, right?

298
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,906
Even if…

299
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,285
you find the person who hit me,

300
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,622
I have no intention
to file a lawsuit or send him to jail.

301
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,166
Isn't that my right to decide?

302
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,546
We aren't investigating
the assault case from two years ago.

303
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,257
Our goal is to find the culprit
in Jung Hui-ju's case.

304
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,634
The content of this video isn't the point.

305
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,595
It's how this video ended up
on your laptop.

306
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,930
That's more important.

307
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,766
Woo Tae-ho was the last person
to be recorded in this video.

308
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,520
It's most likely that he had this video.

309
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,272
Did he give it to you?

310
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,023
Or was it…

311
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,609
Jung Hui-ju?

312
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,407
Was Jung Hui-ju murdered

313
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,783
because she gave this video to you,

314
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,120
who was her friend?

315
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,875
I have a daughter.

316
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,626
She's four.

317
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,670
I'm a single mother.

318
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,131
It's both hard and scary.

319
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,341
I worry about her safety.

320
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,803
I need to work harder

321
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,515
so that she can live a normal life.

322
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,560
That's why I accepted the shop.

323
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,229
It was my compensation for the abuse.

324
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,275
What did I do so wrong?

325
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,235
This video.

326
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,197
Jung Hui-ju gave it to you, right?

327
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,073
Just tell us that.

328
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,075
I don't want to talk about her.

329
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,410
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,039
Your friend Jung Hui-ju is dead.

331
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,041
We should find the person accountable.

332
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,127
She died wrongfully.

333
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,129
I'm grateful to Hui-ju.

334
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,175
It breaks my heart,

335
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,302
and I feel very bad.

336
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,180
Call me selfish,

337
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,767
but my child

338
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,269
comes before Hui-ju.

339
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,566
I have nothing more to tell you.

341
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,154
The cops saw

342
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,367
the footage of you and me
from two years ago.

343
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,370
Don't blame me.

344
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,997
They saw it because of the man you sent.

345
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,210
Why did I show up on their radar?

346
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,339
It wasn't because of Kim Min-ji.

347
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,217
Really? Are you sure?

348
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,428
They were looking into me,
and it led them to her.

349
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,180
Those were their words.

350
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,934
The cops at Incheon Seobu Station.

351
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,645
They're investigating
Jung Hui-ju's case, right?

352
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,816
-Then…
-Go off the grid for now.

353
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,318
Don't contact anyone

354
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,404
besides me.

355
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,405
No.

356
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,157
I won't contact you either.

357
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,620
If anyone betrays me,

358
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,416
that's when I'll go see you.

359
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,628
Stay healthy.

360
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,203
The video you've held onto so dearly

361
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,290
is now with the police.

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,835
They'll ask us both to come in soon.

363
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,339
I understand

364
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,134
you didn't get rid of the video
as a means to threaten me.

365
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,053
But what I don't understand is

366
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,850
why you gave it to Jung Hui-ju.

367
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,856
I admit that I held onto it.

368
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,316
But I got rid of it recently.

369
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,484
How?

370
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,569
You had Jung Hui-ju do it?

371
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,115
That means

372
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,577
it was Jung Hui-ju who leaked it.

373
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,539
How did you find out she had it?

374
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,625
That's not the point.

375
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,088
Did you not hear me tell you
that the cops have the video?

376
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,760
That video proves nothing.
It won't be a problem.

377
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,053
Maybe.

378
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,515
As long as you don't go and testify

379
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,517
that you tampered with it.

380
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,896
When did you find out Jung Hui-ju had it?

381
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,148
I just told you!

382
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,359
That's not the point right now!

383
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,445
I understand.

384
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,618
I'll make sure
the cops don't make an issue out of this.

385
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,473
Mr. Woo.

386
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,935
Why did put you me
in charge of something so important?

387
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,571
INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION

388
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,747
I'm surprised.

389
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,791
I didn't think you'd come so easily.

390
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,459
I'm sure you're aware

391
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,422
that we obtained the video
from two years ago.

392
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,801
Circumstances point to you
being involved in the case.

393
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,344
"Circumstances"?

394
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,723
You shouldn't make rash conclusions.

395
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,933
This isn't about the case
from two years ago.

396
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,102
Our objective is…

397
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,816
to find the culprit

398
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,110
in Jung Hui-ju's case.

399
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,291
Right to privacy.

400
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,752
It's illegal to collect that.

401
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,795
You're well-versed as I expected.

402
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,925
But this belonged to a murder victim.

403
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,220
Meaning this evidence isn't private,

404
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,304
so it's legitimate.

405
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,809
If this picture was why
the victim was murdered,

406
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,562
wouldn't this be enough to be
a piece of evidence?

407
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,484
Don't you think this evidence
and circumstance would be enough

408
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,903
for a prosecutor
to grant an arrest warrant?

409
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,696
You used to be a prosecutor,

410
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,407
so I'm sure you know better.
That's why I'm asking you.

411
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,619
You're asking my opinion as a prosecutor?

412
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,919
Find the source of this picture first.

413
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,880
Who and why they took it.

414
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,840
Secure irrefutable testimony or evidence.

415
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,134
Once you've obtained the video,

416
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,303
you should double-check
the victim's testimony

417
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,847
to verify its credibility for trial.

418
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,474
Check that first.

419
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,892
Also,

420
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,728
threatening a testimony
out of someone can be

421
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,439
seen as an illegal act
and a violation of human rights.

422
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,527
I want a written form of our conversation
submitted to our legal team.

423
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,195
After discussion,

424
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,199
we'll decide whether to file a lawsuit
against the police in charge.

425
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,285
We'll inform you of this later.

426
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,536
Thank you.

427
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,965
Who was interrogating who here?

428
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,939
Prosecutors who dispute every detail
about the case in front of a cop

429
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,108
then talk about
the violation of human rights,

430
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,152
illegitimacy, and other absurd claims.

431
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,322
Do you know
what those prosecutors have in common?

432
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,574
They were solicited

433
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,577
or they have something to hide.

434
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,664
He forgot that nobody knows prosecutors

435
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,166
better than detectives.

436
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,840
Did you find Gi Dong-jae?

437
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,967
He went off the grid.

438
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,262
His number no longer exists,
and he hasn't come to work.

439
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,597
Okay, we'll come right in.

440
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,396
You boys shouldn't be holding knives
in front of cops like that.

441
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,983
Don't just stand there.
Get back to work, you punks.

442
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,820
You little bastards.

443
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,532
Call us immediately
if Gi Dong-jae comes in. Got it?

444
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,992
You better call.

445
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,539
Jae-hong. They seem tense.

446
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,502
Gi Dong-jae has them wrapped
around his finger.

447
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,089
What should we do?

448
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,133
We need Gi Dong-jae
to help kickstart our investigation.

449
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,052
What do you think?
You went after him before.

450
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,304
This guy has a long rap sheet,

451
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,889
but he got away every time.

452
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,683
And now he has Choi Yong-geun, ex-captain

453
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,936
of Criminal Investigation Division,
to coach him.

454
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,438
It'll take longer than we think.

455
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,649
He also falls under
the Gangnam jurisdiction,

456
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,858
not ours.

457
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,527
Let's ask Gangnam Station to help.

458
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,405
TJ probably already reached out to them.

459
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,407
We shouldn't even bother.

460
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,536
Should we cut the middleman
and go straight to the boss then?

461
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,620
Go against TJ?

462
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,705
My sister-in-law's husband

463
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,750
works for a subcontractor

464
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,169
who cleans TJ building's windows.

465
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,088
Actually, we have a closer connection.

466
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,714
Our chief's daughter works at TJ.

467
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,842
If this goes south,
it'll destroy our families.

468
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,927
We have to catch Gi Dong-jae first.

469
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,596
Once we do, we'll have no issues
climbing up the ladder.

470
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,267
So how can we catch him?

471
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,229
Did you forget the teaching
that all detectives know?

472
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,189
You catch gangsters with gangsters.

473
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,107
Remember?

474
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,338
Mr. Woo.

475
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,426
Here.

476
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,387
Sorry, I'm a little frazzled today.

477
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,931
-Drive safely then.
-Okay.

478
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,820
Mr. Woo.

479
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,997
Are you not feeling well?

480
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,373
No, I'm fine.

481
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,500
What is it?

482
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,543
Did something happen?

483
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,923
You think I'm pathetic too, right?

484
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,885
A man who has everything,

485
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,347
just spacing out like that.

486
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,685
I'm honestly nothing.

487
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,938
It's all fake.

488
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,775
Nothing…

489
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,820
Nothing is real.

490
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,074
Gosh, I'm talking nonsense.

491
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,911
You should go. I'm going home.

492
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,171
Where are you going?
Do you have a destination?

493
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,721
That's what I don't know.

494
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,571
Don't go anywhere right now.

495
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,157
Just rest for a bit.
I'll keep you company.

496
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,538
It was you, right?

497
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,249
Who is it?

498
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,376
Who ordered you to take the pictures?

499
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,548
Ten seconds.

500
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,676
That's all the time you have
to earn my forgiveness.

501
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,268
I'll tell you.

502
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,231
Who is it?

503
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,489
What did the cops say?

504
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,451
That video isn't enough for them
to arrest you.

505
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,497
They know that too.

506
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,748
Their objective is

507
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,250
Jung Hui-ju's case.

508
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,175
Which is completely unrelated to you.

509
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,470
You won't have to worry.

510
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,682
Okay, you can leave.

511
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,695
Do you think

512
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,407
I'm related

513
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,034
to that case?

514
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,127
I'll give you a chance.

515
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,214
If you tell me the truth now,

516
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,759
I will protect you with my life.

517
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,471
If you let go of this chance,

518
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,185
I may not be able to protect you.

519
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,152
I have no reason

520
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,198
to kill Jung Hui-ju.

521
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,285
That's a relief.

522
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,671
CHO SANG-PIL

523
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,714
Cho Sang-pil.

524
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,507
He formed the Gangnam East Gang.

525
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,135
He was killed in a private room
of a club two years ago.

526
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,304
GU JAE-CHUN

527
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,182
He was succeeded by Gu Jae-chun,
who's the current boss.

528
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,893
He's doing well thanks to
a development project in Gangnam.

529
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,062
He has two underbosses.

530
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,607
Gi Dong-jae is one of them.

531
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,817
He was our number one suspect

532
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,278
for Cho Sang-pil's murder.

533
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,074
But the executor of the Rotary Gang,
Gangnam East Gang's rival,

534
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,034
was arrested for Cho's murder.

535
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,662
Gi Dong-jae ended up getting released.
He's now second-in-command

536
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,372
and managing the butchery.

537
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,374
Why was he named as a suspect?

538
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,584
Because of a woman.

539
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,836
Cho Sang-pil had a special lady

540
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,713
but Gi Dong-jae made a move on her.

541
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,757
Did the Rotary Gang member confess?

542
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,259
It wasn't a voluntary confession.

543
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,678
-Who forced him to?
-Choi Yong-geun.

544
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,348
Ex-captain of
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

545
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,642
He retired after being charged
with corruption

546
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,727
and is now working on TJ's legal team.

547
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,189
Gi Dong-Jae and Choi Yong-geun were
in on this together then.

548
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,899
What about Gi Dong-jae's men?

549
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,276
They were an intimidating bunch.

550
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,363
They seemed ready to stab us to death
if we mess with their boss.

551
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,657
Gu Jae-chun…

552
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,662
will catch Gi Dong-jae.

553
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,790
You killed Cho Sang-pil, right?

554
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,916
What?

555
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,293
Detective Oh.

556
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,212
Who is this man?

557
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,631
Incheon Seobu's infallible Detective Kang.

558
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,676
-What?
-You killed him to become the boss, no?

559
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,220
You teamed up with a cop
to frame someone else

560
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,013
in case your lackeys retaliated.

561
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,181
Isn't that right?

562
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,059
I can see it in your eyes, you punk.

563
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,479
Seriously?

564
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,231
That case was closed ages ago.

565
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,984
Also, why are cops from Incheon

566
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,903
causing a nuisance
all the way up in Gangnam?

567
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,697
Hey. You know me, right?

568
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,284
I don't stop
once I set my mind on something.

569
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,788
I still consider Cho Sang-pil's murder
an unsolved case.

570
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,625
Why would I kill Sang-pil?

571
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,044
I'm still furious

572
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,423
that we couldn't find his killer yet.

573
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,883
Cut the crap.

574
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,135
Give me your hands.

575
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,721
Are you kidding me?

576
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,389
What the hell are you doing?

577
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,016
Do you think I'm a joke?

578
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,475
You little punk.

579
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,227
Come. Let's talk at the station.

580
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,605
This is bullshit! I didn't kill anyone.

581
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,565
What did you say? Come here, punk.

582
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,734
Do-chang.

583
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,277
Calm down.

584
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,237
We can't cuff him yet.

585
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,363
Detective Oh.

586
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,533
You can't just barge in like this
without any evidence.

587
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,826
I'm not going to sit back.

588
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,746
Handcuffs will keep you still.
Don't move or your dead meat.

589
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,123
Do-chang, stop.

590
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,249
That's enough for today.

591
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,544
He's more powerful than you think.
Just let me talk to him.

592
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,009
Gu Jae-chun. Think wisely.

593
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,845
I suggest you come
and tell us voluntarily.

594
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,848
Until then, I'll never stop chasing you.

595
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,974
Mark my words.

596
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,021
I despise punks like you the most.

597
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,399
Bastards who frame others for their crimes
and carry on living shamelessly.

598
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,860
I have my eyes on you now.
I'll be coming for you.

599
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,999
Is this my unlucky year or something?

600
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,252
Why do flies keep sticking to me?

601
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,420
Yes, Gu Jae-chun is here.

602
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,589
He's drinking right now.

603
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,634
Would you like
an accessory for your wrists?

604
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,179
It doesn't seem like he'll run.

605
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,224
I'll let you know if he tries. Bye.

606
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,477
-Let's go if you're done.
-Okay.

607
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,818
Hey, the boss is here.

608
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,244
Look over here. Yes.

609
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,579
-Is it a video call?
-Yes.

610
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,914
You're watching, right?

611
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,791
I think he was drinking.

612
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,711
Yes, the one in the middle.

613
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,047
Hey, shorty. Move aside.

614
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,591
No, I mean go back.

615
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,135
That's too much.

616
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,762
Don't you know how to stand in a line?

617
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,763
Get it together.

618
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,849
Hey. What are you doing, punk?

619
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,226
That's a good shot.

620
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,104
Let's go now.
We confirmed he's hanging in his hood.

621
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,230
Okay.

622
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,940
We'll get going then, Jae-chun.

623
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,108
Carry on having fun.

624
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,445
Damn it.

625
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,990
What's their problem?

626
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,035
Are they trying
to get a little pocket money from me

627
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,245
because my business is doing well?

628
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,706
Detective Oh is involved, Boss.

629
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,791
You know how he is.

630
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,793
He's not after money.

631
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,504
Then what is it?

632
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,882
Do you boys think I killed Sang-pil?

633
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,551
Seriously?

634
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,221
Those cops were talking about

635
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,893
how I teamed up
with a detective and framed someone.

636
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,603
Do you remember that?

637
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,396
Yes, I remember.

638
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,067
Choi Yong-geun was
the captain in charge at that time.

639
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,779
Which one of our guys is close to him?

640
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,447
He was pretty tight with Dong-jae.

641
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,200
Gi Dong-jae?

642
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,248
Did you fix it?

643
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,625
Yes, you can check.

644
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,667
It should turn on.

645
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,753
That's all I need. You can go.

646
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,046
Yes, ma'am.

647
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,073
Okay. Bye.

648
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,370
The support team called.

649
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,290
The burner cell Jung Hui-ju called.
The power came back on.

650
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,042
What?

651
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,752
Did you get the location?

652
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,129
Yes.

653
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,381
Darn it.

654
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,510
Damn it.

655
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,558
How did you find this?

656
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,270
Some lady found it at the park
and gave it to me.

657
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,772
Call it.

658
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,737
It's the burner cell.

659
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,078
So it was Cheon Sang-woo's.

660
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:01,000
And the person
who found it was Cheon Na-na.

661
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,377
Cheon Sang-woo trashed it
then Cheon Na-na found it?

662
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,879
What's the meaning of this?

663
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,506
I guess we'll have to ask them.

664
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,641
I see you've been working hard.

665
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,103
It might be enough for me
to offer up a deal.

666
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,191
It doesn't confirm anything.

667
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,069
To be charged with assault,

668
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,655
we have to prove
he beat her up in the bathroom.

669
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,449
The assault victim Kim Min-ji,

670
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,326
Mr. Woo Tae-ho who fabricated the case,

671
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,455
and the assailant,
Vice-chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

672
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,208
We can indict him if one of them talks.

673
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,587
I would gain nothing
from making a deal then.

674
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,131
Since there's no chance of indicting him.

675
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,508
What if I told you

676
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,095
that I have evidence
for murder instead of assault?

677
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,722
What would you do?

678
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,976
What murder case?

679
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
Jung Hui-ju's, of course.

680
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,148
That's related to our family too?

681
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,947
Before Jung Hui-ju was murdered,
she had a secret conversation on her cell.

682
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,491
We found that burner cell today.

683
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,538
So?

684
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,623
We also found out the owner of it.

685
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,668
Meaning we found a prime suspect.

686
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,919
Who is it?

687
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,548
The one who went
to the dumpsite of the burner cell.

688
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,134
The CCTV filmed the person paying
for their parking ticket.

689
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,264
It also filmed the person who found it.

690
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,652
What is it that you want, Ms. Cheon?

691
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,530
Do you want to reveal

692
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,949
or hide the culprit?

693
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,367
It's both.

694
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,954
You have to reveal the culprit to hide it.

695
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,457
Find the culprit.

696
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,877
And if you keep the real culprit
between us,

697
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,213
you'll have much to gain through our deal.

698
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,597
Accept all warrants requested
by Incheon Seobu Station

699
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,682
from now on.

700
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:27,021
But make sure you check
the requests thoroughly and let me know.

701
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,650
Yes. I appreciate your help.

702
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:42,953
Come in.

703
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,672
Excuse me, Mr. Woo.

704
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,134
My predecessor Jung Hui-ju's unpaid salary

705
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,969
and severance pay have been processed.

706
00:43:59,053 --> 00:43:59,887
What should I do?

707
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,430
Withdraw it in cash

708
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,141
and personally deliver it to her family.

709
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,225
Also…

710
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,108
This is compensation from the company.
Deliver this too.

711
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,655
Which of her family members
should I deliver it to?

712
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,116
Isn't that your job to find out?

713
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:22,951
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,871
Your predecessor even went to comfort
a victim's family

715
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,665
who filed a lawsuit against us…

716
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,962
When you're giving the money
to the family,

717
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,757
don't be impersonal
and try to be empathetic.

718
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,051
Or else they won't take it.

719
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,594
Get going.

720
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,304
Yes, sir.

721
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,942
Her brother might get arrested for this,

722
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,986
but she gave Cheon Sang-woo's

723
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,657
incriminating evidence to us on purpose.

724
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,243
It logically makes no sense.

725
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,578
She must want him behind bars.

726
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,624
Or she's trying
to obtain his weakness through me.

727
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,167
Are they biological siblings?

728
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,419
On paper, yes.

729
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,338
I can't understand.

730
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,132
I've never seen a sister

731
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,551
try to get her brother jailed
even if she despises him.

732
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,553
It's because you don't know these people.

733
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,472
Do you?

734
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,683
How could I not?

735
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,809
Damn you.

736
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,440
Did you show off your wealth
to Eun-hye also?

737
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,691
Come on.

738
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,111
Eun-hye doesn't trust money,
she trusts the person.

739
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,405
How are you better than me
besides your money?

740
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,366
Everything you say is unlikeable,
and you're not even funny.

741
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:49,204
I'm baffled as to why Eun-hye
always calls you for emergencies.

742
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,168
Do-chang.

743
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,462
You're not being tactical.

744
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,548
You need to give her some space
and then pull her back in.

745
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,593
You're constantly knocking at her.
That's why she repels.

746
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,807
Did Eun-hye tell you she doesn't like me?

747
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,062
She reminds you of her dad, right?

748
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,523
You feel guilty, don't you?

749
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,944
First, get rid of that guilt,
then she'll open up to you.

750
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,571
I know that too.

751
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,531
But it's not easy.

752
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,045
Throw him out.

753
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,007
-Hey, stop!
-Drive.

754
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,509
-Get those, punks!
-Get him!

755
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,427
-Hey!
-Get him up.

756
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,595
What's happening?

757
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,264
Gu Jae-chun is looking for Gi Dong-jae.

758
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,766
He found something out.

759
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,102
If not, that guy would've been dead.

760
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,440
We just need to swoop Gi Dong-jae out

761
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,402
before Gu Jae-chun kills him.

762
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,407
Yes?

763
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,742
Mr. Woo.

764
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,162
I'm at Jung Hui-ju's grandfather's store.

765
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,248
But he refuses to take the money.

766
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,919
You had one job.

767
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,463
He keeps asking to see you.

768
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,590
He has something to talk about.

769
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,884
I told him that's not possible.

770
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,928
But he insists he goes to see you
at the office.

771
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,721
What should I do?

772
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:31,932
Okay.

773
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,530
I guess he can't make it.

774
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,032
Call and tell him

775
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,201
I will go see him myself.

776
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,078
Just a second, please.

777
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,336
I'm sorry, Mr. Woo.

778
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,964
Good evening.

779
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,800
I heard you wanted to talk to me.

780
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,762
I saw Hui-ju's photo with you.

781
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,975
Give us a minute, Ms. Moon.

782
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,864
Are you the one who killed Hui-ju?

783
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,491
No, it wasn't me.

784
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,701
Then who?

785
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,456
If it's not you, tell me who did.

786
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,834
I don't know.

787
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,754
Even if you say you didn't kill her,

788
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,672
Hui-ju died because of you.

789
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,725
Did Hui-ju have feelings for you?

790
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,603
No.

791
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,315
It was me who had feelings for her.

792
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,194
You're a married man. Why?

793
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,738
I'm sorry.

794
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,668
Were you sad

795
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,005
when she died?

796
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,763
Tell me why.

797
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,016
Why did you have to like her?

798
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,688
The police will catch the culprit.

799
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,192
I will do my best to help
with the investigation.

800
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,069
I'm sorry.

801
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,951
JUNGIN SHOES

802
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,043
Mr. Woo?

803
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,006
I'm in a rush, so I'll get going first.

804
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,822
I'm sorry.

805
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,410
I'm sorry.

806
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm so sorry.

807
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,306
I'm sorry.

808
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,104
Good job today, Hui-ju.
I'm sorry I kept you back so late.

809
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,774
It's my job. Don't worry about it.

810
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,407
Yes, Vice-chairman.

811
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,206
Okay.

812
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,667
I'll have someone bring the cash over.

813
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,587
Text me the name
and the address of the club--

814
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,519
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

815
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,270
Can we get a bottle of soju, please?

816
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,313
Okay.

817
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,857
Thank you.

818
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,443
Here.

819
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,241
Drink it all up.

820
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,087
One more shot.

821
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,309
That's it.

822
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,020
I'll drink the rest of it at home.
That's okay, right?

823
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,561
Would you like a cup of coffee?

824
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,151
Na-na.

825
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,944
I…

826
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,948
will have Cheon Sang-woo handcuffed.

827
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,497
I met a detective today.

828
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,083
He suspects

829
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,086
Sang-woo is the culprit
in Jung Hui-ju's case.

830
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,840
But that's too serious of a crime.

831
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,884
I'm not confident I can handle that.

832
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:45,221
Don't you think
the assault charge will be enough?

833
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,432
No.

834
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,101
Cheon Sang-woo.

835
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:54,064
If we don't destroy him completely,
we will be in danger.

836
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,027
Do you also think he killed Jung Hui-ju?

837
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,912
Do as you wish.

838
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,998
I'll follow your decision.

839
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,408
Yong-geun.

840
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,243
Hey, you're here.

841
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,037
How have you been?

842
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,415
I'm taking a short break.

843
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,041
It's not for you, right?

844
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,252
No, it's harder than working.

845
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,590
Are you and your wife still separated?

846
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,384
We're focusing on ourselves.

847
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,637
Why do you make things so complicated?

848
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:12,017
You both have to compromise.
It becomes easier with practice.

849
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,936
I know. But my situation makes it harder.

850
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,981
You're too rigid.

851
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,859
You only look straight ahead.

852
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,445
You need to learn to look around

853
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,698
and pocket some money
for yourself along the way.

854
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,784
Nobody will award you for living upright.

855
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,286
You're right.

856
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,207
I recently helped out

857
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,335
the construction company
affiliated with TJ

858
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,421
and received this home as payment.

859
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,258
Gosh, you are in
a completely different league now.

860
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,511
You should live here.

861
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,974
I can't sell it legally
because it was gifted illegitimately.

862
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,810
I have no agenda,
so don't get the wrong idea.

863
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,020
I see.

864
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,855
I'll think about it.

865
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,609
-Gi-jin.
-Yes?

866
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,528
Let me tell you

867
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,574
what I learned from working at TJ.

868
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,660
They're all thieves.

869
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,539
What differentiates them
from the petty thieves we catch is

870
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,418
that they steal stuff that has no owner.

871
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,424
The investigation division will
reach out soon.

872
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,176
Pardon?

873
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,886
-We'll talk then.
-Wait, Yong-geun.

874
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,721
Don't overthink it.

875
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,808
Just carry on putting bad guys in jail.

876
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,360
Yes, sir.

877
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,073
Yes, I'll return
to the division immediately.

878
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,839
Twenty-two.

879
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,925
LOTTERY

880
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,846
Next number.

881
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,057
Thirty-two.

882
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,186
Okay, next.

883
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,023
-Don't tell me it's been right until now.
-Just hurry up.

884
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,819
Wait. Okay, carry on.

885
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,779
Forty-six!

886
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,953
-Damn!
-Seriously? You won 500 million won?

887
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,997
Really? The numbers match?

888
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,583
This feels bad.

889
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,210
Wow!

890
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,424
That's still third place.

891
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,302
You'll get over a million won, Ji-ung.
This is a big win.

892
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,220
I know, okay?

893
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,056
It's just that…

894
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,853
I feel like I used up all my luck on this.

895
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:02,937
I guess my life is

896
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,149
only worth one million won.

897
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,359
Stop overreacting.

898
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,112
You got one number wrong. Come on.

899
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,072
That one number could have…

900
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,534
Damn it.

901
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,706
One million…

902
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,835
Crap.

903
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,380
That's why my stomach was acting up.

904
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,049
What is it?

905
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:42,393
TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB

906
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,670
Okay. Make sure they don't notice.

907
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,423
Call me right away
if you see anything suspicious.

908
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,887
Gu Jae-chun's men are on the move too.

909
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,764
Even Gu Jae-chun joined them,

910
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,100
so it means they found Gi Dong-jae.

911
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,726
I'm curious.

912
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,229
I wonder which higher-up's name

913
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,356
Gi Dong-jae will blow when we arrest him.

914
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,817
He won't give it up easily.

915
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,820
We'll say he's free to go
if he doesn't talk.

916
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,242
He'll die in the hands
of Gu Jae-chun if we do.

917
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,161
He's safest behind bars now.

918
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:48,001
A LIFE OF SELF-REFLECTING
REFORMING THE FUTURE

919
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,802
Why did you suddenly call for me?

920
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,431
McQueen executives chose Woo Tae-ho

921
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,559
as TJ's next chairman.

922
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,603
Woo Tae-ho?

923
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,023
That's absurd. He has no right…

924
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,150
Just because McQueen chose him,

925
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,319
it doesn't mean TJ will do the same.

926
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,862
However,

927
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,699
you must acknowledge
that he's one step ahead of you.

928
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,493
Na-na is behind this.

929
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:26,414
He's just a figurehead.
She wants the power for herself.

930
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,959
Na-na is my family,
which makes her a legitimate heir too.

931
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,628
But,

932
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,422
I don't want Na-na.

933
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,133
She's aware of this.

934
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,509
That's why

935
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,639
I can never forgive her.

936
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,768
I reached out to Mr. Kang again.

937
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,646
But he adamantly refused
to take the compensation.

938
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,775
So I only transferred
her unpaid salary to his account.

939
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,696
All right, then.

940
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,121
You're not done?

941
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,917
I thought about this long and hard

942
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,836
and decided I should tell you this.

943
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,424
I didn't mean to,

944
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:23,680
but I saw you cry because of Jung Hui-ju.

945
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,059
You liked Jung Hui-ju, right?

946
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:34,774
That's why you were so heartbroken.

947
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,486
You were apologizing
because of that, right?

948
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,448
Don't think too much into this.

949
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,327
I just wanted to find out
what you were truly feeling.

950
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,580
I thought it might help clear up
my misunderstandings about you.

951
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,251
I'm sorry.

952
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,737
Yes?

953
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,282
McQueen's executives agreed
to help Woo Tae-ho become TJ's chairman.

954
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,953
Good work.

955
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,710
All right. I owe you one.

956
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,938
Call the press for me.

957
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,824
Doesn't it seem like
he's going in circles?

958
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:07,825
It does.

959
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:11,537
We're moving further away
from the location Ji-ung gave us.

960
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,955
That little punk.

961
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,291
He's been leading us away.

962
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,836
-Turn the car around.
-Okay.

963
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,776
I fully understand that our company is
in a very difficult situation.

964
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,445
I would like to apologize

965
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,406
for having to make
such an important announcement

966
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,952
during our time of crisis.

967
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,581
I plan to end

968
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,418
my eight-year marriage
and divorce my husband.

969
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,591
I would like to ask you this.

970
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,095
Please do not link my personal matters

971
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,805
with TJ's current situation.

972
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,352
What's the reason for divorce?

973
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,646
Is it about the succession issue?

974
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,147
Is this a mutual decision?

975
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,149
For how long were you thinking of divorce?

976
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,026
-Please answer us.
-Ms. Cheon!

977
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,182
The person you have called is unavailable.

978
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,855
Why, Na-na?

979
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,649
Why?

980
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,851
Hey, Do-chang.

981
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,520
His men went into the building.

982
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,897
How many are there?

983
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,024
Around 20 I think.

984
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,317
Check if Gi Dong-jae is there.

985
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,654
And stand by until we get there.

986
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,947
Make sure you wait for us.

987
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,281
Okay.

988
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,494
-What did Do-chang say?
-He said to wait.

989
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,627
I don't think they found him.

990
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,797
You're right.
They barked up the wrong tree.

991
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,882
-Darn.
-They should've made sure.

992
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,093
Those idiots wasted our time too.

993
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,054
Hey, he's in the back!
Hurry up and get out!

994
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,639
Come on.

995
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,809
You guys follow me and the rest, go right.

996
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,018
-Catch him.
-Hey, Ji-ung.

997
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,771
I think they found Gi Dong-jae.

998
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,023
What do we do?

999
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,067
What else? Let's go get him.

1000
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,610
But Do-chang said to wait.

1001
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,405
He'll be angrier if we lose him,
so let's hurry and get him.

1002
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,617
-Stop the car over there.
-Okay.

1003
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,246
Wait, where are they?

1004
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,638
Hey, go up.

1005
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,352
Hey!

1006
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,687
-Get him!
-You little punk.

1007
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,064
-Stop!
-Hey, come here!

1008
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,234
-Get over here!
-Damn it.

1009
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,820
-Where is he?
-He went out there.

1010
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,656
-Hey!
-Hurry up.

1011
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,491
-Hey!
-Stand back!

1012
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,868
-Get back!
-Come here!

1013
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,012
They're here!

1014
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,139
Stop!

1015
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,023
-Catch him!
-Get lost.

1016
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,674
Watch out.

1017
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,518
Hey!

1018
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,654
Run!

1019
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,989
Gi Dong-jae!

1020
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,866
-Crap.
-You bastards.

1021
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,055
Come here!

1022
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,314
Damn it.

1023
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,108
You darn cops.

1024
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,532
-Man-gu!
-Run!

1025
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,285
Man-gu. Are you okay?

1026
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,120
I'm okay. Go catch him!

1027
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,455
You're not okay, you punk!

1028
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,416
-You…
-I'm fine, just get him!

1029
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,042
Hey, stay with me!

1030
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,295
-Damn it.
-Get him!

1031
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:36,922
Hey!

1032
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,674
Do-chang!

1033
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:45,097
-Hey, come here.
-Crap.

1034
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,558
-Man-gu.
-Come here, you bastard!

1035
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,602
Call an ambulance. Now.

1036
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,770
-Get the first aid kit. Hurry!
-Yes, sir.

1037
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,981
-Go get him. Go!
-Okay.

1038
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,026
You're okay, Man-gu.

1039
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,069
It's nothing. You didn't get stabbed.

1040
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:00,988
It's okay. Just stay awake.

1041
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,365
Open your eyes! You're okay.

1042
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,367
I told you to wait, you punk!

1043
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,370
No.

1044
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,915
Man-gu. Hey, wake up.

1045
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,383
Let's get out of here!

1046
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,224
Come here, you bastard.

1047
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,180
Don't you run, you punk!

1048
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:23,654
Ji-ung!

1049
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,744
He went that way.

1050
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,131
Are you okay?

1051
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,605
Do-chang.

1052
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,442
-Just a second, Jae-hong.
-Yes?

1053
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:02,943
Don't leave just yet.

1054
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:03,986
Okay.

1055
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,116
Are you okay, Ji-ung?

1056
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:12,911
Is Man-gu okay?

1057
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,873
Don't worry. He's stable.

1058
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,001
You know Man-gu's a tough one.

1059
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,420
You should worry about yourself.

1060
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,088
He said we should wait.

1061
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:27,551
Man-gu said we should wait,
but I didn't listen.

1062
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,816
The culprit drove Jung Hui-ju
to the mountains to dump her body

1063
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,318
and then disappeared along with the car?

1064
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,153
I think we found an important clue.

1065
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,406
I'm more worried about us than the cops.

1066
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,033
Has it never occurred to you
that I might abandon you?

1067
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,994
Tell me how to hurt that person.

1068
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,496
Just kill that bastard.

1069
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,332
Did you find something on me?

1070
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,668
I'd like for you to stay on that case.

1071
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,170
He found evidence that proves
Cheon Sang-woo is the culprit?

1072
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,839
-What if we're wrong?
-He'll turn himself in?

1073
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,050
You know nothing about this case.

1074
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:57,307
