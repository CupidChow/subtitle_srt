1
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,026
Do you think it's him?

2
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,494
Someone sent me a CCTV footage
of Lee Dae-cheol via email.

3
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,954
It was also sent to the detective
who investigated the case.

4
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,083
If that footage was handed in
as evidence four years ago in court,

5
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,043
the judge would have reached
a different verdict.

6
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,085
Right.

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,757
Back then,
everyone's eyes were on that case.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,802
The prosecution had to win the trial
no matter what.

9
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,720
So they had no reason
to hand in the evidence

10
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,931
that could put them at a disadvantage.

11
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,558
But why…

12
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,937
Why are you suddenly telling me
that he's innocent now?

13
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,316
It will only end up
ruining your reputation.

14
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,652
I don't know.

15
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,822
Maybe it's because an innocent man
is about to die?

16
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,740
Do you have a guilty conscience?

17
00:01:56,324 --> 00:02:01,079
The recent article you wrote
regarding the victims' families.

18
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,331
Did you come up with the topic?

19
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,209
I bet someone asked you to write it.

20
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,797
I noticed that the press
only keeps talking about Cho Byeong-gil.

21
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,551
People don't even know
that Lee Dae-cheol is going to get hanged.

22
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
The person who asked you
to write that article

23
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:22,308
doesn't care whether or not
if a serial killer is executed.

24
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,477
The person he wants dead…

25
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,606
is Lee Dae-cheol.

26
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,861
Do you know what the best way
to cover up the truth is?

27
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,032
By making the victim disappear.

28
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,118
Forever.

29
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,870
Boom.

30
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:56,217
The recent article you wrote
regarding the victims' families.

31
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,177
I bet someone asked you to write it.

32
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,555
It's still off the record.

33
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,266
I want us to get a head start
before anyone reports it.

34
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,602
I want you to interview
the victims' families.

35
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,274
Should I drop you off
where I picked you up?

36
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,442
Yes.

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,531
By the way, what's your relationship
with the chief prosecutor?

38
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,909
You don't look like someone
who works for the prosecution.

39
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,912
I'm just someone who respects him.

40
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,163
I see.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,961
He went to jail in the Philippines
for robbery and murder.

42
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,256
And after he returned,
he was suspected for many other cases.

43
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,800
It's obvious he killed Park Gun-ho.

44
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,721
But what's important is how Park Gun-ho
knew about the real culprit.

45
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,933
We need to find that out
to understand why this happened.

46
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,853
But Park Gun-ho is dead.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,148
He might've told someone about it
before he died.

48
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,109
-Who?
-Lee Eun-hye.

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,613
What's her illness? Is it serious?

50
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,864
She has epilepsy.

51
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,952
It's a chronic disease, but it's not
bad enough for her to get hospitalized.

52
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,203
Then why did she get admitted?

53
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,996
Just in case.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,416
I figured if Park Gun-ho died,
she'd be the only person left

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,918
who could tell us about him.

56
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,798
Do people tell you
that you're really annoying?

57
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,759
How would I know?
They never say it to my face.

58
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,303
You're annoying.

59
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,388
You really are.

60
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,769
Are you feeling better?

61
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,358
I heard you didn't eat any food here.

62
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,319
Do you want to eat anything?
I'll get it for you.

63
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,615
Park Gun-ho was murdered.

64
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,583
Did he ever tell you
about the real culprit?

65
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,921
I'm sure you cooperated with him
because he managed

66
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,881
to convince you with something.

67
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,094
Park Gun-ho stood up for your father.

68
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,471
Don't you want us to find who killed him?

69
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,438
What the…

70
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,856
-What's going on?
-What happened?

71
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,649
It's not a big deal.

72
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,693
-She's just a patient.
-Just go.

73
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,069
She's a patient. Are you curious?

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,404
I guess it's nothing.

75
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,906
If you want to know,
go ahead and look inside. She's a patient.

76
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's talk to her again
once she calms down.

77
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,580
No, you should wait in the car.

78
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,042
Being nice to her won't make her talk.

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,502
Do you want her to have a seizure
and collapse again?

80
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,998
I don't know if you remember.

81
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,250
But I was the person

82
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,837
who arrested your dad five years ago.

83
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,009
By any chance, do you remember

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,888
the bag of mandarins

85
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,809
that was on your dinner table?

86
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
After the investigation,

87
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,733
I took your dad to the prosecution.

88
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,488
And on our way, he asked me for a favor.

89
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,283
"My daughter, Eun-hye,

90
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,036
enjoys playing video games

91
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,415
for just one hour
after she comes home from school.

92
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,085
And she always eats mandarins."

93
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,965
He thought you might throw it away
if you found out it was from him.

94
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,009
So he asked me to put it on the table

95
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,929
without letting you know about it.

96
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,517
Back then,

97
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,690
I was very convinced
that your dad was the culprit.

98
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,901
But when he told me that,

99
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,320
it made me think for a split second

100
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,576
that he might not be the culprit.

101
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,623
So once more…

102
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,254
Just once more,

103
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,798
I'm going to check

104
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,136
why that keeps bothering me.

105
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,432
Eun-hye.

106
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,311
Your father

107
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,065
will get executed soon.

108
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,215
SEJOONG MEDICAL CENTER

109
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,389
Did Eun-hye tell you anything?

110
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,517
What did she say?

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,563
Apparently, Lee Dae-cheol
asked Park Gun-ho for a favor.

112
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,318
I'm glad you finally found out the truth.

113
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,904
What do you mean?

114
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,781
What did I find out?

115
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,534
I'm bound to die soon.

116
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,202
So why would anyone

117
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,997
try to have me killed?

118
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,459
That means someone wants me dead
as fast as possible.

119
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,422
Let's make a deal.

120
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,344
I won't tell a soul about what you did.

121
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,598
Instead, please tell my daughter, Eun-hye,

122
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,143
that I didn't kill anyone.

123
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,862
Please do me a favor, sir.

124
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,364
Please.

125
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,706
Is she your daughter?

126
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,833
-Yes.
-Where is she right now?

127
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,170
I haven't seen her
ever since I got locked up.

128
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,797
It looks like she abandoned her father.

129
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,758
I don't think she'll believe me.

130
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,178
She was my one and only treasure
and my reason for living.

131
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,765
Eun-hye knows that very well.
She's a kind girl.

132
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
So I'm sure she'll believe me.

133
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,458
Eun-hye believes

134
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,127
that her dad is innocent.

135
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,255
It's natural that she thinks that way.
He's her dad.

136
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,717
Now, I get why Park Gun-ho had to die.

137
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,114
Yes, I'll send you the address and name.

138
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,741
No, I already have his criminal record.

139
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,661
I want an update on Jo Seong-dae.
What he does for a living

140
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,413
and the places he usually goes.

141
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,624
I don't mind if it takes a while.
Look into it for me.

142
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,543
Okay, thank you.

143
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,089
Why are you drinking at home?

144
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,843
We're not here to drink.
We just needed a place to talk.

145
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,887
I was given a leave,
so I can't go to the office.

146
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,599
And I thought you could say hello
to my new partner.

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,726
Hello.

148
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:02,656
Why would a good-looking man like you
work as a detective?

149
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,366
There are lots of detectives

150
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,994
who are better looking than me.

151
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,413
Exactly. What's wrong with you guys?

152
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,416
Detectives should look more like him.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,003
Cut the nonsense and go inside.
We need to talk in private.

154
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,173
Don't drink too much.
I bought them for myself.

155
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,674
Will you please go?

156
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,051
Your breath stinks of alcohol.

157
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,970
You're embarrassing me,
so please just go to your room.

158
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,722
You crazy…

159
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,849
Has she lost her mind?

160
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,895
-Just drink one bottle.
-Okay.

161
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,775
-Do you want a drink?
-No, I need to drive.

162
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,996
Do you remember when Park Gun-ho

163
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,958
pretended to have a seizure

164
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,209
in the holding cell?

165
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,378
He knew about Eun-hye's illness.

166
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,547
He wanted to tell us

167
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,341
that Eun-hye is sick because of us.

168
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,095
Why do you think Park Gun-ho is right?

169
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,181
I don't think he's right.

170
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,853
But I do get why he believed
that Lee Dae-cheol is innocent.

171
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
Do you…

172
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,774
Do you think Lee Dae-cheol is innocent?

173
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,652
Your opinion matters more than mine.

174
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
What do you think?

175
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,824
Up until now, I thought he was guilty.

176
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,161
But I'm going to stop thinking that
as of this very moment.

177
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,498
I'm going to treat this like a new case.

178
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,793
Lee Dae-cheol is neither guilty
nor innocent.

179
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,087
What if it turns out that he's innocent?

180
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,132
Then we'll have to save him
no matter what.

181
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,934
The person who asked you
to write that article

182
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:58,188
doesn't care whether or not
a serial killer got executed.

183
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,357
The person he wants dead…

184
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,818
is Lee Dae-cheol.

185
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,375
Mr. Yoo.

186
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,253
Hey, you're here.

187
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,339
Is something bothering you?

188
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,966
Do you want some tea?

189
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
Is there something wrong?

190
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,726
Let's sit down.

191
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,810
Okay.

192
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,523
Is it something bad?

193
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,108
Ms. Jin.

194
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,321
I think I can finally
keep the promise I made.

195
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,033
You can work here starting from tomorrow.
The director approved.

196
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,665
Your colleagues won't be very welcoming.

197
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,876
I know. I'm prepared for that.

198
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,254
But why did you look so serious earlier?

199
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,926
If you like where you are now,
you don't need to come.

200
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,721
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me right now?

201
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,850
Okay, then I look forward
to working with you.

202
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,143
Okay.

203
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,939
I feel like I should buy you a drink.
I have something to tell you anyway.

204
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,275
I actually need to meet someone.

205
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,069
Then maybe next time.

206
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,989
No, you can come, too.

207
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,581
Don't people pester you these days?

208
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
Pardon?

209
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,460
People who are against the death penalty

210
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,838
wouldn't have left you alone
for writing that article.

211
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,258
It's what I need to endure as a reporter.

212
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,677
Whatever the case, I'd like to thank you.

213
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,012
Pardon?

214
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,099
The current government
promised to get rid of the death penalty.

215
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,476
And they're going to keep
that promise one day.

216
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,563
But those who were already sentenced
to death are the problem.

217
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,608
They might have to cancel the execution
of a guy who killed 11 people.

218
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,530
The execution needed to take place
for us to abolish the death penalty.

219
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,992
And we had to justify that to the public.

220
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,037
So that's why you needed me
to write that article?

221
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,872
I'll be honest with you.

222
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,793
I might become
the next Minister of Justice.

223
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,172
And the death penalty will be abolished
while I'm in office.

224
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,882
Before I got appointed,

225
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,927
We had to clear the elements
that could get in our way.

226
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,931
It looks like you were the one
who should've treated me to a drink.

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,394
I understand. Family comes first.

228
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
Thank you for understanding.

229
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,485
But you could've just kept it a secret
and never told me.

230
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,613
It's not like you'd never find out.

231
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,364
I just came clean before you found out.

232
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,743
I know this is a bit sudden…

233
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,579
I'm guessing it's what you've been
meaning to ask me all along.

234
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,460
Is there some kind of story
between you and Chief Prosecutor Kim

235
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,212
that I'm not aware of?

236
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,173
No, not with me. With my brother.

237
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,801
They were rivals
ever since they were students.

238
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,679
If one person did well, the other person
had to bring that person down

239
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,640
in order to become more successful.

240
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,225
That's what they're like.

241
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,232
How about another drink?

242
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,901
No, tomorrow is my first day
at the head office.

243
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,904
I don't want to show up drunk and swollen.

244
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,073
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow at work.

245
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,749
By the way,

246
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,671
did you hire me at the head office
as a personal gift?

247
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,259
We're not exactly close enough
to be exchanging gifts.

248
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,762
You're right.

249
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,722
I'll see you tomorrow.

250
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,184
Hello, sir.

251
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,038
INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION

252
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,165
The chief called.

253
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,503
He's going to throw a fit
that we went to the scene drunk.

254
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,505
He might call you guys too.

255
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,757
So let's come up with what to say.

256
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,011
I don't think we need to tell the chief

257
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,097
why we drank.

258
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,975
-I'm going to tell him the truth.
-Hey, come on.

259
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,810
Detective Kang hasn't
given up on this case.

260
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,479
I'm going to stand on his side
and help him out.

261
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,898
Darn it.

262
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,401
Jae-hong, this is going to make him
hate us even more.

263
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,904
We might get sent somewhere else.

264
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,157
Okay, fine.
Just tell the chief what you need to say.

265
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,075
You have my faith.

266
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,663
Bye, sir.

267
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,625
Dong-uk.

268
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,794
-Yes, sir?
-I'm warning you.

269
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,340
Just because we're rude to the captain
doesn't mean you can be rude, too.

270
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,092
You're still a rookie.

271
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,388
Hey, Jae-hong. The patrol guys told me

272
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,601
that Do-chang and Ji-hyeok
were already at the scene before us.

273
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,729
Does that mean they were
keeping in touch with Park Gun-ho?

274
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,607
No, I don't think so.

275
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,693
There's no other reason to explain
why they were there.

276
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,071
Oh, I remember now.

277
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,407
This is a secret.

278
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,409
Do-chang apparently saw

279
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,497
Park Gun-ho getting killed there

280
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,999
in his dream.

281
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,840
Hey, don't joke around with him.

282
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,928
Sir, if you want to know
who the culprit is,

283
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,807
you should call Do-chang.
He recently became a shaman,

284
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,808
so he's pretty good.

285
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,897
He even walks on knife blades.

286
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,617
Do-chang, you don't look like
you're on vacation.

287
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,912
Okay. Keep smiling.

288
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,123
Good. Here we go.

289
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,833
In 3, 2, 1.

290
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,253
It's okay for detectives to drink.

291
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,172
Back when I was in the field,

292
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,633
I also got calls while I was drinking.

293
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,264
But I do understand why Captain Nam
behaved that way.

294
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,766
He just did his job as captain.

295
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,852
Plus, it was a murder scene.

296
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,521
You guys shouldn't have let him notice.

297
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,857
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Anyway,

298
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,277
if Captain Nam continues to raise an issue
regarding what happened,

299
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,613
I can't just stay quiet about it.

300
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,074
Do you understand
what kind of situation I'm in?

301
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,577
-Yes, sir.
-First of all,

302
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
you won't get disciplined.

303
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,456
If you get disciplined for that,

304
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,084
it'll become difficult for us
to supervise the other detectives.

305
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,880
But instead, I want you guys
to fully cooperate with Captain Nam

306
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,257
regarding the investigation
on Park Gun-ho's death.

307
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,469
That way, he'll stop raising an issue
about what happened.

308
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,430
Yes, of course.

309
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,017
By the way,
I heard Do-chang was also at the scene.

310
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,062
-Didn't he tell you I gave him a leave?
-He did, sir.

311
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,607
-Is he still obsessed with Lee Dae-cheol?
-No, sir.

312
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,902
Then what was he doing there
when he should've gone on vacation?

313
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,695
Why won't he just get some rest?

314
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,822
Well…

315
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,783
Just a second, sir.

316
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,244
I'M ON VACATION
SORRY TO HAVE FUN WITHOUT YOU

317
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,413
KANG DO-CHANG

318
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,419
He's having fun right now.

319
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,968
Here.

320
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,307
-I hope you catch a lot of fish.
-Thanks.

321
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,895
My gosh, I can't believe
I'm fabricating an alibi

322
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,773
when I'm a cop.

323
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,608
Thank you.

324
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,655
Jo Seong-dae has an office
in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province.

325
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,990
He has his own business?

326
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,159
My gosh, he's pretty bold.

327
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,869
We might catch him faster than expected.

328
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,538
No, it won't be easy.

329
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,916
The fact that he's so open about himself

330
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,086
means he knows it's going to be hard
for us to catch him.

331
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,466
DON'T BE MY SISTER IN MY NEXT LIFE

332
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,224
What do you want this time? What is it?

333
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,017
I want to die.

334
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,937
Should I just kill myself?

335
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,021
Where are you?

336
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,314
I'm at the police station.

337
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,567
Did you get drunk and throw a fit again?

338
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,860
That jerk…

339
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,114
That jerk filed
a restraining order against me.

340
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,783
The cops brought me here
when I went there to see Jae-ung.

341
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,827
I went there to see my son,

342
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,621
but the cops dragged me out like a dog.

343
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,416
Am I not allowed to see my own son?

344
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,960
Is that how the law works?

345
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,962
Tell me.

346
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:28,633
Tell me, you darn cop!

347
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,745
You need to come with me.

348
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:01,333
I might kill someone.

349
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,667
Let's go.

350
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,672
-Who is it?
-Hey, Jae-ung.

351
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,258
It's me, your uncle. The detective.

352
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,601
Jae-ung, your face…

353
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,859
Are you doing well in school?

354
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,444
Do you eat well?

355
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,699
Look at you. You've lost so much weight.

356
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,368
You miss your mom, don't you?

357
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,870
Where's your dad?

358
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,290
He's not home.

359
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,175
I can't believe that darn punk
made a little kid lie.

360
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,344
Jae-ung, here.

361
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,305
You know the snack bar nearby
that you really like?

362
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,351
Order some tteokbokki,
fish cake, and fritters.

363
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,062
Go and eat what you want
and spend some time in the playground.

364
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,981
Go on. See you later.

365
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,577
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,746
I'm really sorry.

367
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:29,587
But you can't file a restraining order
against his own mother.

368
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,174
Do-chang, I had to do that
for her to get to her senses.

369
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,801
She's his mother.

370
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,720
It's natural for her to miss her son.

371
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:41,308
Will you please tell her
to stop getting involved in my life?

372
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,310
She annoys me so much.

373
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,688
She's of no help at all.
She's nothing but an obstacle.

374
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:52,652
Come on. You guys were married once.

375
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,195
Exactly.

376
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,867
Shouldn't you be grateful
that I lived with her for that long?

377
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,829
Sorry.

378
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,708
I'll clean it up. Where's the broom?

379
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,251
Darn it.

380
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,671
I'll just use a mop.

381
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,593
I know you hate her.
That's probably why you got a divorce.

382
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,597
But you don't need
to take her son away from her.

383
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,515
Let her raise Jae-ung.

384
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,102
You can go ahead and live your life.

385
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,271
You know why I can't let her
raise our kid.

386
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,316
And how is she going to raise him?
She has no money.

387
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,525
I'll…

388
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:38,031
I'll pay for what he needs.
I earn enough money.

389
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,240
Do you really?

390
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,243
Goodness.

391
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,080
Hey.

392
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,586
Take a look at this.

393
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,880
The court sent me that recently,

394
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,717
saying they're going to investigate
my bank account

395
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,136
because you're being investigated
for corruption.

396
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,097
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT

397
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,890
How do you expect me

398
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,727
to trust you with my child
in this kind of situation?

399
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,199
Do-chang.

400
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,042
Hey.

401
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,588
I need to go somewhere.

402
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,968
Can you locate Jo Seong-dae without me?

403
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,553
Sure.

404
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,244
INCHEON METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

405
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,497
Yoon Sang-mi!

406
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,917
You evil wench.

407
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,587
How could you do this to me?

408
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,547
How could you be so cruel?

409
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,631
How?

410
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,716
Follow me.

411
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,569
We'll call you.

412
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,446
Okay.

413
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,039
Is Mr. Jo inside?

414
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,624
Well…

415
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,000
May I help you?

416
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,086
I'm here to meet your boss.

417
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,254
What for?

418
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,382
I'd like to talk to him myself.

419
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,926
He went abroad.

420
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,472
That's nonsense. I met him yesterday.

421
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,932
Jo Seong-dae is inside, right?

422
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,185
Leave while I'm being nice.

423
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,564
No, I really need to meet him today.

424
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,900
Do you know how much money
he took from me?

425
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,237
This is your last chance to leave
in one piece.

426
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,738
One.

427
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,115
Two.

428
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,575
Three.

429
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,374
Who is that jerk?

430
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,584
Hey.

431
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,585
What the… Hey.

432
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,795
Open up!

433
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,422
Who are you?

434
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,260
CEO JO SEONG-DAE

435
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,121
KIM GI-TAE

436
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,923
It looks like you have a death wish.

437
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,799
Where should I start?

438
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,052
Let's begin by breaking your darn fingers.

439
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,428
Kill him!

440
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,520
Kill him!

441
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,107
Kill him! Go!

442
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,533
Hurry up.

443
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,787
-Kill him.
-Come over here!

444
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,582
Come on.

445
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,583
Come.

446
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,724
My goodness.

447
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,023
Ma'am.

448
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,234
Don't tell Mr. Jo about this.

449
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,528
They'll get fired for not doing their job.

450
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,867
Get this off me.

451
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,121
Can you get this off me?

452
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,751
You even checked
my brother-in-law's bank account?

453
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,297
It's part of the procedure
to check your family's bank accounts.

454
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,759
My sister got a divorce.
He's not my family anymore.

455
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,428
Didn't you check that?

456
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,346
I checked that they got a divorce.

457
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,850
But the time of the suspected irregularity
happened before the divorce.

458
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,271
My sister is battling her husband
for the custody of their child.

459
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,981
She has nothing.

460
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,735
The only person she relies on is me
even though I have nothing myself.

461
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,570
She's already struggling to gain custody,

462
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,323
but you gave her ex-husband a good reason
to make sure that never happens.

463
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,491
Do you get what you've done?

464
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,119
I was just doing my work.

465
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,414
You see,

466
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,751
when people keep cornering you,

467
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,961
and you have nowhere else to go,

468
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,630
you begin to doubt people.

469
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,134
"I wonder why that happened
to that person back then.

470
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,803
I thought it was a coincidence.

471
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,057
But now, why does it seem like
that person had an ulterior motive?"

472
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,020
Sooner or later, I might have to do my job

473
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,523
and do something unfortunate
to a good friend of mine.

474
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,819
Why does it sound like
you're threatening me right now?

475
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,948
If you want to threaten someone,
you need to be the one in power.

476
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,909
If I was scared of those who have power,

477
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,203
I would've quit this job a long time ago.

478
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,473
KIM GI-TAE

479
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,869
Hey, Detective Oh.

480
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,331
Hi, I'm here to meet
the former chief prosecutor.

481
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,291
Chief Prosecutor Kim?

482
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,878
-Why?
-We found Park Gun-ho's cell phone.

483
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,838
What?

484
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,257
Park Gun-ho was right.
We found a photo in his cell phone.

485
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,135
It turned out to be a guy
named Jo Seong-dae.

486
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,886
Jo Seong-dae?

487
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,014
I found Kim Gi-tae's business card
in his office.

488
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,724
There must be a connection
between the two.

489
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,271
I called to ask
if you've ever met Jo Seong-dae

490
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,648
or heard about him.

491
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,194
No, I've never heard of that name.

492
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,114
Then I'll send you a photo.
You should check it out.

493
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,117
Okay, I'm also on my way
to the detention center.

494
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,785
So let's talk when we meet.

495
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,120
Okay, I'll be waiting.

496
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,837
This time, I heard you were the one
who wanted to meet the chief prosecutor.

497
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,338
Yes.

498
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,798
May I ask what for?

499
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,425
There's something I need to check.

500
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,118
Ms. Jin.

501
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,453
Yes?

502
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,538
You didn't wear your seat belt.

503
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,458
People sitting in the back
also need to buckle up these days.

504
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,792
Fasten your seat belt.

505
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,877
Okay.

506
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,810
You have steered off course.
You will be redirected.

507
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,522
-Why…
-The navigation

508
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,150
doesn't work properly at times.

509
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,652
Don't worry.

510
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,530
I know how to get there very well.

511
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:35,628
I'm sorry. Can you stop the car
at the gas station over there?

512
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,921
I need to go to the bathroom.

513
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,549
Try to hold it in. We're almost there.

514
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,511
I really need to go. Please.

515
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,682
My stomach hurts.

516
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,600
Okay, fine.

517
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,907
I'll be right back.

518
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,992
Gosh, my stomach.

519
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,749
Hello?

520
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,793
Someone came to the office?

521
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,628
Who?

522
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,568
I'm with the guy in the photo.

523
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,195
Yes, Jo Seong-dae.

524
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,281
Can you please come here?

525
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,365
My location?

526
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,410
It's a gas station.

527
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,454
I was too flustered to check the name.

528
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,789
What?

529
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,585
Okay, I'll check my location
and send it to you.

530
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,170
Please hurry up.

531
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,135
Please. Come on.

532
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,638
There we go.

533
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,232
DETECTIVE OH JI-HYEOK

534
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,933
Please don't kill me.

535
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,394
Who did you call?

536
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,479
It was just

537
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,065
a colleague from work.

538
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,202
DETECTIVE OH JI-HYEOK

539
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,164
Detective Oh Ji-hyeok.

540
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,420
TURN OFF DEVICE

541
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,968
We should go now.

542
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,898
Ms. Jin.

543
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,655
I know what you're thinking.
Just forget about it.

544
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,491
I'm a reporter working at Jeonghan Daily.

545
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,411
If something happens to me,
you won't be able to get out of it.

546
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,997
Gosh, we're running out of time.

547
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,418
There's a set hour for special visitors.

548
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,739
You should learn to fasten your seat belt.

549
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,022
Hey! Who do you think you are?

550
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,148
What the…

551
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,335
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not.

552
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,730
-Who is he?
-A suspect.

553
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,776
-For what?
-I'm still investigating.

554
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,235
I'll tell you once I'm done.

555
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,749
Did you kill Park Gun-ho with this knife?

556
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,797
This isn't supposed to be used
to kill people.

557
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,465
You used it to threaten a reporter.

558
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,094
She couldn't open the bathroom door,

559
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,596
so I used it to unlock the door.

560
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,766
-What else?
-This is only

561
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,685
the beginning for us.

562
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,938
Once I start investigating,
I never give up

563
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,689
until the culprit gets locked up in jail.

564
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,279
That knife.

565
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,784
Will I get it back
once you finish the investigation?

566
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,621
It means a lot to me.

567
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,840
He's definitely a murderer.

568
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,509
It was my first time
feeling I could get murdered.

569
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,763
I'm not just saying this
because he murdered Park Gun-ho.

570
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,931
I seriously thought

571
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,185
I might die in that moment.

572
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,480
Okay. You should go home
and get some rest for now.

573
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,607
I'll call you
if I need to ask you anything.

574
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,235
Thank you.

575
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,824
I'm glad you called the patrol officers.

576
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:48,036
But it was reckless of you
to stand in front of a speeding car.

577
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,122
Although that's how I got rescued.

578
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,834
I was going to shoot.

579
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,003
If he came any closer,
I would've pulled the trigger.

580
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,131
I was in the car as well.

581
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,049
Didn't you think that I could get hurt?

582
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,594
If you shot the driver,
the car would have flipped over

583
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,804
or crashed into another car.

584
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,932
Come to think of it,

585
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,309
you do have a point.

586
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,186
What?

587
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,068
They're doing a briefing
on Park Gun-ho's death right now.

588
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,572
Park Gun-ho died
around 4:00 p.m. on November 28

589
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,493
at a deserted apartment
in Gayang-dong, Seo-gu, Incheon.

590
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,122
And we came to a conclusion

591
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,625
that he killed himself
by jumping from the apartment.

592
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,126
Did you find out why?

593
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,461
Was there a will?

594
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,463
No, there was no will.

595
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,216
But we’re assuming that he was scared

596
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:46,345
that his recent activity
might get him locked up in prison.

597
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,347
He was indicted without detention.

598
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,308
So there was no reason for him
to feel that way.

599
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,019
Park Gun-ho used to be a prison guard.

600
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,356
He was probably scared he might end up
doing time with the inmates he supervised.

601
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,983
Does the doctor who performed
the autopsy also agree with you?

602
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,194
There was a wound on his thigh.

603
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,531
But considering the fact
that he was found in a deserted apartment,

604
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,952
the doctor thinks he could’ve been injured
by a nail or some other type of metal.

605
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,119
Who did the autopsy?

606
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,122
Why was he found in a deserted apartment?

607
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,462
What an absurd way
to carry out an investigation.

608
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,798
They're so determined to cover this up.

609
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,467
Is it okay for the cops to do this?

610
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,178
What will happen to Jo Seong-dae?

611
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,222
If they settle it as suicide,

612
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,267
he will no longer be considered
as a suspect.

613
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,726
We'll need to let him go.

614
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,103
But what about what he did to me?

615
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,312
You can't just let him go.

616
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,064
We can only charge him for blackmail.

617
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,650
He could've killed me.

618
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,068
He might try to harm me again.

619
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,862
Aren't reporters similar to detectives?

620
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,907
If you can't bear with that,
you shouldn't be a reporter.

621
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,493
Reporters don't have guns,
but detectives do!

622
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,328
You seem disappointed.

623
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,750
I'm quite disappointed as well.

624
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,295
If it turned out to be a murder case,

625
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,922
it would've been a great chance
to earn some points.

626
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,349
Even if he got orders from the higher-ups,

627
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,893
don't you think he's a bit out of line?

628
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,938
I feel like he might be deeply involved
with what happened five years ago.

629
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,232
He was in charge
of Lee Dae-cheol's arrest.

630
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,901
And he used to be partners
with the late Detective Jang.

631
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,195
They were partners?

632
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,657
Hey, I'm home right now.
I took a short nap.

633
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,578
I know where that is. I'll take a cab.

634
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,163
Give me 30 minutes.

635
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,168
You got drunk and threw a fit already.

636
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,211
And you're drinking again?

637
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,006
Can't you get him locked up?

638
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,717
-You're a cop.
-He did nothing wrong.

639
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,137
Can't you just charge him for something
and get him locked up in jail?

640
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,723
I heard other cops do that.
Why can't you do the same?

641
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,558
Do you really think that's possible?

642
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,185
He called me a while ago.

643
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,938
I heard they checked his bank account
because you're being investigated.

644
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,858
So he got upset and filed
a restraining order against me.

645
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,569
I did nothing wrong. Things just happened.

646
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,822
You're obviously being investigated
because you did something bad.

647
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,576
Then why can't you just frame him
and have him locked up behind bars?

648
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,081
Can't you do that for your sister?

649
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,791
Just keep drinking

650
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,294
and stop riling me up like that.

651
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,587
Then what about me?

652
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,840
Will I never get to see Jae-ung?

653
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,926
I miss him.

654
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,012
I want to touch him.

655
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,391
It's driving me crazy, Do-chang.

656
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,267
Do-chang, please.

657
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,653
I feel like that's the only way
to get him back.

658
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,364
I'm sorry.

659
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,617
I can't do that.

660
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,537
A cop shouldn't do that.

661
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,997
Never.

662
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,589
Isn't it weird?

663
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,467
He's dating his dead partner's wife.

664
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,304
Maybe they grew close

665
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,014
as he consoled her for her loss.

666
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,436
I don't think Detective Oh is naive enough
to agree with that.

667
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,857
Detective Jang
targeted Lee Dae-cheol as the culprit

668
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,817
even after he confirmed his alibi.

669
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,654
That means he was bribed.

670
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,365
And his partner, Nam Guk-hyeon,
was probably an accomplice.

671
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,327
I'm guessing she shared something with him
on behalf of her late husband.

672
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,919
-What's up?
-Search everything.

673
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,589
They're searching your desk right now.

674
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,799
Did you do something again
to upset the higher-ups?

675
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,759
Hey, hey!

676
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,928
You're investigating Do-chang.
Why search someone else's desk?

677
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,805
We're just following orders.

678
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,768
The boys are getting investigated
because of you.

679
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,895
They have nothing on them,
so they'll be fine.

680
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,229
They'll find something.

681
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,939
Who knows what they might come across?

682
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,025
Okay.

683
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,319
Whatever they find,
I'll take full responsibility.

684
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,946
Don't worry. Okay.

685
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,493
That darn punk.

686
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,870
What's wrong?

687
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,956
Fine. Let's see who wins.

688
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,044
I'm determined to reveal everything now.

689
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,879
That darn scumbag.

690
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,763
Don't let it bother you.

691
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,557
What matters is that we did nothing wrong.

692
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,561
I'm just humiliated.

693
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,814
Why are they only investigating us?

694
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,775
Let's be honest.
Everyone knows how corrupt those guys are.

695
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,902
But they don't even care about them.

696
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,779
Why do they have to do this to us? Why?

697
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,865
They just put on a show to scare us.

698
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,452
They didn't have to stay here for an hour.
They could've finished it in ten minutes.

699
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,913
They just wanted to show everyone
at the station.

700
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,998
They wanted to humiliate us.

701
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,625
They just put on an act. Don't worry.

702
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,753
Captain, something feels suspicious.

703
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,090
Why would they do this
when Do-chang is away on vacation?

704
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,802
They also wrapped up Park Gun-ho's death
without even doing a proper investigation.

705
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,972
Do you think they did this to us
so we wouldn't raise an issue

706
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,890
regarding Park Gun-ho's death?

707
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:24,933
You're insane.

708
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:31,314
Listen, you jerks.
You must think you're all very important.

709
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,484
But you're a nobody to the higher-ups.

710
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,820
They don't care about us. They just…

711
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,822
They just did this for no reason.

712
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,283
We just got unlucky.

713
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:45,120
Know your place
before you start getting ideas.

714
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,667
Hey, don't belittle yourselves like that.

715
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,044
Let's just go for a drink

716
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,255
and forget about what happened.

717
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,132
That's how we do things.

718
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,633
Let's go. It's on me.

719
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,969
Forget it. I want to go home.

720
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:02,929
Oh, really?

721
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,350
Then should we go without him?

722
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,147
Why couldn't he just stay quiet?

723
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,275
He always gets in trouble
when he can't even deal with it.

724
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,404
Why did he have to cause harm to others?

725
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,116
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

726
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,998
You'd better not drink too much today.

727
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,791
If you get drunk again, I'll kill you.

728
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,169
-Drink up.
-Sir.

729
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,088
I know I don't have a lot of experience,

730
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:41,301
but isn't it pretty obvious by now?

731
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,639
The reason they wrapped up
Park Gun-ho's death so quickly

732
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,975
is to prevent us
from reinvestigating Lee Dae-cheol's case.

733
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,688
Didn't you hear what Jae-hong said?
Don't be so twisted about it.

734
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,566
Just drink and forget about it.
That's why I'm buying you drinks.

735
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,401
Just drink your alcohol.

736
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,407
I know he called us a bunch of nobodies,
but I disagree with that.

737
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,454
They keep mistreating us

738
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:13,333
because we keep condoning things.

739
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,711
We might not be able to change the world,

740
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,131
but we can at least change
one person's life.

741
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,303
I think they're interested in me.

742
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,724
Hey, they're not interested in you.
They're interested in me.

743
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,019
I like the one on the right.

744
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,521
They're too young though.

745
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,439
Why don't you go talk to them?

746
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,401
It's too early for that.
They need to drink a little more.

747
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,236
Then…

748
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,613
What are you guys doing right now?

749
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,325
-What?
-How could you be focused on women?

750
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,828
The situation we're in…

751
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,873
Never mind.
Just keep living a simple life.

752
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,545
What can I say?

753
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,339
You won't even listen to me anyway.

754
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,634
What's with him?

755
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,344
Drink up.

756
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,804
Go ahead and keep drinking.

757
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,348
-My gosh.
-He's not the only one going through shit.

758
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,660
Hey.

759
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,413
I know this is unfair.

760
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,167
Man-gu and Ji-ung know it, too.

761
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,460
We all know,

762
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,795
but we're just putting up with it.

763
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,176
When I first became a cop,

764
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,139
I thought everyone would be
just and righteous.

765
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,434
But humans are just humans.

766
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,436
Some are cheap and nasty.

767
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,898
Some use others for success.

768
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,359
Some only care about their own benefits.

769
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,948
And some are just foolish like Do-chang.

770
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,952
"We're brothers, so we must be loyal."

771
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,996
That kind of stuff doesn't exist.

772
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:20,043
Don't expect too much from cops.

773
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,711
We're all just

774
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,506
ordinary human beings.

775
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,892
Let's drink a bit more.

776
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,208
This was the place that Park Gun-ho

777
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,918
first told you about, right?

778
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:02,961
Yes.

779
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,881
I finally got it.

780
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,220
Park Gun-ho wanted to tell us

781
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,808
to reinvestigate the case from here.

782
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:44,335
Did you happen to notice
anything suspicious

783
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,130
around the time of your daughter's death?

784
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,133
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

785
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,511
We need to investigate the case
a little more.

786
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,598
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you please try to remember?

787
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,141
I'm not sure.

788
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,767
Did she have a boyfriend?

789
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:03,438
Or was there anyone
who kept following her around?

790
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,857
She did have a boyfriend.

791
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,736
I do remember hearing her fight with him
over the phone.

792
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,654
But I don't remember anything else.

793
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,533
Do you know who Ji-seon's boyfriend was?

794
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,955
Didn't you investigate this back then?

795
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,541
Why did you ask her again?

796
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,835
No, we didn't investigate this.

797
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,173
But it's basic knowledge to investigate
the victim's surroundings.

798
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,633
Why did you skip it?

799
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,512
Did you get Lee Dae-cheol to confess?

800
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,596
NOVEMBER 15 2015

801
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,556
I don't think it'll be easy.

802
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,141
Why? We already have all the evidence.

803
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,227
I can't help but notice

804
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,105
that we didn't do a proper investigation
regarding Yoon Ji-seon's surroundings.

805
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,025
First, I'll meet her close acquaintances--

806
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:52,779
The press is very interested in this case.

807
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,533
Everyone's complimenting us
for having quickly arrested the culprit.

808
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,451
If we take too much time,

809
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,621
the reporters will raise an issue
with the entire investigation.

810
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,375
Why do something to cause trouble
when we've already arrested the culprit?

811
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,212
You were friends
with the late Detective Jang, right?

812
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:12,215
-Yes.
-He killed one of ours.

813
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,261
What if he manages to find a way out
because you kept giving him time?

814
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:20,139
Then neither of us will be able
to keep working as cops.

815
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,808
Don't you agree?

816
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,147
You punk! Listen!

817
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,692
I really want to crack open your skull
right now.

818
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,028
I… I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill the student either.

819
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,446
Why would I kill them?

820
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,532
We found your fingerprints and bloodstain

821
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:40,326
on the knife you used
to kill Detective Jang.

822
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,913
If you didn't kill Yoon Ji-seon,
then why did you kill Detective Jang?

823
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,834
You obviously killed him
so no one would know you killed her!

824
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,335
You bastard!

825
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,422
No… No. Please.

826
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,431
No one investigated
Yoon Ji-seon's boyfriend.

827
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,017
Before Yoon Ji-seon died,

828
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,271
she shared an art studio
with one of her friends.

829
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:11,441
That friend might have
something to tell us.

830
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,567
Did you meet her before?

831
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:18,156
Yes, I did. But by then,

832
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,701
I was already convinced
that Lee Dae-cheol was the culprit.

833
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,372
So I only interviewed her as a formality.

834
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,167
It looks like we're off to a great start.

835
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,421
Are you being sarcastic?

836
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,881
We're starting with a blank slate.

837
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,092
It's better that way
since we're reinvestigating.

838
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,386
Don't try to wiggle your way out of it.

839
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,097
CIVIL COMPLAINT OFFICE

840
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,443
I'd like to know why you had this.

841
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,154
There could be two possibilities.

842
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,074
You either took it from someone

843
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,619
or forgot to hand it in as evidence

844
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,705
after you found it at a crime scene.

845
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,876
I'll have to look into it.

846
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,546
But I believe it's the latter.

847
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,842
Our target is Kang Do-chang.

848
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,846
But we don't have enough evidence
to prove his irregularity.

849
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:29,060
And I'd like you to help us
find that evidence.

850
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:30,853
Are you telling me to--

851
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,398
I'm not asking you to lie.

852
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,318
You just need to keep me updated

853
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:41,781
on everything that Detective Kang does
from now on.

854
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,952
EVIDENCE

855
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,453
I'll postpone investigating this

856
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,206
until I get what I want from you.

857
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,588
From what I remember,
you shared this studio with Yoon Ji-seon

858
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,591
for three years before she died.
Is that correct?

859
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,592
Yes.

860
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:05,847
Then I'm guessing you pretty much knew
all the people

861
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,058
that she frequently met.
For instance, her boyfriend.

862
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,729
Ji-seon wasn't very outgoing.

863
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,481
So she rarely talked about herself
to others.

864
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,401
The only people I know
are her friends from school.

865
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,571
What kind of drawings
did she normally draw?

866
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,406
She normally drew portraits.

867
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,033
Then did she ever draw a portrait
of her boyfriend?

868
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,494
She could've drawn his portrait
since they were dating.

869
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,457
No, she only drew
the people she picked as models.

870
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,418
She never drew for others
even if they asked her to.

871
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,045
She was very proud of her work.

872
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,591
Do you happen to remember
any of the people she drew?

873
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,843
Someone you saw before she died.

874
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,723
I'm not sure. It was too long ago.

875
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:49,849
Try to remember.

876
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,274
He'll be back
as soon as he finishes his meeting.

877
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,650
What kind of tea would you like?

878
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:00,818
No, it's okay.

879
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,199
Hey.

880
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,576
The owner isn't here.

881
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,123
Hey.

882
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,418
Don't underestimate Oh Jong-tae.

883
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,089
If we mess with him, the higher-ups
might pressure us even more.

884
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:28,429
Are you sure Oh Jong-tae
was involved with the incident?

885
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,473
We'll find out once we ask.

886
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,813
She did work on something
right before she died.

887
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,981
But I don't know who the model was.

888
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,860
When she was paid to draw something,
she never showed it to me.

889
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,988
Some even reached out to her
and asked her to draw their portraits.

890
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,075
What kind of people
normally ask for their own portraits?

891
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,036
People who have a lot of money
and self-pride.

892
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,123
Do you still have any of her drawings?

893
01:03:56,207 --> 01:04:00,044
I'm not sure.
Her parents took most of them.

894
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,506
Just a second.

895
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,259
Well…

896
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,511
I don't have any of her drawings.

897
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,347
But I think I might have
a few rough sketches.

898
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:19,480
She used to draw sketches
before she painted her drawings.

899
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,400
But this is just a rough sketch.

900
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:26,028
So you won't be able
to recognize anyone with this.

901
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,437
You think Yoon Ji-seon drew this?

902
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,816
Is there a signature on the bottom?

903
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,404
Probably not. She was embarrassed
about drawing for money.

904
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,324
But aside from that, what kind of a guy

905
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,828
would hang the portrait
that was drawn by the woman he killed

906
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:19,540
in the middle of his office like this?

907
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,709
He doesn't care about that kind of stuff.

908
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,044
What? You know him?

909
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,880
We meet often.

910
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,466
What brings you here this time?

911
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,895
A SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK JI-HWAN
AND LEE HYUN-WOOK

912
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,790
This proves that Oh Jong-tae was dating
Yoon Ji-seon right before she died.

913
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,124
She was so pretty.

914
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,834
I'm scared of something, too.

915
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,086
Failing to catch a culprit.

916
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,213
There's a culprit I need to catch
before I die.

917
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,464
Did you kill her?

918
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,257
Why did you arrest Jo Seong-dae?

919
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,844
-As a suspect for Park Gun-ho's death.
-You punk.

920
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,429
What did you say, you jerk?

921
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,932
-One of them might be innocent.
-Eun-hye.

922
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,684
-Are you confident?
-I know I can prove it

923
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,102
and I'll take full responsibility.

924
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,937
I lied to you.

925
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,355
I really did kill someone.

926
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,440
Our goal isn't to catch the culprit.

927
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,775
It's to save someone from dying.

928
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,151
Mr. Kang.

929
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,487
Please save my dad.

930
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:36,575
