THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,450
Hey!

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,660
What is it now?

5
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,247
You punk.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,166
How dare you mess with my guys?

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,628
Do we look like losers
you can push around, you piece of shit?

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,297
Why are you releasing Gi Dong-jae?

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,215
That bastard is a murderer. Why?

10
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,717
Do you want your life to be ruined?

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,885
You little punk.

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,345
Are you mad?
How dare you start a fight here?

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,680
Let go of me.

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,682
You bastards!

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,686
Don't move!

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,814
Don't worry about them!
Keep beating his ass, sir!

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,316
Let me go!

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,358
-Let go.
-Hold still.

19
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,359
Let go.

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,652
Grab him!

21
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,529
Let me go!

22
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,615
-Hold still.
-Let me go, asshole.

23
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,533
I said hold still.

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,952
-Let me go.
-I said let go.

25
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,165
-Handcuff them already!
-Go ahead, you punk!

26
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,542
But Gi-jin, cops handcuffing
each other is a bit…

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,586
Then lock them up in a cell!

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,507
You bunch of damn psychos.

29
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,801
-Damn.
-Hey!

30
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,805
You should have become a gangster
if you wanted to live like that.

31
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,389
Not a cop!

32
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,974
Release Gi Dong-jae now,

33
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,019
and you'd be killing the bereaved families

34
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,521
all over again.

35
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,648
They were killed by him the first time,

36
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:51,402
and now they'll have been killed again
by a corrupt gangster cop like you.

37
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,200
You've done your share of killing.

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,871
You framed Lee Dae-cheol as a killer
and got him the death penalty.

39
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,416
You framed Kim Hyeong-bok as a killer
and got him killed too.

40
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,255
Had you done your investigations properly,
they wouldn't have died like that.

41
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,092
You went berserk
saying you'll catch the real killer

42
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,469
and a son-in-law of a wealthy family
died in the process.

43
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:17,887
Victim.

44
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,723
You trying to catch the real killer
for the family

45
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,100
created another victim

46
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,646
and another bereaved family.

47
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,857
You, the cop.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,873
I told you very clearly

49
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,416
never to come here again.

50
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,459
The secret kept among the three of you.

51
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,171
You, Jung Hui-ju, and Cheon Sang-woo.

52
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,216
We found out what it is.

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,221
Woo Tae-ho had recorded
his conversation with you.

54
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,352
I know what Woo Tae-ho promised you.

55
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,189
The police will keep that promise
in his place.

56
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,734
We have police dispatched in America, too.

57
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,196
We can find your daughter, Su-yeon,
and bring her back.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,448
So?

59
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,367
What do you want from me?

60
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,997
Just say the same thing
you told Woo Tae-ho in court.

61
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,790
No.

62
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,793
You can't bring Su-yeon back.

63
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,881
You don't know
what Cheon Sang-woo is like.

64
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,342
So why did you tell Woo Tae-ho?

65
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,718
He was…

66
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,097
capable of bringing Su-yeon back.

67
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,185
Jung Hui-ju died for you.

68
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,520
She was trying to
get your child back for you.

69
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,564
Don't you feel guilty at all?

70
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,442
Why do you only think of yourself?

71
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:55,860
Do I feel guilty?

72
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,696
I do.

73
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,911
But you're only thinking of
yourself as well.

74
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,706
Nothing else matters to you
except finding the killer.

75
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,667
You don't care what happens to others.

76
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,962
All you care about is catching the killer.

77
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,716
I was planning on going to America.

78
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,636
Even if I can't meet her,

79
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,347
I wanted to see her from afar.

80
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,140
But…

81
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,686
I can't even do that anymore.

82
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,648
Now he's going to…

83
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,735
hide Su-yeon away even more.

84
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,077
NATIONAL SPORTS COMPETITION

85
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,333
Eun-hye.

86
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,462
Can I ask you something?

87
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,423
What is it?
Are you having trouble with a problem?

88
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,758
It's not that…

89
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,970
The test I got 100 percent on.

90
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,933
Do you think it would be okay
if I showed it to Dad?

91
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,768
Show him. He would be happy to see it.

92
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,440
No. I think Mom will be mad.

93
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,692
Why would your mom be mad?

94
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,571
She doesn't like me meeting Dad.

95
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,905
It's because…

96
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm all she has.

97
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,038
She always says that.

98
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,832
"I only live because of you."

99
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,127
That could be true.
Your mom only thinks of you.

100
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,713
Does that mean
I have to live for Mom as well?

101
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,132
Never making her mad,

102
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,509
and always getting
perfect scores on tests?

103
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,765
I want to play games
and hang out with my friends too.

104
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,894
I want to meet Dad and hang out with him.

105
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,437
Well, that's…

106
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,108
-Hey, you're home.
-Hi.

107
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,905
My goodness, Jae-ung.
Are you studying again?

108
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,826
How do you always make me so proud?

109
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,080
I live because of you.

110
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,338
What? Don't you like me kissing you?

111
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,050
Don't be like that. I live because of--

112
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,512
Do-chang, I have something to ask you.

113
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,430
I can ask tomorrow if you're tired.

114
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,057
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

115
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,976
Mr. Jung didn't open the store again.

116
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,062
I don't think he's eating properly either.

117
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,272
I think his heart is broken.

118
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,193
Why did he have to go see Cheon Sang-woo
just to be mocked?

119
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,403
Did you find Hui-ju's killer?

120
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,533
I think Mr. Jung will only find peace
after that killer is caught.

121
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,826
Well…

122
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,036
It hasn't been easy.

123
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
He has total faith in you.

124
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,041
I also believe you will catch the killer.

125
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,128
Eun-hye,

126
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,506
I'm not as great of a detective
as you think I am.

127
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,758
You solved my dad's case.

128
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,345
He could die with some peace of mind
thanks to you.

129
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,973
-So for Mr. Jung--
-Eun-hye.

130
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,271
I couldn't save your dad.

131
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,858
What good is dying with peace of mind?

132
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,318
If I had done the investigation--

133
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,987
If you were going to keep thinking that,

134
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,905
you might as well have
let him die a killer.

135
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,867
Why did you let him die an innocent man?

136
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,620
Why do you make my heart break
every time I think of my dad?

137
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,457
I don't blame you.

138
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,712
I just don't like you blaming yourself
and trying to become a better person.

139
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,469
Be honest with me.

140
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,555
Did Woo Tae-ho really kill himself?

141
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,644
Why did you suddenly announce a divorce

142
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,022
and drive him to that state?

143
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,984
That's something people made up.
It was an accident.

144
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,736
Then again,

145
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,823
he wouldn't have crashed
on purpose with you in the car.

146
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,035
He was always calm
and collected about everything,

147
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,496
so he's not likely to have
caused an accident either.

148
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,500
Either way, I'm grateful to him.

149
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,169
He took all our headaches with him.

150
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,422
You don't have to concern yourself
with your divorce anymore.

151
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,174
You sure know how to sound like a jackass.

152
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,969
-What?
-Your sister just became a widow.

153
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,680
What kind of consolation is that?

154
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,353
You never acknowledged him
as your husband either.

155
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,611
I thought becoming a father
would change you.

156
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,530
But you're the same.

157
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,995
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,457
He was the only person protecting you,
Mr. Vice President.

159
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,751
Meaning,

160
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,089
there's no one left to protect you.

161
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,175
Na-na,

162
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,011
-You must be mistaken about something--
-Thank you for the food.

163
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,306
See you later. I lost my appetite.

164
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,780
Why are you so obsessed with the case?

165
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,157
It's as if…

166
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,910
your life depends on catching the culprit.

167
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,038
Nothing else matters to you
except finding the killer.

168
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,873
You don't care what happens to others.

169
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,252
All you care about is catching the killer.

170
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,885
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

171
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,399
Do you think you're a good person?

172
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,360
Wake up.

173
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,071
You will never be a good person.

174
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,949
That's how it is, being a detective.

175
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:33,466
I think Na-na is trying to
dig up dirt on me.

176
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,468
What kind of…

177
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,058
I thought becoming a father
would change you.

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,893
But you're the same.

179
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,900
There's something she couldn't have known.

180
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,362
But she found it out.

181
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,073
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi

182
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:03,204
Mr. Woo told me to deliver it
to Director Cheon Na-na and no one else.

183
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,708
Is it something serious?

184
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,794
Something the police shouldn't find out?

185
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,921
No, it's not that serious.

186
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,382
But it does concern me a little.

187
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,511
Very well. I will try to control it.

188
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,804
Control?

189
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,348
I mean…

190
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:28,521
Are you telling me
that you can even control Na-na?

191
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,150
No. I wouldn't dare.

192
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,654
I just meant that
I will keep things under control

193
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,282
so that you are not harmed.

194
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,664
Ma'am, did you get a chance to check

195
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,625
the flash drive that Mr. Woo left you?

196
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,543
Yes.

197
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,295
What was it about?

198
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,424
Mostly secrets about my family.

199
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,470
They will be quite helpful since there are
some secrets I didn't know.

200
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,555
I see.

201
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,015
Was there anything else?

202
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,310
Nothing for you to be concerned about.
You don't have to worry.

203
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,604
I see.

204
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,234
Also, I have a question.

205
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,405
Why is there a rumor
that Woo Tae-ho killed himself?

206
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,410
I don't know, but I don't think
it's something that could hurt us.

207
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,996
We needed to cover up
Jung Hui-ju's murder too.

208
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,956
I don't think it was something

209
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,667
you should have decided
without asking me what I thought.

210
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,173
Do you think I fear you?

211
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,636
I apologize.

212
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,014
It was something that involved the police.

213
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,641
So I thought I could
take care of it on my own.

214
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,936
I'm sorry if I offended you.

215
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,401
The accident is a mere setback to my plan.

216
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,654
You will have no problems
taking what you want.

217
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,574
I understand.

218
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,204
LEGAL TEAM DIRECTOR CHOI YONG-GEUN

219
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,999
NEW OWNER OF TJ?
SHAREHOLDERS MEETING TO DECIDE NEW CEO

220
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,347
So we opened a fried chicken joint.

221
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,682
Over half of it was a loan.

222
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,392
I didn't have any savings.

223
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,771
So I opened the restaurant
with the loan I got,

224
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,898
and it just blew up.

225
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,152
Customers were pouring in,
delivery orders kept coming in…

226
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,488
The culprit was running away
before my very eyes,

227
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,490
but a customer called to order.

228
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,033
"Nothing has ever tasted like this."

229
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,660
"Is this galbi or chicken?"

230
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,537
"This is wang-galbi roasted chicken."

231
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,414
I was selling so many chickens,

232
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
the greeting had become a habit.

233
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,002
With the culprit running away from me.

234
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:02,007
You can't just sell chicken
in the middle of chasing a criminal!

235
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,678
Hello, Mr. Jung.

236
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,889
Hey. Come in and sit down.

237
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,434
Listen to Detective Kang's story.

238
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,479
He was just telling me his stakeout story.

239
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,939
It's so funny.

240
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,524
Is that right?

241
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,775
Is it a true story?

242
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,318
Yes.

243
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,529
So did you catch the guy or not?

244
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,115
I ran like hell and caught him.

245
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,158
But suddenly, this came out of my mouth.

246
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,535
"Have you eaten?"

247
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,913
And the criminal replies, "I had plenty."

248
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,457
"I had plenty."

249
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,752
"I had plenty."

250
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,257
Is it not funny?

251
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm trying to make him laugh.

252
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,889
Laugh heartily.

253
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,600
"I had plenty."

254
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,145
If you want to plagiarize, pick one.

255
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,273
If you thread quotes from everywhere,
it loses consistency.

256
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,942
I never finished a movie.

257
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,279
I don't have enough from a single movie.

258
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,284
Mr. Jung, why did you come out?

259
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,286
Go inside. You will catch a cold.

260
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,204
Go on.

261
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,456
Let's go.

262
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't think he'll go inside
until we're out of sight.

263
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,251
Okay.

264
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,381
I told you before.

265
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,009
Don't try so hard to be a good person.

266
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,845
What are you saying? I'm a bad cop.

267
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,805
I even received shoes as a bribe

268
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,516
from a victim's family.

269
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,104
These are way more expensive
than the pair you got.

270
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,440
Bigger doesn't mean more expensive.

271
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,776
Should we ask him later
which was more expensive?

272
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,111
-Okay.
-These are wholecut.

273
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,947
"Wholecut."

274
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,531
Mine are nice, too.

275
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,618
They look like they're made out of rags.

276
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,205
No. They're really comfortable.

277
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,665
GAWOL RURAL VILLAGE

278
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,315
You're following me, aren't you?

279
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,737
Do you even know whose house this is?
Did you follow me knowing that?

280
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,322
The chief of police lives here, you dummy!

281
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,450
The highest-ranking cop of a station.

282
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,329
You messed with the wrong person. Got it?

283
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,290
You stupid idiot.

284
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,253
I don't think the Incheon Seobu guys
will give up so easily.

285
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,173
One by one, they are nothing.

286
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,135
But when they're so determined
and ganged up…

287
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,891
Let's divide and conquer one by one.

288
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm thinking of roping in their boss.

289
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,397
-Their boss?
-Yes.

290
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,401
Their chief's daughter
happens to work for my team.

291
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,195
With his daughter involved,

292
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,530
the chief is bound to come around.

293
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,367
Involving the family
of police is a little…

294
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,663
That's such a hot-button issue.
Won't it be too risky?

295
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,292
Don't worry. I have made safety nets.

296
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,921
We checked out every account
under Choi Yong-geun's name.

297
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,257
And we looked through
all of his recent calls on his cell phone.

298
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,511
There's nothing
that connects him to Gi Dong-jae.

299
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,514
We went to the restaurant
and the sauna Choi Yong-geun frequents

300
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,224
to look at the CCTV footage,

301
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,892
but he was never with Gi Dong-jae.

302
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,727
Of course not.

303
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,188
He was a detective for over 20 years.

304
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,148
He must have wiped everything clean
in advance.

305
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
I did find out one thing.

306
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,902
Choi Yong-geun has an apartment
in his name

307
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,862
besides the one he's living in,

308
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,074
and Jang Gi-jin has been living there
as of recently.

309
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,951
They've been working together.

310
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,704
The serial murder scene photos
that Choi Yong-geun sent Gi Dong-jae were

311
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,290
sent to Choi Yong-geun from Jang Gi-jin.

312
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,917
For the price of helping him,

313
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,962
Choi Yong-geun gave
Jang Gi-jin the apartment.

314
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,756
Now I see why Jang Gi-jin
tried to take Gi Dong-jae from us.

315
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,384
It was Choi Yong-geun's order.

316
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,805
What if we bring Choi Yong-geun
and Gi Dong-jae together?

317
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,307
To bring those two together,

318
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,143
we need something solid.

319
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,062
They won't bat an eye
over some photos exchanged over email.

320
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,899
We have to find something
before Jang Gi-jin releases Gi Dong-jae.

321
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,359
Gi Dong-jae, Choi Yong-geun,

322
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,487
if either of them disappears,
we are back to square one.

323
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,905
Like Do-chang says,

324
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,783
I don't think we should expect
Choi Yong-geun to give us much.

325
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,703
Maybe Gi Dong-jae has something left.

326
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,415
Yes. I think Gi Dong-jae has something.

327
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,293
In case he has to take the blame alone.

328
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,671
We even searched Gi Dong-jae's hideout.

329
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,256
But other than the deleted photos

330
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,341
of the murder scenes,
there was nothing else.

331
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,760
Gosh.

332
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,182
I don't know if this will be helpful.

333
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,726
On the day Gi Dong-jae bashed my head in…

334
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,784
So,

335
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,745
did you get to see what he handed to him?

336
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,664
It wasn't something small.

337
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,291
It was like…

338
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,793
Could it have been a cell phone?

339
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,421
I think it was a cell phone.

340
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,257
Gi Dong-jae knew
he was being chased by the police.

341
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,302
He gave his phone to one of his cronies
in case he got caught.

342
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,679
That cell phone must have something in it.

343
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,599
Something to get him out of
taking all the heat by himself.

344
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,142
Did you see the guy who got the phone?

345
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,268
I'd recognize him right away.

346
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,521
Let's get that asshole.
We'll press him and find the cell phone.

347
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,942
Do-chang, the two of us will do it.
Let us do it.

348
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,401
Ji-ung, we have to do it.

349
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,488
We have to find the cell phone
and put Gi Dong-jae away again.

350
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,742
We'll do it.

351
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,120
We'll find that phone no matter what.

352
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,832
Byun Ji-ung and Ji Man-gu will do it.

353
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,585
Nobody interfere with their investigation,
understood?

354
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,504
-Yes.
-Yes.

355
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,839
Ji-ung, we made this mess.
Let's go clean it up.

356
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,341
That's for sure.

357
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,468
We are the best partners in the universe.

358
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,179
You keep saying that,

359
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,430
but wouldn't it be…

360
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,307
Superman and Batman?

361
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,727
That's right. Never mind.

362
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,730
Those guys worked separately.

363
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,565
You're the best partners in the universe.

364
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,154
It's Batman and Robin.

365
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,497
What is this?

366
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,833
-What the hell is this?
-Watch where you're going.

367
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,298
Hey, Man-gu.

368
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,099
Long time no see.

369
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,018
I wanted to ask you something.

370
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,856
On the day Gi Dong-jae did this to me,

371
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,150
he gave you something.

372
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,318
Where is it right now?

373
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,029
-What are you talking about?
-You little…

374
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,240
-Look at it, asshole.
-And look at my head.

375
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,661
You know how we got these scars.

376
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,664
I'm going to ask you again, okay?

377
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,667
Gi Dong-jae, who did this to us…

378
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,170
gave you something. Where is it?

379
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,178
We just got a full dose of painkillers
from the hospital.

380
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,556
Our minds are pretty unstable
because of it.

381
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,185
Let me ask you again
while our minds are clear.

382
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,146
Gi Dong-jae really pissed us off.

383
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,315
Where's the thing he gave you?

384
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,486
Where is it, punk?

385
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,779
Where is it?

386
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,836
Yes, she just went into a café.
What should I do?

387
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,686
Yes, Mr. Choi.

388
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,775
I made a short stop
at Attorney Choi's office

389
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,152
and now I'm getting some coffee.

390
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,447
I'll be going back to the office soon.
What did you need?

391
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,950
I left out a few documents.

392
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,744
I will email them to you right now.

393
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,622
Please print them out
and show them to Attorney Choi.

394
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,085
This file should not be stored
in any form at Attorney Choi's office.

395
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,086
Do you understand?

396
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,130
I will send the email to you.

397
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,633
Hold on…

398
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,177
Yes, I got the email.

399
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,929
Good.

400
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,515
If this falls into the hands
of the opposing company,

401
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,810
it could lose us a lawsuit.
It's that important.

402
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,605
Your computer could get hacked,
so be sure to delete the email

403
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,358
right after you print it out.

404
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,526
Do you understand?

405
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,280
Tens of billions of won are at stake.
Keep that in mind.

406
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,157
Yes, I will.

407
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,535
LEGAL TEAM DIRECTOR CHOI YONG-GEUN

408
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,876
Yes, Mr. Choi.

409
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,878
What happened to Oh Ji-hyeok?

410
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,214
The related material was delivered
to the hearing officer.

411
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,632
I called him in to talk now.

412
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,179
We'll keep going after them
one by one like this.

413
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,231
Wait a minute.

414
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,775
Where's my laptop?

415
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,951
One, zero, two.

416
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,829
Calling unit 102.

417
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,789
There is no response.

418
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,671
Hey.

419
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,715
-Making any progress?
-Of course.

420
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,052
We pressed Gi Dong-jae's underling
and got the information.

421
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,930
He said he got it from him that day
and gave it to Gi Dong-jae's girlfriend.

422
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,140
Have you met the girlfriend?

423
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,684
We're in front of her house,

424
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,769
but she's not here.

425
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,480
We'll have to wait until she comes.

426
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,025
Let us know if you need reinforcement.
Dong-uk and I will be on standby.

427
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,735
Make sure not to skip your meals.

428
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,779
Okay. See you.

429
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,074
Bo-gyeong.

430
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,034
Where is…

431
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,912
Detective Oh is at the main office now.

432
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,455
Really?

433
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,790
Should I call him for you?

434
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,874
-Yes.
-Forget it.

435
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,459
He's probably discussing important things.

436
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,127
Do you think that selfish guy
would pick up?

437
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,420
He will ignore it.

438
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,048
That's how people are
when they're well-off.

439
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,134
When they need you, they act like
they would sell off a building for you.

440
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,886
But when they get
all they want out of you,

441
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,097
your number gets deleted.
They hit "delete."

442
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,266
Then what should I do? It's really urgent.

443
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,142
Is something wrong?

444
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,270
I have to find my laptop.

445
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:07,065
If I don't, my life will be erased.
My life will be "deleted."

446
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,999
What do I do?

447
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,376
We have to find this guy
and get my laptop back.

448
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,544
At least by today.

449
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,838
-If not, I'll be in big trouble.
-Listen carefully.

450
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,423
Bo-gyeong,

451
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,050
go by the window and have a cup of coffee.

452
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,346
You will get a call from me
when you see the sunset out the window,

453
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,808
saying that I caught the guy
and found your laptop.

454
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,351
Really?

455
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,562
Let's get moving.

456
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,856
Jae-hong, leave this jerk to me.

457
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,316
I will get him right now.

458
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:54,029
I just found out that she's
the daughter of the police chief.

459
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,700
Why didn't you tell me before?
This is really risky.

460
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,661
So what do you want to do?

461
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,205
Well, I'm not backing out now.

462
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,209
I'm just saying I need some hazard pay.

463
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,837
Okay, I will wire the money now.

464
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,505
Bring me the laptop first.

465
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,215
Never mind.

466
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,844
Just throw it away somewhere
so that nobody can find it.

467
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,305
Let's talk after the money is deposited.

468
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,225
If you drag it out, you will be caught.

469
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,354
As you said, she's the chief's daughter.
The police will soon…

470
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,110
What an idiot.

471
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,534
MR. CHOI YONG-GEUN

472
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,247
MY BROTHER DONG-UK

473
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,007
-Hi, Dong-uk.
-Where are you right now?

474
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,093
Right now, I'm at…

475
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,013
Never mind. I'll text you the address.
I want you to come right now.

476
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,809
Dong-uk, I have to do
something important right now.

477
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,644
You quit your job and drink every day.

478
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,604
What could be so important to you?

479
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,942
Come quickly, before I find you
and break your wrist off.

480
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,285
Take it easy.

481
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,957
Dong-uk, don't get too worked up.

482
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,168
Calm down and let's hear
what your brother has to say.

483
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,715
Welcome.

484
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,767
Dong-uk.

485
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,229
Get up.

486
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,523
When will you come to your senses?

487
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,275
It's about time
you got your life together.

488
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,194
How long do I have to clean up after you?

489
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,697
Why do I have to, you piece of trash?

490
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,031
I'm really sorry.

491
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,033
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

492
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,119
This is an investigation.

493
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,538
We have to take care of this first.

494
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,833
Work out the brother stuff on your own.
Do you understand?

495
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,171
Where is the laptop?
Did you hand it off already?

496
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,840
Not yet.

497
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,015
Is this your laptop?

498
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,183
It is.

499
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,688
What about the important file?

500
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,857
I don't think it was opened
because of the passcode.

501
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,651
It's all there.

502
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,363
And it wasn't sent in an email.

503
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,073
That's a relief.

504
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,286
I am arresting you for theft.

505
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't even dream
about your right to an attorney.

506
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,125
And forget about your right
to not make adverse statements in court.

507
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,920
Did you understand? You thieving bastard.

508
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,296
Dong-uk, I'm sorry.

509
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,224
Oh Ji-hyeok, Violent Crimes Unit Team 2
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

510
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,644
If Lee Eun-hye turns out to be
an accomplice, I will arrest her.

511
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,230
If Lee Eun-hye runs away,

512
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,607
I, Oh Ji-hyeok,
will take all responsibility.

513
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,027
Is this your voice?

514
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:22,946
Yes.

515
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,825
Why do you go to such lengths
to protect Lee Eun-hye?

516
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,497
Isn't this case closed already?

517
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,040
If this goes public,

518
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,960
other suspects under investigation
will be enraged.

519
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,339
"You can get away with anything
if you have a detective on your side."

520
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,133
What did you get
in return for her release?

521
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,597
RECORD OF STATEMENT

522
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,067
ARRESTED ON 2021, DECEMBER 20TH
FOR LAPTOP THEFT

523
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,485
Shit.

524
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,830
The victim doesn't want
you to be punished.

525
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,584
I will let you off with a warning.

526
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,002
Instead,

527
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:24,173
tell me who told you to steal the laptop.

528
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,897
Go on. Don't drink on the way.

529
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,024
Just go home and rest.

530
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,650
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,195
I'm so sorry.

532
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,824
I'm too ashamed to see Dong-uk.

533
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,953
As he said, I am a piece of trash.

534
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,334
If you ever need money,

535
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,670
call me instead of Dong-uk.

536
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,215
If you really need the money,
I will try to get it for you.

537
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,469
Take it.

538
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,514
Thank you.

539
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,933
Thank you so much.

540
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,483
It seems like…

541
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,571
Dong-uk has found himself
a proper older brother.

542
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,699
Thank you so much.

543
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,305
It was Choi Yong-geun.

544
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,726
That bastard found your brother
and talked him into it.

545
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,563
Jae-hong, maybe I should quit being a cop.

546
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,482
What would you do then?

547
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,402
I'm too embarrassed to be a cop.

548
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,738
Is it because of your brother?

549
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:15,618
He will never be able to
shake his bad habit.

550
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,912
He will cause trouble
for the rest of his life.

551
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,499
But I can't disown him. He's my brother.

552
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,753
I can't think of a solution.

553
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,298
When I was interviewed
to become a police officer,

554
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,884
somebody asked a question like that.

555
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,887
"If one of your family members
was a suspect, would you arrest them?"

556
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,182
So I said, "I don't know."

557
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,351
They said it was the right answer.

558
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,772
Not knowing what to do
can be the right answer sometimes.

559
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,817
I'm going back in.

560
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,573
As you told me to,

561
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,117
I delivered the document to Attorney Choi.

562
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,744
I deleted your email too.

563
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,579
Good work.

564
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,000
There was an incident during the process.

565
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,630
-An incident?
-Someone had stolen my laptop.

566
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,134
Fortunately, we found it soon.
Anyway, please don't worry.

567
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,553
The email you sent me was never leaked.

568
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,555
That's a relief.

569
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,394
Perhaps I am overthinking this,

570
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,315
but I think there is a bad guy
who's behind the laptop thief.

571
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,778
A rat bastard who wants TJ to fail.

572
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,074
You should watch out, too.
His methods are nasty.

573
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,787
I'll get back now.

574
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,663
Okay.

575
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,210
What a crazy bastard.

576
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,141
Gi Dong-jae will be released today.

577
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,813
Nice work.

578
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,147
But Gi-jin,

579
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,275
things keep going awry.

580
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:17,073
Make sure this one doesn't go wrong.
Let's be careful.

581
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,784
DETENTION CENTER

582
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,426
Am I supposed to be grateful?

583
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,303
Scram.

584
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,224
I thought I made it clear to Mr. Choi.

585
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,643
I told him I shouldn't be released.

586
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,354
You think you're a hotshot, don't you?

587
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,983
Wake up, you punk.

588
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,403
You're nothing but a bug on the ground.

589
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,697
You're not even worth stepping on.

590
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,242
I'm letting you go
because I don't want blood on my shoes.

591
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,787
Just go quietly.

592
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,791
And without looking up,
crawl into your hole in the ground

593
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,918
and just die.

594
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,242
SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

595
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,480
Get him.

596
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,505
You little…

597
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,251
Dong-jae.

598
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,552
Why did you kill Sang-pil?

599
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,387
You bastard.

600
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,849
Sang-pil took you off the streets
and gave you a new life.

601
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,184
And yet,

602
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,186
you killed your savior over a girl.

603
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,273
How do you live with yourself?

604
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,566
Jae-chun.

605
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,693
I didn't kill him.

606
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,070
I really didn't kill him.

607
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,574
Choi Yong-geun told us everything.

608
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,993
He gave us every little detail.

609
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,495
Anyone could tell
he was telling the truth.

610
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,459
Get rid of him.

611
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,463
Make sure that piece of trash
doesn't float back up.

612
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,922
-Yes.
-Jae-chun!

613
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,300
Please hear me out, Jae-chun!

614
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,891
What's this?

615
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,518
Who put this here?

616
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,979
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2 SIM DONG-UK

617
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,522
Gosh.

618
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,233
It's Bo-gyeong.

619
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,945
She must have left this for me
for helping her out.

620
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,323
No wonder she said
she had to come to the station.

621
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,952
She must have come to bring this for me,
not to see the chief.

622
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,372
There isn't a note or anything.

623
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,499
That is Bo-gyeong's style.

624
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,334
She hides her feelings.

625
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,545
It's embarrassing to show your emotions.

626
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,631
She dropped it off in secret.

627
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,341
Can you see it now?

628
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:49,303
Do you see the true feelings
that Bo-gyeong has hidden in her heart?

629
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,057
We should share it
when the team members come back.

630
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,225
Hey.

631
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,561
Bo-gyeong left this for me to eat.

632
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:58,979
Dad.

633
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,816
When I was little,

634
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,068
I couldn't understand
why you never came home

635
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,654
or why you were always chasing criminals.

636
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,156
Same with your fellow detectives.

637
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,700
But I get it now.

638
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,119
Get what?

639
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,870
It's because you're pissed off.

640
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,455
It's because you get worked up

641
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,500
and feel like your heart would burst
if you don't catch them.

642
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,085
What exactly…

643
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,003
happened to you?

644
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,506
I think something is going down today.

645
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,842
Chief just called an emergency meeting.

646
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,095
I know you're disappointed, but it's work.

647
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,390
Tell my princess that Daddy is sorry
for missing her birthday.

648
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,268
I have the cake I bought at the office.

649
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,686
You should come by and…

650
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,312
Why are you eating that?

651
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,690
Happy Birthday!

652
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,193
Where is everyone?

653
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,111
Right.

654
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,321
Byun Ji-ung and Ji Man-gu
are on a stakeout.

655
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,240
I called the rest so they'll be here.

656
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,825
Tell them to hurry up.

657
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,119
I don't care if it's TJ or whatever.

658
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,038
How dare they get my daughter worked up?

659
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,000
I will crush those bastards.

660
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,046
I heard your wife moved in. Is she happy?

661
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,798
Well, yes.

662
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,514
Use this to get whatever
you need for the house.

663
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,308
Get a new computer for your kid.

664
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,937
Is Gi Dong-jae dead?

665
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,566
I don't know.

666
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,402
He probably did.

667
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,448
He absolutely deserves to die,

668
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,744
but do you have to do such dirty work
as director of a corporate legal team?

669
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,250
That's how it is in this field.

670
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,878
If you look closely, it's a dirty world.

671
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,590
Yong-geun.

672
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,932
I will dive into the dirty world
if you tell me to do it.

673
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,894
But I need to know what's in that mess.

674
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,856
That way, I will have
the motivation to jump into it.

675
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,906
A borrowed-name bank account.

676
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,452
It's too much to scoop it up on my own.

677
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,497
That's why I need you.

678
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,800
I think it's been almost ten years

679
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,970
since you and I worked as partners.

680
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,848
Here.

681
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,311
Let's go together
for the rest of our lives.

682
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,521
Yes.

683
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:53,404
Starting today, I will personally direct
Jung Hui-ju's murder investigation.

684
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,158
Don't be afraid to go against TJ.

685
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,328
They messed with our families.

686
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,622
Go after them no matter what.

687
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,375
You guys have to risk everything.

688
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,711
Otherwise, we can't beat TJ.

689
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,962
-Do you understand?
-Yes!

690
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,923
-Bong-sik.
-Yes.

691
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,301
Give me a situation report.

692
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,095
We have enough to charge
Gi Dong-jae and Choi Yong-geun.

693
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:22,099
As for who's behind them,
we have to get them together to find out.

694
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,769
But the problem is that
Gi Dong-jae has been released.

695
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,937
What?

696
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,316
-Why?
-The Seoul Division guys filed

697
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,568
a non-indictment
opinion with the prosecutor.

698
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,571
The supplementary indictment
that we filed is still pending.

699
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,156
The prosecutor is the problem.

700
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,200
He doesn't want to get involved with TJ.

701
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,536
He wants to wash his hands
after releasing Gi Dong-jae.

702
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,622
The Seoul Division paved the way for him.

703
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,707
The bigger issue is
Jung Hui-ju's case losing interest

704
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,792
because of Woo Tae-ho
and Cheon Na-na's accident.

705
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,794
We have to shed light
on Jung Hui-ju's case

706
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,171
for him to take action.

707
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,799
How?

708
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,092
We need a reason.

709
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,970
The hearing officers called me in today.

710
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,140
Their claim is baseless,
but I think they will be relentless.

711
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,683
Don't worry about that.

712
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,062
I will stop that even if I have to
bug the commissioner.

713
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,481
You will go to the commissioner?

714
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,108
Chief has no one to fear right now.

715
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,319
Who is the most reckless among the police?

716
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,238
SGC. A superintendent who gave up
becoming a commissioner.

717
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,157
No one can mess with him.

718
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,784
Chief, you're the best.

719
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,953
I never said I was an SGC.

720
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,831
Chief Moon Sang-beom, the invincible SGC!

721
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,500
-Big applause!
-Hear, hear!

722
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,584
-Big applause!
-Enough.

723
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,835
You little…

724
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,755
I'm not asking you to save me
from the corruption allegation.

725
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,842
I'm asking you to make it a bigger issue.

726
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,187
Hello.

727
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,272
Amazing! It's so nice to meet you.

728
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,273
Yes, hello.

729
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,150
-I enjoy your show very much.
-Yes.

730
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,569
-I'm a huge fan.
-I see.

731
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,198
I have some information for your show.

732
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,991
This will surely go viral.

733
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,328
Excuse me,
I don't do the show for a favor.

734
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:10,040
Come on, I already know the price.
Why are you being coy?

735
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:14,962
Look…

736
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,218
That's an appropriate cost, right?

737
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,303
Okay?

738
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,224
The death of the son-in-law
of a conglomerate was a sensational story.

739
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,519
But there was
another dark secret behind the story.

740
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,772
There is another
important supporting character.

741
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,524
It's the police.

742
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,694
The police detective in charge
of Jung Hui-ju's murder.

743
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,030
According to a credible source
who's a police insider,

744
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,325
that detective is being investigated
for an allegation of corruption.

745
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,413
He helped the daughter of a friend
using his status as a detective,

746
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,582
getting her out of further investigation.

747
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,667
He seems like
a run-of-the-mill corrupt cop,

748
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,255
but the problem is that
he allegedly received a bribe from TJ

749
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,175
and tried to cover up
Jung Hui-ju's murder case.

750
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,010
Listen.

751
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,805
Jung Hui-ju was an employee of TJ.

752
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,808
For them, it was just a murder case
of an entry-level employee.

753
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,185
But why?

754
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,190
Why did TJ give
an exorbitant amount of bribes

755
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,694
to a corrupt cop
just to intervene in the investigation?

756
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,779
Hey,

757
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,990
are you sure
we can keep spending like this?

758
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,200
Don't worry.

759
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,745
The money is from the owner
of a building in Gangnam.

760
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,330
Keep typing.

761
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,335
Do you want a glass of wine?

762
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,546
No.

763
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,048
I have a meeting in the afternoon.

764
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,094
Did Cheon Sang-woo ever call you?

765
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,931
I wouldn't take his call if he did.

766
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,266
We are about to have
the shareholders' meeting.

767
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,024
What about McQueen's side?
Is there a direction yet?

768
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,617
I will relay your message to them.

769
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,540
I plan to visit America after the meeting

770
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,291
to clear my head a little.

771
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,963
I want to meet with
the head of McQueen while I'm there.

772
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,673
Can you arrange that?

773
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,064
There's a lot of talk
about Tae-ho's death.

774
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,108
How are you handling it?

775
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,445
It's just temporary.
It'll blow over after a while.

776
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,698
What do you think, Na-na?

777
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,741
It won't just blow over for me.

778
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,868
I may need some time.

779
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,205
The two of you shouldn't
trouble yourselves with his death.

780
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,666
It's my burden to bear.

781
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:03,589
Compensate his family generously.

782
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,048
He did a lot for us.

783
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,342
What exactly…

784
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,054
did he do for us?

785
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,098
He tried to take everything from us.

786
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,975
Put his contribution before his faults.

787
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,311
That's the way to respect the dead.

788
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,646
Okay.

789
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,732
I contacted the major shareholders.

790
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,820
I relayed to them that Sang-woo,
you will be the CEO in my place.

791
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,156
Most of them responded that they agree.

792
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,493
I think we just need to convince McQueen.

793
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,621
I will take care of them.

794
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,916
Are you saying that because of
your college friend, Michael Cha?

795
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,834
Yes.

796
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,377
-Are you confident?
-Yes.

797
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,255
I always thought…

798
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,884
I was unlucky with my children.

799
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,094
But I think…

800
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,556
I did a good job raising my daughter.

801
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,815
What did Na-na say?

802
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,110
She wants to meet
with the head of McQueen herself.

803
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,612
She means to go over my head.

804
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,113
What do you think is her intention?

805
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,532
What Na-na wants is the "King."

806
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,202
So?

807
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,913
The gap between her desire
and her talent is too great.

808
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,998
That's the official statement
from McQueen.

809
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,834
Na-na will be disappointed.
You guys are friends, after all.

810
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,755
I didn't follow her opinions
because I was her friend.

811
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,342
It was because Woo Tae-ho stood by her.

812
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,094
For McQueen,

813
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,638
Cheon Sang-woo isn't
fit for the job either.

814
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,890
We just chose Cheon Sang-woo
because he has you

815
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:40,686
over Cheon Na-na,
who no longer has Woo Tae-ho.

816
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,396
Woo Tae-ho's death

817
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,691
seemed to have worked out well
for Sang-woo and me.

818
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,652
If another person like
Woo Tae-ho ever comes into play,

819
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,780
our position will change again.

820
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,866
That won't happen.

821
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,496
A reporter will be visiting soon.

822
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,165
All you have to do is
tell him what's written.

823
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,418
This is a little…

824
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,086
I'm not telling you to lie.

825
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,923
This isn't totally wrong, but…

826
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,675
Gosh.

827
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,427
Can you do it, Detective Kwon?

828
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,262
Yes, without a problem.

829
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,223
Why don't I get anything?

830
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,601
Someone who likes me even a little
shouldn't do the interview.

831
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,728
You can tell.

832
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,396
Someone who likes…

833
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,232
I don't understand why you think…

834
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,191
Yes, Bo-gyeong.

835
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,652
Yes.

836
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,696
I think this is a little weak.

837
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,824
I want to use swear words like
"damn" and "shit,"

838
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,409
but I can't say that on TV.

839
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,538
BIRTHPLACE OF FOUNDER CHEON TAE-JOO

840
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,374
This place is

841
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,587
where my grandfather,
founder Cheon Tae-joo,

842
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,089
first came into the world.

843
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,510
And today, after 100 years,
it is where I, Cheon Sang-woo,

844
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,513
will take my first step
as the third Chairman

845
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,057
of the Board of Directors.

846
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,436
It will be a difficult path.

847
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,021
However,

848
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,899
every time I get tired and weary
from taking on challenges,

849
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,943
I will think of this place.

850
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:12,861
CHEON SANG-WOO BECOMES HEAD OF TJ

851
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,864
I will remember the 100-year legacy of TJ…

852
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,032
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

853
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,534
…that the founder accomplished.

854
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,854
You can't do it
without my permission, Sang-woo.

855
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:54,528
The history of TJ will start anew with me.

856
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,364
Our first step to becoming a global…

857
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,616
Can we really…

858
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,285
-I'll work hard like if TJ falls,
-get him?

859
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,038
-It would be easier…
-Korea falls.

860
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,374
to pluck a star out of the sky.

861
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,460
I will grow it into a tree
with even deeper roots.

862
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,046
Thank you.

863
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:17,551
FIRST INTERVIEW AT THE BIRTHPLACE OF
TJ FOUNDER, CHEON TAE-JOO

864
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,845
That is tremendous pride.

865
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,515
"If TJ falls, Korea falls."

866
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,685
But the current state at TJ isn't rosy.

867
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,644
Yes.

868
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,647
First, the Honorary Chairman
Cheon Seong-dae is imprisoned.

869
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,483
Then the son-in-law died in an accident.

870
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,819
Also, there was the bad news

871
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,698
that an employee of TJ Group,
Jung Hui-ju, was murdered.

872
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,742
Wasn't that from a personal broadcast
on the internet recently?

873
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,702
That's correct.

874
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:47,789
The huge response isn't
limited to the online world.

875
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,833
We looked into it a little deeper.

876
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,585
Please take a look at the screen.

877
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,338
He was at the Seoul Criminal Investigation
Division and joined us a year ago.

878
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,174
He's such a lunatic
so I don't know what he was thinking.

879
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,469
I think I heard
that he worked on the TJ case

880
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,263
when he was with the Seoul Division.

881
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,890
But think about it.

882
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:09,936
Does it make sense that a big company
like TJ bribed a police lieutenant?

883
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,897
There's a discrepancy in levels.

884
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,858
It would make more sense
if his boss took the bribe.

885
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,401
Who do you mean by "his boss"?

886
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,238
I don't know the details,
but I heard he quit the police force

887
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:25,035
and now he's one of the high-ranking
officers on TJ's legal team.

888
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,912
But I just heard it somewhere.

889
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,373
It's not accurate information.

890
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,961
-This won't work. Please edit this out.
-What are they trying to pull?

891
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,297
I heard he owns a building in Gangnam.

892
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,424
In Gangnam.

893
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,718
He doesn't know what a credit limit is.

894
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,928
Gosh.

895
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,555
Do you think that's possible
with a detective's paycheck?

896
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,933
He thinks anything is possible with money.

897
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,811
He's completely materialistic.

898
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,522
He likes money and women.
He is total scum.

899
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,983
I was fooled by his looks.

900
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,654
I made a big mistake.

901
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:05,325
Not long ago, I arranged a meeting
with the top management of our company.

902
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,410
It was at a very secretive place.

903
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:12,958
I didn't know a detective
could be a sociopath like that.

904
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:17,796
That means that
this corrupt detective made a secret deal

905
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:22,133
concerning the murder of Jung Hui-ju,
an employee of TJ,

906
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,220
with one of TJ's top executives.

907
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,430
Nothing has been verified yet.

908
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,516
But forgotten due to
the corruption scandal,

909
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,311
Jung Hui-ju's case is becoming
an issue of great interest.

910
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,938
Currently, the Blue House bulletin

911
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,399
is flooded with over 100,000 petitions

912
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,944
demanding the truth
about the murder of Jung Hui-ju.

913
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,320
Yes, thank you.

914
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,368
The prosecutor will
accept additional charges.

915
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,955
Let's arrest Gi Dong-jae
and officially resume investigating.

916
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,249
It will be hard to find Gi Dong-jae.

917
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,377
We have to find him somehow.

918
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,629
We need his confession
to unravel the rest.

919
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,174
They didn't release
Gi Dong-jae to save him.

920
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,260
They did it to get him killed.

921
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,137
Then what do you want to do?

922
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,347
He's not the main body anyway.

923
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,642
We have to get Choi Yong-geun first,
and then…

924
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,312
we will pluck the star from the sky.

925
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,945
Apparently, Gi Dong-jae was released.

926
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,282
Maybe he ran far away with his girlfriend.

927
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,787
We got the guys excited for no reason.

928
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,873
What if we are back to square one?

929
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:38,293
No, I have a feeling that
we will hit the jackpot.

930
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,587
Guys like me don't hit jackpots.

931
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,338
What do you mean?

932
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,133
You won third place in the lottery
not too long ago.

933
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,844
You can't call that a jackpot.

934
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,472
The first prize is over a billion won.

935
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:55,060
Because of one number,
999,000,000 won is gone.

936
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,978
It wasn't even the first prize.

937
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,441
Not one thing has gone right ever since.

938
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,070
There comes our jackpot.

939
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,698
Catching a criminal
is the jackpot for a detective.

940
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,621
One moment!

941
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,083
Excuse us.

942
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,838
What is it?

943
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,133
Do you know about the crime
of concealing evidence, by any chance?

944
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,385
What? What is that?

945
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,929
What is it?

946
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,766
Gi Dong-jae killed a person.
He even beat up two detectives.

947
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,393
But the evidence is all on his phone.

948
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,229
If you hide that cell phone,

949
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,231
it's a crime of concealing evidence.

950
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,567
But if you hand over
Gi Dong-jae's cell phone to the police?

951
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,446
For your contribution
to the investigation,

952
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,740
you will then receive
the exemplary citizen award

953
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,660
There's also a reward.

954
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,871
It is equivalent
to the third prize in the lottery.

955
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,206
Why are you…

956
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,416
So, what will you do?

957
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,086
Will you choose this?

958
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:07,215
Or will you choose, after tax,
1,103,000 won?

959
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,384
I said I don't know.

960
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,804
Detective Oh Ji-hyeok took the day off
and went somewhere.

961
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,764
To the South Pole.

962
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,267
He went to the South Pole
to meet the penguins.

963
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,478
-Okay?
-No, It wasn't me.

964
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,065
Why would I swear? It wasn't me.

965
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,608
Goodbye.

966
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,486
Put all the phones off the hook.

967
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,785
-Maybe we took it too far.
-There's no hard evidence, only suspicion.

968
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,620
We'll keep it up for a bit

969
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,498
and then I'll tell them
it was my father's inheritance.

970
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,292
But it's…

971
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,669
-Yes.
-Whatever. He owns a building.

972
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,796
Hello?

973
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,840
Detective Oh…

974
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,093
-Director Cheon?
-Please help me.

975
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,932
This is Oh Ji-hyeok,
Incheon Seobu Police Station.

976
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,643
101 Ocheon-ri, Seongsan-myeon,
Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do.

977
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,605
Please send nearby officers
and an ambulance.

978
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,482
A woman called for help.

979
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,786
I think it's somewhere in Gyeonggi-do.

980
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,497
-I'll tell you
-Hey.

981
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,956
once I look at the GPS.

982
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,541
-What about Jung Hui-ju's corpse?
-You found Gi Dong-jae's phone?

983
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,834
-Yes.
-Yes.

984
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,336
Where are you?

985
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,588
Let's see…

986
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,132
I think it's somewhere in Gyeonggi-do.

987
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,260
I'll tell you once I look at the GPS.

988
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,803
What about Jung Hui-ju's corpse?

989
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,975
It pretty much looks like the photo.

990
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,977
I would be convinced he killed her.

991
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,271
-Do you have gloves on?
-Of course.

992
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,356
What about your shoes?

993
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,192
Like you said,
I covered them to not leave footprints.

994
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,444
Okay. You may have left
our DNA on her robe.

995
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,364
Try to remember if you
handled it with your bare hands.

996
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,533
I washed it before I brought it.

997
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,035
I had my gloves on, so don't worry.

998
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,828
Do you remember how you got there?

999
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,872
Trace your steps back down.

1000
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,334
The branches may have scratched
your clothes or skin.

1001
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,128
Cut off all suspicious branches
and burn them.

1002
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,338
Okay.

1003
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,716
Drive the car you transported her in
for a while, then drive it into the water.

1004
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,010
DNA remains even if you
scrap it or burn it,

1005
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,762
so get it underwater no matter what.

1006
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,641
Check thoroughly for evidence
before you do it.

1007
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,562
Burn all your belongings to ashes.

1008
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,729
Yes, sir.

1009
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,819
We got Choi Yong-geun.

1010
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,740
We can finally look at
Jung Hui-ju's grandfather in the face.

1011
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,046
Oh Ji-hyeok, Violent Crimes Unit Team 2
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

1012
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,133
-What happened?
-By the time we came, she had recovered.

1013
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,343
According to her, it was a diabetic shock.

1014
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,095
-Where is she?
-She's inside.

1015
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,514
She said we could leave
because a friend was coming.

1016
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,683
I see. Thank you.

1017
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,892
-Good night.
-Good night.

1018
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,431
Why are you tormenting me?

1019
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,477
What did I do to you?

1020
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,146
Why?

1021
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,983
I told you to bring
what Woo Tae-ho was hiding,

1022
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,360
not for you to use it.

1023
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,863
What do you want? Is it money?

1024
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,200
Or do you want me to make him
get a divorce for you?

1025
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,160
Give Min-ji her child back.

1026
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,790
Why do you…

1027
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,294
Why do you care about Kim Min-ji's kid?

1028
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,505
She has nothing to say to me.

1029
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,716
I gave her enough.

1030
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,595
You took everything from Min-ji.

1031
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,721
So what?

1032
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,475
If I don't return the child,

1033
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:31,187
will you hand the CCTV footage
over to the police?

1034
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,148
Yes.

1035
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,987
Go ahead.

1036
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:44,367
I can hire a lawyer
and get myself out of there.

1037
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,285
But what will happen to you?

1038
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:52,709
Your life will probably be hell.

1039
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,713
I fully expected that.

1040
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,133
Is that right?

1041
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,928
What about your shoemaker grandfather?

1042
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,431
He seemed pretty frail.

1043
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,351
What are you saying?

1044
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:16,524
I'm saying that your grandfather
may see hell before you do.

1045
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,820
What if I…

1046
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,990
sent the footage to Director Cheon?

1047
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,285
Then the Chairman would see it too.

1048
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,372
Don't you fear them more than the police?

1049
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,916
What?

1050
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,129
And if the Chairman finds out
why you assaulted Min-ji,

1051
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,256
he will be greatly disappointed.

1052
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:44,761
Are you…

1053
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,305
threatening me right now?

1054
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:52,018
Someone lowly like you?

1055
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,646
I thought you'd be
used to threats like this.

1056
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,523
What?

1057
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,194
You beat an innocent woman
to the brink of her death.

1058
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,405
You took her baby from her
and threatened her to cover it up.

1059
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:08,451
You even threatened a weak old man.

1060
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,455
Compared to that,
this isn't even a threat.

1061
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,915
You really…

1062
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,502
are on a mission to die.

1063
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,170
Sit down!

1064
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,088
Give Min-ji her child back.

1065
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,383
This is the last chance I can give you.

1066
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,678
Hey.

1067
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,514
Hey!

1068
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,849
Stop right there!

1069
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,965
Kill Jung Hui-ju.

1070
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,761
I will give you enough
for generations to come.

1071
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,305
Kill Jung Hui-ju!

1072
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,475
Mr. Choi will take care of the rest.

1073
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,061
All you need to do, Gi Dong-jae,

1074
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,355
is to kill her.

1075
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,065
Got it?

1076
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,693
Thank you for saving me.

1077
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,195
This is a token of my gratitude.

1078
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,396
We have an arrest warrant
for Choi Yong-geun.

1079
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,899
We have solid evidence.
He can't get out of this.

1080
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,734
I'll see you soon, Chairman.

1081
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,069
Would you be in this mess
if Tae-ho were alive?

1082
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,322
You've been hiding all your life.

1083
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,824
Why are you revealing your true self now?

1084
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,326
Why did Woo Tae-ho die?

1085
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,202
That belongs to the man
I share a bed with.

1086
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,829
Why!

1087
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,123
If you were the prosecutor,
would you indict Cheon Sang-woo?

1088
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,666
How will you handle the aftermath?

1089
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,087
Will you tell them who the real killer is
or will you take all the blame?

1090
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,214
The police have summoned you.

1091
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,383
You must get her on your side.

1092
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:34,096
