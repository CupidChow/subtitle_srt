JUNGIN SHOES

4
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,208
Mr. Jung…

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,713
Gosh, you're still hanging on.

6
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,341
Grab him.

7
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,816
The last signal was from here.

8
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,152
Where is this place?

9
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,945
Mr. Jung's address is near this place.

10
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,536
Yes, Eun-hye.

11
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,372
Mr. Jung texted me,

12
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,083
but it sounds weird.

13
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,502
He says he wants to join Hui-ju.

14
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,713
But…

15
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,009
he's never texted me before.

16
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,177
And…

17
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,515
a suspicious man came to his shop.

18
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,145
It looks like he was
searching for something.

19
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,688
Yes.

20
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,149
Do-chang,

21
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,736
I think something happened to Mr. Jung.

22
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,362
What do we do?

23
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,947
Do-chang, please…

24
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,327
Please save Mr. Jung.

25
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,288
They are trying to make it
look like a suicide.

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,999
The text to Eun-hye hints at suicide.

27
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,293
They took his cell phone
and sent the message.

28
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,295
Let's go before it's too late.

29
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,634
Darn it.

30
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,972
Someone is coming.

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,349
Shit.

32
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,642
Come on, hurry up.

33
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,940
Pull.

34
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,158
Over there!

35
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,451
Shit!

36
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,707
Cut the rope, quick!

37
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,793
Hold him!

38
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,919
Cut the rope.

39
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,212
Call the ambulance, hurry!

40
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,047
Get him down! Good.

41
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,091
Send an ambulance to where the signal is.

42
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,598
Mr. Jung…

43
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,183
You can't go like this.

44
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,646
Please hold on.
Breathe like your life depends on it.

45
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,817
There is something else you need to know.

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,279
So, please… Come back to life.

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,825
HAEMYUNG MEDICAL CENTER

48
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,890
Mr. Jung…

49
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,440
Please hang on a little longer for me.

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,486
I can't lose someone in vain again.

51
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,822
Mr. Jung, please… I'm begging you.

52
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,705
Other than our footprints,
we found several more.

53
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,791
They ran away in a rush
so they couldn't erase their trace.

54
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,335
After the lab analysis,

55
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,337
we will soon be able
to find out who they were.

56
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,049
-What about the other guys?
-They're checking the CCTV of the roads.

57
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,177
Okay. Hold the forensic guys
until the end.

58
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,055
Tell them I will kill them
if they do a half-hearted job.

59
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,849
Tell them they better not miss
a single strand of hair.

60
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,144
-Okay.
-Keep working.

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,826
He will regain consciousness.

62
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,330
We can't say for sure because of his age,

63
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,707
but he is strong-willed.

64
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,668
He will definitely recover. Trust me.

65
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,006
Are you sure
he wasn't trying to kill himself?

66
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,258
Yes. I'm sure of that.

67
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,177
Why?

68
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,513
Why did they hurt him like this?

69
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,101
We're investigating that
so we will find out soon.

70
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,772
I bet it's him.

71
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,024
I bet he's definitely connected.

72
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,029
-Who?
-I saw his face.

73
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,198
He tied me up
at Mr. Jung's shop and ran away.

74
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,034
What? Who was that bastard?

75
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,578
What did he do to you?

76
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,790
He was looking for something
in Mr. Jung's shop.

77
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,291
He ran into me

78
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,044
and he covered my eyes
so I wouldn't see his face.

79
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,255
But I saw his face.

80
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,969
Did you see him for sure?

81
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,554
Was it someone you saw before?

82
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,015
No. But I remember him clearly.

83
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,269
His eyes, nose, and lips.

84
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,063
His whole face.

85
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,719
I don't know.

86
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,930
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

87
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,933
It's okay.

88
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,060
Dad.

89
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,202
I'm never going to make
the same mistake again. Never.

90
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,006
What did you do
with Jung Hui-ju's clothes?

91
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,426
I burned them.

92
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,388
Good work. Was there any problem?

93
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,058
There is something that bothers me.

94
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,310
That means you didn't do a clean job.

95
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,479
No.

96
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,068
I heard something happened
to Jung Hui-ju's grandfather.

97
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,779
But he didn't die.

98
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,157
I guess that's what bothers you.

99
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,828
The doctors say
he will not likely recover.

100
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,373
It's such a shame.

101
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,499
Isn't it?

102
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,712
Anyway, have you eliminated
most of the problematic things?

103
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,714
It's too soon to say.

104
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,800
I think we have to monitor the situation.

105
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,887
Mr. Jang, is this the best you can do?

106
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,138
Excuse me?

107
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,683
You should give me more confidence

108
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,853
"There won't be a problem."
"If there is, I will take care of it."

109
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,188
That's what you should say.

110
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,857
I will try, but…

111
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,402
Then why did you do things
that I didn't ask you to do?

112
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,281
You will take responsibility
for the mess you make.

113
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,327
I understand. I think I was mistaken.

114
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,622
I will take care of the
things that may become a problem.

115
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,212
I'm a little busy these days.

116
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
There's a lot to take care of
in the company.

117
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,011
If things are handled well,

118
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,848
I will promote you
to the closest position to me.

119
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes, I understand.

120
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,277
How did you know Mr. Jung was in danger?

121
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,072
There was something I gave him.

122
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,577
They tried to kill him because of it.

123
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,331
What was it?

124
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,757
You guys…

125
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,676
Didn't you beat up Gi Dong-jae's brother?

126
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,972
You are the ones
who kidnapped Jung Hui-ju's grandfather

127
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,807
and made it look like suicide.

128
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,934
Gi Dong-jae's brother told us everything.

129
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,312
He said you guys came with Gu Jae-chun.

130
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,815
We have the evidence related to you
from the crime scene.

131
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,402
We sent them to the National Forensic
Service. The results will be out soon.

132
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,572
He even verified the van you were riding
from the CCTV footage.

133
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,533
Two, one, one, two. Is that wrong?

134
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,374
In my life investigating gangsters,
I've seen countless vicious guys.

135
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,917
But never such punks like you.

136
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,339
Even if you are low-life scumbags,
he is your grandfather's age.

137
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,674
You bastard. Do you want to die?

138
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,968
-Hey, take it easy.
-Calm down.

139
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,512
Calm down.

140
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,014
You guys aren't even gangsters.

141
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,183
You are scum.

142
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,643
Just scum of the earth.

143
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,604
Damn it. Why are you hitting us?

144
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,482
-Isn't this a violation of human rights?
-You…

145
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,317
Human rights, my ass.

146
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,277
Only humans get human rights.

147
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,487
Asshole.

148
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,988
Do-chang!

149
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,615
Calm down.

150
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,826
Sit up straight, punk.

151
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,994
These kids don't know better.

152
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,914
You were just following orders, right?

153
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,501
You didn't want to do it,
but your boss made you do it.

154
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,879
Imagine that a rumor spreads
that you guys beat up an 80-year-old man.

155
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,051
Do you think you can walk around
with your heads held high as gangsters?

156
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,928
You can't. It's too embarrassing.

157
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,764
They won't treat you
as human beings in prison, either.

158
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,059
You will have to spend a long time
with your heads stuck in the toilet.

159
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,562
-Sure.
-Just pick one to blame it on.

160
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,772
Then, your names won't appear in the news.

161
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,441
Was it Gu Jae-chun?

162
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,151
Yeah?

163
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,112
Was it someone else?

164
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,781
That is…

165
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,578
It looks like Jae-chun got
an order from someone.

166
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,663
Do you know who that is?

167
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,665
Well…

168
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,419
I don't know that.

169
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,713
Only Jae-chun knows.

170
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,633
You bastard!

171
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,511
Shit.

172
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,309
What brings you here?

173
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,730
I heard Jung Hui-ju's grandfather
suffered an accident.

174
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,607
Did you find the reason?

175
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,692
We're still investigating.

176
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,446
But what is the reason
you're so interested in the case?

177
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,533
I was actually investigating
Gi Dong-jae's disappearance for a while.

178
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,078
I thought Gu Jae-chun could be behind it.

179
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,415
I was wondering if he was
responsible for this, too.

180
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,669
I can't say anything
because we're still investigating.

181
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,965
I'm not trying to take away the case.

182
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,843
I'm trying to give the case
to the Incheon Seobu Police.

183
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,929
Is that so?

184
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,349
But we haven't found anything yet.

185
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,185
Our guys were spying
on Gu Jae-chun's guys.

186
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,271
They saw your guys taking them away.

187
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,567
That must mean they are involved
in Mr. Jung's case, am I right?

188
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,319
Am I right?

189
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,988
Well…

190
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,200
This is evidence

191
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,954
that Gu Jae-chun killed Gi Dong-jae.

192
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,334
Incheon Seobu Station
got the best of me again.

193
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,753
You guys can

194
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,047
arrest Gu Jae-chun.

195
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,429
We can't stop this.
It's already beyond my reach.

196
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,431
Are you washing your hands now?

197
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,643
I only did what you told me to.

198
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,020
Stay under the radar for a bit.

199
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,981
Give me some time to handle this.

200
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,525
I trust that you will.

201
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,463
FAITHFUL WARM AND TRUSTY POLICE

202
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,636
What is this?

203
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,263
Did she see me that night?

204
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,019
This forensic report states

205
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,980
that Gi Dong-jae's blood
was found on the deck of a boat.

206
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,274
And this is…

207
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,777
a testimony

208
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,031
stating that the owner lent
the boat to one of Gu Jae-chun's guys.

209
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,492
It's the evidence proving
Gu Jae-chun killed Gi Dong-jae.

210
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,580
But why would Jang Gi-jin
hand this over to us?

211
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,333
He said we should catch Gu Jae-chun.

212
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,587
Jang Gi-jin, that punk
is scheming something.

213
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,340
He wants to blame Gi Dong-jae's death

214
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,425
and Mr. Jung's accident on Gu Jae-chun.

215
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,052
He wants to stay out of it.

216
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,514
It's Eun-hye.

217
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,641
Hello.

218
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,768
Eun-hye, why are you here?

219
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,686
I have something to show you.

220
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,117
It's Jang Gi-jin.

221
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,164
This is the man who snuck into
Mr. Jung's shop and stole something.

222
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,251
I just saw him drive away
from the police station too.

223
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,925
Gi Dong-jae's brother gave Mr. Jung
the clothes and shoes

224
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,719
Jung Hui-ju was wearing
at the time she was killed.

225
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,264
Jang Gi-jin must have found that
at Mr. Jung's shop.

226
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:18,435
He ordered the Gangnam East Gang guys
to kidnap Mr. Jung and kill him,

227
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,938
making it look like suicide,

228
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,983
while he stole
Jung Hui-ju's things from the shop.

229
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,111
He made sure we caught
the Gangnam East Gang guys

230
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,280
and gave us the evidence
of the murder of Gi Dong-jae.

231
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,034
So that would turn
our attention to Gu Jae-chun.

232
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,204
That was Jang Gi-jin's intention.

233
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,290
What could be in Jung Hui-ju's things

234
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,917
that they tried to kill a person?

235
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,712
Gi Dong-jae didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

236
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,716
That's why he was holding onto
her things as evidence.

237
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,095
That means the evidence pointing
to Jung Hui-ju's killer is her things.

238
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
Jang Gi-jin is the team leader
of Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

239
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,479
That means the evidence is
in the possession of the police.

240
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,358
He's no longer a cop

241
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,319
but a criminal.

242
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,949
SIMHOE IRON MOLDING

243
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,536
Hello.

244
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,414
I'm Kwon Jae-hong
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

245
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,958
How long have you done business here?

246
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,599
-Executive Director, it's Cheon Na-na.
-Yes, hello.

247
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,770
Didn't I announce that I'm having
a meeting with the company's presidents?

248
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,691
The Honorary Chairman
changed the location suddenly.

249
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:53,530
I thought he was going to tell you
but I guess the message wasn't delivered.

250
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,240
I apologize.

251
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,370
There's nothing to apologize for.

252
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,638
Yes.

253
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,724
The detectives are
investigating something, as you said.

254
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,892
Okay.

255
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,694
Nice work.

256
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,404
You were right to burn them.

257
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,657
Otherwise, things could have
gotten complicated.

258
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,450
Yong-geun,

259
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,994
the situation is pretty serious.

260
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,789
There will be too many charges
against me for this.

261
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,000
Illegal trespassing, assault,
and concealment of evidence.

262
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,419
-Even conspiracy to murder.
-That's quite a lot.

263
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,509
Don't worry. I will clean up
all of the mess for you.

264
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,719
You couldn't protect
Chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

265
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,639
And you're in prison right now.

266
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,977
How can I keep trusting you
under these circumstances?

267
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,019
Gi-jin.

268
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,940
If something happens to you,

269
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,485
the money we made together
will disappear into thin air too.

270
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,779
I'm serious this time too.

271
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,074
I will protect you at all costs.
Don't worry.

272
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,953
Yong-geun,

273
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,622
who is the real killer?

274
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,544
If you tell me, I will trust you.

275
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,551
I only received Jung Hui-ju's corpse.

276
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,595
And I handed it over to Gi Dong-jae.

277
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,889
I don't know who killed her and how.

278
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:46,894
So who handed over the corpse to you?

279
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,818
Woo Tae-ho.

280
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,155
But at the trial, why…

281
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,866
Cheon Sang-woo had to be convicted
of conspiracy to murder,

282
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,576
so we could get the money.

283
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,702
Right?

284
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,881
The defibrillator is ready.

285
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,424
-Turn it up to 200 joules.
-Got it.

286
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,313
This is all of it.
Jang Gi-jin's not in it.

287
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,107
He knew where the CCTV was in advance.

288
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,901
That bastard.

289
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,779
He used his knowledge
as a cop on things like this.

290
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,866
That means this is
all we have as evidence.

291
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,580
-Did you find anything?
-Yes.

292
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,666
Do you have Jang Gi-jin's footage?

293
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,584
No, we don't have Jang Gi-jin.

294
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,630
But Cheon Na-na was there.

295
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,892
Does that mean Cheon Na-na
is involved in this case?

296
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,893
Yes.

297
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,645
But the time is during the day.

298
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,023
There's a wide gap between then
and the time Eun-hye saw Jang Gi-jin.

299
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,900
Could it be a coincidence?

300
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,195
We should check with Cheon Na-na first.

301
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,572
She definitely went to the shop.

302
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,908
She'll tell us why she went
in one way or another.

303
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,202
Would Cheon Na-na be straight with us?

304
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
This is Kang Do-chang with the Incheon
Seobu Police Station.

305
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,125
What?

306
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,668
I see.

307
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,586
I will be right there.

308
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,879
Yes.

309
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,135
Something happened to Mr. Jung.
I have to go to the hospital.

310
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,511
-Let's talk later.
-Okay.

311
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,143
Something is fishy, isn't it?

312
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,396
Why did something happen to Mr. Jung

313
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,065
as soon as we find out
Cheon Na-na was at the shop?

314
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,108
Maybe Cheon Na-na…

315
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,444
Why would a woman like Cheon Na-na…

316
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,780
She's perfectly capable
of doing something like that.

317
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,955
What happened?

318
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,415
Is it…

319
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,549
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

320
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,238
What is it?

321
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,783
Jung Hui-ju's grandfather
is in the hospital.

322
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,412
Somebody tried to kill him
while masking it as suicide.

323
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:59,294
You were on the black box footage
of a truck near Mr. Jung's shop.

324
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,963
-Why were you there?
-I went to meet Mr. Jung.

325
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,131
For what reason?

326
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,676
I don't think you would believe me
no matter what I tell you.

327
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,680
Mr. Jung is unconscious,
so you can't hear his side of the story.

328
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,183
I didn't tell you he was unconscious.

329
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,353
Don't you think I already know that?

330
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,772
I have people everywhere.

331
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,650
Are you admitting

332
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,069
that you met the victim
on the day of the incident?

333
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,079
Are you suspecting me again?

334
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,416
You met the victim.
You are a suspect with that fact alone.

335
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,295
You are the one who made him that way.

336
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,841
You can't let go of a case
that's already resolved,

337
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,510
which only makes more unnecessary victims.

338
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,305
If you stop now,

339
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,308
nothing will happen.

340
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,062
If I stop…

341
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,400
Would the killer stop too?

342
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,027
If I were the killer,

343
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,363
I would.

344
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,952
I understand.

345
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,662
Thank you for your cooperation.

346
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,708
We will send an official summon.

347
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,418
I'll see you at the police station.

348
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,506
All of the things happening
around you, Detective Oh,

349
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,718
are happening because of you.

350
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,055
There may be
other innocent victims like Mr. Jung.

351
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,017
I hope you will think about it.

352
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,580
You are the one who made him that way.

353
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,082
If you stop now,

354
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,877
nothing will happen.

355
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,266
How does McQueen feel about
TJ's current situation?

356
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,062
To be honest, it's the worst.

357
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,981
Have a drink.

358
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,077
What is your dream?

359
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,914
For now,
it's to rise to the top at McQueen.

360
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,291
Will McQueen put you at the top?

361
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,754
You are a foreigner in their world.

362
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,091
I agree. But it must change.

363
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,968
I will change it.

364
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,349
Are you planning on breaking up TJ?

365
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,729
If you break it up and sell it,
you will probably make a lot of money.

366
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,024
But to break up a Korean conglomerate

367
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,361
and give the money to foreign companies?

368
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,239
There will be a lot of backlash.

369
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:20,370
Perhaps McQueen would need
to sacrifice someone.

370
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,457
So who would be the best scapegoat?

371
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:32,507
But if you single-handedly save
a dying company,

372
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,804
wouldn't you become an essential person
for both TJ and McQueen?

373
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,517
That theory is too ideal.

374
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,605
TJ's current situation isn't
something that I can save.

375
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,024
What I'm saying is…

376
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:54,738
I want you to become the head of TJ.

377
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:01,077
Separation of ownership and management
of a conglomerate,

378
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,498
people want that and you will be the hero
who makes that ideal come true.

379
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,003
Would that be possible in reality?

380
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,921
If I want it, it will become reality.

381
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,967
You only need to do one thing.

382
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,272
-Yes.
-Do you have time?

383
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,358
Let's meet.

384
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,319
I'm sorry, but I have something tonight.

385
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,404
I sent the car. Stop by for a minute.

386
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,288
I will be there. I guess I have to.

387
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,222
Have a seat.

388
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,186
-You must be busy.
-It's the same.

389
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,690
You broke your promise
at the shareholders' meeting.

390
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,150
Shouldn't you apologize to me?

391
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,033
I understand.

392
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,244
What did the chairman want?

393
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,123
He wanted advice.

394
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
On what?

395
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,376
You're well aware of the situation, too.

396
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,129
You also know what
the chairman wants from me.

397
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,755
Did he say anything about me?

398
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,341
No, he didn't.

399
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,762
So what is the conclusion
you two made together?

400
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,267
Even McQueen doesn't want
these misfortunes to keep happening.

401
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,229
They may go with the worst-case scenario.

402
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,443
The chairman wanted
to personally talk to McQueen.

403
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,989
But that would probably make
the situation worse.

404
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,285
So, this is just my thought.

405
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:11,124
But it would be better for someone else
to meet with McQueen and work it out.

406
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:13,960
Who?

407
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,591
You said you wanted to meet my boss.

408
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,552
Are you telling me to go?

409
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,096
No.

410
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,641
I will not force you.

411
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,227
Figuring out what's best
for the company and for you,

412
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,404
You have a weird habit.

413
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:49,454
When you aren't being honest,
you speak English without realizing.

414
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,459
Maybe it's the opposite.

415
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,921
English is easier for me
to express my feelings.

416
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,050
Okay. I will think about it.

417
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,805
You should go. You said you had plans.

418
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,849
Let me know when you make a decision.

419
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,987
Dad told you to send me to America,
Didn't he?

420
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,823
That he'll send me there to kill me.

421
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,830
I told you not to lie to me in English!

422
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,581
Na-na…

423
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,501
Did you get on his side, too?

424
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,878
Are you teaming up with him
to strangle me?

425
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,716
Let's forget about you going to America.
Then it's fine, right?

426
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:00,024
Tell Dad. I will not die.

427
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,821
Even if I do,
I will take everything down with me.

428
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,032
Make sure to tell him.

429
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,024
I have people everywhere.

430
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,276
If you stop now,

431
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,778
nothing will happen.

432
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,488
If I were the killer,

433
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,699
I would.

434
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,082
How is Mr. Jung? Is he okay?

435
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,377
He had a momentary heart failure.

436
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,089
Fortunately, he recovered right away.

437
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,174
What was the reason?

438
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,803
I don't know. The doctors don't know.

439
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,389
They say it happens to critical patients
sometimes.

440
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,183
I guess we have to trust the doctors.

441
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,938
How did it go with Cheon Na-na?
Did she admit to meeting Mr. Jung?

442
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,065
Yes.

443
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,568
What do you think?

444
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,656
Don't you think Cheon Na-na is
behind Jang Gi-jin for sure?

445
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,491
For now…

446
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,827
I don't think
we should bother her for a while.

447
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,288
Why all of a sudden?

448
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,666
Are you scared of her now?

449
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,377
Let's catch Gu Jae-chun first.

450
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,004
If we catch Gu Jae-chun
and trace that up to Jang Gi-jin,

451
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,714
we will see Cheon Na-na.

452
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,175
He must know his guys are caught.

453
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,386
Do you think he's hiding?

454
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,681
I know. Maybe he went overseas.

455
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,642
I bet he's still watching
how things will unfold.

456
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,560
He probably thinks
Jang Gi-jin will protect him

457
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,521
as the team leader of Seoul
Criminal Investigation Division.

458
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,606
Shit.

459
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,732
Hey,

460
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,651
you know Gu Jae-chun a little.

461
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,113
-Is she seeing any woman?
-He does like women.

462
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,823
But he isn't faithful to just one.

463
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,450
Besides, it's been two years
since I investigated him

464
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,703
so I don't know who he's seeing now.

465
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,830
It's a dead end.

466
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,373
We have to catch him

467
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,960
in order to charge Jang Gi-jin for sure.

468
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,214
There is something Gu Jae-chun likes
as much as he likes women.

469
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,049
What is it?

470
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,218
Black goat soup.

471
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:37,390
CHEONG BLACK GOAT

472
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,981
This is Gu Jae-chun's
favorite restaurant, right?

473
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,650
-Yes.
-How often does he come here?

474
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,653
He usually comes about twice a week.

475
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,238
What does he eat from here?

476
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,240
Mostly jeongol stew.

477
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,827
Is there a particular type of dish
that Gu Jae-chun likes to eat?

478
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,204
He likes all jeongol stew dishes
from this place.

479
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,332
He prefers the goat skin salad over suyuk.

480
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,544
He wouldn't come here in person to eat.

481
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:11,007
We will have to follow
every delivery or pick-up order.

482
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,016
JUNGIN SHOES

483
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,768
What are you doing here?

484
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,521
I'm cleaning up
before Mr. Jung comes back.

485
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,400
He'll be sad to see his shop
messed up when he comes back.

486
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,778
He likes it clean.

487
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,496
I think Mr. Jung is getting better.

488
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,957
Is he?

489
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,919
Yes, you can tell
from the sound of his breathing.

490
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,921
He seems to be getting more comfortable.

491
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,549
You must have
a deep connection with Mr. Jung.

492
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,929
He was very taken by you.

493
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,349
No, I liked him more.

494
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,268
Why? What did you like about him?

495
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,271
Well…

496
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,650
I was just happy to have him in my life.

497
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,778
Whenever I missed him,
I could run over and see him.

498
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,240
Do-chang, I have to go.

499
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,159
The ICU has limited
visiting hours so I have to hurry.

500
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,452
-Okay.
-Bye.

501
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,339
I thought you were going to work.

502
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,091
Why are you sitting there like that?

503
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,763
Aren't you going to work?
Why are you drinking?

504
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,853
You said you had a lot to do.

505
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,940
Come to your senses. What are you doing?

506
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,568
You have to catch the guys
who hurt Mr. Jung.

507
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,070
You said you had to catch them
before they ran away.

508
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,030
You can't sit here like this.

509
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,995
I'm so angry.

510
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,331
-I'm so angry.
-Do-chang…

511
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,334
I'm just so angry.

512
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,298
I'm angry with myself.

513
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,758
I'm angry with everything.

514
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,053
I'm so angry about everything.

515
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,222
Let it out.

516
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,100
Go ahead and cry.

517
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,898
Just let it all out.

518
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,160
CHEONG BLACK GOAT

519
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,192
-Freeze!
-You bastard!

520
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,444
What's going on?

521
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,448
Well…

522
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,493
Do any of you know Ji Mun-suk
among the women that work here?

523
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,621
She's his little sister.

524
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,790
She looks just like him,
except with longer hair.

525
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,209
There is no such person here.

526
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,046
But why do you have that?

527
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,300
Just wait until I find her.

528
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,802
-Mun-suk? Mun-suk.
-Yes.

529
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,263
I'm going to break her leg.

530
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,808
Where are you, Mun-suk?

531
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,893
Enjoy your meal.

532
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,171
I didn't know you were coming
so I ordered only for myself.

533
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,173
Go tell them there is one more person.

534
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm fine.

535
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,888
Finish your meal.

536
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,183
Who told you I was here?

537
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,313
I had someone follow you.
I was worried about you, Dad.

538
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,605
Yeah?

539
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,985
These greens are good. You will like them
even with your picky palate.

540
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,197
I…

541
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,077
I don't know what you want from me, Dad.

542
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,873
If you tell me specifically,
I will do as you say.

543
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,834
I told you, shrink your ego.

544
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,378
I'm only staying where I always was.

545
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,629
How…

546
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,799
How am I supposed to go even lower?

547
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,595
To a place where you're invisible,
where I can't see you,

548
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,929
that's where you should go.

549
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,849
Shall I die for you?

550
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,813
Is that something
you should say to your father?

551
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,982
I committed a deadly sin.

552
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:26,530
I sent the only person
you think of as a family to jail.

553
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,159
I gave the police the evidence.

554
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,996
How could you forgive me,
even if I was your daughter?

555
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,710
Why did you do it?

556
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,047
He made Mom kill herself.

557
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,965
So it was revenge?

558
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:51,097
I did more for you
than that woman ever gave you.

559
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,183
So why do you have to avenge
that woman's death? Why?

560
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,393
Why?

561
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,312
The person you call "that woman,"

562
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,359
taught me one thing before she died.

563
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,194
"Take it all."

564
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,322
"You will die,
if you don't take all of it."

565
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,659
Do you really believe
what that foolish woman told you?

566
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,787
She was foolish.

567
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,041
She was trampled to death
having never rebelled once.

568
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,669
You seem quite determined tonight.

569
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,631
You are trying to provoke me
so I won't ignore you.

570
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,386
Do you know why you got prison time?

571
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,848
I sent the documents to the Blue House.

572
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,726
You really want to die at my hands.

573
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,691
Enjoy your meal.

574
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,162
I'll be honest with you.

575
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,248
I'm afraid of you.

576
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,959
I fear…

577
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,920
You will actually kill me.

578
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,231
CUT

579
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,234
CUT

580
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:39,997
I sent the only person
you think of as a family to jail.

581
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,751
I gave the police the evidence.

582
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,796
How could you forgive me,
even if I was your daughter?

583
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,549
You seem quite determined tonight.

584
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,220
You are trying to provoke me
so I won't ignore you.

585
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,681
Do you know why you got prison time?

586
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,726
I sent the documents to the Blue House.

587
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,688
You really want to die at my hands.

588
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,566
I'll be honest with you.

589
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,819
I'm afraid of you.

590
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,239
I fear…

591
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,325
You will actually kill me.

592
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,452
Yes, Team Leader Jang.

593
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,373
How long do I have to stay like this?

594
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,542
Just wait a little while.

595
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,587
I found out that they put
a foreign travel ban on me.

596
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,423
At least lift that ban for me.
I want to get some fresh air.

597
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,134
I'm getting cabin fever.

598
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,469
Fine.

599
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,889
I need time
because I have to talk to the superiors.

600
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,767
I will lift the ban somehow.

601
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,935
Sit tight.

602
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,501
CHEONG BLACK GOAT

603
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,758
Yes.

604
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,386
Yes, okay. Thank you.

605
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,680
That order is a jeongol stew.

606
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,599
And they ordered goat skin salad, too.

607
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,019
Let's go.

608
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,696
CHEONG BLACK GOAT

609
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,123
He should order jjajangmyeon
from a jjajangmyeon place.

610
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,667
Why does he order black goat stew?

611
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,587
Hey, it's a dud. Let's go.

612
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,341
Let's eat jjajangmyeon
since we're already here.

613
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:57,885
Hello?

614
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,096
Welcome.

615
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,306
Please have a seat.

616
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,561
What can I get you?

617
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,396
Please finish your meal first.

618
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,357
-We'll order later.
-Yes, thank you.

619
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,030
Why aren't they eating
the black goat they ordered?

620
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,865
I don't know. Why aren't they eating?

621
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,619
I'm back.

622
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,205
I want food, too.

623
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,624
Have your food after you come back.

624
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,377
You have a delivery.

625
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,337
CHEONG BLACK GOAT

626
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,147
These punks played a clever trick.

627
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,275
They made the delivery route
complicated to evade us.

628
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,027
I'm sure it's Gu Jae-chun.

629
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,904
Yes.

630
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,891
CHEONG BLACK GOAT

631
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,685
Thank you.

632
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,231
The delivery is here.

633
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,315
Let's eat.

634
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,783
What is this?

635
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,456
You bastards. Stay put.

636
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,297
Put down your weapons!

637
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,925
-Jae-chun.
-Yes.

638
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,013
I'm asking you nicely. Let's stop here.

639
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,683
If we don't,
I don't know how far I will go today.

640
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,851
Shit.

641
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,901
I heard everything
from Gi Dong-jae's brother, Gi Dong-su.

642
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,531
Why did you try to take
Jung Hui-ju's things Gi Dong-jae had left?

643
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,825
What good is it to you?

644
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,661
And why did you do that
to Jung Hui-ju's grandfather?

645
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,330
What does it matter to you?

646
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,917
Who told you to do it?

647
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,507
I didn't know whether Gi Dong-jae
was dead or alive somewhere.

648
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,926
I went there to catch that bastard.

649
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,471
As for that old man,
I have nothing to do with him.

650
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,181
Your cronies did it.

651
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,058
Maybe someone else ordered them.

652
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,227
They don't do just my jobs.

653
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,688
They have side projects.
And as you told me,

654
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,316
why would I do something
that I will get nothing out of?

655
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,276
You don't know
whether Gi Dong-jae is dead or alive?

656
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,361
Yes.

657
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,281
Take a look.

658
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,991
If you read this,

659
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,870
you'll find out what happened
to Gi Dong-jae.

660
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,877
CASE OF MISSING SUSPECT GI DONG-JAE

661
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,171
REPORTING OFFICER JANG GI-JIN
SEOUL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION

662
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,298
Jang Gi-jin gave this to us.

663
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,509
He said to arrest you
for the murder of Gi Dong-jae.

664
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,805
Jang Gi-jin is using you as a shield.

665
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,975
It's fine if you want to keep quiet.

666
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,810
We're embarrassed

667
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,980
about having a despicable piece
of trash as a colleague.

668
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,446
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

669
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,536
Let's draw up a report charging
Gu Jae-chun for Gi Dong-jae's murder.

670
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,621
What about Jang Gi-jin?

671
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,000
He's a cop and the team leader
of Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

672
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,295
We can't arrest him
with Gu Jae-chun's testimony alone.

673
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,881
We have a witness. Eun-hye.

674
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
Eun-hye.

675
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,680
Yes, what is it?

676
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,265
What?

677
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,851
She was taken?

678
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,103
By which bastard?

679
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,440
Are you afraid?

680
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,566
No.

681
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,986
You must have come
to places like this a lot.

682
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,156
You were taken as an accomplice
in a burglary not long ago.

683
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,824
Oh Ji-hyeok helped you get out.

684
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:34,328
You are the police. Why did you do it?

685
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,413
-Do you know me?
-I told you I saw you.

686
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,332
-From where?
-From Mr. Jung's shop.

687
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,958
Did you?

688
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,712
I did go to retrieve
an important piece of evidence.

689
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,965
That was you that night!

690
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,259
But why were you there?

691
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,470
Were you there
to retrieve that evidence, too?

692
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:57,100
Did you hide the evidence there
at the direction of Kang Do-chang?

693
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,144
What?

694
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,563
That was important evidence
for the murder investigation.

695
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,899
If what you're saying is true,

696
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:08,111
it means Detective Kang Do-chang
concealed evidence through you.

697
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,865
-I never said that.
-Don't be afraid.

698
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:15,827
I only brought you as a witness.

699
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,122
But why were you attacking me
so desperately that night?

700
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,959
Did Kang Do-chang tell you by any chance?

701
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,420
That you had to guard the evidence
no matter what?

702
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,422
What are you talking about?

703
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,591
You hit me first.

704
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,094
You tied me up and covered my eyes
so I couldn't see you.

705
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,470
I'm a detective.

706
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,431
I subdued someone who was
obstructing justice.

707
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,226
But I didn't handcuff you
because you were too young.

708
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,604
And I felt sorry for your sad life.

709
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,692
You should thank me.

710
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,572
Good job.

711
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,242
Everything will be fine.

712
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,369
Don't worry.

713
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,164
You asshole!

714
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,207
You!

715
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,918
-Do-chang!
-Hey!

716
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,253
Don't get worked up.

717
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,547
I just brought her as a witness.

718
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,341
-She's not here for a crime.
-What?

719
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,928
Which case is she a witness for?

720
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,807
I told her everything
so she will tell you when you go back.

721
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,892
Goodbye. You did well.

722
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,477
Are you okay?

723
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,479
-Did nothing happen?
-Yes.

724
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,023
Detective Kang Do-chang is
an incredible man.

725
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,651
He's raising the daughter
of a man he put to death.

726
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,362
He's so kind-hearted.

727
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,533
He should have become a director
of an orphanage, not a detective.

728
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,076
What a silly man.

729
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,882
Why isn't this punk answering?

730
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,300
How could he?

731
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,177
It's Gu Jae-chun's burner phone.

732
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,389
If he answers, it will be obvious
that he is colluding with Gu Jae-chun.

733
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,600
-He won't answer it. Just hang up.
-Yes.

734
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,185
Hey bastard!

735
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,770
Look at me, asshole.

736
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,042
Is that what Jang Gi-jin said?
That you obstructed justice?

737
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,338
That bastard.

738
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,257
He's trying to beat us to the punch.

739
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,761
He's also claiming that you are hiding
Jung Hui-ju's clothing.

740
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,554
If there is a problem later,

741
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,974
he's trying to frame you
for concealment of evidence.

742
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,812
Eun-hye,

743
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,816
I don't want to involve you
in this case anymore, so--

744
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,400
I saw him.

745
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,152
I'll testify that he's the culprit.

746
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,113
I'm saying that because I'm worried
you might get hurt.

747
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,408
I don't want you to suffer unfairly
because you got caught up in something.

748
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,661
Are you going to say
that Mr. Jung won't come back

749
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,079
just because I'm stepping up?

750
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,330
Eun-hye.

751
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,791
Then I will get
another burning hole in my heart.

752
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,336
I can't. I'm already so burdened.

753
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,506
I can't even breathe
because my heart weighs so heavily.

754
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,596
Yes.

755
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,266
I tracked the call radius
of Gu Jae-chun's burner phone.

756
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,892
It was mostly within Seoul.

757
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,728
There were a few base stations near
Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

758
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,524
And among the most recent call locations,

759
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,777
there is a building near here
that catches my attention.

760
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,824
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

761
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,715
There's only one reason
for a detective to go to the NFS.

762
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,427
It's to bring Jung Hui-ju's clothes
found at Mr. Jung's shop.

763
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:05,015
Didn't he steal that to hide it
at the order of Cheon Na-na?

764
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,809
He probably wanted to know
why Gi Dong-jae hid that.

765
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,396
Because it will have
a trace of the real killer.

766
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,654
Wasn't Jang Gi-jin of the Seoul
Criminal Investigation Division here?

767
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,908
What did he leave here?

768
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,827
It was something he asked personally.

769
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,831
It was the clothes and shoes
of a murder victim. Right?

770
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,459
Yes.

771
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,880
The victim was Jung Hui-ju.

772
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,591
That case is being handled
by Incheon Seobu Police Station.

773
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,176
This is not a personal request.

774
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,847
We are conducting official business
necessary for the investigation.

775
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,518
These are the items
she was wearing at the time of death.

776
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,270
We are conducting a DNA search.

777
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,856
I found traces of blood in many places.

778
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,692
I was able to confirm
that the blood wasn't from one person.

779
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,946
So there's the blood
of someone other than the victim?

780
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,322
Yes.

781
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,032
Did you identify the person?

782
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,159
That will take some time.

783
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,411
We will have the result within this week.

784
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,957
The result doesn't necessarily
identify the person, though.

785
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,961
We have DNA from Gi Dong-jae and others
that Team Leader Jang sent over.

786
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,214
We will be able to identify a person
by comparing the data.

787
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,634
Please call us when you have the result.

788
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,636
Yes, I will.

789
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,682
If Gi Dong-jae's blood is found there,

790
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,934
we will be able to move on
without a problem.

791
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,353
But if it's an unexpected person's blood…

792
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,105
Then we go back to the beginning.

793
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,734
Gosh. Why is this case neverending?

794
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,736
It's like we're walking in place.

795
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,782
-Hello?
-I only have one thing

796
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,743
I can tell you guys in this situation.

797
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,578
-Young police officer,
-Young police officer,

798
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,123
-the country has faith in you.
-the country has faith in you.

799
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,250
-That's exactly right.
-Okay.

800
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,169
Kang Do-chang.

801
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,797
The public affairs team called.

802
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,718
TJ is inviting you and Oh Ji-hyeok
to their charity event.

803
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,680
We're their enemy. Why would they?

804
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,974
-I see their intention.
-What is their intention?

805
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,309
They will invite them and…

806
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,650
As the chief says,
"Ten billion won per head."

807
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,407
I see your father is the chief
of Incheon Seobu Police Station.

808
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,035
-Am I right?
-Yes.

809
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,453
I see.

810
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,456
Then you must know the detectives well.

811
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:42,005
It's nothing,
but we're preparing a lawsuit.

812
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,049
It was put on hold because of the trial.

813
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,510
Illegal investigation
and defamation of character.

814
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:51,473
We're filing a complaint
against each detective.

815
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,434
They underestimated a conglomerate.

816
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,977
They'll have to pay for that.

817
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,230
I want you to take charge of it.

818
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,275
Why should I…

819
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,656
I think the previous legal team director
hired you for a specific purpose.

820
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,242
I thought you didn't do a good job.

821
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,537
I think you actually leaked
unfavorable information about the company.

822
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,540
This is a chance to make up for that.

823
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,670
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

824
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:26,674
I was looking for the right time
to give this to you.

825
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,218
You gave me the occasion.

826
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,264
If you leave like this,
there may be grudges.

827
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,642
I wasn't with this team for a long time.

828
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,646
So I can't bring down
this horrible company.

829
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,900
But I do have enough information
to ruin a team leader-level officer.

830
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,654
Let's see whose grudge is the worst.

831
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,032
There is something I learned here.

832
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,494
You have to play even dirtier
against someone who plays dirty.

833
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,206
That's how they know how rotten they are.

834
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,299
It's coming right up.

835
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,555
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

836
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,349
-Please tell me if you need anything.
-Yes.

837
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,269
They're doing great.

838
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,146
The business is really good.

839
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,481
Yes, it's doing better than expected.

840
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,734
The food is delicious
and Eun-hui is working hard.

841
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,324
I'm asking because I don't know,

842
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,368
but when you fry the chicken,

843
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,163
do they cut up the raw chicken
themselves before frying?

844
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:42,208
Or are they frying the chicken
that comes already prepared?

845
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,420
I don't know that much about…

846
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,297
Why don't you ask Eun-hui later?

847
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,883
Yeah.

848
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,595
I should come back
when she's not busy and ask her again.

849
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:57,724
Why? Are you thinking of opening
a fried chicken restaurant?

850
00:57:58,933 --> 00:57:59,976
I'm thinking about it.

851
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:04,856
But I don't think
I can handle raw chicken.

852
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,651
When I was little, I went over to
my grandmother's house.

853
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:13,364
I developed trauma after I saw
my grandmother twist a chicken's neck.

854
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,910
-So I can't have chicken to this day.
-What?

855
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,039
Come to think of it,
chicken is a bad idea.

856
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,167
But Chief, aren't you curious?

857
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,128
-About what?
-About Jang Gi-jin.

858
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,214
He requested analysis to the NFS.

859
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,507
-And…
-Pork.

860
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,300
Pork will be okay.

861
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:36,346
Pigs feet and pork belly.
No need to slaughter a pig for that.

862
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,722
Chief,

863
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,725
if this goes wrong,
we may have to release Cheon Sang-woo--

864
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,937
Hey, my ears are ringing all of a sudden.

865
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,605
I can't hear.

866
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,899
-I can't hear anything.
-Chief.

867
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,817
I can't hear.

868
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:56,324
I heard beef was
more profitable than pork.

869
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,575
Is beef better?

870
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,465
Hey.

871
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,344
What are you doing out here?

872
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,304
Just sitting here.

873
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,475
Dad.

874
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:06,978
Bo-gyeong…

875
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,817
Let's not say anything today.

876
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,072
There is no reason to double our misery.

877
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,078
Yes.

878
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,554
So, TJ people are going to sue us?

879
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,266
-Why?
-Because you messed with them.

880
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,353
They will pay you back
as much as you hurt them.

881
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,356
You should prepare. They are vicious.

882
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,983
There's nothing to fear.

883
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:58,946
A detective's job is
to deal with vicious people.

884
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,991
If you're sued,
they could take everything you own.

885
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,952
I have nothing
so they can't take anything.

886
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,998
You might not get promoted.

887
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,335
Detectives don't care about promotions.

888
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,128
Experience is more important.

889
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,422
Your family may suffer.

890
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:20,468
I only have
a jobless brother for a family.

891
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,471
There is only one way to make him suffer.

892
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,891
Stealing all of his items
in the game he's playing.

893
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,476
Then he loses it.

894
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,522
Well then…
I guess I was worried for nothing.

895
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,690
Thanks.

896
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,982
I'll go.

897
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,484
Okay.

898
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,031
If you haven't eaten, maybe we could…

899
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,826
There's a place that sells
great sundae soup. My treat.

900
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,329
No, thank you. You have nothing,
you don't want to get promoted,

901
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,998
and have a bum brother to take care of.

902
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,542
I shouldn't impose.

903
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,753
I would soon skin a flea of its hide
than have you buy me lunch.

904
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,548
-Wait.
-Goodbye.

905
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,591
Was I too honest?

906
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,637
-Is she disappointed in me?
-What do you expect?

907
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,515
You listed everything a woman hates.

908
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,435
I chipped away
at everything I'd built up so far.

909
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,478
What have you built up?

910
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,399
You haven't built anything.

911
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,236
Maybe I should have offered
bone hangover soup.

912
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:32,123
FUNDRAISING EVENT
FOR JUNG HUI-JU SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION

913
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,964
Thank you for coming to the launch
of the Jung Hui-ju Scholarship Foundation.

914
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,300
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the invitation.

915
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,719
I hope you have a good time.

916
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,389
What is the purpose of this?

917
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,684
Is she taking moral responsibility
for Jung Hui-ju's death?

918
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,103
I think so.

919
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,813
Yes, it is.

920
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,898
One moment.

921
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,816
Please excuse me.

922
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,739
-Welcome.
-Yes, hello.

923
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,407
Thanks for inviting us.

924
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:10,036
I don't think this place suits us.
Why did you--

925
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,040
You should be here. You are the ones
who solved Jung Hui-ju's murder.

926
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,959
This is also an event
to express my gratitude.

927
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,253
Your gratitude? To us?

928
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,673
Of course I'm grateful. You even saved me.

929
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,093
That night, when my brother
tried to kill me.

930
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,889
I did what I should be doing
as a detective.

931
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,850
That's why I like you.

932
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,435
You have no ulterior motive.

933
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,064
As you said, do only what a detective
should be doing.

934
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,607
That's all I want.

935
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,668
CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

936
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,044
You will be back soon.

937
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,846
What is it?

938
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,649
To be honest, this situation was caused

939
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:25,236
by unfortunate events that my family
is currently going through.

940
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,253
I must admit, yes.

941
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,716
But I must add that all of these
events started with me,

942
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,218
and I agreed to do this interview

943
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,178
because I wanted the chance
to talk about it.

944
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,184
Yes.

945
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:03,107
Former Chairman Cheon Seong-dae
being put on trial for corruption

946
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,736
was actually because I blew the whistle.

947
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:10,448
And for Chairman Cheon Sang-woo's crime,

948
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,452
I was the one that handed over
a key piece of evidence to the police.

949
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,959
TJ's crisis started a long time ago.

950
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,377
We were just hiding it.

951
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,881
I decided that exposing those exact faults
and coming clean

952
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,216
is the only way TJ can start afresh.

953
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,556
Yes.

954
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,727
But they are mistaken about something.

955
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,395
They think…

956
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:46,776
I'm avenging my mother who killed herself.

957
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,653
That is the saddest thing about it.

958
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,785
To all TJ staff members
who have worked tirelessly,

959
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,871
and to the investors who believe in TJ,

960
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,207
I bow my head to apologize.

961
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,170
TJ will rise again.

962
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:11,342
I want to make a promise. I vow to learn
from missteps and move forward

963
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:15,846
to resurrect TJ as the type of company
you will be proud to be a part of.

964
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,598
I saw the broadcast.

965
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,310
It seems you made a bad move.
The stock price is taking a dip.

966
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,646
If you saw the broadcast, you should know.

967
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,399
I was the whistleblower
who sent the documents to the Blue House.

968
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,444
I thought there was a possibility.

969
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,781
But my doubt was greater.

970
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,785
I sent the documents
that Director Woo Tae-ho kept.

971
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:42,123
That was only a small branch.
The trunk is somewhere else.

972
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,708
It will be far more destructive.

973
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,835
Why…

974
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,045
You already have an agreement
with the Honorary Chairman, right?

975
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:51,007
Michael Cha will be the next CEO.

976
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,177
He is like a doctor for TJ.

977
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,138
He can save a dying company.

978
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:02,977
But no doctor can save someone
that is already dead.

979
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,898
Director Cheon, we are ready.

980
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,234
Okay. Let me fix my makeup.

981
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,941
The late Jung Hui-ju was
a promising employee.

982
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,486
She was dutiful to the end

983
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,530
and gave her best in everything she did.

984
01:07:57,114 --> 01:08:00,951
It was tragic and hard to believe,

985
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:06,165
but because of our chairman's momentary
lapse in judgment, she perished.

986
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,586
And her grandfather,
who was her sole guardian,

987
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,922
now lies in a hospital bed.

988
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,223
We…

989
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,769
remember Jung Hui-ju's bright smile.

990
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,314
-What's wrong with her?
-We are here today…

991
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:33,609
for Jung hui-ju, whose life was
unfairly taken away…

992
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,236
-and her grandfather…
-What's going on?

993
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,695
She looks ill.

994
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,073
… to begin meaningful work…

995
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,075
This is Oh Ji-hyeok with
the Incheon Seobu Police Station.

996
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,702
I have the results of the blood analysis
on Jung Hui-ju's clothing.

997
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,412
The DNA comparison is also completed.

998
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,164
Thank you.

999
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,795
They found out whose blood
was on Jung Hui-ju's clothing.

1000
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,088
Whose is it?

1001
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,507
Cheon Na-na's.

1002
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,387
Creating the Jung Hui-ju
Scholarship Foundation

1003
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,514
is to ask for her forgiveness…

1004
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,231
Cheon Na-na is on her way.

1005
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,483
You are misunderstanding me. I apologize.

1006
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,986
She beat us to the punch.

1007
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,697
Your teammates are about to lose
their jobs. What are you going to do?

1008
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,283
I think Jang Gi-jin did
a good job framing us this time.

1009
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,993
How will we turn this around?

1010
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:07,578
We need support.

1011
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,580
Chairman, I have something to tell you.

1012
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,374
I'll show you a world
where my thoughts become reality.

1013
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,418
Please help me.

1014
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,711
I've bet my whole life on this.

1015
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:19,006
That vile bastard started this fight.

1016
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:22,051
We need to win this fight.
We can only get Cheon Na-na that way.

1017
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,725
