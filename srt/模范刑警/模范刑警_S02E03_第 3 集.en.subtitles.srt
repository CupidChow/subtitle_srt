THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,363
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,494
SEONGWOL-DONG

4
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,538
Do you remember

5
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,833
this student who got off
around eight o'clock?

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,087
This is in Seongwol-dong, right?

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,255
That's correct.

8
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,340
Yes, I remember her.

9
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,843
Not many people get on and off there.

10
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,929
I remember her getting off alone
from time to time.

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,973
Did you happen to see

12
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,351
someone carrying this bag get off there?

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,438
You can't expect me to remember
a passenger's bag too.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,399
Was there a man who got off alone there

15
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,276
before this girl did?

16
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,112
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,450
The security camera footage from the bus
would be more accurate than my memory.

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,918
Frankly, we have no proof that the man
with the bag is the culprit.

19
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,380
He could have been filmed coincidentally
while relieving himself.

20
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,132
Or he was drunk and throwing up,

21
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,760
and it was caught on camera.

22
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,263
Yes, I guess so.

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,181
What? Hey.

24
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,602
You didn't think of that before
insisting he's the culprit?

25
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,980
I never insisted on anything.

26
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,024
That insolent little punk.

27
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,574
Can you sniff the killer out?

28
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,537
The culprit was

29
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,000
waiting for the victim
where he could see the bus stop.

30
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,796
Then he saw the headlight flashing
and hid behind the wall.

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,675
If he moved to the side to avoid the car,

32
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,426
he would have been facing it,

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,220
not turning his back to it.

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,599
-What is this?
-Something must have happened.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,811
-It's impossible to recognize.
-Look over here.

36
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,563
It's too dark.

37
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,439
-I can barely see.
-What does it say?

38
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,275
Violent Crimes Team 2?

39
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,985
PLEASE CALL IF YOU'VE SEEN
SOMEONE WITH THIS BAG!

40
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,280
-How can we remember a bag?
-We see hundreds of them.

41
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,031
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2
LIEUTENANT OH JI-HYEOK

42
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,993
-What's this about?
-They're looking for a man.

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,163
You were at the scene yesterday
with the detectives, right?

44
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,247
I was.

45
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:48,209
The detectives tell me
that you asked to go there first.

46
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,086
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

47
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,463
What was your reason?

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,674
My granddaughter died there.

49
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,178
I wanted to go and comfort her soul.

50
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,392
But why that day of all days?
It seems a little belated.

51
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,852
Why all of a sudden?

52
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,901
Was my granddaughter also lying there

53
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,485
exactly like the woman I found?

54
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,157
Hui-ju called me to go see her.

55
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,951
She wanted me to see with my own eyes

56
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,786
how she died.

57
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,208
Sir. I think you're mistaken.

58
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,212
We suspect the culprit
of this case is a different one

59
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,923
from your granddaughter's case.

60
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:40,136
Do you have proof to back that up?

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,805
The culprit of this case
will be caught in no time.

62
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,766
-That will be my proof.
-Right.

63
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,562
Please contact me once you catch

64
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,356
the culprit of this case.

65
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,692
I have many things I want to ask him.

66
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,528
Okay. You should head home now.

67
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,614
-Thanks for your time.
-Sure.

68
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,743
-Detective Park. Take him home.
-Yes, sir?

69
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,953
-Okay, sir.
-It's fine.

70
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,873
I'm still capable of
taking care of myself.

71
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,458
I can go home on my own.

72
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,802
Captain. I just got an email from NFS.

73
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,345
What did they say?

74
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,721
The thing is…

75
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,848
What did they say, you punk?

76
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,145
The MO is almost a perfect match
to the previous cases.

77
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,481
They already concluded it's the same guy.

78
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,941
What a load of bullshit.

79
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,112
Call and tell them to conduct
the investigation themselves

80
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,989
if they're going to dictate our course.

81
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,076
All they do is cut up corpses.
What the hell do they know?

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,828
PLEASE CALL IF YOU'VE SEEN
SOMEONE WITH THIS BAG!

83
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,121
What is this?

84
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,916
We checked the footage,

85
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,210
and this wasn't taken on the bus.

86
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,587
Where did you get this?

87
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,215
Why would you post your name card there?

88
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,092
You're confusing these men

89
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,679
who were following
a very clear path they paved.

90
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,433
You found something at the scene,
didn't you?

91
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,644
You went off from that
and got this, right?

92
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,147
You think your division has all the power?

93
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,607
Aren't you here to get intel from us?

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,402
You think that coercive tone is
appropriate?

95
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,530
Look. We're not here to fool around.

96
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,116
We're officially requesting cooperation.

97
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,659
So file an official document.

98
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,994
Or figure it out yourselves.

99
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,164
So you're refusing to cooperate?

100
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,708
Don't you think that might cause problems?

101
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,794
We'll lay out some conditions then.

102
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,381
Disclose all the records
from the serial murder cases.

103
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,967
Then we'll tell you where this was taken.

104
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,930
Are you that desperate
to catch the culprit?

105
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,848
Is that it?

106
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,974
I'll be honest.

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,479
A murder happened
right in front of my eyes.

108
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,565
I must catch him with my own hands.

109
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,235
I'll be humiliated
for the rest of my life if I don't.

110
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,696
That's my one and only reason.

111
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,366
But showing our case records
to an outsider…

112
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,369
It's difficult as of now.

113
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,998
We don't need your lousy case records.

114
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,751
Just don't get in the way

115
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,420
of our investigation.

116
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,176
My goodness, you never disappoint.

117
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,637
What would I have done without you?

118
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,724
How much for the repairs?

119
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,311
You bought from me out of trust,
so I have to return that favor.

120
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,355
The repair is on the house.

121
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,942
Gosh, you always say that. Thank you.

122
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,277
I appreciate it.

123
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,987
Goodbye.

124
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,406
You won't retire anytime soon, right?

125
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,370
-No, I won't. Goodbye.
-Okay.

126
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,373
-I'll be back.
-All right.

127
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,096
I get this was a difficult find,
but do you think it's him?

128
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,765
The time he was filmed is
questionable too.

129
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,393
And we don't have enough to say
that this is the culprit's bag.

130
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
What did the guys at Seobu Station say?

131
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,646
They insist it's the culprits.

132
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,690
-They're sure.
-They're right.

133
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,774
It's his.

134
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,361
Focus on this for now.
But we'll narrow our scope.

135
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,072
Only investigate acquaintances
of Park Seon-mi, okay?

136
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,532
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,960
Excluding Park Seon-mi's case,
I retraced all the other victims' routes

138
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,297
by searching surveillance cameras
and found 180 hours of footage.

139
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,633
Out of that, 98 hours were filmed

140
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,886
on the day of the crimes
and around the bodies.

141
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,887
That's a total

142
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,723
of 278 hours.

143
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,227
Say we watch it for 24 hours a day.
How many days is that?

144
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,982
-It's over ten days.
-Don't calculate it like that.

145
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,903
We have one, two, three, four, five of us.
Six including Dong-uk.

146
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,405
Divide 278 hours by 6.

147
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,823
It's 46 hours and 20 minutes.

148
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,994
-Damn.
-That's impressive, but also annoying.

149
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,038
So it'll take less than
two days per person.

150
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,250
-Aren't we going to eat?
-Multi-task, you punk.

151
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,836
This might be a copycat crime
like the investigation division said.

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,965
Logically speaking,
it makes no sense to dump the body

153
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,759
at the scene of the murder.
Don't you think so?

154
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,344
I say we focus on Park Seon-mi.

155
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,431
Yes, I think it's a little foolish
to look at all the cases.

156
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,101
That's for those who think
Kim Hyeong-bok is the culprit.

157
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,062
We know it's not him.

158
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,608
We have to reinvestigate
from the beginning.

159
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,986
-I found it.
-Good.

160
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,446
This is it, right?

161
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,824
Yes, it's identical. Nice work.

162
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,952
Search the footage for this bag.
there will be our killer.

163
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,188
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

164
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,981
-Shoot!
-Shoot!

165
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,149
-Shoot!
-Shoot!

166
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,906
KWON JAE-HONG

167

VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 2

169
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,077
-Let's go get lunch.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,579
Captain Woo, we're going to lunch.

171
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,873
-Take it easy.
-You shouldn't skip meals.

172
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,334
You guys are working so hard.

173
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,113
All right.

174
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,948
Eat up. Fast.

175
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,993
The sashimi knife we had as evidence.
Where did it go?

176
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,453
-Who moved it?
-It wasn't me.

177
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,288
-It's not there?
-Where is it?

178
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,623
Hurry up and go find it.

179
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,001
There was no blood on it.

180
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,670
-Gosh.
-Damn it.

181
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,757
Less than a week from the death

182
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,551
of the White Gown serial killer,

183
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,512
another murder has occurred
using the same methods.

184
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,681
-The police are saying that it's…
-Those punks.

185
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,600
-…a copycat of the White Gown killings.
-Such great novelists.

186
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,603
They're mobilizing their forces
to catch the culprit.

187
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,697
Did you find out what the boys are up to?

188
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes, well…

189
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:09,288
It seems everyone has some work,
so they're all at the office.

190
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,831
But they're on vacation.

191
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,209
Don't tell me they're…

192
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,254
I'll persuade them somehow
to get back to their vacations.

193
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,049
No, there's no need for that.

194
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,383
Let them be.

195
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,885
But still,

196
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,764
I'm just worried
they'll get you into trouble, Chief.

197
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,768
Have those guys ever listened to us?

198
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,646
Just let them do as they want.

199
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,689
Can I really do that?

200
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,026
I've given up on them. Let them run free.

201
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,611
Yes, sir.

202
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,114
By the way, I told the chief
of the crime department

203
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,201
to not assign any cases to you
even once your vacations are over.

204
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,828
-But why?
-Don't pry.

205
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,414
It's a win if you end up
catching the real culprit.

206
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,874
If not, there's no loss.

207
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,544
Right, I see.

208
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,339
Then according to your orders,

209
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,719
I'll tell the guys
to knock themselves out.

210
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,548
So you've checked
all the local male students, right?

211
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,510
Don't just stick to the neighborhood.

212
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,805
Look into workers at factories
and construction sites nearby.

213
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,348
Okay.

214
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,933
All right.

215
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,019
Captain. Take a look at this.

216
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,276
PARK SEON-MI
CLASS DINNER, DRANK ALL NIGHT

217
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,162
We weren't able
to clearly distinguish anything.

218
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,539
But we have 30 footage
with similar-looking bags.

219
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,001
Okay. It's time to do some legwork then.

220
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,586
Let's hang in there.

221
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,091
We've been strapped to our desks
for two whole days.

222
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,594
At least give us the time to relax
at the sauna for a bit.

223
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,221
Sure, do what you have to do.

224
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,932
Do what we…

225
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,143
We're not even paid for our expenses
because we're on vacation.

226
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,108
Here, pay for the sauna with this.

227
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,029
This is for your meals.
The convenience store has good options.

228
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,031
-This is it?
-Seriously?

229
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,157
There are four of us.

230
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,495
-Well…
-Give it back.

231
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,791
Hey. Give me your wallet.

232
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,542
But I don't have any cash right now.

233
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,585
Just give it.

234
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,549
-I'll take it.
-Wait.

235
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,801
Don't.

236
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,135
Give it to me.

237
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,345
Hey, Rookie.

238
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,597
I can't trust the other guys.

239
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,432
-You keep it.
-Okay.

240
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,726
-Only pay when it's necessary.
-Yes, sir.

241
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,107
I'm quite a big spender.

242
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,527
Detective Oh.
What's the limit on this card?

243
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,486
Limit?

244
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,822
That's a thing?

245
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,702
I've never heard
of credit card limits before.

246
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,291
So damn full of himself.

247
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,844
Young police officers.
The nation believes in you.

248
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,346
You can do it. Yes, you can!

249
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,431
-Yes, we can.
-Yes.

250
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm sick of that young police crap.

251
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,191
Tell him to stop with the boomer talk.

252
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,152
It gives me goosebumps.

253
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,445
Let's eat first.

254
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,281
Your back must be hurting.
You should go get some rest.

255
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,449
I'm fine.

256
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,953
My body is more fit for running around
outside than being stuck to a chair.

257
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,289
I guess desk duty is out then.

258
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,791
I don't know either.

259
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,461
If my body is comfortable, my heart isn't.

260
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,629
And vice versa.

261
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,967
Oh Ji-hyeok, Incheon Seobu Station.

262
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,720
Yes, I left my card at the office.

263
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,182
Is that so?

264
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,769
Yes, I'll head over. It won't take long.

265
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,853
Okay.

266
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,563
-What is it?
-It was a bus driver.

267
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,231
He remembers seeing the black bag.

268
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,071
What are you going to do?
Seon-mi asked Ji-young to set her up.

269
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,739
-What?
-Seriously?

270
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,158
Your time is up, Ho-jun.

271
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,327
It's for the better. Forget about her.

272
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,412
Aren't you sick of this unrequited love?

273
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,663
It's okay, dude.

274
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,958
-Don't worry, I'll find you a girl.
-Cheer up.

275
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
Are you Choi Ho-jun? Biology major?

276
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,631
Yes, that's me.

277
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,632
Please come with us.

278
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,470
What is it? Why are you doing this to me?

279
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,308
SEONGWOL-DONG

280
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,444
Hello.

281
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,703
I saw the note
when I got to work this morning.

282
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,998
My memory isn't perfect,

283
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,501
but I figured I should still tell you,
so I called.

284
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,171
Do you remember the black bag?

285
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,259
I didn't remember it right away
after seeing the picture.

286
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,596
But after I heard the girl who gets off
at Seongwol-dong died,

287
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,889
it came back to me.

288
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,142
You also drive this bus, right?

289
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,060
Yes, we work three shifts.

290
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,564
So you saw the passenger with that bag
during your shift?

291
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,232
Yes.

292
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,443
It probably wasn't easy to remember
a passenger's bag.

293
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,195
How did you recall it?

294
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,907
There was an incident at that time.

295
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,159
That's why.

296
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,203
Plus, those two were
the only passengers at the time.

297
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,539
"Those two"?

298
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,499
Yes.

299
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,503
I'm getting off. Don't follow me.

300
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,215
Hey, I came all the way here for you.
Where else can I go?

301
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,009
I'm dead meat if my mom catches us.

302
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,303
Besides, why did you follow me?

303
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,805
Who are you to drop me off?

304
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,309
I'll take you home since I'm already here.
The neighborhood looks sketchy.

305
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,895
I said no. You're just being annoying now.

306
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,646
I told you.

307
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,232
We're just friends.

308
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,692
Nothing more than that.

309
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,530
BUS STOP

310
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,166
I'm sorry, can you open the door again?

311
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,592
Seon-mi.

312
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,930
-Hold on, Seon-mi.
-Stop following me.

313
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,264
The neighborhood is secluded.

314
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,641
-Can we talk?
-Let go.

315
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,186
I watched just in case he hurt her.

316
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,488
Yes, I'm certain. It was this bag.

317
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,449
We checked the dashcam on the bus,

318
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,953
but I don't recall seeing
what you described.

319
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,915
It happened around a month ago.

320
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,667
It's probably gone from the records.

321
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,507
Does this help our case or worsen it?

322
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,092
Excuse me. Detectives?

323
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,679
I hope my statement doesn't

324
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,931
make you suspicious of the male student.

325
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,392
We'll have to look into it more.

326
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,143
I'm just worried.

327
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,437
He seemed like a nice kid.

328
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,276
I'm concerned
that I may be framing an innocent person.

329
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,530
Don't worry. We'll investigate thoroughly
to make sure that never happens.

330
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,990
I don't doubt it.

331
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,033
I'll get to work then.

332
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,163
Could you maybe come to Seoul?

333
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,292
Come as a witness whenever you have time.

334
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,919
All you have to do is
repeat what you told us.

335
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,384
If it's necessary, I guess I'll have to.

336
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,635
-Have a good one.
-Okay.

337
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,683
SEONGWOL-DONG TERMINAL

338
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,020
SEONGWOL-DONG

339
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,772
Shouldn't we find
that university friend first?

340
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,031
This phone belongs to Park Seon-mi,
who was murdered.

341
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,700
Can you explain why this was in your bag?

342
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,535
I don't know.

343
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,245
I really have no idea.

344
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,664
Hey! Who else will know better than you?

345
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,500
Are you saying
it magically appeared in your bag?

346
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,668
I really…

347
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,715
Maybe Seon-mi accidentally put it--

348
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,675
Are you kidding me?

349
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,136
The phone was turned off near her home.

350
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,929
That's where she was abducted.

351
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,556
If what you're saying is true,

352
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,517
it would mean she put it in there
before she was murdered.

353
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,563
That she did it before dying
to prove it was you.

354
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,274
No, that's not true. Why would I kill her?

355
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,777
I liked Seon-mi.

356
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,737
Why would I kill the girl I like?

357
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,199
You liked her,
but she didn't like you back.

358
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,241
So you killed her.

359
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,534
No, I didn't.

360
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,788
That's not true. It's not.

361
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,793
It wasn't me. I'm telling the truth.

362
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,754
Mount Mibong.

363
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,173
Pardon?

364
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,842
Mount Mibong.

365
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,761
-What?
-You know where it is.

366
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,846
It's where you dumped her body
after killing her!

367
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,476
I don't know.
I swear I've never heard of it.

368
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,773
Where did you hide the weapon?

369
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,900
And the rest of her belongings?

370
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,363
You didn't do this alone, did you?

371
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,781
There's an accomplice, right?

372
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:32,285
The two of you planned it to make it
look like it was the White Gown killer.

373
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,454
Right?

374
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,165
Say Something!

375
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,840
Dragging this out won't do you any good.

376
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,638
-It's him? What did he say?
-I know there's an accomplice.

377
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,807
-Did he confess?
-No, not yet.

378
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,852
Didn't you find
the victim's phone in his bag?

379
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,520
We did.

380
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,856
Your copycat theory.

381
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,065
-You must be right.
-Speak!

382
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,776
It's not certain yet.

383
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,237
We need to check his alibi

384
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,322
and see if he has an accomplice.

385
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,701
Let's wrap this up quickly.
The press is taking a bad turn.

386
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,412
Hey, just tell me the truth.

387
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,164
-Come on.
-Let's give it more time.

388
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,373
Okay.

389
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,125
This bag.

390
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,962
It's Ho-jun's, right?

391
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,839
-Yes.
-Ho-jun?

392
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,717
Yes, Choi Ho-jun. We're in the same major.

393
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,219
He must have been friends
with Park Seon-mi too.

394
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,554
Right.

395
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,140
Where is he now? Can you call him?

396
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,933
He was taken by cops earlier.

397
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,024
It must be
the Criminal Investigation Division.

398
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:44,983
Shall I confirm?

399
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,986
Let's leave Choi Ho-jun to them for now.

400
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,197
We just need to
stick to our investigation.

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,753
Damn it.

402
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,508
Stop the bus, sir.

403
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,345
I'll stop at the next bus stop.

404
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,930
Seriously?

405
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,724
Just hurry up and stop the bus.

406
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,393
I pressed the bell.

407
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,104
Why are you still driving?

408
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,440
This isn't the stop. I can't do that.

409
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,443
But I pressed the bell just now.

410
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,028
It was after I passed the stop.

411
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,863
No, you saw it late.

412
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,490
Hurry up and stop.

413
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,410
Hold on, we're almost at the next stop.

414
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,748
This place is so far from my home!

415
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,960
Stop the bus now, damn it!

416
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,381
What?

417
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,926
What are you glaring at me for?

418
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,305
My gosh, I'm so terrified of you.

419
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,349
How scary.

420
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,269
Stop it.

421
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,606
Stop the bus now before I cuss you out.

422
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,652
Are you deaf?

423
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,571
Stop the car now!

424
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,534
Sir, just let her get off.

425
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,035
This is dangerous.

426
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,007
Get off.

427
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,344
I'm not getting off.

428
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,730
Get off!

429
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,815
You should have dropped me off earlier.

430
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,275
Turn it around.

431
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,113
Drop me off where I asked you to stop.

432
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,948
Or else I will never get off.

433
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:29,564
BUS STOP

434
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,076
Thank you, sir.

435
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,079
What?

436
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,208
Do you want to sleep with me too?

437
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,879
Don't kid yourself.

438
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,256
Just keep living this way.

439
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,926
Crawling on the floor all your life.

440
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,561
Gosh, what a nasty person.

441
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,064
Let it go.

442
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,743
I'm heading out now.

443
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,495
Hey, take this.

444
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,039
I packed some food we had at home.

445
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,624
I hope you understand.

446
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,961
I barely slept thanks to
the obnoxious bunch that barged in.

447
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,424
I could have just bought something
from the convenience store.

448
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,967
Thank you.

449
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,511
Eun-hye. I overslept.

450
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,847
Let me quickly brush my teeth,
so wait for me.

451
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,765
No, it's okay. I can go by myself.

452
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,059
There's time until the exam.
I'll take the bus.

453
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,770
Why would you take the bus?
I can drop you off.

454
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,274
Just let me go by myself.
It's more comfortable.

455
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,484
Let her do that.

456
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,403
Your presence will only pressure her.

457
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,613
-Will you really be okay?
-Yes.

458
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,366
Remember what I said last time.

459
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,619
Don't try to do well,
just trust your ability.

460
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,080
All you have to do is
pass the cutoff point.

461
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,290
So relax.

462
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,250
Stop, that's enough.

463
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,004
She wants to go alone
because of all your nagging.

464
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,839
Why won't you let me say anything?

465
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,466
Gosh, don't worry.

466
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,176
I'll do well. I feel confident.

467
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,428
All right.

468
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,681
Eun-hye. Thank you.

469
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,484
Lee Eun-hye.

470
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,489
You're Lee Eun-hye, right?

471
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,699
Yes, that's me.

472
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,618
-Darn it!
-Get up!

473
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,120
-Damn it!
-Darn.

474
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,457
Your friend told us everything.

475
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,378
Officer. Please let me go.

476
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,005
I'm taking my GED today.

477
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,301
I'll come back after the test.
I promise. Please believe me.

478
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,345
You frequented the police station
in the past.

479
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,305
-That's…
-This is your trick, right?

480
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,475
Carrying books around for show,
pretending you're a studious kid.

481
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,438
-Yu-na, you…
-This is the girl.

482
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,607
We went in together to steal
when I got caught

483
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,025
and she ran away.

484
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,821
Drop the good girl act.
It won't work here.

485
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,037
She'll be here at ten o'clock sharp,
so don't take reservations.

486
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,205
Yes ma'am.

487
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,083
Just leave the afternoon open.

488
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,085
We'll only take that one customer today.

489
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,796
She doesn't like
having other customers around.

490
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,548
Okay, I'll do that.

491
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,550
Hello.

492
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,219
I'm sorry, we're all booked today.

493
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,221
It's been a while.

494
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,182
When did you get back from the States?

495
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,184
Who are you?

496
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,269
You don't remember?

497
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,146
From two years ago.

498
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,361
I'm sorry, I have no memory of you.

499
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,030
You have the wrong person.

500
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,617
I'm a detective.

501
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,999
You don't remember?

502
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,378
You filthy bitch! Die!

503
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,465
Did you happen to see the culprit's face?

504
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,219
Follow me.

505
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,021
Weren't you in a different business
back then?

506
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,607
I was originally a hairdresser.

507
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,649
That job…

508
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,486
It was a temporary part-time job.

509
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,280
Would that be all?

510
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,699
I guess the job paid well.

511
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:54,245
A shop this size in Gangnam
must have cost a lot.

512
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,707
I received an investment.

513
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,044
I'm the director, but not the owner.

514
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,339
The investigation came to a halt
because you left.

515
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,840
No, it's over.

516
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,008
Don't you feel wronged?

517
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,677
Please.

518
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,680
I forgot everything.

519
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,767
I don't want to remember it.

520
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,562
It's a criminal case.

521
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,690
I must continue investigating
even against the victim's will.

522
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,321
You went to that club
after receiving a call from

523
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,531
TJ's secretary's office, right?

524
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,534
Vice-chairman Cheon Sang-woo was there.

525
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,081
Director. She's here.

526
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,083
Yes, okay.

527
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,671
Please.

528
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,464
No more.

529
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,313
Oh Ji-hyeok, Incheon Seobu Station.

530
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,774
Yes.

531
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,319
Yes, I know Eun-hye.

532
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,113
How's my hair?

533
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,241
-It seems good.
-I'll see you again.

534
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,168
He was at the club with me.

535
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,517
He's handsome.

536
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,602
Yes, he is.

537
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,563
That face is hard to forget.

538
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,489
Eun-hye.

539
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,953
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,289
No, you did well.

541
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,461
You did well,
giving my number to the detective.

542
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,262
You thought they would let Eun-hye out

543
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,140
because she's close to cops, right?

544
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,143
And that they'll release you
along with her?

545
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,191
I just told the truth as it is.

546
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,568
Eun-hye is close to us.

547
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,070
She's family.

548
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:37,116
Meaning that you just dragged
a detective's family member in.

549
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,120
Detectives have no power.

550
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,789
We can't let guilty people go.

551
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,915
But…

552
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,711
you're dead if you mess with our families.

553
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,757
You just made a mistake.

554
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:59,722
She named her an accomplice. We can't…

555
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,767
You know Detective Kang Do-chang
from Incheon Seobu Station?

556
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,311
Yes, I know him well.

557
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,312
That's his daughter.

558
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,773
He isn't married though.

559
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,901
He has no daughter.
Her last name is different too.

560
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,861
He sees her as one.

561
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,322
Her address is the same as Do-chang's.

562
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,908
Let me check with him.

563
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,576
I wouldn't if I were you.

564
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,496
You know his temper.

565
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,332
He'll run right over and make a mess.

566
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,132
But what if something happens later?

567
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,136
Oh Ji Hyeok, Incheon Seobu Station,
Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

568
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,263
If it turns out Lee Eun-hye
is an accomplice,

569
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,889
I will arrest her myself.

570
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,183
If she runs away,

571
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,602
I, Oh Ji-hyeok, will
take full responsibility.

572
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,730
I'll send the recording to you.

573
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,815
What's your number?

574
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,693
It's 8867…

575
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,993
Why don't you ask me?

576
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,704
I might really be her accomplice.

577
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,544
It's not that I trust you. I trust myself.

578
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,672
I trust my gut as a detective.

579
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,135
You've dealt with
a lot of bad guys, right?

580
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,847
I've always been a bad person.

581
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,140
A really vile one.

582
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,060
Will I change?

583
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,938
I want to change.

584
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,857
But I don't think I will.

585
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,361
My past will stop me from it.

586
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,032
Don't get all moody with me.

587
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,826
Just because you went through
some hard times,

588
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,829
you shouldn't be so quick to conclude.

589
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,832
It wasn't you who made your past.

590
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,883
It's not the bag we're looking for,
but he seemed sketchy.

591
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,677
We checked just in case
and look what we found.

592
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,305
We have a sixth sense
for sniffing out bad guys.

593
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,515
You boys should go on more vacations.

594
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,185
You only seem to catch criminals
on your vacation.

595
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,523
Captain. We ran his name, and it turns out
he has a history of drug use.

596
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,901
I think he'll lead us to the others
if we keep digging.

597
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,611
I say we should keep digging.

598
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,821
-Shall we?
-I'll start digging then.

599
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,075
Are you making any headway or not?

600
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,411
Who's he? The culprit?

601
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,748
He's a different culprit

602
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,793
from the one you're looking for, Chief.

603
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,424
But Chief, our guys went through
the effort to catch him.

604
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,343
He's small fry.

605
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,345
He could lead us to big fish though.

606
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,431
-Who are you guys?
-Pardon?

607
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,310
We're Incheon Seobu Station's
Violent Crimes Unit Team 2.

608
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,270
That's right.

609
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,316
Do you think that small fry is

610
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,026
up to par with Team 2's level?

611
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,612
Right, I understand.

612
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,658
Send him to Narcotics.

613
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,619
-Why?
-Send him? Over my dead body!

614
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,163
He says he doesn't match our level!

615
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,248
But that bastard…

616
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,583
Damn it.

617
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,922
Gosh, to what pleasure does this dad
owe my princess for this call?

618
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,384
What?

619
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,512
Why would you suddenly quit your job?

620
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,682
Hey.

621
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,478
There is no such thing as a fitting job.
You have to fit yourself into it.

622
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,521
Also,

623
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,691
you worked hard
to get into a major company.

624
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,778
Hey, are you drinking?

625
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,239
Hey, Bo-gyeong.

626
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,535
Oh, for…

627
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,371
Why is she acting up again?
She was good for a while.

628
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,627
The person you have called is unavailable.

629
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,006
I get a bad feeling about this.

630
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,563
Gosh, this is good.
Are you a regular here?

631
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,652
I like the atmosphere too.
It's comfortable.

632
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,283
Your father-in-law will have to
stay put a little longer.

633
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,827
It's looking bad on our side.

634
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,749
That will greatly affect the economy.

635
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,501
It's time for a change.

636
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,046
Passing on the business
to one's child is outdated now.

637
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,048
It must change.

638
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,051
But why us?

639
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,765
Who do you think the owner of TJ is?

640
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,559
As a member of the Blue House,

641
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,146
TJ plays a big role in our economy.

642
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,608
If the owner tears it up
and bleeds it dry,

643
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,777
we'll suffer grim consequences.

644
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,278
The problem is,

645
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,241
we have no right
to stop the owner's tyranny.

646
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,159
There's only one way to do that.

647
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,748
Changing the leadership of TJ.

648
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,089
I think the owner the Blue House is
talking about is McQueen.

649
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,424
SELF-REFLECTING ATTITUDE
REFORMATION FOR THE FUTURE

650
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,051
I'm sure those guys want me in here.

651
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,138
It would be their best excuse
for acquiring TJ.

652
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,266
The Blue House and McQueen
want different things,

653
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,268
but it's clear they're both against us.

654
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,191
If McQueen wants you as an executive

655
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,819
what will you do?

656
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,779
Wouldn't you be tempted?

657
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,366
That will never happen.

658
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,328
I devoted my entire life
to building this company.

659
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,749
I'd rather you have it than someone else.

660
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,085
Sir.

661
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,921
You think it's impossible?

662
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,678
McQueen has more power than me as of now.

663
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,474
If you join them, you take over TJ.

664
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,935
What do you want me to say?

665
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,314
Am I supposed to answer that I can?

666
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,357
I'm sure

667
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:30,070
there's someone on the inside
who's thinking exactly that.

668
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,533
Find that person.

669
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,996
If you can't,

670
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,998
then it's you.

671
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,006
What should we eat?

672
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,675
You decide. I'm fine with whatever.

673
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,680
Do you remember the Thai restaurant
Khao Chai on Seventh Avenue?

674
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,892
It was our first private meetup.

675
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,647
Let's go. I know a good Thai restaurant.

676
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,816
Hang on.

677
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,903
Yes?

678
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,490
I'm sorry. I have plans.

679
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,953
I'll call you later when I can.

680
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,663
Okay.

681
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,752
Your husband has a very nice voice.

682
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,587
Is that why you fell for him?

683
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,298
Hold on. I need to make a call.

684
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,008
Go wait in the car.

685
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,893
What are you doing there?

686
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,355
I'm looking at you.

687
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,318
I'll be back at the office after dinner.

688
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,653
Wait for me there.

689
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,748
Go on in.

690
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,174
Find that person.

691
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,261
If you can't, then it's you.

692
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,397
DIRECTOR CHEON NA-NA

693
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,693
The phone is turned off…

694
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,281
Was it you, Na-na?

695
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,078
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message…

696
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,791
The phone is turned off. Please leave…

697
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,006
Chief, why are you still here so late?

698
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,219
Chief?

699
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,892
Bong-sik. I need you to track the location
on a cell phone.

700
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,608
Black bag.

701
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,404
Gosh, this will take forever.

702
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,450
Yes, sir?

703
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,621
We're right there. It won't take long but…

704
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,041
I understand. Okay.

705
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,421
Jae-hong. Captain wants us
to find Chief's daughter.

706
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,548
Are you serious?

707
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,259
That was his order.
I guess her phone is off.

708
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,637
Hey, tell him no thanks.

709
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,514
Why would he have detectives do that?

710
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,182
Are we his lackeys or something?

711
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,184
Tell me about it.

712
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,936
Don't mind him.

713
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,438
Gosh, it's pissing me off.

714
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,607
Jae-hong. Chief's daughter.

715
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,867
Where is she right now?

716
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,537
Let's hurry up and go find her.
It's dangerous these days.

717
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,290
She reminds me of a celebrity.

718
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,336
-I'm not going!
-Okay, all right.

719
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,754
-I'm not going home.
-Come on.

720
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,048
You should. Chief will be worried.

721
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,050
I'm not drunk at all today.

722
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,762
-Let me have one more drink.
-Do you want to sit down for a bit?

723
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,888
Let's go for another round.

724
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,223
-Round three?
-Sure.

725
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,143
-Okay, let's go!
-One, two, three.

726
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,978
All right, let's go drink some more.

727
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,772
-I'm super upset today.
-Hey.

728
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,567
-Just one more drink.
-Have him meet us at Do-chang's place.

729
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,110
-Okay.
-One more drink, please.

730
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,155
-We're going to grab a drink.
-Yes, sir. We did find her.

731
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,324
But she's in no state to be transferred.

732
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,201
I think Chief has to come get her himself.

733
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,040
Thank you.

734
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,927
-Is she your girlfriend?
-I wish.

735
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,305
-She's Chief's daughter.
-Oh, my goodness.

736
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,058
She must have taken after her mom.

737
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,938
-Hello, Chief.
-Yes, hi. Did you maybe…

738
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,234
Hey, Bo-gyeong!

739
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,527
Dad?

740
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,613
Why did you do that?

741
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,073
I was worried sick.

742
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,202
Who is it? Who's making your life so hard?

743
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,996
What do I do, dad?

744
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,457
Dad, you know how I

745
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,502
worked my butt off
to get into that company, right?

746
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,920
Yes, of course.

747
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,714
I regret it so much!

748
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,093
Why should I let people
trample over me like that?

749
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,638
What gives them the right?

750
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,142
Doesn't everyone make mistakes at first?

751
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,895
Is it such a big deal
to leave out a few digits?

752
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:01,026
They said the company will
go out of business because of me.

753
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,611
-Okay, Don't cry.
-That's what he said.

754
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,697
-Out of business because of me.
-Hey, don't cry.

755
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,702
If it's a company that'll go
out of business from a tiny mistake,

756
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,828
don't go there anymore.

757
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,664
It's not worth it.

758
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,874
Just quit. It's okay. Don't cry.

759
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,210
Thank you, Dad.

760
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:21,797
You're the only one who understands me.

761
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,591
Thank you. I'm sorry.

762
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,387
Gosh, what a relief

763
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,513
you take after me too.

764
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,098
-Don't cry.
-I'm sorry.

765
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,809
-Okay, don't cry.
-Sorry.

766
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,353
-I'm so upset.
-Hey, Eun-hye didn't call?

767
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,396
No.

768
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,440
Where in the world
did she go at this hour?

769
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,484
I'm sure she's fine.

770
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,529
She's probably hanging out with friends
now that her exam is over.

771
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,574
She studied so hard.
Let her blow off some steam.

772
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,700
Hi, Do-chang.

773
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,704
-What is this?
-Goodness.

774
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,081
Chief?

775
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,085
Chief.

776
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,922
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

777
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,090
Wait a second.

778
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,013
Look who it is. It's you, Bo-gyeong.

779
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,723
Hello.

780
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,225
You're all grown up.

781
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,977
She's gotten prettier.

782
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,770
-She did?
-Yes.

783
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,647
Bo-gyeong. I'm over here.

784
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,942
She's not in her right mind.

785
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,360
Look at her eyes.

786
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,241
Bo-gyeong.

787
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,494
Go home and get a good night's sleep.

788
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,914
Let's talk tomorrow
when you've sobered up, okay?

789
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,590
Stop by a convenience store.
Let's get her a hangover cure.

790
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,633
Yes, sir.

791
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,217
Dad.

792
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,306
Are all detectives handsome like that?

793
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,474
What?

794
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,476
What are you saying?

795
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,103
I thought all detectives looked like you.

796
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,689
Dad.

797
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,735
Once I quit, I'll be jobless.

798
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,695
Can I sometimes visit you at the station?

799
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,324
Who's the handsome guy
you're talking about?

800
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,500
I have a hunch.

801
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,462
It's a tsunami-sized hunch
that's crashing into me.

802
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,089
Moon Bo-gyeong, Chief's daughter.

803
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,883
She's fallen for me.

804
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,760
What are you saying? I don't think so.

805
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,054
Look at you. You're jealous.

806
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,474
The thing about jealousy is,

807
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,601
it blinds you.

808
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,814
I think you all have to
get on my good side from now.

809
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,483
My father-in-law is the chief. You hear?

810
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:52,280
Do-chang. I think Jae-hong needs
a break from all the work.

811
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,365
He's deranged.

812
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,492
Just finish your drink and go.
Stop talking rubbish.

813
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:56,993
Eun-hui.

814
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,204
Can you try calling Eun-hye again?

815
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,330
I did.

816
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,666
I get a signal, but she won't pick up.

817
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,252
This is driving me crazy.

818
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,047
I hope she's not hanging out
with the wrong kids now that she's done.

819
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,466
She wouldn't do that. Don't worry.

820
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,285
Yu-na.

821
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,538
Why are you doing this to me?

822
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,958
You were the one
who dragged me in to save your dad.

823
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,168
Did you forget?

824
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,297
I'm never going to let you go.

825
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,590
You can't go anywhere.

826
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,969
Why should I be the only one
living in the sewers?

827
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,889
You can't leave. We're family.

828
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,271
Hey, Eun-hye.

829
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,691
Where are you going?

830
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,986
I got lost on my way home for a second.

831
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,112
Let's go.

832
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,489
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

833
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,200
Request to track Eun-hye's phone.

834
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,326
That's a bit much.

835
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,287
Chief tracked his daughter's phone.

836
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,580
Why can't I?

837
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,124
Eun-hye is my daughter too.
My precious daughter.

838
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,715
Eun-hye.
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

839
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,467
I'm sorry.

840
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,261
Did the exam go well?

841
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,555
The truth is…

842
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,391
She did well. She texted me earlier.

843
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,476
What?

844
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,604
How dare you receive
a text message from Eun-hye?

845
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,024
How dare you receive
her text before I did?

846
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,276
She's more comfortable with me
than with an old man.

847
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,070
Right, Eun-hye?

848
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:08,875
So you were drinking alone
in your room that night?

849
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:14,548
That's a go-to alibi
for guys who don't have one.

850
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,590
It's the truth.

851
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,051
Please believe me.

852
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,428
Hey, Choi Ho-jun.

853
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,349
Can we just wrap things up nicely
for both of our sakes?

854
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,143
All right, you didn't plan it.

855
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,729
You were drunk
and killed her out of anger.

856
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,732
Then you made it look like
it was a serial killer's doing.

857
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,111
In conclusion,
this was an impulsive crime.

858
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:43,702
It's a no-brainer
that this was premeditated.

859
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,955
However, we don't see it that way.

860
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,457
Let me tell you this.

861
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,460
Whether the cops see this
as an impulsive case

862
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,922
or as a premeditated one

863
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,800
makes a world of difference.

864
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,890
I'll go with that then.

865
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,225
Go with what?

866
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,855
Like how you explained it.

867
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,317
I'll say that I did it.

868
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,404
Are we done then?

869
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,364
So please

870
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,659
just stop.

871
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,577
Please.

872
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,413
Let's have the prosecution indict him.

873
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,165
-I think our job is done.
-Wait.

874
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,003
Let's check one more thing.

875
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,672
I think I'll be a little late today.

876
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,592
I left the car behind
after grabbing a drink.

877
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,719
No, I'm not there yet.

878
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,388
I can just take the bus.

879
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,142
Okay, I'll be back with the car.

880
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,526
WHISTLEBLOWERS, DO NOT WORRY

881
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,212
WHITE GOWN SERIAL MURDER CASE

882
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,797
1ST VICTIM: KANG SO-JEONG
SEONGWOL-DONG CONSTRUCTION SITE

883
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,132
3RD VICTIM: CHOI YUN-A
HAKDAL-DONG PINE TREE FOREST

884
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,343
4TH VICTIM: JUNG HUI-JU
MOUNT MIBONG

885
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:29,099
SEONGWOL-DONG TERMINAL

886
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,106
Aren't you getting off?

887
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,483
Sorry, sir.

888
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,777
I got confused. This isn't my stop.

889
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,070
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

890
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,375
Attention, everyone.

891
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,169
Dong-uk isn't in?

892
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,796
He's getting the car. It won't be long.

893
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,550
As of today,
your vacation is officially over.

894
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,095
As I'm sure you know,
Chief has high expectations for us.

895
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,597
Let's keep doing our thing.

896
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,474
He's going to fund us very well.

897
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,894
What if we fail to catch this punk?

898
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,312
We'll have nothing to show.

899
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,941
You're upset about handing over
that druggie to Narcotics, aren't you?

900
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,401
Well…

901
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,111
The chief told me

902
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,530
he'll count that as your find.

903
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:30,452
Gosh, our chief is the best.

904
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,997
I think I've been seeing him
in a bad light until now.

905
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,291
He's a stand-up guy
the more you get to know him.

906
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,585
Since when did you become his fan?

907
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,003
Are we up for promotion soon?

908
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,924
You can tell a person
by looking at their kids.

909
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,427
He raised his daughter very well.

910
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,138
She's a good one.

911
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,557
Good morning, Chief.

912
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,479
-It's you, right?
-Sir?

913
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,522
You carried my daughter
from the bar, right?

914
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,442
Yes. Why do you ask?

915
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,321
Why in the world
does she think you're handsome?

916
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,239
You look like a grilled piece of anchovy.

917
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,867
-Are you saying she likes--?
-You!

918
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,452
I'm warning you.

919
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,289
Don't go within 100-meter radius
from my daughter. That's an order.

920
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:21,419
If you disobey it,
I'll rip that anchovy face off of you.

921
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,714
You better keep a close eye on
this punk too.

922
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,592
Don't even let him near Bo-gyeong. Got it?

923
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,469
Yes, sir.

924
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:33,765
Why does it have to be a cop,
of all jobs in this world?

925
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,682
Damn it!

926
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,267
Gosh.

927
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,437
What the hell? He's a cop himself.

928
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,149
-Gosh.
-I expected this level of disapproval.

929
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,903
The important thing is
that she fell for my looks.

930
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,574
He's lost it.

931
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,203
He'd be crazy to give
his big-shot daughter to you.

932
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,746
A big shot?

933
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,791
She's beautiful and a big shot.
Where does she work?

934
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,543
At TJ.

935
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,089
She must make a fortune then.

936
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,761
To the headquarters.

937
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,889
I suddenly got transferred here.

938
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,724
I was totally surprised.

939
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,395
Of course. This is the headquarters.

940
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,981
I'm part of a core department too.

941
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,235
Why would I? I would be crazy to quit.

942
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,113
Yes.

943
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,157
Okay.

944
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,158
I love you too, Dad.

945
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,286
Do you like your seat?

946
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,372
Of course. I love it, Mr. Choi.

947
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,668
We're going to need
a lot of help from you, Ms. Moon.

948
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,295
I'll thank you in advance.

949
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,421
Sure.

950
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,013
SEONGWOL-DONG

951
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,348
I'm not slacking around.

952
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,434
I have a hunch.

953
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,812
Give me about an hour.

954
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,648
I'll explain to you later.

955
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:10,320
Tell everyone to stay in the office
until I get there.

956
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,697
I found something very important.

957
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,371
WHISTLEBLOWERS, DO NOT WORRY

958
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,303
Where is this place?

959
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,931
Why did you bring me here?

960
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:38,890
Don't play dumb.

961
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,809
This is where you dumped
Park Seon-mi's body.

962
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,229
No, I'm not going!

963
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,563
We moved her. Just look.

964
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,982
-I'm not going. I won't.
-Hey!

965
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,277
I'm not going.

966
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,490
Why would I go to where Seon-mi died?

967
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,325
Hey, get up.

968
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,162
This is protocol.
You have to do it, you punk.

969
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,789
-Hey!
-I'm not going.

970
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,091
Hey.

971
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,186
Damn it.

972
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,022
-Send him home.
-What?

973
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,274
I said to send him home!

974
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,318
He's not the culprit.
So send him home, you punks!

975
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,778
Damn it.

976
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,743
The triangles are
where the bodies were found.

977
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,789
The blue circles are the areas
we searched for the owner of the bag

978
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,374
by tracing the victim's routes.

979
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,668
The victims usually hung around here.

980
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,379
The black circles are the victims' homes.

981
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,842
And this is a close-up map
of Seongwol-dong.

982
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,635
Just looking at it,

983
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,930
it seems like there is no connection
besides their close locations.

984
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,225
Now I'm going to draw the route of the bus

985
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,477
that I've been on all day today.

986
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,480
The bus starts operating from here.

987
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,316
SEOJIN-GU

988
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,072
SEONGWOL-DONG
5TH: PARK SEON-MI

989
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,033
3RD: CHOI YUN-A

990
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,868
2ND: JUNG HYE-JIN

991
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,164
1ST: KANG SO-JEONG

992
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,129
All right. The fourth victim, Jung Hui-ju.

993
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,173
Besides the bus stop by her home,

994
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,135
it's all connected to this.

995
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:43,222
-My gosh.
-Nice one, Dong-uk.

996
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,185
How did you find this out?

997
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,188
I did some legwork
like Do-chang told us to.

998
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,482
Didn't I tell you all

999
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,985
that nothing bad comes
from listening to me?

1000
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,740
But why is the case
on the top not connected?

1001
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,949
It might be

1002
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,328
because he used
a different form of transportation.

1003
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:09,499
So the culprit mostly used
this bus route to get around

1004
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,750
and commit crimes.

1005
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,544
But we checked all the CCTVs on the bus.

1006
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,716
Watch out!

1007
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,390
If the culprit used the bus
for his crimes,

1008
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,892
he would have been on it all day.

1009
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:32,772
Wouldn't there have been one person
who stood out on the footage?

1010
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,190
Maybe not.

1011
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,362
Someone who flies under the radar

1012
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,615
despite being caught on CCTV all day.

1013
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,619
The bus driver.

1014
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,664
SEONGWOL-DONG

1015
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,451
I kept this dashcam just in case.

1016
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,161
It's this bus, right?

1017
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,704
Yes, that's the one.

1018
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,874
This was taken where the body was dumped.

1019
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,710
It's completely off from its usual route.

1020
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,589
The culprit loaded the body on the bus

1021
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,841
and dumped it.

1022
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,052
Nobody paid attention to the CCTV
because it was just a bus.

1023
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,600
SEONGWOL-DONG

1024
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,851
Currently, two buses are operating.

1025
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,313
One is three stops from the terminal.

1026
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,439
It'll be back soon.

1027
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,527
There's no time.
We'll check the bus on its way back.

1028
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,946
You guys go and track the other one down.

1029
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:45,863
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

1030
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,031
Excuse me.

1031
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,909
There's a bus under repair

1032
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,578
because it suddenly broke down mid-route.

1033
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,373
Who was the bus driver?

1034
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,346
You boys go over there.

1035
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,016
Jae-hong, Ji-hyeok, and Dong-uk.
Go together.

1036
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,060
Be careful, okay?

1037
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,311
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

1038
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:00,980
Open it.

1039
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,144
You're still alive, right?

1040
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,971
I wonder why
he exposed himself unnecessarily.

1041
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,347
Help me.

1042
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,224
He's calculating every single move.

1043
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,476
Don't believe a word she says.
To extort money.

1044
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,103
Why should I treat this scum as a human?

1045
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,021
Is he the man who killed Hui-ju?

1046
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,356
He has to become the copycat.

1047
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:28,609
You want to be given credit
for the job we did.

1048
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,277
Did you catch the culprit?

1049
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,947
Do you really think
you can read Na-na's mind?

1050
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,659
It's a card I need to hold onto
until I get what I want.

1051
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:40,162
Why do I keep getting the feeling
that Jung Hui-ju's case doesn't fit?

1052
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,288
Let's take our time.

1053
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,749
We should take our sweet time.

1054
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:49,839
