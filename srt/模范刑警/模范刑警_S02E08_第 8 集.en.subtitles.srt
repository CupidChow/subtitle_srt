1
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,505
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
THE GOOD DETECTIVE: SEASON 2

3
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,875
He's in pain.
Are you sure he's anesthetized properly?

4
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,293
We gave him local anesthesia.

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,962
Stop being a crybaby.
They gave you anesthetics.

6
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,590
I've just been stabbed.
Of course I'm in pain!

7
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,384
We gave you enough anesthetics.
The pain will subside soon.

8
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,762
It really hurts.

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,097
It feels like my intestines are in a knot.

10
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,766
Maybe you have to poop.

11
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,643
Do I? Maybe that's what it is.

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,732
Man-gu, are you okay?

13
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,901
It hurts a little, but I'm okay.

14
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,153
-Is he really okay?
-His organs are unharmed.

15
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,531
He lost a lot of blood,
but he'll be fine after the stitches.

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,242
That's a relief. What about Ji-ung?

17
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,536
He got beat in the face,
so it's a bit swollen, but…

18
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,831
We'll have to operate on Byun Ji-ung.

19
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,584
The MRI showed cerebral hemorrhage.

20
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,211
-What?
-What?

21
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,007
How's Man-gu?

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,176
He's fine. He really is.

23
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,178
It's my fault.

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,972
He told me to wait.

25
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,974
What about Man-gu?

26
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,352
Don't worry, Man-gu is fine.

27
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,937
Focus on yourself.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,357
Man-gu…

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,441
Man-gu.

30
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,194
Don't die, Man-gu.

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,655
You have to live.

32
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,616
Please stay alive, Man-gu.

33
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,702
Man-gu…

34
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,165
You have to live, Man-gu.

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,794
I should have listened.

36
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,838
Man-gu.

37
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,844
Let's begin.

38
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,471
Bring the Leica.

39
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,807
Scalpel.

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,482
Is this fun for you?

41
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,653
Do you think we're softer
than the Incheon Seobu guys?

42
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,534
Let's skip over the petty things

43
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,203
and talk about the big ones.

44
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,872
You killed Cho Sang-pil, right?

45
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,582
No.

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,794
Neither of us would benefit
from further investigation.

47
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,673
Sang-pil was killed by the Rotary Gang.

48
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,550
Damn.

49
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,344
Should I send you to Incheon?
They would love to have you.

50
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,680
Or should I just let you go?

51
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,683
The Gangnam East Gang would
love to have your head.

52
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,771
Captain,

53
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,609
-His attorney is here.
-My name is Choi Sang-ho.

54
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,903
I'd like to talk to my client in private.

55
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,404
Can we have the room?

56
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,491
TJ GROUP LEGAL TEAM
ATTORNEY CHOI SANG-HO

57
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,046
Organizing a criminal group
and inciting assault and injury

58
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,797
within the criminal organization,

59
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,218
that will get you three to four years.

60
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,809
Why are you covering
for a piece of trash like that?

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,605
He did some work for TJ Group.

62
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,317
Was that work worse
than three to four years in jail?

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,654
It's kind of related to my higher-ups.

64
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
It will be bad for me if that comes out.

65
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,907
Was that work…

66
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,701
a murder or worse?

67
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,119
Nothing that bad.

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,539
I understand.
But I have to investigate the case.

69
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,832
But…

70
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,628
if it's more serious than
what I'm thinking,

71
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,130
I have to do my job.

72
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,632
I hope you understand.

73
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,233
What's the reason?

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,195
It was an inevitable choice
to protect our family.

75
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,197
What did Tae-ho do?

76
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,994
The head office of McQueen
picked Tae-ho as the next CEO.

77
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,453
That's their decision.

78
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,998
Tae-ho was planning on
getting Sang-woo arrested.

79
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,376
The head of McQueen Korea
is my university friend.

80
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,128
I found out through him

81
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,256
that Tae-ho had a secret deal
with McQueen as well.

82
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,340
So…

83
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,220
Are you telling me that you and Tae-ho
have nothing to do with each other?

84
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,014
You told me yourself,

85
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,392
that the next head of TJ will be Sang-woo.

86
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,729
If Sang-woo is arrested,
there is no TJ Group.

87
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,648
The future of TJ Group

88
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,692
is my future.

89
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,861
It is for my future

90
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,322
that I decided to divorce him.

91
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:27,160
Would Tae-ho have been able to plan
such a bold move without you?

92
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,247
I still love him.

93
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,917
It was for a short while,

94
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,713
but I had to go along with his plans.

95
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,048
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,966
I'm truly sorry.

97
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,511
It hurts.

98
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,017
It was a painful choice.

99
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:59,108
But I don't want to lose
you or Sang-woo because of him.

100
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,824
He knows all of our dirty secrets.

101
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,284
Just because we cut him off

102
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,704
doesn't mean
you will be able to get rid of him.

103
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,165
That's why I ended things with him.

104
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,126
Without me,

105
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,296
he's nothing.

106
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,426
I had no other choice.

107
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,721
I have to make you the target.

108
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,099
That's the only way
they will not suspect us.

109
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,310
Did you ever think
to talk to me about this?

110
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,105
A press interview has no legal binding.

111
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,648
We can always undo it.

112
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,734
Don't you care about my feelings?

113
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,987
Are you sure you're so innocent?

114
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,114
What?

115
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,581
I called the reporters.
You can do a separate interview.

116
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,959
Make sure you act like a selfish scum.

117
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,380
That way, they won't suspect
our relationship.

118
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,675
Why do I have to go that far?

119
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,010
I'm never going to leave you.

120
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,470
Maybe not you.

121
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,394
The idea of me leaving you
never crossed your mind?

122
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,399
I won't allow that.

123
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,570
That means that worthless girl
is better than me.

124
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,864
Please don't do that.

125
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,670
We are not legally divorced yet.

126
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,672
I take most of the blame.

127
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,550
But I did nothing
that would be a reason for divorce.

128
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,555
I will do my best for a reconciliation.

129
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,766
What if you can't reconcile with her?

130
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,978
I can't answer that yet.

131
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,273
Will you go to court over this?

132
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,609
I can't answer that, either.

133
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,153
However…

134
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,907
The responsibilities of informing me
of this one-sided divorce…

135
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,534
CHEON NA-NA'S HUSBAND, WOO TAE-HO,
REFUSES TO DIVORCE

136
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,703
…and the issues regarding my rights

137
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,247
will be addressed.

138
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,709
I'm sorry, that will be all.

139
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,629
Are you officially refusing the divorce?

140
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
How is the alimony--

141
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,302
She's willing to discard her husband.

142
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,847
That's so like Na-na.

143
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,560
But Woo Tae-ho…

144
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,356
doesn't seem like himself.

145
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,277
We were able to drain the hemorrhage

146
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,071
and the intracranial pressure is stable.

147
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,156
We have to wait for the prognosis,

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,075
but the surgery was a success.

149
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,203
Will there be any aftereffects?

150
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,871
We can't say for sure.

151
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,583
Brain surgery always runs
the risk of nerve damage.

152
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,294
He will wake up from anesthesia soon.

153
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,714
If the patient experiences pain,
please alert the nurses' station.

154
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,218
Thank you very much.

155
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,844
Thank you.

156
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,057
He'll be okay, right?

157
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,476
He was fine

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,478
when we rough-and-tumbled on the job.

159
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,107
-He won't have aftereffects.
-He may not have physical symptoms.

160
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,942
But he may have mental ones.

161
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,569
That's true.

162
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,822
He might look tough on the outside,

163
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,699
but he is very sensitive.

164
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,286
-He will feel it mentally for sure.
-He's a cop.

165
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,454
He won't break down
due to something like this.

166
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,082
Ji-ung is a simpleton.

167
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,919
-That won't happen.
-He may be a simpleton.

168
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,588
But that doesn't rule out trauma.

169
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,924
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,842
I'm just saying.

171
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,801
Man-gu.

172
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,303
-Ji-ung.
-Man-gu…

173
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,470
Ji-ung, are you awake?

174
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,682
-Are you in pain?
-What happened to Man-gu?

175
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,766
Man-gu…

176
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,644
He's fine. Completely fine.

177
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,980
You are lying.

178
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,525
You are lying to calm me down.

179
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,153
Mangu is dead.

180
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,114
Man-gu is dead!

181
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,410
Why would Man-gu die?

182
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,536
He bled a little.

183
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,955
He only got a few stitches,
and he's better.

184
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,749
No…

185
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,626
Don't lie to me.

186
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,878
Man-gu is dead!

187
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,673
Man-gu!

188
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,133
Ji-ung.

189
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:38,012
Man-gu!

190
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,971
Ji-ung!

191
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,514
What?

192
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,099
I'm okay.

193
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,313
Man-gu!

194
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,900
You're not a ghost, right?

195
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,404
You guys all see him, right?

196
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,991
I'm the one who was stabbed.

197
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,202
Why are you lying there?

198
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,537
Come here.

199
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,498
Please come closer.

200
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,166
Hurry.

201
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,006
Man-gu, you're not a ghost.

202
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,758
I'm not a ghost.

203
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,511
See, I'm breathing.

204
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,600
You are hurt because of me.

206
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,978
I'm really sorry.

207
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,188
Why is it your fault?

208
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:33,401
You got hurt worse than I did.

209
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,238
I got myself stabbed

210
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,532
and it led to you getting hurt.

211
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,118
It's my fault.

212
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,744
I am to blame.

213
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,248
It was my fault. I was stupid.

214
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,209
I will listen to you from now on.

215
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:55,047
If you tell me to raid, I will.
If you tell me to stop, I'll stop.

216
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,590
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,051
Stop it.

218
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,763
You're the one with a hole in your head.

219
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,474
You are hurt more.

220
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,394
Why do you keep saying you're sorry?

221
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,020
Stop saying that.

222
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,525
Thank you for staying alive, Man-gu.

223
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,114
Shouldn't we be…

224
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,782
crying with them?

225
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,287
I mean, I feel sorry for them
for getting beat up and stabbed.

226
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,206
But…

227
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,168
You're looking at a deep bond
between two detectives.

228
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,669
It's not something to laugh at.

229
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,673
Man-gu.

230
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,592
Don't ever get hurt.

231
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,552
If you're hurt,

232
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,013
it will hurt me more.

233
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,185
Ji-ung.

234
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,353
Don't ever suffer alone.

235
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,147
Let's suffer together.

236
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,360
I can't stand it anymore.

237
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,820
It's too funny.

238
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,366
-Don't get sick either.
-You take care of yourself.

239
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh, boy.

240
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,665
It's a mental aftereffect for sure.

241
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,959
We have to bring Gi Dong-jae here.

242
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,795
Why should we let them
have the bastard that hurt our guys?

243
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,299
They are the ones that arrested him.
We have no cause to bring him here.

244
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,885
They snatched him on purpose
to hinder our investigation.

245
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,596
At least he's in custody.

246
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,556
We can bring him after they are done.

247
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,518
They won't give him to us.
Gi Dong-jae will refuse, too.

248
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,145
The prosecutor won't accept
our additional indictment either.

249
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,314
I don't care about the complicated things.

250
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,566
I'm going to bring him by force
if I have to.

251
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,652
-Those bastards…
-Let me go with you.

252
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,529
Calm down.

253
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,406
You've dealt with Jang Gi-jin before.

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,450
He's not even going to blink at us.

255
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
It's embarrassing.

256
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,828
Our guys were stabbed
and had brain surgery.

257
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,038
Enough.

258
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,582
Captain Oh is right.

259
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,045
Jang Gi-jin won't budge,
no matter what we say.

260
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,507
We know him better than you guys.
Let us talk to him.

261
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,927
Take care of Man-gu and Ji-ung. Let's go.

262
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,514
You must be rational, with a cool head.

263
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,848
Don't blow this up.

264
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,059
Of course. No need to worry.

265
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,102
Let's go.

266
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,897
You scums!

267
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,733
You bastards!

268
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,946
You scums dare hurt my guys?

269
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,824
You're all dead, you bastards!

270
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,075
VISITORS ONLY

271
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,369
Gi Dong-jae!

272
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,581
Gi Dong-jae, you son of a bitch!

273
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,249
You're going to pay for this!

274
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,252
Damn it!

275
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,965
Gi Dong-jae! You're going to regret this
for the rest of your life.

276
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,967
Open this!

277
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,888
Open up, you bastards!
Let me drill a hole in his head!

278
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,141
I'm going to rip his guts open.

279
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,771
I'll have you lose your badges!

280
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,784
-I'm done, let's go.
-Okay.

281
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,163
He'll get a taste of his own medicine.

282
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,000
You should have been more gentle.
You tore everything up.

283
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,754
I'll drill a hole in his head,
rip open his guts, just like he did.

284
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,884
What is the reason

285
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,511
you guys arrested Gi Dong-jae?

286
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,222
If you have the same charges as ours,

287
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,808
I'm willing to let you guys keep him.

288
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,185
You tell me first.

289
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,895
Why were you after him?

290
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,146
You had no charges.

291
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,439
You just arrested him.

292
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,152
I'm trying my best to stay calm right now.

293
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,155
Give me a good reason before I lose it.

294
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,239
What's wrong with him?

295
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,992
I think you told me before.

296
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,454
Even dogs know not to mess
with what's not theirs.

297
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,052
It's because of Jung Hui-ju's murder.

298
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,971
You know that's our case.

299
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,975
I guess you have a lead.

300
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,978
Give it to us.
We'll add it to our investigation.

301
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,562
I don't think so.

302
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,190
The reason for
your arrest on Gi Dong-jae is fishy.

303
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,903
Gi Dong-jae has a history.

304
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,366
He once got off a charge
with the help of Choi Yong-geun.

305
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,036
This case is very similar to that one.

306
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:44,086
Aren't you very close to the ex-captain?

307
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,800
It's too early in the investigation
to say for sure.

308
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,011
We will see how it goes.

309
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,973
We'll call you if we need anything.

310
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,686
Two of our guys were hurt.

311
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,646
They're in the hospital.

312
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,901
Gi Dong-jae stabbed
and beat the hell out of them.

313
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,864
They're on my team,

314
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,118
but they are also your colleagues.

315
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,917
Let's get more on Gi Dong-jae.

316
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,586
We'll find more evidence

317
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,213
and get the prosecutor
to add to his charges.

318
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,884
The prosecutor is a son-in-law
of a very powerful family.

319
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,177
You think it'll work?

320
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,387
We never cared about those things.

321
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,556
If we hit a wall, we'll jump over it.

322
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,850
If the wall is too high,
we'll crash through it.

323
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563
You are over your puberty.

324
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,440
Let's get over the mid-life crisis now.

325
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,860
I'm not having a mid-life crisis.
I'm not even married yet.

326
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,612
It has been known to happen.

327
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,655
Unmarried man going through
mid-life crises.

328
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,823
It's the worst.

329
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,035
You may tease me,
but seeing you gives me comfort.

330
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,454
I am your future self.

331
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,458
I know you're bound to live
"the worst" life like me.

332
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,044
That's practically a curse.

333
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,171
Wait for me, future Kang Do-chang.

334
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,131
-Do-chang.
-So disgusting.

335
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,341
Do-chang.

336
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,510
Do-chang.

337
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,845
The guys from Incheon Seobu Station
came by today.

338
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,639
They were chasing you for murder.

339
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,225
I told you I didn't kill Sang-pil.

340
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,727
Not that one.

341
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,604
Jung Hui-ju's murder.

342
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,981
Why are they pinning that on me?

343
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,150
I have nothing to do with her.

344
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,028
You have connections to TJ Group.

345
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,073
Your lawyer is from TJ Group too.

346
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,492
Whatever. Talk to my lawyer.

347
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,202
I don't want to talk anymore.

348
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,496
I see.

349
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,166
You don't want to talk to
a low-ranking officer like me.

350
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,171
Who's looking out for you?

351
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,966
Are they that powerful?

352
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,594
You think your powerful friends
will take care of you

353
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,847
even if you stab and beat police officers?

354
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,599
You think life is that easy?

355
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,854
Captain Jang.

356
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,815
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

357
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,860
I admit to organizing a criminal group.

358
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,280
You just do as the lawyer--

359
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,868
Hey. Get up.

360
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,579
Stand up straight.

361
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,081
Captain Jang.

362
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,792
this is not right.

363
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,003
What?

364
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,337
Do you think it's unfair?

365
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,174
Fine then.

366
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,383
Here.

367
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,427
You.

368
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,139
Hit me.

369
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,851
I'm a detective
like those guys you messed up.

370
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,603
Take a shot, you bastard!

371
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
Let's stop this.

372
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,315
This won't do you any good either.

373
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,649
I know.

374
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,569
But I would be too ashamed.

375
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,239
I would be too ashamed to live

376
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,075
if I let a scum like you go

377
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,494
who has no respect for the police.

378
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,746
You son of a bitch!

379
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,417
How can you beat up a suspect
in this day and age?

380
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,501
Are you nuts?

381
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,629
He stabbed an officer.

382
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,839
One of them had surgery
for cerebral hemorrhage.

383
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,591
They are not our guys.

384
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,384
They are with Incheon Seobu Station.

385
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,220
Why are you so worked up about it?

386
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,639
But they're still our colleagues.

387
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,350
So you took revenge for them?

388
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,188
That's what thugs do. You're a cop.

389
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,024
A cop should work like a cop.

390
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,234
The reason!

391
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,237
What do you think is the reason
I risked my life doing this?

392
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,198
It's because

393
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,117
I know my brothers in uniform

394
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,330
will risk their lives for me as well.

395
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,670
If I let guys like Gi Dong-jae go,

396
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,048
would these guys…

397
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,551
Would they be able to trust me

398
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,222
and jump into dangerous situations
and risk their lives?

399
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,147
Gi Dong-jae's lawyer will

400
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,901
charge you with aggravated battery.

401
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,903
I'll go to trial.

402
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,407
Transfer Gi Dong-jae to another team
and stay home.

403
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,874
What are you doing?

404
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,044
Didn't you tell your wife yet?

405
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,588
Yong-geun.

406
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,674
Thanks for the offer,

407
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,135
but I don't think this place suits me.

408
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,720
It's not for me.

409
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,807
Gi-jin,

410
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,935
I talked to the lawyer.

411
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,021
It will all blow over.

412
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:54,938
No need.

413
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,065
I just want some rest.

414
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:58,942
I'm tired.

415
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,196
Do something about your damn temper.

416
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,408
You're not a young cop anymore.

417
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,869
Your kid is now…

418
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,666
Think of your kid and hold your temper.

419
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,840
Our chief will transfer
Gi Dong-jae to another team.

420
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,426
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

421
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,017
I'd like for you to stay on that case.

422
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,310
That won't be easy.

423
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,562
I messed up.

424
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,441
I don't think
the Chief will let it slide either.

425
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,654
I'm saying I want you.

426
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,031
Yong-geun,

427
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,618
let's think of this
as the end of the road for us.

428
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,037
If we continue,

429
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,789
things may get very awkward.

430
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,716
I want you to stay on.

431
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,609
Captain, they announced
the transfer this morning.

432
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,236
Already?

433
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,154
Where am I going?

434
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,740
I hope it's a scenic place
somewhere far away.

435
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,953
Not you, but the Chief.

436
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,224
I should have been nicer to you
if I had known.

437
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,061
You won.

438
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,876
Hey.

439
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,252
Come in.

440
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,382
Come in.

441
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,051
Can they leak this?

442
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,803
This is a police file.

443
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,181
Someone snuck it out
and sent it to Gi Dong-jae.

444
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,435
Gi Dong-jae used these photos
to copy the serial murders.

445
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,897
That means the police have a mole.

446
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,940
It's most likely from

447
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,442
the Seoul Criminal Investigation Division.

448
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,445
This is bad.

449
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,949
Are you sure
this is from Gi Dong-jae's computer?

450
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,993
Yes. We found it in the factory
he was hiding out.

451
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,411
Okay.

452
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,790
I think it's enough
for the prosecutor to add charges.

453
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,418
-Will it work?
-I don't know.

454
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,379
I don't think it's enough.

455
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,965
We need a sure punch.

456
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,717
Did you find it?

457
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,730
This is the last place he was spotted.
There's no record of him afterward.

458
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,940
Who owns the car?

459
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,149
It's unregistered.

460
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,776
Was he recorded coming back?

461
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,611
No.

462
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,324
He drove Jung Hui-ju
to the mountains to dump her body,

463
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,494
then disappeared along with the car.

464
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,255
Ji-hyeok.

465
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,386
Hey.

466
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,058
Seems likely.

467
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,084
FORENSICS

468
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,211
Damn.

469
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,550
Jae-hong,

470
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,261
can you get DNA samples?

471
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,472
It's been underwater too long.

472
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,848
No bloodstains, either.

473
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,476
We may not even get hair samples
because of the water.

474
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,520
Oh.

475
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,316
Do-chang,

476
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,902
-Gosh.
-What is it?

477
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,861
Look at this.

478
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,071
Where did you find it?

479
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,449
It's a lid for a lipstick.
It was stuck under the driver's seat.

480
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:34,003
Finally, we were able to find
definitive evidence against him.

481
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,213
That is all.

482
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,466
That lipstick lid was found
inside the car?

483
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,384
Yes.

484
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,219
What did the NFS say?

485
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,639
They said it matches the lipstick
used on Jung Hui-ju.

486
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,559
We seem to have the full picture now.

487
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
Arrest Gi Dong-jae then.

488
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,896
The investigation division has him
right now,

489
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,982
so that's a bit difficult to do.

490
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,610
We need to give the prosecutors
these new pieces of evidence

491
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,447
and file a new charge against him
with an arrest warrant.

492
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,074
Do you have a motive?

493
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,411
Gi Dong-jae didn't act alone.
Someone ordered him to do it.

494
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,414
We have to find the solicitor
to find out the motive.

495
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,415
And who is that?

496
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,252
Who ordered the kill?

497
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,632
It's either Woo Tae-ho or Cheon Sang-woo.

498
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:24,012
The same guys that you know,
I know, and the world knows?

499
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,222
That Woo Tae-ho and Cheon Sang-woo?

500
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,106
Are you going to tell the prosecutor
the mastermind?

501
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,191
We have to.

502
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,943
You know they don't like to
issue additional indictments.

503
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,237
They may not do it
even if we give them everything.

504
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,698
Do you have evidence
that they are behind it?

505
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,493
Do you want to see it?
It's pretty straightforward.

506
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,203
Go downstairs and bring the files.

507
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,206
No. That's not necessary.

508
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,792
Damn it.

509
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm tired of asking you this again.

510
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,883
But do you know who they are?

511
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,135
We do. They are big shots.

512
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:08,973
My wife's sister's husband works
for a subcontractor that cleans

513
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,934
TJ Group's office building windows.

514
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,187
-If things go south, my wife will kill me.
-That's right.

515
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,356
So you do understand.

516
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,316
But why are you messing with them?

517
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,569
We don't get to choose our cases.

518
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,529
Captain Oh,

519
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,656
Chief's daughter works at TJ too.

520
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,534
Her boss is Woo Tae-ho,
who's one of the suspects.

521
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,411
And yet, I know he won't give up
on this investigation.

522
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,496
I'm going to give up.

523
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,665
I'm going to.

524
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,793
So leave TJ Group alone, you punks!

525
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,128
You don't know
what it's like to be a parent.

526
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,548
Any parent will react this way.

527
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,842
I will take care of Ms. Moon Bo-gyeong.

528
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,094
What? Hey.

529
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,389
Who are you to take care of my daughter?

530
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,890
He's rich.

531
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,267
You little…

532
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,811
What does that have to do with this?

533
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,064
Also, how rich can you be?

534
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,401
My university buddy recently
opened a law firm in Gangnam District.

535
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,654
They will welcome
someone as capable as Bo-gyeong.

536
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,865
A law firm in Gangnam?

537
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,575
Can you make that happen?

538
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,702
He won't be able to refuse me.

539
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:15,164
I own the building his office is in.

540
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,045
By any chance,
do you already have a contractor

541
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,423
that cleans windows for your building?

542
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,049
Sir?

543
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,221
What are you guys doing here?

544
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,099
Do you have time to be standing around?

545
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,644
Send the evidence to the prosecution
and get that additional indictment!

546
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,440
I don't care if the suspect
is an heir or the son-in-law of Chaebol.

547
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,400
-List them as solicitors.
-Okay.

548
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,735
Yes, sir.

549
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,665
TJ

550
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,418
You will have to step down
as the legal team director.

551
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,128
Can you at least do that?

552
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,089
Fine.

553
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,550
But give me some time.

554
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,386
It's not because of my title.

555
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,513
But I have to be there

556
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,349
for us to accomplish what we want.

557
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,895
I'll tell father

558
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,897
that I gave in because you insisted.

559
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,358
I'm sure he'll understand.

560
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,528
He knows you're too valuable to kick out.

561
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,324
The detectives submitted

562
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,327
evidence related to Jung Hui-ju's murder
to the prosecutor.

563
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,537
Apparently,

564
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,748
Sang-woo and I are named

565
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,626
as solicitors of murder.

566
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,711
You?

567
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,755
Why?

568
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,427
Either way,

569
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,806
the detectives are suspecting
Sang-woo of ordering her murder.

570
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,058
Yes.

571
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,852
Then make it true.

572
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,896
Even if it's not true, make it true.

573
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,149
That way, you're off the hook.

574
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,412
The prosecution sent me the files.

575
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,872
After I look through them,

576
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,833
I'll tell you where they're at.

577
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,586
Okay.

You remember

584
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,995
Do you have evidence of the killer?

585
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,707
No, we don't have anything yet.

586
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,961
Do you think you'll get anything?

587
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,089
We are trying, but it's tough.

588
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,554
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

That's him.

Is he still on our tail?

Did he approach you too?

I apologize. I'll make sure to warn him.

I don't want to make a fuss.

627

I'll try to persuade him.

628
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,860
It won't be easy.

629
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,654
He's quite stubborn.

630
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,117
-He seemed pretty corrupt.
-Not at all.

631
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,954
He only cares about catching criminals.

632
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,541
He is different from other detectives.

633
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,043
He does it at all costs.

634
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,340
He cares about catching criminals
over law and principle.

635
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,508
Really?

636
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,595
That will be tricky.

637
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,556
Understood.

638
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,184
Anyway, pretend you know nothing
and let me take care of it.

639
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,020
Yes.

640
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,062
You may leave.

641
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,439
Okay.

642
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,736
By the way,

643
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,613
I'm sorry to ask,

644
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,700
but why did you and Woo Tae-ho…

645
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,909
I apologize.

646
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,038
I should have let you know in advance.

647
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,752
This incident won't have
any effect on our goal.

648
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,590
Will he leave the company afterward?

649
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,008
Not yet.

650
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,969
But he will eventually have to.

651
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,474
Now he's a nobody
who has no ties with TJ Group.

652
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,060
Okay.

653
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,686

00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,331
I'm not the only one who's screwed
if things go wrong.

658
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,459
Of course, I know.

659
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,545
We need to have strict control
over our personnel.

660
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,756
To be honest,

661
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,301
I'm more worried
about our side than the cops.

662
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,138
I will make sure that doesn't happen.

663
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,066
-You're still at the office.
-Yes.

664
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,194
Assistant Manager Park
was supposed to give me something.

665
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,279
-But I think he went home.
-Yes.

666
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,198
Aren't you going home?

667
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,699
I will.

668
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,730
DVD RW DRIVE

669
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,608
DECEMBER 9TH 2021 8:22 P.M.

670
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,072
DECEMBER 9TH 2021 8:22 P.M.

671
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:54,326
DECEMBER 9TH 2021

672
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,425
Doors are closing.

673
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,639
I'm sorry.

674
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,310
Doors are closing.

675
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,111
You must have parked on B6.

676
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,655
I did.

677
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,202
I thought level B6
was reserved for executives.

678
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,370
There wasn't any other space.

679
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,664
I'll be careful in the future.

680
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,942
I forgot
I had to meet someone for a drink.

681
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,610
I see.

682
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,448
I'll see you tomorrow.

683
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,879
Mr. Choi, I heard you're working on
Gi Dong-jae's case.

684
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:34,051
I think I might need to talk to
Gi Dong-jae soon.

685
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,540
TJ

686
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,458
It's done.

687
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,460
Thank you.

688
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,096
Please enter your security code.

689
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,476
It has been unlocked. Your door is open.

690
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,357
Security code input or change mode.

691
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,942
To use…

692
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,448
The security code has been…
The door is locked.

693
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:39,825
Come in.

694
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,166
What is it?

695
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,046
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

696
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,465
Why?

697
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:59,011
I spoke inappropriately to you
the other day.

698
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,139
That's not a reason to resign.

699
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,433
I don't usually care about my dad's work.

700
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,645
But I guess I take after him.

701
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,606
I keep thinking about Jung Hui-ju's case.

702
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,819
I don't think it helps you

703
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,489
or my dad.

704
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,324
You keep thinking about

705
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,243
Jung Hui-ju's case?

706
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,371
It has nothing to do with my work here.

707
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,123
That case will be solved soon.

708
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:32,753
Why don't you reconsider until then?

709
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,422
Will it be solved so soon?

710
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,219
You are an important member of our team.

711
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:46,350
I can trust you
as much as I trusted Hui-ju.

712
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,854
Please…

713
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,190
stay.

714
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,820
Let me think about it more.

715
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,948
I know.

716
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,408
I get it.

717
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,618
You're right, I was used.

718
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:05,994
So what?

719
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,665
Can't I just do what they tell me
and get paid?

720
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,922
Hello.

721
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,675
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM YOU CAN START AGAIN

722
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,759
Sure.

723
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,565
This is exciting.

724
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,110
I feel like I'm on a blind date
during my university years.

725
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,863
-My name is Cheon Na-na.
-No need to introduce yourself.

726
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,824
Everybody knows you.

727
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,619
Unfortunately,
I'm not here for a blind date.

728
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,163
Then the excitement is all mine.

729
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,582
What brings you here?

730
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,629
I'm interested in Oh Ji-hyeok these days.

731
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,424
Aren't you his cousin?

732
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,179
Ji-hyeok is impressive.

733
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,266
He's even harassing a Chaebol's daughter.

734
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,727
I take it you two don't get along.

735
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,396
He's the one who put me here.

736
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,689
There's nothing to like.

737
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,403
I can make him suffer for you.

738
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,616
Tell me how to hurt him.

739
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,453
Just kill that bastard.

740
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,041
-I'm sorry. I can't do that.
-Then it's no use.

741
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,127
Nothing ever hurts him.

742
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,379
I even stabbed him once.

743
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:48,138
He didn't even moan.
He's a determined little brat.

744
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,142
I'll be back.

745
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,062
Today was just for an introduction.

746
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,230
Are you sure…

747
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,984
you're confident enough to
make him suffer in agony?

748
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,328
He came at my throat first.

749
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,540
I can't let him get away with that.

750
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,379
Look into Ji-hyeok's heart.

751
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,215
You'll see someone there.

752
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,467
His mom.

753
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,597
Someone who died
because of a pathetic son.

754
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,057
Ji-hyeok's mom.

755
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,478
I couldn't check up on you these days.

756
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,231
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

757
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,608
No need to be sorry.

758
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,944
I am always grateful to you.

759
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,615
Hui-ju talked about you from time to time.

760
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,952
That you were
heartbroken over your daughter.

761
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,914
She felt bad that she couldn't help you.

762
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,376
The hair on top is too long.

763
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,795
Shall I cut it?

764
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,839
Hui-ju was trying to help you, right?

765
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,259
Is that why she showed you the video?

766
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,306
I will help you instead of Hui-ju.

767
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,558
I will bring your daughter back to you.

768
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,310
Is that even…

769
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,521
possible?

770
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,690
If we can stop Cheon Sang-woo
from interfering,

771
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,191
it's more than possible.

772
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,360
That man…

773
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,905
has no right to be a father.

774
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,533
What do you…

775
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,036
want me to do?

776
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,248
All you need to do is tell me something

777
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,168
that only you, Hui-ju,
and Cheon Sang-woo knew.

778
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,933
VOICE RECORDING

779
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,086
Show this to Cheon Sang-woo.

780
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,757
Tell him that you will release this
if he doesn't give your daughter back.

781
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,967
Hui-ju…

782
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,719
When I think about how you suffered,

783
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,639
I want to take it to the police myself.

784
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,184
But the baby comes first.

785
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,603
No.

786
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,856
You don't know how scary he is.

787
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,484
I can't do it.

788
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,946
He won't let me live.

789
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,740
I can't.

790
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,034
I'm scared.

791
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,495
Tell him I have it.

792
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,666
If something happens to you,
I'll take it to the police right away.

793
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,544
That will keep you and your baby safe.

794
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,380
Hui-ju…

795
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,215
I want to meet Su-yeon too.

796
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,344
I bet she's pretty like her mom.

797
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,191
Hui-ju…

798
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,488
I'm sorry.

799
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,201
I'm sorry.

800
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,541
Is this your dad?

801
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,128
He looks like a good person.

802
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,757
I had him kept in my heart for too long.

803
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,800
Now I'm going to let him stay beside me.

804
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,511
I'm sure your dad would like that too.

805
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,223
Hui-ju is such a beautiful person.

806
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,058
Yes.

807
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,102
She had beautiful eyes.

808
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,106
I felt so peaceful looking into her eyes.

809
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,066
Wow.

810
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,737
Your painting is so good.
It looks like he's smiling at you.

811
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,863
Look.

812
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,408
He always smiled when he looked at me.

813
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,061
Won't you have a drink?

814
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,022
No, thank you.
I have to go back to the station.

815
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,526
That's too bad.

816
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,826
Do you have something--

817
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,118
You and I…

818
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,372
don't you think we have a lot in common?

819
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,543
You have sadness in your eyes.

820
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,796
Maybe you were as sad as I was.

821
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,509
My mom died.

822
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,846
Because of me.

823
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,100
It's been haunting me ever since.

824
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,310
I can never forget it.

825
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,440
The face she made looking at me

826
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,235
before she died.

827
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,949
She looked like she was blaming me.

828
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,201
Saying, "I'm dying because of you."

829
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,578
Why are you…

830
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,123
telling me this?

831
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,000
I told you.

832
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,670
I saw the same sadness in your eyes.

833
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,046
Did you…

834
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,719
find something on me?

835
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,761
No.

836
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,098
I was just talking about myself.

837
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,850
I know nothing about you.

838
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,236
I must be too drunk.

839
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,739
I'm sorry,

840
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,868
but please pretend
you didn't hear what I just said.

841
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,371
It's embarrassing.

842
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,800
You will start to fall for Ji-hyeok.

843
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,013
Your heart races
when you meet someone like yourself.

844
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,392
Just like my heart raced
when I first saw you.

845
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,485
Cheers.

846
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,362
Nice to meet you, Ji-hyeok.

847
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,986
The door is open.

848
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,307

TJ

850
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,877
We're almost there.

851
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,629
Cheon Sang-woo will be arrested soon.

852
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,757
On what charges?

853
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,468
Soliciting to murder Jung Hui-ju.

854
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,845
When?

855
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,681
I need to confirm with someone.

856
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,933
Even if that person doesn't talk,

857
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,603
there's enough material to convict him.

858
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,773
Nice work, Mr. Prosecutor.

859
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,695
I will have to testify
to the police in person.

860
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,781
I have to admit

861
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,325
that I tampered with the evidence
of the assault two years ago.

862
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,410
That's the only way

863
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,954
that the murder makes sense.

864
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,332
What do I have to do?

865
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,541
You…

866
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,587
knew nothing.

867
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,131
Nothing.

868
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,054
Thank you.

869

MICHAEL CHA

870
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,208
Are you back?

871
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,385
I didn't kill Jung Hui-ju.

872
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,930
I talked to your lawyer.

873
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,850
He's thinking of three to four years.

874
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,560
That's not bad.

875
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,105
Recently, a close friend of mine
joined a private practice,

876
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,816
fresh out of the prosecutor's office.

877
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,319
If he takes your case,
you'll be off with just probation.

878
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,740
On the day Jung Hui-ju was killed,

879
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,910
what were you doing?

880
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,538
I told you I didn't kill her.

881
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,333
I reviewed the evidence
submitted by Incheon Seobu Police.

882
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,629
They want disposal of a dead body.
Maybe even murder and disposal.

883
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,299
The prosecutor agrees with me.

884
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,593
The evidence is clear.

885
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,847
If it goes to trial,
a conviction is likely.

886
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,435
The sentence will be,
more years than life.

887
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,732
The outcome depends on me.

888
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,859
I will ask you again.

889
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,445
On the day Jung Hui-ju was killed,

890
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,823
what were you doing?

891
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,623
If I can get probation,

892
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,335
that means I can get
an acquittal too, right?

893
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,879
If your testimony checks out,

894
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,423
it's not impossible.

895
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,468
You want the facts?

896
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,017
Let me start with the surest fact.

897
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,646
The one who killed Jung Hui-ju,

898
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,191
is not me.

899
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,069
Then who?

900
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,031
I don't know that.

901
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,286
Why should I believe you?

902
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,668
Good evening.

903
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,462
Give me the keys.

904
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,215
Wasn't I supposed to take you home?

905
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,469
I need to use Ms. Cheon's car.

906
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,096
Give them to me.

907
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,639
Yes, sir.

908
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,230
You may go.

Now it's your turn.

Do you have someone

01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,197
that comes to mind right now?

917
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,242
Who could that be?

918
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,495
I wonder.

If you were going to divorce him,

921
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,623
why did you ask me to support
Woo Tae-ho as the next leader?

922
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,667
You should've asked me
to support you from the start.

923
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,460
If I did,

924
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,423
everyone would have thought
I framed my brother for murder

925
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,882
and got my dad locked up.

926
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,513
You want them to believe
it was all Woo Tae-ho's work?

927
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:09,809
And you become the savior
for kicking him out of TJ Group.

928
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,895
Wouldn't McQueen like that plan?

929
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,859
Did your husband agree to this?

930
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:18,818
Yes.

931
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,738
Why? He has nothing to gain.

932
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,283
Aren't you glad I'm getting a divorce?

933
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,909
Now you have a chance.

934
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,036
Sorry.

935
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,831
I won't give up everything for you,
the way your husband did.

936
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,083
I married him because he's not like you.

937
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,587
So you are saying, marrying him was
also a part of your plan?

938
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,132
You were wrong back then.

939
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,677
But now, you're right.

940
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,346
So there was love, then.

941
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,482
Yes.

942
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,944
You should come to where I am.

943
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,662
I'm with someone.

944
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,081
Come, right now.

945
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,459
I had a glass of wine.

946
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,753
I think you should come.

947
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:19,962
Take a taxi.

948
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,716
Why do I have to do that?

949
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,010
You'll know when you come.

950
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,679
Right now…

951
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,894
I'm where your mom used to live.

952
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,129
What is it?

953
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,680
On that day,

954
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,351
why were you here?

955
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,022
Yes.

956
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,316
Yes, I will.

957
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,818
We will search again.

958
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,570
Yes.

959
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,284
Will the prosecutor
make an additional indictment?

960
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,202
He says it's too soon to say.

961
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,455
What is his reason?

962
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,957
There's no motive.

963
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,042
There's not enough reason
to order a murder.

964
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,168
But…

965
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,838
He kept asking for more investigation

966
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,507
on Cheon Sang-woo, not Woo Tae-ho.

967

01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,357
I will come to the station.

972
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,067
What is this about?

973
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,653
I need to talk to you
about Jung Hui-ju's murder.

974
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:12,158
I will tell you more at the station.
I'll see you soon.

975
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,387
Don't think about doing anything.

976
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,473
Nothing has changed.

977
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,725
You know…

978
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,978
nothing about this case.

979
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:52,573
I think Woo Tae-ho found
an important clue.

980
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,952
He found evidence that proves
Cheon Sang-woo is the culprit?

981
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:57,828
What if we're wrong?

982
01:05:58,704 --> 01:05:59,789
He'll turn himself in?

983
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,432
Let's think about this again.

984
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,935
We are rushing into this.

985
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,146
This is our best option.

986
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,985
Please listen to me this time.

987
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,363
I'll take care of it.

988
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,085
I'm sorry.

989
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,218
I can't trust you.

990
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,037
VICE-CHAIRMAN CHEON SANG-WOO

991
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,623
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM YOU CAN START AGAIN

992
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,257
She will turn Woo Tae-ho's death
into suicide

993
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,092
and blame it on the detectives in charge.

994
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,802
Why are you obsessed with this case?

995
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,971
It's as if your life depends on it.

996
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,556
Looks like Gi Dong-jae will be released.

997
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,309
You can't catch all the bad guys.

998
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,227
How dare you mess with my guys?

999
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,729
Why were you the last one?

1000
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,190
You came to my store
to check out Hui-ju, didn't you?

1001
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,817
What the hell are you talking about?

1002
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,654
She truly feels that she could end up
dying like Woo Tae-ho.

1003
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,239
You took something out of the safe, right?

1004
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:46,408
"You can't find the evidence
that I killed them." Is that it?

1005
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:47,910
Do you think you can?

1006
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:54,416
