00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,643
MURDER OF YOON JI-SEON AND JANG JIN-SU
LEE DAE-CHEOL'S INTERROGATION REPORT

2
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,520
INCHEON SEOBU POLICE STATION

3
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,289
Sir.

4
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,500
Detective Kang.

5
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,878
I heard about you while I was
in the detention house.

6
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,799
Everyone said you are nice
and warm-hearted.

7
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,592
It's a relief

8
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,304
that someone like you took my case.

9
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,807
I was very glad to hear that.

10
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,433
Cut the nonsense

11
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,852
and just answer my questions honestly.

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,479
Of course I will.

13
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,272
I will answer
all your questions truthfully.

14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,691
I swear on my daughter

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,693
that I will never lie.

16
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,852
I don't think we need to worry
about the witness.

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,314
We just need to work on
the police's side of the story.

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,362
Here.

19
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,952
I've already looked over this.

20
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,998
I know. I just added my comments there.

21
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,426
I was at the courier office at that time.

22
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,636
You can go ask them. It's true.

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,138
How many people were there?

24
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,849
-I believed Nam Guk-hyeon
-How long were you there?

25
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,143
when he said he'd checked
the CCTV footage at the office.

26
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,521
I should've gone there
and checked it myself.

27
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,443
Why would I carry around a knife with me?
What for?

28
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:19,282
I only have this small knife
to cut packages open.

29
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,535
That is not the knife I carry with me.

30
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,038
I only treated it as a premeditated crime.

31
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,164
I just…

32
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:30,960
I should've checked the possibility
of it being an accidental crime.

33
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,423
Are you saying that I raped and killed

34
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,008
a person in the delivery truck?

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,011
I have to return the truck
around that time.

36
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,597
If I don't, it will be recorded
at the company.

37
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,934
I checked with the company over the phone

38
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,854
and led them to say what I wanted to hear.

39
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,527
Since I started living with Eun-hye,
I've never even spat in the street.

40
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,822
Because I'm too embarrassed about my past.

41
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,074
How would someone like me

42
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,619
kill two people?

43
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,831
Do you think I could face my daughter
after doing such a thing?

44
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,211
I'm afraid that I might slip back
into my bad habits,

45
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,505
so I always look at Eun-hye's photos
on my phone.

46
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,176
"Eun-hye is always watching me."

47
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,139
Whenever I look at my phone,
I feel grateful.

48
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,226
"Thank you for being my daughter."

49
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,274
I say that hundreds and thousands of
times a day whenever I look at her photo.

50
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,652
It wasn't me.

51
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,989
It wasn't me.

52
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,615
I…

53
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,659
I'm not…

54
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,620
I'm not that kind of a father to Eun-hye.

55
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,417
I'm not such a horrible father.

56
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,878
-I'm sure I saw Lee Dae-cheol's
-Detective Kang.

57
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,672
sincere heart at that moment.

58
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,966
-But…
-Please, Detective Kang.

59
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,343
I got rid of that thought on purpose.

60
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,513
Just because I'm supposed to break
a case only with evidence.

61
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,102
-Detective Kang.
-Yes?

62
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm afraid

63
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,814
this wouldn't help much with the trial.

64
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,399
This is too subjective.

65
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,401
I know. Still…

66
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,987
It might be taken into consideration.

67
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,074
At least there's one thing
that's been confirmed.

68
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:26,993
Detective Kang,

69
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,872
the person who arrested Lee Dae-cheol,

70
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,125
is confident that he's innocent.

71
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,377
Truly.

72
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,047
All right, then.

73
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,884
Now, we're ready to win.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,525
You can get your hopes up now.

75
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,365
-Mr. So.
-Yes?

76
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,366
Please…

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,994
let me die quietly.

78
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,372
What?

79
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,638
-We scored.
-Over here.

80
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,307
Hey, move over. Darn it.

81
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,757
Eun-hye.

82
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,935
-Pull over for a moment.
-Why?

83
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,729
Just stop the car.
I want to get some fresh air.

84
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm not feeling good.

85
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,192
Maybe I ate something bad earlier.

86
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,758
You're feeling uncomfortable.

87
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,052
And you're feeling bad.

88
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,180
Why would I feel bad?

89
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,557
What else am I supposed to do?

90
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,393
I've done everything I can.

91
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,103
I can go see him by myself.

92
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,982
Give me a moment. I'm just feeling sick.

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,587
When did it start?

94
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,089
What?

95
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,675
When did you start thinking I'm innocent?

96
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,595
You were closing in on me back then.

97
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,972
Well, the thing is…

98
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,434
Mr. Lee Dae-cheol.
You seem to be mistaken.

99
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,603
We are not certain that you're innocent.

100
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,482
It's just that
new evidence has been found.

101
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,110
And as detectives, we think
the evidence is probable enough.

102
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,820
So we're reinvestigating the case.

103
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:54,450
If the evidence fails to prove
that you're innocent during the retrial,

104
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,370
we'll readily accept the verdict.

105
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
Right. We will.

106
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,711
But we are going to do everything we can.

107
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,340
We will find all the evidence we can.

108
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,925
That's enough. Forget it.

109
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,512
Why are you refusing a retrial?

110
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,389
I won't blame you, so stop.

111
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:22,728
I've killed you and the other detectives
in my dreams thousands of times.

112
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,646
So…

113
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,108
That's enough.

114
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,279
Just go. Don't say anything.

115
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,155
We see Eun-hye quite often.

116
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,492
Your daughter, Lee Eun-hye.

117
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,414
Don't worry. Detective Kang is
taking good care of her.

118
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,250
Dae-cheol.

119
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,753
Shouldn't you see your daughter
a bit longer?

120
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,883
I can't promise
that I'll get you released.

121
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,805
But I can at least
get you a reduced sentence.

122
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,309
Then you can live and see Eun-hye.

123
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,560
Why?

124
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,980
Why did you get my daughter involved? Why?

125
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,317
It's you. It's because of you, right?

126
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,279
My daughter is suffering on the streets
because of you, isn't she?

127
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,197
-What are you doing?
-Just tell me!

128
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,658
Why did Eun-hye end up
like that, you jerk?

129
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,704
Why are you doing this to me?

130
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,748
Just kill me.

131
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,832
Why?

132
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,419
Eun-hye asked me for help.

133
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,547
She asked me to save you.

134
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,055
Just live.

135
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,850
For your daughter.

136
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,311
You must stay alive, Lee Dae-cheol.

137
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,733
Let go of him.

138
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,235
It's okay. We will take care of him.

139
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,370
Have you heard anything
about Eun-hye recently?

140
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,916
Who told you that Eun-hye isn't
in good condition right now?

141
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,462
No one.

142
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,257
I was just worried about her.

143
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,344
-Dae-cheol.
-Don't ask anything.

144
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,514
Don't try to do anything for me.

145
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,195
Detective Kang.

146
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,073
What? Why?

147
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,953
Please do me one favor.

148
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
What is it?

149
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,457
When Eun-hye gets married,

150
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,461
walk her

151
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,631
down the aisle for me.

152
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,469
Then

153
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,264
you would have done all you need to do.

154
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,945
I guess it's because of Eun-hye.

155
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,162
Do you know Oh Jong-tae?

156
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,913
Yes, I do.

157
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:32,126
Oh Jong-tae was permitted to start
a REIT six months ago.

158
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,086
Are you aware of that too?

159
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,464
Well, I know that.

160
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,842
REITs are like a goose that lays
the golden eggs.

161
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,888
And Oh Jong-tae, who is known
to have no experience in finance,

162
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,974
is the only one to be permitted
to start a REIT in Incheon.

163
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,059
Who do you think is behind it?

164
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,812
Is it because he lives
in your constituency?

165
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,565
I used to be a legal professional,

166
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,484
so I don't know much about finance

167
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,110
or anyone in the field.

168
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,572
The head of the Financial Services
Commission, Keum Jang-ho.

169
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,741
He was your fellow student activist,
wasn't he?

170
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,743
During the military regime,

171
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,536
you went through thick and thin together.

172
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,707
That's just a coincidence.

173
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,417
Yes.

174
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,294
Okay.

175
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,097
As expected,

176
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,684
they mentioned you at the hearing about
permission for Jeil Investment Trust.

177
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,397
The chairman of the Legislation and
Judiciary Committee ordered you to come.

178
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,483
What should I do then?

179
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,236
Should I flee or something?

180
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,737
No.

181
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,907
You can just refuse to go.
It's not mandatory.

182
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,494
Just pay some fine later.

183
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,334
The law can be very scary for those
who don't know much about it.

184
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,588
But that's not the case
for those who are well-versed.

185
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,842
Did the police ever come to see you

186
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,512
regarding something other than this?

187
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,974
They did.

188
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,018
Does it have something to do
with Lee Dae-cheol?

189
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,395
Yes.

190
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:19,483
Have they found any evidence
that would make them suspect you?

191
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,402
I might be summoned

192
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,404
to Lee Dae-cheol's retrial.

193
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,949
There was a circumstance
that made me look pretty suspicious.

194
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,660
But I won't ever be going to court.

195
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,830
Right?

196
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,762
If we keep letting Oh Jong-tae
have his way,

197
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,557
he'll try to wrap us around his finger.

198
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,392
We have no other choice for now.

199
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,060
It's important to keep his mouth shut.

200
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,149
There must be something
we can tackle him with.

201
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,317
Find out what it is.

202
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,488
I'm going to crush him
as soon as the hearing is over.

203
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,160
Of course.

204
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,759
Did you

205
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,178
go to see your dad recently?

206
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,097
I checked the visitors' register.

207
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,142
Did you go to see him often?

208
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,229
Then you must have seen him
for the first time in five years.

209
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,900
He must be worried about you.

210
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,986
His grown-up daughter would collapse
in the street from time to time.

211
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,448
Who wouldn't worry?

212
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,533
He doesn't know about that.

213
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,911
How would he know when I didn't tell him?

214
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,329
He knows.

215
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,748
How?

216
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,667
How does he know that?

217
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,460
That's my point, exactly.

218
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
How do you think he found out?

219
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,216
WITNESS

220
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,469
I heard you refused to testify at first.

221
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,680
What made you change your mind?

222
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,556
Someone told me

223
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,643
that I would just have to pay a fine
even if I didn't come.

224
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,978
-What?
-That's ridiculous.

225
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,356
But it turns out
that the fine is pretty huge.

226
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,650
What is he talking about?

227
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,403
What is your relationship
with Candidate Yoo Jeong-ryeol?

228
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,737
Candidate Yoo says

229
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,032
he met your late father often,

230
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,451
but he's never met you.

231
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
As far as I remember,

232
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,043
I saw him a few times at a golf course.

233
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,129
And a few times at a bar as well.

234
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,214
This is unbelievable.

235
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,717
-Keep quiet.
-What does that mean?

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,388
All right. So it means Candidate Yoo
perjured himself, right?

237
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,974
-What are you talking about?
-He can't be telling the truth.

238
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,892
He might not remember it.

239
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,562
There are many people
who follow him around.

240
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,023
-What is he saying?
-Are you kidding me?

241
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,463
I once collapsed
because of the jerk, Park Hong-du.

242
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,216
He knows what happens
when I get pissed off.

243
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,010
That scumbag.

244
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,345
This is amazing.

245
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,344
Who is it?

246
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,059
Who is it?

247
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,772
What's this? What kind of jerk did this?

248
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,609
Hey, you can't rip this off.

249
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,696
That's obstruction of justice.

250
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,084
What is this about? What did I do…

251
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,255
Get up.

252
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,300
Get up.

253
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,515
Hey.

254
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,893
You did something wrong, right?

255
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,688
You did something wrong.

256
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,940
Hey.

257
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,609
-You did something wrong, right?
-Yes.

258
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,735
What did you do?

259
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,904
This and that.

260
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,163
That doesn't sound sincere.

261
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,206
Tell me what you did wrong in detail.

262
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,541
Damn it!

263
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,460
It's not like the 80s anymore.

264
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,753
You can't beat me up like this.

265
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,631
Why don't you just kill me?
Go ahead and kill me.

266
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,598
Okay. All right.

267
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,935
Let's go to the station.
I'll tell you at the police station.

268
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,645
-Why would we go there?
-What?

269
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,272
Did you not see the police line earlier?

270
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,815
This is a crime scene.

271
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,276
The body was found

272
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,778
at 12:40 p.m. on January 8.

273
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,699
Cause of death is excessive bleeding
and severe brain damage.

274
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,285
Found by Detective Oh Ji-hyeok
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

275
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,956
He found the body while investigating
a juvenile prostitution case.

276
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,375
Are you kidding me?

277
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,213
This is how detectives kid around.

278
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,470
Sit.

279
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,350
Your late father, Chairman Oh Jeong-su
took care of all the business permits?

280
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,352
Yes.

281
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,229
-Gosh.
-What is he talking about?

282
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,898
Then why did you meet
with Candidate Yoo Jeong-ryeol?

283
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,025
You must've met him
to ask him for a favor.

284
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,736
And Candidate Yoo
did you a favor in the end.

285
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,029
You should admit it!1

286
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,952
To be honest,
it was to ask him for a favor. Yes.

287
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,537
-See? I told you so.
-I knew it.

288
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,206
-Unacceptable.
-What is he talking about?

289
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,750
But he gave a flat refusal.

290
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,754
That made me
prepare things more carefully.

291
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,173
So he did help me in a way.

292
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,676
I had to rely on my ability
instead of my connections.

293
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,802
All right.

294
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,763
The leading financial companies
in the country gave up on the business.

295
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,766
And Incheon Jeil Investment Trust
was given permission

296
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,893
when it had no experience in the field.

297
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,854
Do you think it's something
you can do with your ability alone?

298
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,022
As I've told you,

299
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,693
my father laid most of the groundwork.

300
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,027
If any stage

301
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,073
of the process
turns out to be unjustified,

302
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,825
I will give up

303
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,621
on all of my businesses.

304
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,915
-Did you not hear him?
-That's impossible.

305
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,001
Can you take responsibility
for what you just said?

306
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,752
Keep quiet!

307
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,381
What do you think you're doing?

308
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,805
He must have evidence.
He's threatening us with it.

309
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,267
I know more about the law than he does.

310
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,812
And even Oh Jong-tae knows
that some papers can't be

311
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,355
enough evidence.

312
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,024
And?

313
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,651
If he suddenly announces

314
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,656
that he will give up on his REIT
and all the profits

315
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,200
as he said earlier,

316
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,329
he will be able to corner me
even without any evidence.

317
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,915
I believed that Oh Jong-tae
would cooperate with us

318
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,542
to protect his interests.

319
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,004
But he just stabbed me in the back today.

320
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,467
What he wants to protect isn't money.

321
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,386
What would it be?

322
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,681
I'll look into it.

323
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,023
Regarding this cabinet
confirmation hearing

324
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,275
held by the National Assembly,

325
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,861
I will give testimony according to the Act

326
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,781
on Testimony and Appraisal
before the National Assembly,

327
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,574
Article 7…

328
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,370
CONFIRMATION HEARING
FOR CANDIDATE YOO JEONG-RYEOL

329
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,666
Ms. Jin.

330
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,544
-Yes, Mr. Yoo.
-We need to talk.

331
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,765
Weren't you the first one to find out
about Lee Dae-cheol's case?

332
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,727
Did Jung Gi-mun from JBC beat you to it?

333
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,563
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,858
I was working on my article,
and the news broke out.

335
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,696
Then you have to make
an exclusive report now.

336
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,616
Tell me once you find evidence
that Oh Jong-tae is the killer.

337
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,952
-But…
-Why?

338
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,329
Is this about Oh Jong-tae
attending the hearing?

339
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,040
Isn't that what the public would like?

340
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,377
The witness at the hearing
for a minister candidate

341
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,712
turns out to be a killer
who murdered two people.

342
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,341
The real culprit of the case
with an execution order.

343
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,011
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead and cover it

344
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,013
before someone else reports it.

345
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,558
Okay.

346
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,854
Do you still think I'm the culprit?

347
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,981
You're just on the list of suspects.

348
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,316
It's not like we concluded
that you're the culprit.

349
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,319
What should I do to get off the list?

350
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,946
Don't do anything.

351
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,157
If you don't do anything,
I won't do anything either.

352
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,204
Don't hurt the girl.

353
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,836
Gosh, who do you think I am?

354
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,380
Do you know what I regret the most?

355
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,174
I didn't do anything

356
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,634
and turned a blind eye

357
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,554
when you did bad things
when we were young.

358
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,099
I should have stopped you
even if I had to beat you.

359
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,061
Then you wouldn't have ended up like this.

360
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm not sure.

361
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,653
But it's true that I've become a bastard

362
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,781
because of you.

363
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,578
The girl who got me this painting
told me this.

364
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,580
My face shows

365
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,959
bitter hatred toward someone.

366
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,713
I was sad when I heard about her death.

367
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,926
She was the only person
who ever understood me.

368
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,186
SEOBU POLICE STATION

369
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,229
So Jae-seop?

370
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,857
Yes. He's taken a lot of our cases.

371
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,193
Right. I remember him.

372
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,279
When the tax office head's son
got involved in an assault case,

373
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,865
he defended the suspect
and had the case dropped.

374
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,908
Right.

375
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,203
Do you remember who was
in charge of the case?

376
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
-Was it Kang Do-Chang?
-Most of the cases

377
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,000
Mr. So took on were from Kang Do-chang.

378
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,503
And he's the lawyer
who requested Lee Dae-cheol's retrial.

379
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,381
Kang Do-chang is behind all this.

380
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,806
Park Hong-du filmed this,

381
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,058
and Jo Seong-dae took it from him?

382
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,395
Yes. And Oh Jong-tae is
behind Jo Seong-dae.

383
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,982
Those bastards.

384
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,277
What should we do?

385
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,697
If we tell Dae-cheol that a bigwig
like Oh Jong-tae is behind this,

386
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,992
Dae-cheol won't want to go to court.

387
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,368
Detective Kang.

388
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,329
Oh, hello.

389
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,251
Hello.

390
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,335
What brings you here?

391
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,299
Detective Kang, you said you were sure

392
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,719
that Lee Dae-cheol was the one
who killed my husband.

393
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,429
Well, I did.

394
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,724
Then why will there be a retrial for him?

395
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,268
So the thing is…

396
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,813
If he turns out to be innocent,

397
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,274
will he get released?

398
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,444
That will be decided by the court.

399
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,698
My husband

400
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,242
was a good detective.

401
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,871
Sure. I'm well aware of that.

402
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,081
But for my family,

403
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,835
he was a bad husband and a bad father.

404
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,880
He shouldn't have died just like that.

405
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,551
To be honest with you,

406
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:22,223
who killed him doesn't
even matter to my family.

407
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,642
The future

408
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,021
of my daughter and myself
is more important to me.

409
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,106
I understand.

410
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,443
They concluded that my husband
died in the line of duty.

411
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,948
That's the last gift we got from him.

412
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,744
But if Lee Dae-cheol gets released,

413
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,832
the decision might get revoked.

414
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,959
If that happens,

415
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,297
I will hate my husband
for the rest of my life.

416
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,758
Because he wouldn't have done

417
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,345
anything for us even after his death.

418
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,815
I'll be counting on you, Detective Kang.

419
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,483
Sure. Please take care.

420
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,029
-Detectives.
-Hey.

421
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,324
How could you feign ignorance like that?

422
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,368
You should buy me a drink
to celebrate the retrial…

423
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,452
-Not now.
-Why?

424
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,497
Well…

425
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:29,958
So…

426
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,544
Don't tell me you did…

427
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,672
Jin-su was murdered by the killer.

428
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,424
He did die in the line of duty.

429
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,844
What if Lee Dae-cheol is proven innocent,

430
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,637
and you fail to find the real killer?

431
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,391
No one will know why my husband died.

432
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,559
Will you watch your mouth?

433
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,978
I'm going to catch the real culprit.

434
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,689
Can't you just let him get executed

435
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,483
as decided by the court?

436
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,068
Jin-su would want this too.

437
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,740
He would want us to catch
the real culprit up there.

438
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,158
Because Jang Jin-su

439
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,827
was a real detective.

440
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,456
So what if he was a detective?

441
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,460
Would he want to remain as a detective

442
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,920
even after death?

443
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,715
Is it that important?

444
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,178
Slow down.

445
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,180
Do you want me to slow down?

446
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,602
You can't let him drink
all of it by himself.

447
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,437
You should drink too.

448
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,981
He can't slow down
unless you keep pace with him.

449
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,274
I'll die if I drink.

450
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,218
Yes.

451
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,346
I told Detective Kang

452
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,182
that they might not acknowledge
that Jin-su died in the line of duty.

453
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,976
-But…
-Don't think about anything else.

454
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,644
They've already decided.

455
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,146
Isn't it time for Hyeon-ju's class to end?

456
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,356
You should go pick her up.

457
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,734
Call me when you get back.

458
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,365
Captain Nam, I let everyone out.
No one's in there.

459
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,449
Okay. Thanks.

460
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,160
You can take tomorrow off.
I'll see you the next day.

461
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,829
Thank you, sir. Salute!

462
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,345
Let's go for another round.

463
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm not drunk.

464
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,308
-Excuse me.
-Ji-hyeok. Ji-hyeok!

465
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,894
-Gosh, Detective Kang.
-I love you.

466
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,103
-Just go.
-Do you love me?

467
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,772
Detective Kang, get in the taxi.

468
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,608
Go straight home. Don't go anywhere else.

469
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,444
I love you, Detective Oh!

470
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,695
Don't go anywhere else.

471
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,241
-That moron.
-What a moron.

472
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,744
What? Jinx!

473
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,954
Jinx again.

474
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,415
You should get going too.

475
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,000
After I see you off.

476
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,877
I need to drink some more by myself.

477
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,255
Detective Kang drank so much
that I don't think I got to drink any.

478
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,215
I'll go with you then.

479
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,301
Why would I do that with someone
who will die if he drinks?

480
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,678
I like to watch others drink.

481
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,846
Forget it. Bye.

482
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,890
I also like to pay
for someone else's drink.

483
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,769
Really?

484
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,281
All right. I'll have
another bottle of this.

485
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,908
No.

486
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,411
Why? Are you regretting it now?

487
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,871
-Get her the 25-year-old one instead.
-Okay.

488
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,289
This will make you less hungover.

489
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,210
You don't even drink.
What do you know about drinks?

490
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,213
Thank you.

491
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,176
You know Jong-tae was at
the cabinet confirmation hearing, right?

492
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,930
When Yoo Jeong-seok met with Jong-tae…

493
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,809
Oh Jong-tae is Candidate Yoo Jeong-ryeol's
Achilles' heel.

494
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,228
They tried to get their stories straight
before the hearing.

495
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,358
Does Mr. Yoo know that we think
Jong-tae is the real culprit?

496
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,569
Yes. I told him.

497
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,320
And is he okay with that?

498
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,119
Did you find anything else
to prove that Oh Jong-tae is the culprit?

499
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,539
Why? Did Mr. Yoo ask you to find out?

500
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,499
He'd want to protect Jong-tae.

501
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,045
I mean, it's his brother,
the next Minister of Justice.

502
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,765
He's not that kind of a guy.

503
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,477
He would fulfill his duty
as a reporter no matter what.

504
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,313
-He'd never do that.
-Really?

505
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,732
Is that what you believe?

506
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,655
What's going on? Why does it feel like
I'm being interrogated?

507
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,576
You're trying to make me get drunk
and pour out my heart, right?

508
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,788
It's a lie that you will die if you drink,
isn't it?

509
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,923
What are you doing?

510
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,308
So it's a lie.

511
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,352
You seem fine.

512
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,357
He passed out all of a sudden.

513
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,317
Is he unconscious now?

514
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,945
What do I do?

515
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,113
I'm sure he was breathing.

516
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,448
But he wouldn't wake up
no matter how hard I tried.

517
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,368
He just had one drink.

518
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,494
How could he suddenly…

519
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,375
What?

520
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,711
What is it? Is he really about to die?

521
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,547
His blood pressure is normal.

522
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,174
And he has no problem
with his pulse and breath.

523
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,217
So?

524
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,511
I think he's asleep.

525
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,055
What?

526
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,475
He's asleep?

527
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:54,694
CHIEF MOON SANG-BEOM

528
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,618
3:10 A.M., NOVEMBER 3, 2015,
HANDONG LOGISTICS OFFICE

529
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,289
This CCTV footage is
what moved Kang Do-chang.

530
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,623
Who sent it?

531
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,041
-I don't know.
-Have you

532
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,461
seen this before, Detective Nam?

533
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,092
No.

534
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,053
If I had checked this back then,
things would've turned out differently.

535
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,639
Whose computer was this on?

536
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,640
Sim Dong-uk's.

537
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,312
So it means all the guys
from Team Two have shared it together.

538
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,111
You know this video can't
change the situation, right?

539
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,740
-Yes, sir.
-Let's keep it quiet then.

540
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,782
Yes, sir.

541
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,869
You may leave now.

542
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,682
This place is about a two-hour drive away
from where the body was found.

543
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,810
And he worked for another
three hours after that.

544
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,396
Considering the time
when the body was abandoned,

545
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,399
there's almost no possibility
that Lee Dae-cheol is the real killer.

546
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,403
He could be someone
who looks like Lee Dae-cheol.

547
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,614
They all look the same
in the courier uniforms.

548
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,699
I'm sure it's Lee Dae-cheol.

549
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,410
I've checked it more than a hundred times.

550
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,414
Okay.

551
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,292
I'll talk to the prosecutor in private.

552
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,461
Give me the flash drive.

553
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,092
Make sure to talk to him.

554
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,853
No.

555
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,315
Lee Dae-cheol

556
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,651
is the culprit.

557
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,947
He's the killer.

558
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,468
-Welcome.
-Hello.

559
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,679
Don't you have to drive?

560
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,639
I can call a chauffeur. Don't worry.

561
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,183
Hey, Park Dong-cheol.

562
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,269
You scumbag.

563
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,354
What are you doing?

564
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,064
Let's just go.

565
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,649
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-Just go.

566
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,609
Do-chang, it's been a while.

567
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,446
"It's been a while"? Are you kidding me?

568
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,281
She's my sister.

569
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,367
How dare you try to hit on her, you idiot?

570
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,453
Gosh, please stop it.

571
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,912
Dong-cheol, just go.

572
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,748
-Go.
-Let go of me!

573
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,166
-My goodness.
-Hey!

574
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,710
Do you not know him? He's a thug.

575
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,672
Why would you hang out
with a scumbag like him?

576
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,924
Will you watch your mouth?

577
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,010
-You're drunk.
-Gosh.

578
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,136
-Just go.
-Call me later.

579
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,346
Let's eat together sometime.

580
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,430
-Hey!
-Gosh.

581
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,182
-Stop right there!
-Hey.

582
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,391
-Gosh.
-Let go of me!

583
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,360
You. Stop right there.

584
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,278
Get out.

585
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,866
You… You're under arrest.

586
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,495
Get out of the car, you idiot!

587
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,455
-Stop it.
-Hey!

588
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,332
I'm going to arrest you.

589
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,793
Dong-cheol, I'm sorry. Just go.

590
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,836
Get out of the car!

591
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:45,883
I'm a police officer.
Do you think I'm a joke?

592
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,135
Stop it! You're embarrassing me!

593
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,678
-What's going on?
-Hey.

594
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:55,226
Have you been fooling around
with that scumbag?

595
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,062
Just because you're divorced

596
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,856
doesn't mean you can date around
like that.

597
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,733
You little…

598
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,196
-My goodness.
-Oh, no. Is he all right?

599
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,615
-What should we do?
-Is he hurt?

600
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,951
My gosh. Is he all right?

601
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,078
-What do we do?
-Gosh.

602
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,497
Hey, Kang Eun-hui!

603
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,333
Shame on you, you wench.

604
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,003
Your brother is a detective, okay?

605
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,090
How could you date

606
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,177
a thug of all people?

607
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,096
Weren't you a thug yourself?

608
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,099
Do you not remember

609
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,144
being a fat thug
and hanging out with Dong-cheol?

610
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,107
Dong-cheol quit being a thug.

611
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,735
He's now a successful man
who owns three buildings.

612
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,949
Look at yourself.

613
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,369
Who do you think is
living in a mess right now?

614
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,843
So what if he was a detective?

615
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,138
Would he want to remain as a detective

616
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,308
even after death?

617
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,727
Is it that important?

618
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,910
We have an emergency.

619
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,994
Please move over.

620
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,079
Please excuse us.

621
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,790
I don't think I can make it
to the meeting today.

622
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,544
Someone I know got hurt.

623
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,256
He hasn't regained his consciousness yet.

624
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,472
Actually, I can make it to the meeting.

625
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,266
Yes. I'll be right there.

626
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,937
-You're still here?
-Why did you not die?

627
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,356
I was dead, but I came back to life.

628
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,233
Are you kidding me?

629
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:08,901
Thanks.

630
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:12,279
Thanks to you, I slept without dreaming
for the first time in decades.

631
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,493
-You fell asleep for real?
-Yes.

632
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,161
Are you really human?

633
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:24,583
No, this doesn't happen to humans.

634
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,127
It happens a lot to people with insomnia.

635
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,922
Even the slightest stimulation
can make them sleep.

636
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,215
Insomnia?

637
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,218
I thought only those with busy
brain cells could have that.

638
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,512
And you rarely use yours.

639
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,765
Let's go. I'll buy you some hangover soup.

640
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,768
Why would you eat hangover soup
after one drink?

641
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,853
This is nice.

642
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,148
I feel so refreshed
after a long, restful sleep.

643
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,567
We should do this again sometime.

644
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,111
Are you out of your mind?

645
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,904
Do you like bones or sundae?

646
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,656
I like sundae. Let's eat sundae soup.

647
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,366
What is he talking about?

648
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,417
-How did this footage get leaked?
-I don't know.

649
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,377
Anyway,

650
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,213
I'm positive
that the lawyer has this video.

651
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,549
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

652
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,427
How are you handling your files?

653
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,636
Prosecutor Jung.

654
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,347
We weren't the only ones
who had the video.

655
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,101
The file was handed
to the prosecution too.

656
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,352
All right.

657
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,023
Just make sure there won't be
another leakage.

658
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,025
If we lose this case,

659
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,903
it will be the end of both your career
and mine. You know what I mean.

660
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,828
The prosecutor has been assigned
for the trial.

661
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,497
You know Prosecutor Jung Sang-il, right?

662
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,416
He was the prosecutor in charge.

663
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,503
He got passed up for a promotion
and transferred to Jeju Island. Why him?

664
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,964
The prosecution is pulling a trick.

665
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,468
They dispatched him to
the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office.

666
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,263
It shows how desperately
they are trying to win the case.

667
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,683
And the date for the trial is set too.

668
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:09,229
We've gotten things ready
for the first trial.

669
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,816
But the problem is Lee Dae-cheol.

670
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,944
Did you manage to convince him?

671
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,031
It will go well.

672
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,033
Don't worry and focus
on preparing for the trial.

673

CENTRAL CONTROL CENTER

674
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,635
The only people who recently
visited Lee Dae-cheol

675
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,762
are Eun-hye and us.

676
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,556
And he has no record of any calls.

677
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,643
I'm sure he was threatened by an insider.

678
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,240
What is this about?

679
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,035
Give me your account number and the price.

680
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,328
What price?

681
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,831
The price you were recently offered.

682
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,582
Write it down.

683
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,377
I will send the exact amount
to your account right away.

684
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,045
-What are you talking about?
-Darn it.

685
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,089
The thing you showed Lee Dae-cheol.

686
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,551
Just show us
what you exactly did, you idiot.

687
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,779
Go ahead and tell the truth.

688
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,783
I filmed the video of Eun-hye.

689
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,953
Someone paid me to film her.

690
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,330
But I didn't do anything to her.

691
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,915
She has a condition.

692
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,834
She has a seizure when she's enraged.

693
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,213
Did you make her
go into a seizure on purpose?

694
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,298
Yes.

695
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:02,092
But… Actually, I know well
about her condition.

696
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,470
She's fine once the seizure is over.

697
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,555
It's just temporary.

698
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,266
What do you think will happen
if you mess with her again?

699
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,435
I'm not crazy. I won't even go near her.

700
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,645
Never again.

701
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,117
Eun-hye's dad will go to her wedding.

DEFENSE COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

705
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,740
Witness.

706
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,827
You shared the studio
with the victim, Yoon Ji-seon, right?

707
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,746
-Yes.
-Do you remember the defendant?

708
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,708
Yes. Ji-seon and I often got
paints and painting supplies

709
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,668
delivered from overseas,

710
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,628
so we saw him often.

711
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,672
How would you describe

712
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,258
the relationship between
Yoon Ji-seon and the defendant?

713
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,802
Unlike other delivery men,

714
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,513
he did show some interest in Ji-seon.

715
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:16,351
Did something make
the defendant interested in her?

716
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,352
Yes.

SEPTEMBER 10, 2015
TWO MONTHS BEFORE MURDER

718
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,361
What do you think?
This is my daughter's painting.

719
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,614
Is she in middle school?

720
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,906
Yes. Seventh grade.

721
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,910
Isn't this amazing?

722
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,580
It really is.
She used the colors really well.

723
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,497
So is her sketching.

724
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,126
She even expressed his emotions.
This is unbelievable.

725
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,003
-She's good, isn't she?
-Yes. She's talented.

726
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,547
Gosh, no.

727
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:50,177
I want my daughter to go
to an art college like you.

728
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,804
But I don't know much about this field.

729
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,766
Should I send her to an art academy?

730
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,268
I think that would be good.

731
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,396
I see. I should send her to an academy.

732
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,525
How much does it cost?

733
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,402
It's expensive, right?

734
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,368
-Please excuse me for a second.
-Sure.

735
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,833
This is me.

736
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,461
-You look white.
-Oh, right.

737
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,633
These are for your daughter.

738
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,137
Why would you give her
those precious things?

739
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,306
These are way above her level.

740
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,310
Tell her to draw the things
in this artbook exactly the same.

741
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,355
Since she's talented,
it's better for her to teach herself.

742
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,274
Once she fills up the sketchbook,
show it to me.

743
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,734
I'll take a look at it.

744
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,739
Thank you so much.

745
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,449
Thank you.

746
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,998
Eun-hye will be really thrilled.

747
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,256
Did you tell the police about this story?

748
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,258
No. This is my first time
talking about it.

749
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:17,889
This is the interrogation report
of Lee Dae-cheol's case from the police.

750
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,725
I'll summarize it for you.

751
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,768
"While delivering packages,

752
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,354
Lee Dae-cheol fell in love with
Yoon Ji-seon in a sleeveless top.

753
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,899
So he kept coming to her drunk,
asking her to drink with him.

754
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,401
When Yoon Ji-seon refused,

755
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,529
he sneaked into her studio
and stole her underwear

756
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,114
acting like a stalker.

757
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,451
On the day of murder, he sneaked
into Yoon Ji-seon's studio,

758
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,661
took her to his delivery truck by force,

759
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,621
and tried to rape her.
When his attempt failed,

760
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,498
he choked her to death."

761
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,418
-My goodness.
-That's terrible.

762
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,587
I can't believe this.

763
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,173
Witness, what do you think of this report?

764
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,800
It was me who slept in the studio.

765
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,510
Ji-seon came from home.

766
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,554
If he stole any underwear,
that would be mine.

767
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,683
And I've never seen
Ji-seon wear a sleeveless top.

768
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,603
She had a scar on her shoulder,
so she never wore one.

769
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,939
There's another report.

770
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,984
"While delivering food,

771
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,069
he fell in love
with the victim in a sleeveless top.

772
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,572
As she refused
to drink with him every time,

773
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,199
he sneaked into her room

774
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,993
and stole her underwear
acting like a stalker.

775
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,788
On the day of murder,
he sneaked into her room

776
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,790
and tried to rape the victim and failed.

777
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,042
So he took her to his car and raped her."

778
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,211
This report is from a case

779
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,214
that happened three years before this case

780
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,300
was investigated
by the Incheon Seobu Police Station.

781
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,760
The suspect is named Kim Chi-se.

782
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,387
And he's never met
with the defendant, Lee Dae-cheol.

783
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,268
It's plagiarism.

784
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,021
The report is plagiarized.

785
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,441
Can I see both of the reports?

786
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:52,901
Yes, Your Honor.

787
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,615
Did you find it out?

788
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,369
-You didn't know back then?
-Last night,

789
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,414
I found it while going through
the cases Nam Guk-hyeon took.

790
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,918
This is a good thing about a detective
investigating other detectives.

791
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,504
"A good thing"?

792
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:17,384
I'm stabbing my colleague
in the back with a knife now.

793
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,018
This footage proves the defendant,
Lee Dae-cheol's alibi

794
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,104
for the time when the body was abandoned.

795
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,147
It's conclusive evidence.

796
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,275
But for some reason,

797
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,736
it wasn't chosen as evidence
at the trial five years ago.

798
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,994
The man in the footage is Oh Jong-tae.

799
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,412
Yoon Ji-seon painted

800
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,330
Oh Jong-tae's portrait back then.

801
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,876
Later on, they maintained
a close relationship.

802
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,627
They even went to New York together.

803
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,046
This footage proves that

804
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,799
Oh Jong-tae was in a hotel in Busan
when the body was abandoned.

805
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,551
With this footage,

806
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,304
Oh Jong-tae got excluded
from the investigation.

807
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,183
But we had this footage
examined by an expert

808
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,977
and found out

809
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,605
that the time code was fabricated

810
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,150
by filming the original video
with another camera.

811
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,448
Your Honor.

812
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,325
Yes. Go ahead.

813
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,620
Are you saying the second
CCTV footage is fabricated?

814
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,206
I can show you the report
from the KCSI if you want.

815
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,291
Okay.

816
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,670
But did you have the first footage
examined for fabrication?

817
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,010
Don't you think you're too biased?

818
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,277
Are you here to watch me
in case I mention you?

819
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,946
Don't worry. I will keep my promise.

820
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,032
Since you've started it, I hope you win.

821
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,743
Do you really mean that?

822
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:10,956
Do you think I live only for my sake,
Detective Kang?

823
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,293
I don't think I can live like you,
and I have no reason to do so.

824
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,254
But I do think

825
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,299
the police also need people like you.

826
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,635
That doesn't mean

827
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,348
you have the right to criticize
police officers like me though.

828
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:33,061
Because you just made enemies
of the police, your long-time colleagues.

829
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,619
Hello?

830
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,332
This is Oh Ji-hyeok
from Incheon Seobu Police Station.

831
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,667
I left the message.

832
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,211
Really?

833
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,879
Sergeant Choi,

834
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,717
I'm sorry but can I see you at the scene?

835
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,178
Yes. Where Oh Jong-tae was caught.

836
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,848
Okay.

837
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,684
Where Oh Jong-tae was caught?

838
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,273
NOVEMBER 3, 2015, 3:30 A.M.

839
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,826
You crossed the centerline.

840
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,745
Can I see your license?

841
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,668
-You must've been in a hurry.
-Shit.

842
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,588
What did you say?

843
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,800
What did you just say?

844
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,177
I admit that I crossed the centerline!

845
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,846
Just give me a ticket and let me go.

846
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,351
Are you drunk?

847
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,020
What?

848
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,486
The car was over there.

849
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,073
And it was making
an illegal U-turn this way.

850
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,951
What happened to Oh Jong-tae after that?

851
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,786
He was taken to the police station
for DUI.

852
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,457
Blow it.

853
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,170
Get out of the car.

854
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,673
-What about his car?
-We left it parked there.

855
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,095
I guess he came back to take it later on.

856
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,058
The place where the body was found
is about 13km away from here.

857
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,852
It's a ten-minute drive.

858
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,729
Anyway, it proves that

859
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,108
Oh Jong-tae was near the scene
on the day of murder.

860
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,234
Right.

861
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:31,239
But why did he make a U-turn

862
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,324
to go back to the scene?

863
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,330
He must've dropped something
important at the scene.

864
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,874
Like what?

865
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:56,222
LEE DAE-CHEOL'S ATTORNEY CLAIMS
THE INVESTIGATION IS FATALLY FLAWED

866
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,683
The trial is getting
a lot of attention from the public,

867
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,226
so we had to cover it to some extent.

868
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,063
Yes. I checked the article beforehand.

869
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,941
I judged that it was written objectively.

870
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,819
I'm not saying the article is wrong.

871
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:14,240
I just think it went too far.

872
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,367
It didn't mention your full name though.

873
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,911
You don't have to worry about it.

874
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,579
It'll work out fine, right?

875
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,083
As long as you don't cross the line.

876
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,669
Oh, right.

877
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,590
Congratulations. Your brother has been
appointed Minister of Justice.

878
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,927
I hope he stays in office for a long time.

879
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,845
Okay. Thank you.

880
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,858
You didn't change my article much.

881
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,788
Hello.

882
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,706
It's been a while.

883
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,501
-It's been five years, right?
-Yes.

884
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,463
I thought we were never supposed

885
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,840
to see each other again.

886
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,801
Pardon?

887
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,847
Why did you make such a mistake?

888
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,268
Why?

889
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,271
I'm sorry.

890
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,737
You recently put this up for auction
through an agent, right?

891
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,410
This is the receipt of payment
from the agent to your account.

892
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,371
It was sold at auction
for 800 million won,

893
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,789
and the commission was deducted.

894
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,836
-So?
-Where did you get this watch?

895
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,796
That's…

896
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,927
Do I have to tell you that?

897
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,096
I just sold something I had.

898
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,181
It's a watch that
a suspected murderer was wearing.

899
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,684
What?

900
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,312
It's disappeared
since the murder case five years ago.

901
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,608
Why do you think
the watch was in the hands

902
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,235
of Detective Jang's wife
when he was in charge of the case?

903
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,738
If it turns out

904
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,657
that Detective Jang pocketed
an important piece of evidence,

905
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,367
as you worried,

906
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,704
he will no longer be on the roll of honor
on suspicion of corruption.

907
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,670
You just need to tell us the truth.

908
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,881
Where did you get this watch?

909
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,342
Was it from Jin-su?

910
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,265
Who was it?

911
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,240
Move along.

912
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,160
NOVEMBER 3, 2015, 4 P.M.

913
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,537
Take a close look.

914
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,206
What else did you find?

915
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,250
-Keep looking.
-What are you doing there?

916
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,673
So did you find anything?

917
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,717
It rained so hard last night
that most stuff got swept off.

918
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,722
I'll go to the station
and check who the victim is.

919
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,849
You stay here and
search the surrounding area.

920
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,017
Okay.

921
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,146
See you.

922
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,398
Can you

923
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:19,152
testify what you just said in court?

924
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,030
Jin-su is

925
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,283
Hyeon-ju's dad.

926
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,162
You need to free him
from being falsely accused.

927
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,224
I'll do it.

928
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,435
I'll testify.

929
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,840
We have to find the evidence to prove
Lee Dae-cheol was framed for the murder.

930
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,885
I asked if you told him.
Did you tell Do-chang?

931
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,304
Who killed Detective Jang?

932
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,514
Do you remember his face?

933
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,476
What's the new evidence
that you said you'd give me?

934
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,478
Why didn't my article get published?

935
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,522
Ms. Jung Yu-seon!

936
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:38,773
The witness isn't here yet.

937
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,692
You might have to prepare for the worst.

938
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,028
I will never forgive you people.
You damn bastards

939
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,447
What can I do to help you?

940
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,658
You're the one
who's disgracing the police.

941
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,243
You little piece of trash!

942
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,120
I'm Detective Kang Do-chang
in Violent Crimes Unit Team Two,

943
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,914
at Incheon Seobu Police Station.

944
01:03:54,997 --> 01:04:00,002
