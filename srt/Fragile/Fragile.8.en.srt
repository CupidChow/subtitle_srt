1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,000
They've gone crazy.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,566
You can't stay quiet.

3
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:05,133
They'll go even wilder if you ignore them.

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,266
Did you send Ji Yu those stupid DMs?

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:10,200
Aren't you being biased
just because Do Ha's my friend?

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,100
- He went home early today.
- What?

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,533
He hasn't been doing well lately.

8
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,666
But at this point, we're both...

9
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,633
Why did you bring me here?

10
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,933
Did you two make up? Why?

11
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,233
How far did you two go?

12
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,700
Next time. When you're sober.

13
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,066
(Fragile)

14
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,933
No more candidates, right?

15
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,133
So are we going with them?

16
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,100
Me!

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,633
I have one! Basketball jerseys!

18
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,200
Class Five is already wearing it.

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,566
If these are it,
we'll go straight to voting.

20
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,033
We have to decide on one fast.

21
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,133
Do you like basketball?

22
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:46,733
No, it's not like that.

23
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,533
She's dating a guy who likes basketball.

24
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,097
Hey!

25
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,800
We'll go with a taekwondo uniform then.

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,066
Finally.

27
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,966
We're ordering them this week,

28
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,866
so check your sizes and let me know.

29
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,666
Also, we need to decide
who will participate in what.

30
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,333
You all have to participate in
at least one.

31
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,466
I don't feel like it.

32
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,466
Why not?

33
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,733
I'll get burnt.

34
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:10,966
Wear sunscreen.

35
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,800
A Ra, can you participate
in one more for me?

36
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,233
No, and I was going to
participate in everything.

37
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,433
Anyone for the race?
We need two boys and two girls.

38
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,600
- Me!
- Okay, A Ra.

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,233
Any boys? Quickly.

40
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,466
Okay.

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,900
Any more girls?

42
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,233
Hurry up. I'll take recommendations, too.

43
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,200
Ji Yu, do you want to run, too?

44
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,666
No, I want to recommend someone.

45
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,666
Who?

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,666
Han Su Jin.

47
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,500
- Su Jin?
- Yes.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,966
Su Jin is good at running.

49
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,800
She would always win races
back in middle school.

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,100
That's a relief.

51
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,066
Will you be okay with it?

52
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,500
Yes, I'm fine with it.

53
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,033
Okay then.

54
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,033
Now let's pick out for dodgeball.

(Chapter 51
Tuesday, October 22nd, 2024)

56
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,900
We need to talk.

57
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,266
About last time,

58
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,533
I didn't know Si Jung would go that far.

59
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:56,966
Me, too.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,766
I'm sorry I doubted you.

61
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,733
No. I doubted you, too.

62
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,833
Hey, Su Jin.

63
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,966
I'm really sorry.

64
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,800
About hurting you.

65
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,400
It'll sound like an excuse,

66
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,733
but I had a huge crush on Chan Seong.

67
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,533
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:43,833
It wasn't just anyone.
I shouldn't have done that to you.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,900
I get it, so you can stop.

70
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,766
I'll stop hating you,

71
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,066
so you stop being sorry to me.

72
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,500
But how did you know before?

73
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,333
About me wanting to run.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,266
I saw your fingers.

75
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
What?

76
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,566
When you're thinking about something,
you crack them.

77
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,066
Right.

(Chapter 52
Tuesday, October 22nd, 2024)

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,533
Have you thought about a phrase?

80
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,366
- Yes.
- What is it?

81
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,400
- Guess what this is.
- "Titanic?"

82
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:51,933
The free hug.

83
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,366
That's classic. What about you?

84
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,533
"Count on me, sister!"

85
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,233
"Victory for Class Three."

86
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,866
I'll upload it on my Instagram
to get more followers.

87
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,733
Will that work?

88
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:10,200
- But do I have to do this?
- Of course. You all have to.

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,633
You have to since your friend
is serious about sports day.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,566
I haven't thought of what to use.

91
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,100
- Should I recommend one?
- What?

92
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,433
"Class Five, the cuties."

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,466
- That's cute.
- Are you crazy?

94
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,100
You expect me to go with that?

95
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,433
- "Cute girl?"
- No.

96
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,433
"Cool girl?"

97
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,066
I'm not doing this.

98
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,600
Then do other things.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,366
Something like sunshades or fans.

100
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,800
Never mind. I'll find something.

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,866
I can do it.

102
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:42,866
Okay.

103
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,466
Look at them.

104
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:53,533
Are you done?

105
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,166
- You didn't forget.
- I didn't forget.

106
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,000
Do it again.

107
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:01,466
You're in Class Three, too.

108
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,833
I can't believe you came up
with something using your name.

109
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,533
Make me one with my name, too.

110
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,533
With A Ra.

111
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,700
"I know you, A Ra."

112
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,500
That's too lame for sports day.

113
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,233
You're so good.

114
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,766
- You have a knack for it.
- Really? Is it good?

115
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,533
Yes, you're good.

116
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Ye Ri, what are you doing?

117
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,166
What is that?

118
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,466
- Is it that bad?
- Yes, it is.

119
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,766
It's so hard.

120
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Give it to me.

121
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,800
- That's...
- This is a lost cause.

122
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,666
- I'll have to do what I can.
- Forget about that.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,733
- What do you think?
- It's pretty.

124
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,866

It must be a passing shower.

I guess.

Should we just use it then?

- I think he likes you.
- Stop it.

- Why?

00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:54,300
Hey, you were looking for San, right?

183
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,266
Yes.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,600
Why San? Have you messaged him?

185
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:04,366
No, I should talk to him in person.

186
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,500
Is something wrong?

187
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:19,400
Don't you think San is acting differently?

188
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,566
I can't see a big difference,

189
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,766
but something does feel different.

190
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,233
Why did you want to see me?

191
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,966
Let's get off and talk. We should get out.

192
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's just keep going.

193
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,033
What?

194
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:04,066
Let's just go to your place.

195
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,400
I'll walk you home.

196
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,400
You brought me to my home a lot.

197
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,866
I'm glad it stopped raining.

198
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,466
Yes, it must have been a shower.

199
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,700
I worried that it might rain until late.

200
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,833
You didn't bring an umbrella either?

201
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
We could just buy one.

202
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,266
It's just...

203
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,100
we might not be able to talk for long.

204
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,900
I thought about it a lot.

205
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,300
About what?

206
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:56,233
About being with you.

207
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,500
About understanding you
and resolving our issues.

208
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,166
About what to say first
and things like that.

209
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,800
It was hard.

210
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,500
- But...
- Chan Seong.

211
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:21,900
It was so hard to be with you.

212
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,833
What?

213
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:29,033
I betrayed my best friend.

214
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,866
I felt so uncomfortable.

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,166
I gave up my friend to be with you.

216
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,200
I had to ignore those feelings
to be together with you.

217
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:48,333
When you're smiling, having a good time,

218
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,166
I somewhat got annoyed
even if I was laughing with you.

219
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,266
Once I had that in my mind,
it was endless.

220
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,166
I kept doubting you and Su Jin,
and kept obsessing over it.

221
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,833
Then I think I slowly lost myself.

222
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you regret being with me?

223
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:22,033
No. I don't regret liking you.

224
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,266
But my behavior hurt someone.

225
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:36,766
And moreover,

226
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,400
I couldn't look after myself.

227
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,433
I think I know what's important to me now.

228
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,300
I...

229
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:02,866
So this is why you brought me home.

230
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,100
Let's break up.

231
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:19,800
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:28,800
Me, too.

233
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:33,933
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,833
Here you go.

235
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,400
Bye.

236
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,866
(Chapter 56
Friday, October 25th, 2024)

237
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,600
How do I look? Do I look okay?

238
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,666
Yes.

239
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,433
What's the point of asking?

240
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,800
You're dressing up for sports day.

241
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Even so...

242
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,133
- Am I cute?
- Yes.

243
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,266
You're cute.

244
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,833
- How can you be okay?
- What?

245
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,300
It didn't work out between Mi Na and San.

246
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,466
Ji Yu and Chan Seong broke up,
but she's so alive.

247
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,566
We should have fun when it's a fun day.

248
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,966
And we have you guys.

249
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,866
Eun Su, you don't seem to know.

250
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:08,666
I, Jeon Mi Na, learned so much.

251
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:10,900
I see.

252
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,933
Also...

253
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,933
Never mind. Anyway,

254
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,866
you told me to be careful
and now you want me to cry?

255
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,533
Never.

256
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,500
Here's the money.

257
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,500
Ji Yu, just stay there.

258
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,600
It's so crowded.

259
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,233
Please don't push.

260
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,066
- What?
- Do you like cats?

261
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,366
- All of a sudden?
- It's not all of a sudden.

262
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,633
I asked you on a DM before.

263
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,300
I see.

264
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,633
Why don't you read my DMs?

265
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,733
I know you can hear me.

266
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,000
Do I have to answer that now here?

267
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,466
I'd rather just answer it.

268
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,033
- Why do I have to read them?
- I'm just asking you to accept me.

269
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,866
Why do you hate me?

270
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,900
I also don't understand
why you're so interested in me.

271
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,533
I like you. Isn't that enough?

272
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,900
I'll pay for everything.

273
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,233
Thank you.

274
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,533
It's on me, so enjoy.

275
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:26,966
See you later.

276
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,266
Also, answer my DMs.

277
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,066
Are you okay?

278
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,733
Well, it's free food.

279
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,133
Let's go. The girls are waiting.

280
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Over our heads, please.

281
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,533
A little further up.

282
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,066
What are you doing?

283
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,700
Thanks.

284
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,233
- What?
- What?

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,033
Thanks.

286
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,366
So you ordered food, too.

287
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,133
Ji Yu, this must be ours.

288
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,000
They look so good together.

289
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,733
What are you talking about?

290
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:53,000
The rice cake and chicken
go together so well, right?

291
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,400
- You're right.
- Try it.

292
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,533
- They do go together so well.
- Yes.

293
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,100
I've never seen you with braids.

294
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:05,400
The girls did it for me.

295
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:12,900
It suits you.

296
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,333
Thanks.

297
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,533
My goodness.

298
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,366
- What?
- My gosh.

299
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,066
- Did you drop it?
- Do you have a tissue?

300
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,066
No.

301
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,033
- Hi.
- Hi.

302
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,700
What got on your clothes?

303
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,633
The girls and I had rice cakes.

304
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,433
Do you want to eat with us?

305
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,866
No, my stomach doesn't feel good.

306
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,600
Are you nervous?

307
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,333
What?

308
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,033
Good luck at the race.

309
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,233
Are you going to root for me?

310
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,200
Of course.

311
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,666
Sorry.

312
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,800
I'm okay.

313
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,066
Nice shot.

314
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,133
Let's go, Class Three!

315
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
- Class Three!
- Let's go!

316
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Class Three!

317
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:01,466
- Let's go!
- Class Three, let's go!

318
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:02,966
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

319
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,998
- Hey!
- San!

320
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,033
Are you okay?

321
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,500
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay? Where does it hurt?

322
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This is bad.

323
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,066
- This is bad.
- He must be hurting.

324
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,233
Be careful.

325
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:23,200
This is bad.

326
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,933
- He needs to see the nurse.
- Are you okay?

327
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:28,666
(Nurse's Office)

328
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,366
- What's going on these days?
- What?

329
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,100
What's with you?
Look at your handsome face.

330
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,200
You're completely out of it.

331
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,466
Why would you get pushed by that?

332
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,566
It's nothing.

333
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,266
Is it because of Mi Na?

334
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,333
What?

335
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,800
You must have liked her a lot.

336
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:00,466
Is it hard because it's not working out?

337
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,133
Is this a post-breakup breakdown?

338
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,800
Shouldn't I be getting it?
I broke up with Ji Yu.

339
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,200
Stop it. It's not that.

340
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,366
So I'm saying

341
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:21,666
you should tell me
so that I can help you as a friend.

342
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,533
What is it?

343
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,033
Do you really want to know?

344
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:40,733
Yes.

345
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,100
(Fragile)
