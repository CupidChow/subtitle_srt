00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,200
Cute.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,733
I heard Chan Seong's voice
in Han Su Jin's story post.

3
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:05,933
Are you suspicious of Chan Seong?

4
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,766
If you know anything, be honest.

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:12,966
Are you okay?

6
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,166
- Did I scare you a lot?
- What?

7
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,966
Yoon Su Ho?
Boys like that are heartbreakers.

8
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:19,600
But if you really like him, you can't.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,100

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,700

can we start studying?

11
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,400
What's that?

12
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,133

Wake up.

17
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,900
Ye Ri told me I'm way too good for you.

18
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,466
Really?

19
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,600
How did she know? She's so sharp.

20
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,533
Ji Yu, I'm home.

21
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,433
Mom, didn't you say you're on
a business trip for the whole week?

22
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:28,933
Were you asleep until now?

23
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:31,233
I just woke up.

24
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,633
Aren't you hungry?

25
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,566
Should we eat out?

26
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,733
Why are you suddenly being formal?

27
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,666
I'm hungry. Let's go.

28
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,666
- I'll meet you outside after I change.
- Okay.

Chan Seong,
how do I change the sound setting?

31
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,966
- How do I change the setting?
- Lower the volume.

32
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,333
I want to use the headset instead.

33
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,033
Do you see the button in front of you?
Press that.

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,633
(Headset)

35
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,400
Thank you.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,500
What do I do now?

37
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,466
Do you see the bottom tower? Go there.

38
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,566
Okay.

39
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:03,700
Why did you take that?

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,933
We won't get the item now.

41
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:21,233
You're not bad for your first time.

42
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,533
- Chan Seong used to be a troll.
- Really?

43
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,933
San, stop spreading rumors.

44
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,500
I'll sue you.

45
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
For what?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
For defamation by stating a fact?

What's with him?)

48
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,766
(What should I do?)

49
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,400
(But it might be better to just
buy him dinner and get it over with.)

50
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,366
What should we eat?

51
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,700
- Are you hungry?
- What? No.

52

Are you okay with her?

62

Yes, I'm okay with her.

63
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,366
Really? I don't think she fits in with us.

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,366
She bashed your boyfriend, too.

00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:10,000
Why are you so startled?
You talked bad about me again, right?

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
- No, I didn't!
- Never mind then.

71

- Yes.

How do you know Do Ha?

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,300
I just somehow do.

77
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,633
Why? How did it happen?

78
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,033
You said it was nothing.
The vibe is telling me otherwise.

What was it? Tell us.

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,633
We bumped into each other
on the way to school...

81
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,333
and he cracked his phone.

82
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,900
I see. So that was you?

83
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,500

I might have heard it, too.
I also heard a huge one.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,066
Are you curious?

87
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,900
It's about Su Ho.

88
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,466
About him dating only college girls?

89
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,866
What?

90
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,700
It's so typical for boys like him.

91
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,200
He's somewhat cocky but has a sexy vibe.

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,100
You know, right?

93
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,633
- You know, right?
- What?

94

00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,166

100
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,300
No way!

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
What's wrong?

102
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,033
I gained 500g.

103

Stop overreacting.

104
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,566
Why did I gain weight?
Do I have to starve more?

105
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,600
Why would you starve?

106
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,200
I used to weigh 42kg in elementary school.

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,833

108
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,300
You're right.
I was so popular in elementary school.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,866
- Whatever.
- You're weird.

110
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,633
But does your boyfriend like you skinny?

111
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,633
Yes, maybe?

112
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,433
Did you take a photo?

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,333
Not yet, but we will.
He said he'll think about it.

114
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,466
What is there to think about
when his girlfriend is asking?

115
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,433
Isn't it very strange?

116
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,800
It is, but there might be a reason.

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,466
- Is he an idol or something?
- I know.

118
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,966
I bet the cardigan weighs a few kilograms.

119

who Mi Na's boyfriend is either?

120
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,133
Mi Na, are you not going to tell me?

121
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:46,000
You see... Never mind. I'll say it later.

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you finally have a secret with me?

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,266
I'm disappointed.

124
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,133
I hope he's not a jerk.

125
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,400
That would be great,

126
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,666
but if he was a good guy,
he wouldn't have hidden like this.

127
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,366
Hey! What does that mean?

128
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,600
How annoying.

Thursday, September 19th, 2024)

181
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
What's this?

182
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:04,600
(Ye Ri, Eun Su, Mi Na, Seo A Ra)

183
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:14,000
- Guys!
- Hi.

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
- You're eating again?
- It was a snack before. This is fruit.

185
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,466
What is it? Is something going on?

186
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,733
- What are you doing this weekend?
- I'm not sure.

187
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,766
Let's go bowling. I want to go bowling.

188
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:30,733
Good idea. I have to exercise since I ate.
Otherwise, I'll gain weight.

189
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,166
I'm not really good at bowling.

190
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,200
Can't we go to an amusement park
if we're going to hang out?

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,433
Amusement parks are too crowded
and expensive.

192
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,900
Let's go bowling. Snacks are on me, okay?

193
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,133
It'll be fun.

194
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Hi, Ye Ri.

195
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,100
- Did you call Ye Ri, too?
- Yes, I called her.

196
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,600
My online class is about to start.
Make it fast.

197
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:55,166
Me, too.

198
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,733
Ye Ri, pick one.

199
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,100
Bowling versus an amusement park
for this weekend.

200
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:04,200
Just go bowling.
The amusement park is too far.

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,333
Let me know the time and place.
I'm leaving. Bye.

202
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:14,533
I finally get to show off
my bowling skills.

203
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,500
Are you going through the roof?

204
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,300
- I'll knock them down.
- But what time are we meeting up?

205
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,266
Why? Are you meeting someone?

206
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,033
It's not that.
I just need to arrange a time.

207
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,933
That's why I'm asking.

208
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,033
Should we talk about the details
in person?

209
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,133
Yes, that's better. Ye Ri's not even here.

210
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,733
Ye Ri seriously only cares
about her business.

211
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,933
What's wrong with that?
I like that she's a smart cookie.

212
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,533
Then I'm leaving, too.

213
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:45,800
- Good night.
- Bye.

214
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,766
Already? But I'm bored.

215
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:49,766
Bye.

216
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:53,100
Mi Na, your skin will rot
if you sleep late.

217
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,466
Okay. Bye.

218
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,833
Bye.

219
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,233
(Chapter 18
Friday, September 20th, 2024)

220
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
I know. It's so...

221
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,433
Me, too.

222
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:13,100
What?

223
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,066
I know. I got it all.

224
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,033
I know.

225
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,233
- Let's go.
- You got it?

226
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,466
It's so big here.

227
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,366
- It's Nam Do Ha.
- What?

228
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,533
Should we go somewhere else?

229
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,733
Why? We don't have to avoid him.

230
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:37,666
Nice to see you.

231
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,600
- Yes.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,166
Your size is 235, right?

233
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:43,966
- What is this?
- Hi!

234
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,700
- I'm late.
- You look pretty.

235
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:50,000
Mi Na, do you have a date afterward?

236
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,033
What? No, I don't. Why?

237
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,833
- Do I look okay?
- Yes.

238
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,033
I thought you were going to a party.

239
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,766
- Hey, it's Nam Do Ha.
- Where?

240
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,433
Yoon Su Ho is here, too.

241
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:10,566
Aren't they in the 12th grade?
Do they even have time?

242
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Kids who can have a good time
study well, too.

243
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,233
By the way, Su Ho has a girlfriend.

244
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,600
She might be in college, right?

245
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,300
Then shall we get started?

246
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,000
- Hey!
- What is this?

247
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,300
Did you see that?

248
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:02,433
- I'll get something to drink.
- Okay.

249
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,066
- Keep playing.
- Thank you.

250
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,600
(Pine Eye)

251
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,766
You have a unique taste.

252
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,533
Sorry?

253
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,933
How many of you is it?

254
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:19,966
Five.

255
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,866
Five?

256
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,066
Pick more. It's on me.

257
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,633
(Where are you?)

258
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,900
(Husband Material Chan Seong)

259
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,533
What about this?

260
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,400
You don't like it?

261
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:48,566
I like that, too.

262
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,400
Have fun.

263
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,633
Thank you.

264
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,933
Guys, Do Ha bought them for us.

265
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,400
Really? That's so touching.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
It looks good.

267
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,300
Hey.

268
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,666
- I knew it.
- You're good.

269
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,533
That was cool.

270
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,100
The finish was no joke.

271
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,833
- Which one?
- I want the soda.

272
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,466
You two are getting along.

273
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,500
Shall we keep playing? Or end it?

274
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,900
Let's get going now.

275
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,300
Stay still. Let's focus.

276
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,966
- Guess what they are.
- Condoms.

277
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,700
Keep your voice down. People will hear.

278
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,666
Where did you get them?

279
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,666
I got them from my brother's room.

280
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,300
He's been dating.

281
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,433
I bet he thought I couldn't find them.
But I know everything.

282
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,266
You're hilarious.

283
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,366
But why did you bring them?

284
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,466
He was being so cocky
for having a girlfriend,

285
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,333
so I thought it was funny
that he was hiding condoms.

286
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,933
I bet he's looking for them everywhere.

287
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,966
But I also got a little curious, too.

288
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:31,066
We need to study these things.

289
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,766
I mean, is that necessary?

290
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:35,666
Why not? It's fun.

291
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,900
Who needs them? Ji Yu? Anyone?

292
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,233
Raise your hand if you want one.

293
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,466
Hey, Mi Na.

294
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,633
It's 30 dollars each.

295
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:46,666
What?

296
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,166
Nothing is free, Mi Na.

297
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,700
Please send the money
to my Kakao Bank account.

298
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,500
- Don't be stingy. Give me one.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,966
- Give it to me.
- This is expensive.

300
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,066
You must have done a good job.

301
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,466
Seriously.

302
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,633
Let's go.

303
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Just a moment.

304
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Help me out here.

305
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,333
- What is this?
- Sorry.

306
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,333
Chan Seong.

307
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,433
Why are you here?

308
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:03,533
I lost track of time while bowling.

309
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:10,766
Don't stand there and sit.

310
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,533
It's okay.

311
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,333
Where are your friends?

312
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,066
I left them midway.

313
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,233
Hey! Push the lane!

314
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,100
Darn it.

315
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,666
Are you mad?

316
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,100
Do you have something to say?

317
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,166
About what?

318
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,200
You seem to want to talk.

319
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,033
Talk to me.

320
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,533
Why didn't you answer your phone?

321
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,366
I was going to,
but the timing was not good.

322
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,633
- You could have called back.
- But I'm here now.

323
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Are you really mad?

324
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,800
No, I'm fine.

325
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,600
You're fine?

326
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,300
Yes. I was with the boys, too.

327
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:46,966
It doesn't matter.

328
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,900
Okay then.

329
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,100
It's great that you made friends,

330
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,866
but being pushed down
in your priority list...

331
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,666
doesn't feel good.

332
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,666
Okay.

333
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,600
I didn't do that on purpose.

334
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,633
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,400
I'll take you home. Wait here.

336
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,533
No. You can keep playing.

337
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,633
Then just for today.

338
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:56,700
Call me when you get home.

339
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,166
(Chapter 19
Saturday, September 21st, 2024)

340
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,500
Did you make up with Chan Seong?

341
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:26,366
He looked mad, but we made up.

342
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,866
He couldn't reach you.
I can see why he got mad.

343
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,100
Honestly, I don't think
he's completely fine.

344
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:46,966
You guys don't talk about
uncomfortable stuff, right?

345
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,900
Chan Seong doesn't like to
talk about that stuff.

346
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,700
You could bring it up first.
He might be waiting for it.

347
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:03,066
He's slightly small-minded.

348
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:08,166
My boyfriend wants to see me later.

349
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,266
Does it look bad if I bring this?

350
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,766
What is bad? It's better than nothing.

351
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,833
My underwear's not matching either.
What should I do?

352
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,066
Then don't do it today.

353
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,133
But if I say no...

354
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:34,300
What do you mean?
If you don't want to, say it.

355
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,866
Don't be dragged around by him.

356
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,033
It's him. I'm leaving.

357
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:51,933
It's no use talking to her.

358
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,300
Why did she even ask us?

359
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:03,300
(Chapter 20
Sunday, September 22nd, 2024)

360
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Hi.

361
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:31,566
What do you want to eat?

362
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,266
I...

363
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,566
Since you're buying, can I pick?

364
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,666
Sure. Go ahead.

365
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,133
By the way, I eat a lot.

366
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:48,700
How much?

367
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,800
What do you think? As much as I can.

368
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,266
I...

369
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:58,100
I'll have this one, this one,

370
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:02,466
this one, and this one.

371
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,933
Should I order from here to here?

372
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,566
I'm joking.

373
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:22,466
That was so cheesy.

374
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,733
What do you want to eat?

375
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,433
You seem to like burgers a lot.

376
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:28,866
You were eating one before.

377
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:31,366
- No, I don't.
- You don't?

378
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,133
I don't.

379
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:35,900
What do you want?

380
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:38,733
- I'll have this.
- This one?

381
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,566
We're really eating together now.

382
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:51,866
Eat slowly.

383
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,066
Should we eat Korean food next time?

384
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,500
- Korean food?
- Yes.

385
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:07,133
- Do I buy...
- I'll buy next time.

386
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:11,500
Do you really think
I expect you to buy me a meal?

387
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
What?

388
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,833
It was an excuse.
