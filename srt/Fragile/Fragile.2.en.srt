I want to quit the academy.

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:03,233
- You don't want to go?
- No, I don't.

3
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:06,300
I don't want to go. I want to be with you.

4
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,500
A boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,900
It's not because of that...

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,500
Ji Yu, is something wrong?

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,300
What? She sounds like a total slut.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,600
She kind of is.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,233
- She...
- She who?

10
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,500
You scared me.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,166
Who is she? I just transferred here.
I don't know much.

12
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,266
Mark, what do you think?

13
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,600
Are you happy we're taking a walk?

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,566
He's cute.

15

Cute?

20
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:49,633
Cute.

21
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:52,300
What's so cute?

22
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,033
What?

23
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,600
What are you listening to?

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Well...

25
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,266
I can't hear anything...

26
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:26,866
You like quiet music, right?

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
I guess.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,466
I like it, too.

29
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,066
Really?

30
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:36,666
By the way,

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,933
do you have sanitary pads?

32
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,233
Yes, just one second.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,900
Is it on my skirt?

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,566
No, it's fine.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,766
I'm glad.

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Thank you.

37
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,966
Do you want to come? Let's get snacks
after going to the bathroom.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,966
I want to thank you. It's on me.

39
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:08,533
Okay.

He made money by doing that
instead of working part-time.

42
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,166
Really?

43
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,300
What do you think?

44
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,166
- Ji Yu.
- What?

45
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,733
What's distracting you?

46
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,366
It's nothing.

47
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,233
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

What's this?

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,900
These are sweets to make you feel better.

52
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:35,933
That's cool.

53
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,666
Thanks.

54

I'm just grateful.

57

Fine. Let go of me.

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,800
I don't want to.

59
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,600
Cute.

60
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,100
Cute.

61
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,533
Cute?

62

What now?

63
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,833
You're acting strange.

64
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,200
If something's up, tell me.

65
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,933
It's the only way for me to know.

66
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,233
You don't tell me everything either.

How are things with Chan Seong?

What do you mean?

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,133
Did you see Han Su Jin's story post?

73
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:12,766
Han Su Jin? Why do you ask?

74
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:18,133
I heard...

75
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,366
Chan Seong's voice in her story post.

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,766
Are you suspicious of Chan Seong?

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,866
If you know anything, be honest.

78
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,666
Instead of thinking about it alone,
why don't you talk to him?

79
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,566
There's a girl behind you diagonally
just sitting there.

80
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey, don't turn too quickly!

81
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,400
- Do you know her?
- I think she's in my class.

Let's go.

83
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,966
They're leaving.

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,600
They ran.

85
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,000
These are bribes.

About the boy who was with you,
is he your boyfriend?

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
- Who?
- The one who sat with you on the bench.

88
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,133
You mean him? No.

89
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,500
Okay, so he's just a friend.

90
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,033
There needs to be a give-and-take.
Do you follow him on Instagram?

91
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,366
- Instagram?
- Yes.

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,066
His Instagram? One second.

93
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,733
Here it is.

94
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,000
His username is "river.m0untain?"

95
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,600
It's based on his name.

96
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,433
Even his name is so handsome.

97
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,933
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

98
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,433
But is he your type?

99
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,933
He's so darn gorgeous.
That's enough for me.

100
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,300
This looks good.

101
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:07,800
Yes. It's a pain to travel
between classrooms.

102
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,333
It seems good for a stroll.

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,500
You know I see a cat sometimes, too.

104
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,966
- A cat? Where?
- Sorry.

105
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:20,966

- I need to talk to you.
- I don't.

- Don't you have anything to say to me?
- Do I have to?

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
How annoying.

117
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,666
What are you doing?

118
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,266
Nothing.

119
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,466
I met Han Su Jin today.

120
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,966
Why? Where are you now?

- Did she say anything?
- No.

122
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,400
Come on. What did she say?

123
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,433
Is that important?

124
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:11,900
I met her, too.

125
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,866
- When?
- I just bumped into her.

126
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,333
Don't worry about her.

127
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,500
I think it's over between me and her.

128
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,266
I said don't worry about her.

129
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:47,900
You're kinder, cuter,
and more considerate.

There's a saying.

- Isn't it a cool quote?

It's not cool at all.

What? It's not?

135
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,266
- You were moved by it.
- I wasn't moved even one bit.

136
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,000
- You were.
- No, I wasn't.

- No, I wasn't.

What was that? Is this...

181
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,433
One day, a handsome boy
walked into our classroom?

182
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,733
Come on now.

183
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,800
Are they famous?

184
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,300
Since you just transferred,
you wouldn't know.

185
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,733
I've got so much to tell you.
But do you not know him, Ji Yu?

186
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,800
I think I heard his name a few times.

187
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,533
You don't know him well.
But you do have a boyfriend.

188
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:22,800
But how do you know him?

189
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,600
- It's just that there was an incident.
- It was nothing.

190
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,366
What? You're in this, too?

191
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,366
Come on, what is it? Tell me.

192
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,200
- What's going on?
- It's huge.

193
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,266
While you were pooping,
we had a surprise visit.

194
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:42,000
A surprise visit? By whom?

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,933
Nam Do Ha and Yoon Su Ho were here.

196
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,466
What? Really?

197
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,700
Yes. I can't believe
you missed them, Mi Na.

198
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,566
I should've come earlier.
I want to see them, too.

199
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,033
Then go to their class.

200
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:59,533
Should I? I should say hello, too.

201
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,333
Say hello? You'd be lucky
if they even look at you.

202
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,633
- Come on!
- Am I wrong?

203
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:06,733
Come on!

204
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,400
You don't even know them well.

205
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,033
Go and say hello.

206
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,166
- I bet they'll respond.
- Go ahead.

207
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:17,366
Come in.
Just make sure yourselves at home.

208
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,966
- This is what I'm capable of.
- I see.

209
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,566
- Hi, Ye Ri.
- Hi.

210
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:24,800
The teacher wants you to have this.

211
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:26,833
Sit down.

212
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:31,966
- Are they newbies?
- I brought them. I'm an expert in that.

213
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

214
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,500
Hi.

215
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,366
- I got a new game.
- What is it?

216
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,666
This is so hard to find.

217
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,666
I really wanted to play this.

218
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,800
- Ye Ri, join us.
- I can't bother.

219
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,433
Are you scared?

220
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,233
Me?

221
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,900
- I'll make you regret those words.
- Okay.

222
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,366
- I'm a bit...
- What?

223
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,566
I'm a bit scared...

224
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,300
She was cool, wasn't she?

225
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,100
Yes, it was refreshing to see.

226
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,266
Why are you scared? Do you know me well?

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,033
No. I don't usually hang out
with people like you.

228
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,766
She talks like this,
but she isn't a bad person.

229
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,500
What are people like me like?

230
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,333
Do you want to bet?

231
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,933
- You're wrong.
- You're wrong.

232
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,433
Thanks, Ye Ri!

233
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,366
Thanks!

234
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,033
Enjoy!

235
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,566
Enjoy!

236
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,400
(Counselling is in progress.
Unload your heart anytime you want!)

237
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,266
I can't believe
you all can't eat cilantro.

238
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,633
Can't you eat them?

239
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,833
Does it say that I can eat cilantro
on my face?

240
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,900
If you can't, never mind.

241
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,733
Are you all prepared for the mock test?

242
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,033
Hold on. I almost lost my appetite.

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,700
I'm taking an online course.
What about you?

244
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,566
I'm still thinking...

245
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:27,000
- If so, why don't you try mine?
- Really?

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,566
Yes, I'll send you my login details.

247
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,633
Thank you.

248
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,700
But have you all decided
what college to apply to?

249
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,433
We have to talk to our teacher first.

250
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:40,866
Maybe Gyeonggi University?
I should at least stay in Gyeonggi-do.

251
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,666
If not, my mom will kill me.

252
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,166
Eun Su, what about you?

253
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,633
Anywhere within Seoul for me.

254
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,200
- You?
- Worry about yourself.

255
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,233
Ye Ri, what about you?

256
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,616
Seoul National University.

257
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,800
If I don't get in,
I'll study another year, but I can do it.

258
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:04,133
You sure are a showoff.

259
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:08,100
I'm applying to the college
my boyfriend is applying to.

260
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
What?

261
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:12,333
That's why I didn't pick one.
I said I'll think about it.

262
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,266
We'll be a campus couple.

263
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,600
I don't know who your boyfriend is, but...

264
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,900
By the way, the fried rice here
is supposed to be good, too.

265
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,833
Since I'm paying, I'll go and order it.

266
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,833
Yes!

267
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

268
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,166
- It should be good.
- Yes.

269
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,000
Ji Yu, can I study at your place
this weekend?

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,200
- My place?
- Yes. Where do you live?

271
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,866
- A Ra, do you want to come, too?
- No, I'm fine.

272
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,466
Then is just the two of us okay with you?

273
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,000
- Well...
- Where are you going?

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,100
Ji Yu wants us to study at her place
on the weekend.

275
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
- Ji Yu said that?
- I did?

276
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,066
Such propaganda and fabrication...

277
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,333
Really? Can Ye Ri go, too?

278
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,400
By the way,
how do you two know each other?

279
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,166
I met her while traveling
in Southeast Asia.

280
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,500
She's so funny when she talks nonsense.

281
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,533
We were in the same club last year.

282
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,166
I see. Do you get good grades?

283
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,733
For me to survive in this country,
my grades should be darn good.

284
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,400
Ji Yu, are you okay with this?

285
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
It was supposed to be both of us.

286
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,866
Am I a third wheel here?

287
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,166
- Where was it again?
- Ji Yu's home.

288
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:44,666
Give me the address later. Southeast Asia
is far away, so I need to leave early.

289
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,166
I don't mind Ye Ri joining.

290
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,433
Friends with good grades
always sets the right mood.

291
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,400
Didn't you say you aren't coming?

292
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,033
If Ye Ri's coming, I'll go. Is that okay?

293
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:01,266
Well, okay. You all can come.

294
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,800
Hi, Su Jin! Where are you going?

295
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,766
What's this combination?

296
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,900
What a joke.

297
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,733
Did she not hear me?

298
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,166
PJ, aren't you coming?

299
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,200
- You're not wearing anything?
- What?

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,733
What will you wear?

301
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,200
What are you doing?

302
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,866
We look good, right?

303
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,433
Yes, we look good.

304
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,566
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

305
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,633
Look over there.
They're playing basketball.

306
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,933
Here you go. It's for you.

307
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,733
- What is this?
- Open it.

308
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,500
But today is not a special day.

309
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:29,066
Is that necessary? You don't want it?

310
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:34,200
- I'll just take it back...
- No, I'll take it. I'm curious.

311
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:42,266
Chan Seong, what's this?

312
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,666
Isn't it pretty?

313
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,900
My PJ is not feeling well these days.

314
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,166
You looked worn down, so I got it for you.
What do you think?

315
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:57,666
Isn't this expensive?

316
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,400
Where did you get it? Did you buy it?

317
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,233
Of course.

318
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,033
- This is fake, right?
- Hey, why would I get a fake?

319
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:21,233
I saved my allowance. Don't lose it.

320
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:26,566
But you spend all your money on games.

321
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,800
No, that's not true.

322
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,033
It does look pretty.

323
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:38,433
- But how did you buy this?
- It's just...

324
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,666
I bought it to see you smile.

325
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,066
Are you working behind my back?

326
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,900
What work?
I don't even have time for games.

327
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:04,000
You're supposed to put cash here, too.

328
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:05,633
Give it back.

329
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,900
(Chapter 11
Sunday, September 15th, 2024)

330
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,666
I should ask my boyfriend
to take these photos with me.

331
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,766
It's been a while since you mentioned him.
You haven't taken them yet?

332
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,900
We had a fling for a long time.

333
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,700
But you could still take photos.
What do you do on dates?

334
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,633
Us? We spend time at his place.

335
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:36,066
We order good food, we watch movies...

336
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:40,066
You're not filming a movie?
An R-rated one?

337
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,700
Fine, we do. What's wrong with that?

338
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,066
And what else?

339
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:48,633
What else do you do
other than spending time at his home?

340
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:52,666
We do other things.

341
00:24:56,733 --> 00:25:00,566
Ji Yu, did he ask you to do this first?

342
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,133
It just happened that way.

343
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,666
Mi Na, who is your boyfriend?

344
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,500
Who is it? Why don't you tell us?

345
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:12,800
Do you want to know?

346
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,166
It's a secret.

347
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,033
- My gosh...
- You hooked us in.

348
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:23,266
- Are you sure you have a boyfriend?
- Of course.

349
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:26,966
He's in a 3D form, right?
He's not AI, is he?

350
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,766
I'll tell you when the time is right.

351
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:31,766
So when is that going to be?

352
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:33,600
Just don't be shocked when I show him.

353
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,066
I'd be surprised that he existed.

354
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:42,300
By the way, what are your ideal types?

355
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,266
What's with that face?

356
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,366
I was thinking of my ideal types.

357
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:48,433
Who are they?

358
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:51,800
For me, it's Kang San and Yoon Su Ho.

359
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,366
- Yoon Su Ho?
- Yes. He looks smart.

360
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:57,566
Boys like that are heartbreakers.

361
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:01,666
Still, in this tough world,
we need those cute faces.

362
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:05,033
I bet they don't even think about that.

363
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,066
I bet Ji Yu's type is Chan Seong.

364
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,633
The No Chan Seong that's in our class?
Are you two really dating?

365
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes. Why?

366
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,733
It's just that you're too good for him.

367
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
My gosh!

368
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:27,633
It's so pretty in real life.
I screenshotted it since I want one.

369
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,600
Jang Won Young is the brand ambassador.

370
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:33,200
Mi Na, it's a capitalism trap.

371
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,533
Idols these days are
all ambassadors of something.

372
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,800
Adults are trying to leech
on kids like us.

373
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,933
And that's why some people say
we suck our parents dry.

374
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,900
Then I should be a malatang ambassador.

375
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,166
So where did you get this, Ji Yu?

376
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,066
- It was a gift.
- From who? Your boyfriend?

377
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,233
That's crazy. He's so sweet.

378
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,166
Chan Seong?

379
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,733
Yes. He said he saved his allowance.

380
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,766
He saved his allowance?
Do you believe that?

381
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:11,500
I believe him maybe halfway.

382
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,500
I asked him if he had been working.

383
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,300
If you believe him, you do.
It's not like a half-and-half pizza.

384
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:22,033
Then again, it's not a bad idea
to believe only halfway.

385
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:25,100
- It's a type of self-protection.
- Self-protection?

386
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,866
Yes, you'll feel as betrayed
as you believed him.

387
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:29,600
If you get betrayed
while half-believing him,

388
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,333
only half of you would be crushed.

389
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:35,233
But if you really like him, you can't.
The more you believe, the more you love.

390
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes, believing is good.
But you feel as betrayed as you do.

391
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,833
That won't happen to me.

392
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:42,600
Hey, guys.

393
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,033
If you'll keep talking about guys,
can we start studying?

394
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,666
Darn it! What's that?
I thought he was a ghost.

395
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,833
- It looked like you were having fun.
- Really?

396
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,100
What were you doing while hanging out?

397
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,533
We didn't just hang out. We studied.

398
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,733
We talked, too.

399
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:13,900
It's totally raining.

400
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,833
Don't look at that!

401
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,533
- It was there, so I looked.
- Don't you know about privacy?

402
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,300
Okay, I'm sorry.

403
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,500
- That's annoying.
- Sorry.

404
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:30,400
By the way, was it better
than hanging out with me?

405
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,866
Well, yes.

406
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,633
Really?

407
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,200
Stop it.

408
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,633
- Really?
- Don't do it.

409
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:41,600
Really?

410
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,800
Hey, focus on me!

411
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:19,266
(Do Ha, You're sorry, right?
Treat me to a meal then!)

412
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:25,533
(Fragile)
