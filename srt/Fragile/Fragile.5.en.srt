1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:03,333
What if you have a boyfriend you like...

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,466
but you found out that he lied to you?

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:07,933
How would you react?

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,400
Nam Do Ha? Just you two?

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,333
What do I do if I find out?

6
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,100
I feel so weird about this.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,733
It's all in the past.

8
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,833
I could be honest
because I did nothing wrong.

9
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,733
We'll talk later.

10
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,266
They say if you look back, you'll fall.

11
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,833
Can you reach him even when
he doesn't want to do it with you?

12
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,666
All you know is how to embarrass others!

13
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,700
Why are you doing this?

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,033
Ask Han Su Jin.

15
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,700
(Fragile)

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,500
Don't cry.

17
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,066
It's okay.

18
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:55,933
(Chapter 28
Friday, September 27th, 2024)

19
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:15,933
Ji Yu.

20
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,933
Can I talk to you for a second?

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
- The thing is...
- I'm sorry.

22
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:37,900
You go first.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,400
I don't know what Han Su Jin told you,

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,666
but I bought that wallet with the money
I won through a sports lottery.

25
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:57,233
- A sports lottery?
- I heard you could win money with it.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,566
That's gambling.

27
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05,533
I didn't think much of it,
because you can win money through a game.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,300
You should have told me.

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,366
Well, it wasn't an honorable thing to do.

30
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,600
I was a bit embarrassed, too.

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,800
Then how do you know Han Su Jin?

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
I did the lottery
with Han Su Jin's older brother.

33
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,700
He introduced me to it
and even gave me money to play.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,833
That bastard won a massive amount.

35
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,466
Are you still doing it now?

36
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,400
I came to my senses after getting hit
with the wallet you threw.

37
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,933
Han Su Jin was there a few times
when I met with her older brother.

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
That's all there is.

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,966
I thought things were completely over
between me and you.

40
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:14,800
We keep fighting over the same thing.

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,700
I didn't want to make you suffer so much.

43
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,066
I should have just told you the truth.

44
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:35,900
But Ji Yu,

45
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,200
it was also very hard for me.

46
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,366
It was so hard trying to have you.

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,733
You're always sincere to me.

48
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:58,333
From now on, things like this
will never happen again.

49
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,866
Please believe in me just one more time.

50
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,200
I'll make sure you can trust in me

51
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,133
as much as I trust in you, okay?

52
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,400
Okay.

53
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,733
- (Where did Mi Na go?)
- (I don't know. Why did she leave?)

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,566
(There are no posts.)

55
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:06,000
But why did Mi Na exit the DM chat?

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,300
I know. Her phone is turned off as well.

57
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,066
Is something going on?

58
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,666
It looks like
she also deleted her account.

59
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,233
Hey, Mi Na is here.

60
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,166
What's going on?

61
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,733
- Hey, Mi Na!
- Hey!

62
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,466
I was hoping you weren't the kind
to steal your friend's boyfriend,

63
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,433
but I hear you stole
Han Su Jin's boyfriend.

64
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:41,166
I'm talking about No Chan Seong!
Tell me if it's not true!

65
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:45,766
Mi Na, please listen to me.

66
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,666
Mi Na, just calm down first...

67
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,833
And what I'm most mad about...

68
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,900
is how you even stole my boyfriend.

69
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,533
How could you do that?

70
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,100
I saw you.

71
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,733
I saw my boyfriend kissing Park Ji Yu.

72
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,466
What?

73
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:22,466
My boyfriend is Nam Do Ha!

74
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,333
Chan Seong...

75
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,000
Hey, she's here.

76
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,366
If it was me,
I would have just skipped school.

77
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,800
You shouldn't say such things.

78
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,133
(Mom, I want to transfer
to another school.)

79
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,133
(If things don't work out,
I'll go to Dad.)

80
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,700
(Chapter 30
Monday, September 30th, 2024)

81
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,716
Why did you skip school
without telling me?

82
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,566
You turned off your phone, too.

83
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:01,033
I was just feeling sick.

84
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,700
What nonsense is that?

85
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,266
Don't you know how important attendance is
when applying for colleges?

86
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,666
I can just take a leave of absence.

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,733
I heard from the school
that you had fought with the girls.

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,366
What's going on, Park Ji Yu?

89
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,100
Are the girls bullying you?
Is that what this is?

90
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,066
If that's so, I'll go to the school
and tell the teacher...

91
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,266
It's not that!

92
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,833
Then what is it?
You need to tell me for me to know.

93
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,033
What difference would it make
if I told you about it now?

94
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,500
Just act like you always did!

95
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:58,033
Ji Yu, are you asleep?

96
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,200
I knew you would be home.

97
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:10,900
What brings you here?

98
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,866
I'm here because I'm worried about you.

99
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,366
You missed class
and didn't answer my calls.

100
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,866
Are you okay?

101
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,633
Is it hard?

102
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,300
It's okay.

103
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,700
Time will solve everything.

(Chapter 31
Tuesday, October 1st, 2024)

105
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:12,633
- I hope nothing is wrong.
- There shouldn't be.

106
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,333
It's not my fault, is it?

107
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:28,133
(Do Ha
Mi Na and I are friends.)

108
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,766
(How could you do that when you know
Mi Na and I are friends?)

109
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,666
(Explain to Mi Na and apologize,)

110
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,100
(you bastard.)

111

(Chapter 32
Tuesday, October 1st, 2024)

113
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,266
It smells like rags in here.

114
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,533
I don't know whether this can
get the stench out.

115
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,266
How about we wash it?

116
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,133
- Leave it. Or maybe spray some deodorant.
- Why should we?

117
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,833
We need to spray it all over.

118
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
The stench is so strong.

119
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,700
- Go and wash it.
- Should we just throw it away?

120
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:59,566
- This is annoying.
- That's enough. Stop it.

121
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,933
We shouldn't have gotten involved
in the first place, right?

122
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,733
What? Why aren't you saying anything?

123
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:14,466
I mean, Ji Yu must have had
her own reasons.

124
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:17,666
What reasons? I saw them with my own eyes.

125
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,633
And she's normally...

126
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,866
She was rumored to be a slut.

127
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:28,933
But that's just a rumor.

128
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,666
Rumors don't come out of nowhere.

129
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,366
If she had felt wronged,
she would have told us that.

130
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,700
She didn't have the chance to do that.
She was slapped right away.

131
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,100
- What?
- That's just a fact.

132
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,566
Hey, do you call yourself my friend?

133
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,500
What's with you again?

134
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,100
Let's go. Hurry up.

135
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,933
- Whose side are you on?
- What do you mean by whose side?

136
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,166
I'm on your side.

137
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,433
What are you doing?

138
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:25,133
Could you ask Chan Seong to see me
for a minute?

139
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,066
Okay. Wait here.

140
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,033
The thing is...

141
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:55,233
he just wants to be alone right now.

142
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,200
- I see.
- Should I ask him again?

143
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
No, that's okay.

Throw it!

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,633
Hey, throw it!

147
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,533
Hit them!

148
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:26,933
Nice job!

149
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,233
- Hey, be careful.
- Su Jin.

150
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,233
Behind you!

151
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,200
Be careful!

152
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:43,266
Get away!

Hey.

154
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,533
Sorry.

155
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,966
That's why you should have got out.
You were disrupting the game.

156
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,633
Why? Are you mad that it happened to you?

157
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,666
What?

158
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,100
That's what you do best.
It's stabbing people in the back.

159
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:35,166
That face again.
Why do you always play the victim?

160
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:38,333
That's so immature.

161
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
What?

162
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,333
You still have feelings
for No Chan Seong, right?

163
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,000
That's why you only do this to Ji Yu.

164
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,166
That's not true.

165
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,000
Hey, Seo A Ra, you should watch out, too.

166
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:57,233
You might regard her as a friend,

167
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,066
but she might not.

168
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,266
But isn't that feeling mutual?

169
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:10,600
If you regarded Ji Yu as a real friend,
you wouldn't have done this.

170
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,400
Hey, what do you know?

171
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,266
A Ra!

Hey!

173
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,166
Hey, get over here!

174
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,233
Let go! I said let go!

175
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,466
First of all,

176
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,633
I didn't know Nam Do Ha
was Mi Na's boyfriend.

177

That doesn't need to be pointed out.

178
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:10,866
I'm more amazed by how Mi Na kept that
a secret. I mean, he hid Nam Do Ha?

179
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,233
She's capable of doing that.

180
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:17,666
That piece of trash
was her absolute boyfriend.

181
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,333
And like what Mi Na said,

182
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,233
Chan Seong is Su Jin's ex-boyfriend.

183
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:36,133
I know how rumors involved him
between me and Su Jin.

184
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,766
Honestly, I was thankful how
you kept pretending you didn't know.

185
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:50,666
But it wasn't like I was determined
to make that happen.

186
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,466
The situation just presented itself.

187
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:03,600
And I thought that was a problem
between me and Su Jin.

188
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,100
Did you ever open up to her
to have a talk?

189
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Sorry.

190
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,266
Forget it.

191
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,866
Now that we're on the subject, let me ask.

192
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,933
What happened between you
and No Chan Seong?

193
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:26,466
It's just...

194
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:32,666
It's complicated with the incident
about Han Su Jin and all.

195
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What I'm saying is...

196
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,700
It's true I did find myself
drawn to Nam Do Ha.

197
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:49,800
That's how it was then.

198
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,266
In the end, I messed up everything.

199
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,366
This is hard.

200
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:04,800
But it's unfair how she's the only one
suffering like this.

201
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:09,233
We'll try to talk to Mi Na.

202
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,966
No, you don't need to do that.

203
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,966
(Chapter 34
Wednesday, October 2nd, 2024)

204
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,500
You seem to be going through
a hard time these days, Ji Yu.

205
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,933
Would you like to have a talk
with your mom?

206
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,300
Ji Yu, your grades, too.

207
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,066
Look at this. They can't drop like this
when they were going up so well.

208
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,133
Teacher.

209
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,266
Chan Seong, wait up.

210
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,600
Next year will come around soon.

211
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,033
It'll be too late to regret it
once you get to the 12th grade.

212
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:58,733
Including that time you missed school
without saying anything,

213
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,000
your mother is very worried.

214
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,666
Ji Yu, try to cheer up.

215
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,333
Okay. I'm sorry.

216
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,533
- What will you be having?
- I'll have milk tea.

217
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,000
We'd like a milk tea
and a pineapple kale juice, please.

218
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,033
Just a moment.

219
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,933
- Yes, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

220
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,400
French toast.

221
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,866
Should we have gotten these
as drinks to go?

222
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,866
We might be able to get seats.

223
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:39,666
- Let's just leave.
- Yes, let's do that.

224
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,500
Can we get those drinks to go?

225
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:47,200
- Where are you going?
- Just a minute.

226
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,200
You can sit over there.

227
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,966
We'll be leaving soon.

228
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:00,933
Let's go.

229
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
So much is left over.

230
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,333
What was that?

231
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,900
Are you by any chance...

232
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:24,233
What? What about me?

233
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,200
Or maybe not?

234
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:31,933
What are you talking about?
Let's just drink.

00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,733
Look, Mi Na.

237
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,333
The thing is...

238
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,266
Well, the thing is...

239
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,600
Mi Na, wait.

240
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:41,100
Mi Na, could you just talk with me?

241
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,533
Mi Na, what's wrong?

242
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,333
Mi Na, are you okay? What's going on?

243
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,633
What's wrong?

244
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,200
Get out of the way.

245
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,566
Mi Na, wait up.

246
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Mi Na.

247
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,600
Mi Na, what's wrong?

248
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,700
Hey, she's breathing.

00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,366
Jeon Mi Na, are you okay?

250
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:20,233
- Mi Na.
- Hey, can you see me?

251
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:21,800
Are you okay?

252
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:31,833
I...

253
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,733
Since I started dating Nam Do Ha...

254
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,966
I've been missing my periods.
