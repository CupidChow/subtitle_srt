1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,240
Ji Yu, I'm home.

2
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:06,240
Thank you.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,340
San, hurry up and join now...

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,774
or we'll all die.

5
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:10,144
(What should I do?)

6
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:11,940
Aren't they in the 12th grade?

7
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:14,040
Do they even have time?

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,074
Kids who can have a good time
study well, too.

9
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:18,507
You don't like it?

10
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:19,607
I like that, too.

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,440
- You're fine?
- Yes, I was with the boys, too.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,074
Actually...

13
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:26,207
Do you really think
I expect you to buy me a meal?

14
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,240
It was an excuse.

15
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:31,774
(Fragile)

16
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:35,374
(Chapter 21
Sunday, September 22nd, 2024)

17
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:36,807
What is it?

18
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,874
I bumped into Do Ha...

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,174
and he dropped and broke his phone.

20
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:45,574
I felt bad and offered
to treat him to a meal.

21
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,140
We just had a meal! There's nothing else!

22
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:56,540
Then that's a relief.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,440
But does Chan Seong know this?

24
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:02,307
No, he doesn't.

25
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:04,907
I knew it.

26
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:09,074
What would you have done
if I had been with Chan Seong?

27
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:12,874
- Did it look bad?
- Not just bad, but very bad.

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,640
I don't think it's too late to tell him.

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,274
- I should, right?
- Yes.

30
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:32,674
Before he gets the wrong idea
later on, you should tell him.

31
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:38,307
What should I say?

32
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:45,607
First, find the right time.

33
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:51,474
Okay.

34
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,174
I've been talking too much
about me, right?

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,940
No, I understand.

36
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,374
You don't really
talk about your problems to me.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,607
Don't you have any?

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,907
Of course, I do.

39
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,574
You do? What is it?

40
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:26,374
- It'll just be between us.
- To you?

41
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,707
I'll never tell anyone.

42
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:30,740
I promise.

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
It's okay.

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,174
Come on. You're making me want to know.

45
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm burning with curiosity. Tell me.

46
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,074
There is someone I like.

47
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,707
Really? Who? Do I know her?

48
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,574
You might know her.

49
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:04,674
I see.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,340
But it's a close friend,
so I'm a bit confused.

51
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,107
A close friend? Who could it be?

52
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,474
Who is it? What's her initials?

53
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:18,474
Later.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,807
- Who is it?
- I'll tell you later.

55
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:25,774
Which class is she?

56
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,207
Never mind.

57
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:34,874
(Chapter 22
Monday, September 23rd, 2024)

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,574
- I heard they're going out.
- Really?

59
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,407
How do you know?

60
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:48,440
People do stuff up there.

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,040
Whether kissing, smoking, or drinking,
they do everything there.

62
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:55,007
I heard they got caught doing it.

63
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,074
I bet they got exposed.

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,807
(Chapter 23
Monday, September 23rd, 2024)

65
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,007
Ji Yu, do you also believe in "SBD?"

66
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:08,674
I guess.

67
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,240
See? Everyone is SBD these days.

68
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:16,007
But isn't that the norm?

69
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,107
Spending time before dating
is more comfortable.

70
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:21,940
No, it's not that.
It's "sex before dating."

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,874
I thought it meant,
"Sweetie, bring me dumplings."

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,007
But is everyone serious about that?

73
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,707
Did you guys think that, too?

74
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:31,140
No, I believe in taking steps.

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,107
Mi Na's kind of a hopeless romantic.

76
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,674
- A little.
- Yes, I admit.

77
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:39,607
Still, when I fall for someone,
I fall deeply.

78
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,840
- You must really like him.
- I guess.

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,174
Yes, I like him. I like him a lot.

80
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:50,507
Mi Na, are you really not going to tell us
who your boyfriend is?

81
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,074
No, it's a secret.

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,540
It's like you're playing hide-and-seek.

83
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,940
Are you that curious?

84
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,440
Yes, she tells us everything
but never who her boyfriend is.

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,740
Don't you think I'd be baffled?

86
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,140
I guess so.

87
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:07,640
But you'll tell us one day.

88
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:12,007
My boyfriend needs to lay low these days.

89
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,340
- Lay low?
- Yes.

90
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,874
His parents are pressuring him hard
to study.

91
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,074
His parents cannot know about me.

92
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:22,840
Do you think we'll go around
and tell people? Come on.

93
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:30,774
But in Mi Na's shoes, I think
it's better to keep it a secret.

94
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,140
You understand how I feel.

95
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,174
I want to tell you guys later though.

96
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,607
He's really hot.

97
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:47,474
Okay, I hope he's really hot.

98
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:50,040
- I'm serious.
- I got it.

99
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,274
What if...

100
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:06,040
you have a boyfriend you like...

101
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:11,207
but you found out that he lied to you?

102
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,707
How would you react?

103
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,707
- What was the lie?
- Yes, that's important.

104
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:25,374
It's a white lie.

105
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,307
Then I'd be fine.
He was thinking about me.

106
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:32,474
I don't like it.
It doesn't change that he lied.

107
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,940
I don't know
since I've never had a boyfriend.

108
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,307
- Ji Yu, what about you?
- What?

109
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,907
I'd...

110
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,474
Never mind. It's not important.

111
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:52,474
Let's stop chatting
and start studying, please!

112
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:54,740
I get a headache, thinking about studying.

113
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,007
Hey!

114
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,740
You're a student!

115
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,274
- That hurts!
- Study!

116
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:01,074
Look at this!

117
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:02,607
If not, at least eat it.

118
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:05,174
How gross! There's saliva on it!

119
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,807
Rip it!

120
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,240
Rip it!

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,740
What are you doing?

122
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:13,740
(Chapter 24
Tuesday, September 24th, 2024)

123
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,740
What should I say...

124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,140
(Do Ha)

125
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,807
(What are you doing on the weekend?)

126
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:34,774
(Open)

127
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,107
(What are you doing on the weekend?)

128
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,740
(I hope you're not ignoring me.)

129
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,707
(Crying)

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,674
(I'd appreciate it if you can stop...)

131
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,274
(I'd appreciate it if you could stop
contacting me. It'll bother my boyfriend.)

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,207
(And it bothers me, too.)

133
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,307
(Block)

134
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:11,674
(Do you want to block "189cm do?"
Yes)

135
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,374
You're at the study cafe a lot these days.

136
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,607
I'm trying to do this alone.

137
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,407
A Ra recommended an online course, too.

138
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:46,107
That's good.
Ask me if you have questions, okay?

139
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Okay.

140
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,240
Tell him now.

141
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,807
Right now?

142
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,940
- Hey, PJ.
- What?

143
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:14,807
I thought you wanted
to talk to Chan Seong.

144
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
To me?

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,040
I mean, later...

146
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,940
What is it? Tell me.

147
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:31,707
I'll leave you guys alone.

148
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,207
- Bye.
- Okay.

149
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,074
Bye.

150
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,207
What is it?

151
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:48,174
You know,

152
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:57,507
Do Ha and I had a meal not long ago.

153
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,074
Nam Do Ha?

154
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,074
Just you two?

155
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,307
Why?

156
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:16,240
I guess I owed him something.

157
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:20,040
We had a little incident
at the school gate.

158
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,574
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

159
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:25,107
I was just going to have the meal
and get it over with,

160
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,674
so I didn't think much about it.

161
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,707
It was nothing,
but I thought you'd be bothered.

162
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,374
Then when were you going to tell me?

163
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,807
And how does San know?

164
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:43,240
San saw me.

165
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,307
He saw me eating with him.

166
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:01,240
Then you wouldn't have told me
if San hadn't caught you.

167
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,274
What?

168
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,874
- This is so upsetting.
- Chan Seong.

169
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Does everything go away
just by telling me?

170
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,840
I'm trying to be honest even if it's late.
Don't be mad.

171
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:23,474
We just ate.

172
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:25,107
I was the last to know.

173
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:32,483
It's not that. His phone cracked
and he told me to buy him a meal,

174
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,440
- so I got worried about...
- Ji Yu.

175
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,407
Do you think food is what he just wanted?

176
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,340
It wasn't like that.

177
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,540
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

178
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,274
Fine.

179
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,207
Are you done?

180
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:16,440
(Chapter 25
Wednesday, September 25th, 2024)

181
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,674
Defeated!

182
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:25,874
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:27,340
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Here we go.

185
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:31,040
My PE grade's so awesome.

186
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,840
I played nonstop with my brother.

187
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,974
Lessons you learn by losing
stay forever with you.

188
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:37,707
Hit it towards me. I'm all alone.

189
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,040
Hey, is something wrong with you two?

190
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,740
You make me depressed
just by looking at you two.

191
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,674
There is nothing to know.
Go back to your business.

192
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,574
We don't have enough players.
Can you come join?

193
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm tired.
Are we training for a competition?

194
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:59,240
Let's swap. Eun Su, you go.

195
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,507
This is a workout.

196
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,874
What kind of a badminton match
is played by three people?

197
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,540
Your sigh reached all the way
to the other side.

198
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,740
What is it? What's going on?

199
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,874
No one's as sharp as Ye Ri.

200
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,340
Just tell us.

201
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,974
I'm curious, too.

202
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,607
My boyfriend took photos.

203
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,307
- I see.
- I see.

204
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:38,707
So he finally did it?
Then why do you feel so down?

205
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,240
He did it with another girl.

206
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:47,140
What? This just got interesting.

207
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,707
How did you find out?

208
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,907
I saw the photo at the shop.

209
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,307
Is he two-timing?

210
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,907
She might be his ex-girlfriend.

211
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,507
Did you check the date?

212
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,107
- The date?
- Yes.

213
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:05,540
The photo comes with the date.

214
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,240
I didn't think about that.

215
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,274
I was so shocked that I just left.

216
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,274
She must be his ex-girlfriend.
Many don't even remember stuff like that.

217
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,774
That's right. Who would think
their photo is still there?

218
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:20,940
You think so?

219
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,640
Check the date first.

220
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,407
Ji Yu, do you know
all of Chan Seong's exes?

221
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,307
His exes?

222
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:41,740
Yes. What do I do if I find out?
I feel so weird about this.

223
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:46,107
What can you do?

224
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:49,140
It's all in the past.

225
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:56,007
They say if you look back, you'll fall.

226
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,940
He likes me now.

227
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,174
That's true.

228
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,874
It's a bad day
for the ones in a relationship.

229
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,974
It's easy living single, right?

230
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:15,807
Ji Yu, what about you?

231
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:19,940
I...

232
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:25,507
I just made a small mistake...

233
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,640
and Chan Seong's a little mad.

234
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,540
You tied up your hair.

235
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,307
What was that? Is today
going to be this interesting?

236
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:51,874
Is something going on with you and Su Ho?

237
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,674
He seems to have something
going on by himself.

238
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,307
No.

239
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,440
You think I would?

240
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,007
Something's strange lately.

241
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:07,607
What? You can't let go of
one of your gems again?

242
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,307
Leave San out of this.

243
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:12,107
You can keep Su Ho.

244
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,174
- I'm watching.
- Why?

245
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,040
- They're all yours?
- Yes.

246
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,774
- Are they yours?
- Leave San out of this.

247
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,640
(Did it go well?)

248
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,207
I'm not taking him.

249
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:35,407
You're not, right?

250
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:41,774
They're all yours?

251
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,974
Can you come to the study cafe
after tutoring?

252
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:01,340
Chan Seong.

253
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,074
I'll think about it.

254
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:07,907
Please come, okay?

255
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,740
How long are you going to be like this?

256
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:20,107
- What?
- I said I'm sorry.

257
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,574
This won't just go away
just because you apologize.

258
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,974
But you don't have to go this far.

259
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,974
It was late, but I could be honest
because I did nothing wrong.

260
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,307
We'll talk later.

261
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:35,940
- Later when?
- I don't know.

262
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:44,974
Fine, I'm sorry about eating
with another guy.

263
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:48,840
But you make me feel like...

264
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,207
- I'm some kind of criminal.
- What?

265
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:55,207
I was at least honest.
I also drew the line with him.

266
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,274
Drew the line? What do you mean?

267
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,474
- It's all about you, right?
- Ji Yu.

268
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:07,807
Why are you dating me?
Do you even like me?

269
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,340
Why are you changing the subject?

270
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,674
- You haven't even been around me.
- Hey.

271
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,874
- You're hiding something from me!
- What am I hiding?

272
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:19,540
You would know better than I do.

273
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,007
Talk clearly.

274
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,107
You met Han Su Jin, right?

275
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,340
I heard your voice in her story post.

276
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,174
Are you doubting me?

277
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,340
You have no idea how I felt all along.

278
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:58,940
- Ji Yu.
- Forget it. Let's stop.

279
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,974
Fine. Let's stop.

280
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:30,340
(Chapter 26
Thursday, September 26th, 2024)

281
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,607
Did she go to the bathroom?

282
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,374
Ji Yu, don't you have to
prepare your presentation?

283
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:38,774
- Presentation?
- You have a presentation today.

284
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,040
Aren't we going over a quiz?

285
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,774
- What?
- Ji Yu, you didn't prepare?

286
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:48,074
Darn it, how could I have not known?

287
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:50,707
I totally forgot about this.
I must be dumb.

288
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:52,040
How much time do I have?

289
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,940
Don't look at the time.
Time won't wait for you.

290
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,007
Make the first and last slides first.

291
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,540
Say "Hello" first.

292
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,640
"Hello?"

293
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,407
Let's contact Ye Ri. Let's just copy hers.

294
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,974
Should I type for you with my tablet PC?

295
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,240
Our last class was...

296
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,307
- What was Ye Ri's number?
- What?

297
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,107
I can't remember...

298
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,774
(Thank you.)

299
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:12,540
I don't know.

300
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,807
Ye Ri has to answer.
Text her to answer our call.

301
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:15,940
Call her.

302
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:19,107
My stomach hurts.

303
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:21,640
I felt it coming, but nothing came out.

304
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,874
Try eating prunes.

305
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:25,140
- It didn't work.
- Really?

306
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,607
You must be immune.

307
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:28,740
Stop taking laxatives.

308
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:35,340
Guys, about what I told you...

309
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,307
Which one? You tell us too many things.

310
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,974
About my boyfriend's photo that I saw.

311
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,307
Did you check the date?

312
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,340
- Yes.
- When was it?

313
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:54,974
She must be his ex.

314
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:57,507
If not, Mi Na wouldn't be this calm.

315
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:03,307
They didn't seem close enough.
They must have just hung out.

316
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,607
What? Hung out?

317
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:08,640
The date was a week
before we started going out.

318
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,907
A week?

319
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,274
Yes. We hung out then, too,

320
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,774
but you can hang out with multiple people.

321
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,207
What's wrong?

322
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,574
Hanging out ends there.
Going steady is what counts.

323
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:30,340
He chose me at the end. Isn't that better?

324
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,407
So the key point is who he chooses.

325
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,740
Do you really think so?

326
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,807
How do you know he's only dating you?

327
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:45,974
What?

328
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:48,940
Think about it.
He hung out with two girls.

329
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,440
Well, he could've hung out
with a countless number of girls.

330
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,607
Would a jerk like him
have only one girlfriend?

331
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,040
Jerk? Watch your mouth.

332
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,674
He's your boyfriend. He's a jerk to me.

333
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:06,007
Also, let's say he chose you,
just as you said.

334
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,707
Then why does he only take photos
with the other girl?

335
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:11,907
- He said he'll take them with me, too.
- When?

336
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,974
It's the action that counts.
You still haven't taken them.

337
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:19,274
I'll take them and show you the photos!

338
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:25,174
Mi Na, I don't care
if you take photos with him.

339
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,907
That's not what I'm curious about.

340
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,240
And be honest with me.

341
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:33,107
Can you even reach him these days?

342
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,074
Yes, I can.

343
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,940
I don't think so.

344
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:45,140
You brought the condom on that day, right?

345
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,374
Can you reach him even when
he doesn't want to do it with you?

346
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:51,040
He's just busier than before.

347
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,307
He's busy studying
for the mock tests and midterm.

348
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,074
Everyone can be busy!

349
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,140
Mi Na, you have to be honest.

350
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,907
Does he meet you when you want to see him?

351
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,840
Do you really not get it?
Or are you pretending not to know?

352
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,107
What do you know?

353
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,240
All you know is how to embarrass others!

354
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:24,107
Mi Na.

355
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:28,240
Hey, do you hate me that much?

356
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:33,174
I didn't want to make you cry.

357
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:37,040
Why are you so mean to a friend?
What's wrong with you?

358
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:43,640
Mi Na, Ye Ri doesn't hate you.

359
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,174
Don't be like this.

360
00:23:47,174 --> 00:23:48,807
She's just worried.

361
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:56,140
Yes, that's it.

362
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:01,674
Stop it. I don't care.

363
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,874
I'm not telling you anything from now on.

364
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,907
I'll go.

365
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,474
This is so frustrating.

366
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,674
I was only worried about her.

367
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:26,540
Yes, we know.

368
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,274
But she can still get hurt.

369
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:36,207
He might be ready to take photos with her.

370
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,540
But when I see Mi Na,

371
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,740
it looks like a one-sided love.

372
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,840
She's excited alone
and disappointed alone.

373
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,974
I bet that jerk will tell her
not to show the photos to others.

374
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,474
Why do you think he wants to
hide the fact that he's dating her?

375
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:55,440
He has many things to hide.

376
00:24:57,907 --> 00:25:00,207
Honestly, I think Ye Ri is right.

377
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:04,207
Mi Na will have to
go through this to know,

378
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:08,074
but it's better to avoid it
if Mi Na doesn't have to.

379
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,907
Then what should Mi Na do?

380
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:16,040
She seems to like him a lot.

381
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,374
What do you think?

382
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,574
She'll keep liking him...

383
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:28,207
and deal alone with the hurt
that she feels.

384
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:31,574
That's a bit sad.

385
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,274
Do you think Mi Na doesn't know
that it's weird?

386
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:39,374
She's just pretending while meeting him.

387
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,674
And didn't you guys also feel
something a bit off?

388
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:55,674
Do you know what makes me so mad?

389
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,207
You can misunderstand
and you can lie, too.

390
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,607
And hiding something?
Darn it, you can hide things, too.

391
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:12,107
But when you blame others for doubting
after giving them a reason to doubt,

392
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,774
that's being such a loser.

393
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,207
But Mi Na isn't even doubting.

394
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,707
Someone had to tell her anyway.

395
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,807
I didn't want to regret it
after things blew up.

396
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:36,674
Even if it hurts Mi Na,
I had to let her know.

397
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,040
That's what friends do, right?

398
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:50,474
(Chapter 27
Friday, September 27th, 2024)

399
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:04,840
So he chose this.

400
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
What?

401
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,807
I meant it's pretty.

402
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:16,940
What are you talking about?

403
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:19,374
What?

404
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,474
About what you said.

405
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,507
Do you know how he got that?

406
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,774
Chan Seong keeps things from you.

407
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,207
Get lost.

408
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:46,074
Ji Yu, enjoy the wallet.

409
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:49,374
Chan Seong had to work so hard
to buy that.

410
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,074
What was that?

411
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:42,640
You jerk.

412
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,174
Why are you doing this?

413
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,207
Ask Han Su Jin.

414
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,207
Did Su Jin tell you?

415
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,707
Su Jin?

416
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,207
Why are you crying?

417
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:46,407
Is something wrong?

418
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,974
Someone is calling you.

419
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,907
(Husband Material Chan Seong)

420
00:29:58,307 --> 00:29:59,407
Your boyfriend?

421
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,340
It's all over.

422
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,840
It's okay.

423
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,507
Don't cry. It's okay.

424
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:27,274
(Husband Material Chan Seong)

425
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,074
(Fragile)
