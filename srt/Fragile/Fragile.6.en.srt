1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:02,466
- Hey, Mi Na!
- Hey!

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,466
What I'm most mad about...

3
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:06,666
is how you even stole my boyfriend.

4
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:08,133
How could you do that?

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,100
Are the girls bullying you?
Is that what this is?

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,900
What difference would it make
if I told you about it now?

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,866
She was rumored to be a slut.

8
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:16,566
If she had felt wronged,
she would have told us that.

9
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:17,833
Hey!

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,433
Mi Na, talk to me...

11
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:22,833
Mi Na, what's wrong?

12
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:24,833
Are you okay?

13
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,700
Since I met Do Ha, I haven't had a period.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,900
(Fragile)

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,400
(Chapter 36
Friday, October 4th, 2024)

16
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,166
The truth is
I really wanted to talk to you.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,366
- Are you okay?
- What?

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,566
What I hit you that day.

19
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,366
Yes, I'm okay.

20
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,466
It didn't hurt much.

21
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,566
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:12,066
I was so upset...

23
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,066
that I lashed out at you.

24
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,266
To go to Do Ha...

25
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:24,466
I was a bit scared.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,366
I know well even if you don't tell me.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,166
I like him more than he does.

28
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,366
I was the only one...

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,800
Ye Ri was right.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Pulling the wool over my eyes
won't resolve this.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,900
I'll do something about the rumor.

32
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,600
It's fine.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,233
It's not my first rumor.

34
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,200
I guess it's punishment
for pulling the wool over my eyes.

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,233
It happened to me, too.

36
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:18,200
Su Jin was a friend I really liked.

37
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,533
But...

38
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,200
I had a huge crush on Chan Seong.

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,166
That could be why.

40
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,133
I kept obsessing over it.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,733
I pretended I was fine.

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,866
I pretended nothing happened.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,100
I blamed myself for the fights.

44
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,333
Me, too.

45
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's not do that anymore.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Okay.

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,700
By the way, are you feeling better?

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Yes.

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,433
But I have a question.

50
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,666
What?

51
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,333
I've been meaning to tell you.

52
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,466
I thought you knew.

53
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,833
San knew I went out with Do Ha.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I thought you obviously knew.

55
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,200
You guys are close.

56
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,566
What?

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,266
(Chapter 37
Saturday, October 5th, 2024)

58
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,600
It's not like we're not supposed
to be here. What's the problem?

59
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,300
I just feel weird.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,433
What's weird about it?
Stop worrying about others.

61
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,066
Where else would you go in this case?

62
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,800
Yes, Mi Na.
Don't worry about what others think.

63
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,833
Yes, it's fine. We're here together.

64
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,833
Yes.

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
Aren't they students?

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,333
I know. Don't stare.

67
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,866
But they look young.

68
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,266
- I know. They must be embarrassed.
- Okay, fine.

69
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:20,400
Jeon Mi Na.

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,033
Jeon Mi Na.

72
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,833
Yes.

73
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,700
Where are you hurting?

74
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,333
It's not that I'm hurting, but...

75
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,533
She's not having her period.

76
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,333
These are two lines, right?

77
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:48,966
Why is this...

78
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,433
It's true, right? I'm pregnant, right?

79
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,766
She's sick in a few ways.

80
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:55,566
Mi Na, let's check your eyes after this.

81
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,466
I'm telling you
there are two lines if you look closely.

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
You're okay.

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,866
Your test results look fine.

84
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:09,233
If she is fine, you're saying
she's not pregnant, right?

85
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,900
No, she's not.

86
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,500
Do you want to be pregnant?

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,433
No.

88
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:19,200
But you've been straining yourself
too much.

89
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm looking at your responses.

90
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,833
You seem to be starving yourself.

91
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,800
Coffee, water, and salad
for one meal a day.

92
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you finish the salad?

93
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,166
She doesn't finish her lunch at school.

94
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,500
She won't even try it
even if something good is served.

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,733
She gives them to me, so it's good for me.

96
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,066
But I always say no, too.

97
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,900
I say yes sometimes,

98
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,633
but if I don't eat it,
she doesn't even touch it.

99
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,466
You'll be in big trouble
if you keep this up.

100
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,700
That's not being on a diet.

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,433
It's a shortcut to becoming sick.

102
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,500
But...

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,833
You keep fainting
and missing your periods.

104
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,800
Your body's giving you a signal, right?

105
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:12,533
Your friends are very worried about you.
Look at them.

106
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:25,833
(Chapter 38
Monday, October 7th, 2024)

107
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,366
One, two, three.

108
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,300
- Come on...
- You won!

109
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,666
It's huge.

110
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,700
- Thanks.
- You said this is fine.

111
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
- You two do the dishes.
- You clean up today.

112
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,566
The sesame oil smell
is making me so hungry.

113
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,266
- I know.
- Let's hurry.

114
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,266
Hurry and mix it.

115
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Mix it.

116
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,433
- It looks so good.
- I know.

117
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,766
Are you all amateurs?

118
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,433
Look at this.

119
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:54,500
I knew it.

120
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
You're different.

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Show us.

122
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,166
It looks good.

123
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay, try it.

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,266
This is a lot.

125
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll tilt it a bit.

126
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:09,666
That was a good bite.

127
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,800
Is it good?

128
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Yes.

129
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,133
I want some, too.

130
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,233
Eun Soo!

131
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,533
- What are you doing?
- It's all over the table.

132
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,666
I have a small mouth.

133
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,866
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

134
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,633
Don't hog it.

135
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,466
Don't pull it.

136
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,300
I'm putting it in the middle.

137
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,700
How is that the middle?

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,466
You have long arms.

139
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,700
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

140
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,433
What?

141
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,633
(I heard from Chan Seong. Are you okay?)

142
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,866
- You need sesame oil in this.
- You better not eat.

143
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:48,866
I'm watching you.

144
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,266
The bracken is good.

145
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,566
Who is bracken?

146
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,833
Who brought the zucchini?

147
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,600
What did Chan Seong say?

148
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,633
You know...

149
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,266
Is he really mad?

150
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll try to talk to Chan Seong.

151
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,033
Okay.

152
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:27,233
It's fine. Try to smile.

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
San.

154
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,633
Why did you...

155
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,266
What?

156
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:47,366
Never mind.

157
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,633
(Chapter 39
Monday, October 7th, 2024)

158
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:05,733
Let's find him.

159
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,700
Who? No Chan Seong?

160
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,733
No, I meant Nam Do Ha.

161
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,133
What?

162
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,100
What if we find him...

163
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,166
and he cries his eyes out,
saying he likes Mi Na?

164
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,766
What if he makes a scene?

165
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,666
How sorry are we talking about?

166
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,266
- Hey.
- That idiot still doesn't get it.

167
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,233
- We have a long way to go.
- I'm kidding.

168
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,533
But what if he kneels, too?

169
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,566
If he does, we should stomp on him.

170
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,700
Can you stomp on him?

171
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:58,433
Then what if...

172
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,033
he says he will quit school
if he doesn't have Ji Yu?

173
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,333
What if he won't take the CSAT?

174
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,066
Then what? He brought this on himself.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,100
He's the worst.

176
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,000
But you almost fell for him.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,900
You almost fell for him.

178
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,566
Stop it.

179
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,100
- Hey.
- Stop that.

180
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,866
Let's go and beat Do Ha up.

181
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:27,333
I can't do it.

182
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,166
- Me neither.
- Why not?

183
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,700
- We can all go.
- Yes.

184
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

185
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,400
(Chapter 40
Tuesday, October 8th, 2024)

186
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
(Grade 12, Class 4)

187
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,866
Nam Do Ha!

188
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,633
Why did you do that to me?

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,100
What?

190
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,800
You kept contacting me to buy you a meal.

191
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,533
You told me you didn't meet me for a meal.

192
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,533
You were going out with Mi Na.

193
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:28,333
You can't keep a secret.

194
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:32,233
You're so...

195
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,233
Are you kidding me?

196
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,800
Weren't you in the wrong and not me?

197
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,566
You knew Ji Yu and I were friends.

198
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:49,033
How could you lie and hide...

199
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:52,833
Did you even like me?

200
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:56,933
Yes, I did.

201
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,266
But...

202
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,300
you two liked me, too.

203
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,233
What?

204
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,966
You two are silly.

205
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,966
I was just being nice,
and you fell for me.

206
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,566
I've never met girls as easy as you two.

207
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,366
You really are trash.

208
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm just generous with love.

209
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,666
You two just couldn't accept it.

210
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,266
I'm tired, so don't come to me again.

211
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:40,000
If you want an apology, give up.

212
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:44,566
My ears are rotten!

213
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,900
You piece of trash!

214
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,466
- So what?
- I get it now.

215
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,933
I see who you are.

216
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:03,533
You don't care about
what others see or feel.

217
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,800
They say empathy is intelligence.

218
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,566
Guys who manipulate and play with girls
who open their hearts for them...

219
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,533
are the emptiest up here.

220
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,866
You're stupid and hollow.

221
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,300
But I guess no one told you.

222
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,566
Everyone must have given up.

223
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,366
What did you just say...

224
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,300
Stop it.

225
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,066
Hey.

226
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:37,633
Give it a rest. It's embarrassing.

227
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay, the show's over.

228
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:46,733
Let's go.

229
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,466
This is a very dangerous situation.

230
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,433
(Chapter 41
Tuesday, October 8th, 2024)

231
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,800
What's that? Who bought that?

232
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,433
Why? Eun Su loves that.

233
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,233
- Really?
- Yes.

234
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,266
Did you buy this rice cracker, too?

235
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,266
I bought that one.

236
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,066
- Is this Eun Su's favorite, too?
- No, but it's good.

237
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:13,266
I know. Why did you only buy one?

238
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,833
It's good.

239
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,200
But why is Do Ha so quiet?

240
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,666
I know. Did that knock sense into him?

241
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,333
He should stay quiet
after being embarrassed like that.

242
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,700
That's true. A Ra was so cool.

243
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,233
- I agree.
- What do we do now?

244
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,300
Should this go on the back?

245
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,100
I think so.
The back should be the most stable.

246
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,100
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

247
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,300
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

248
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,866
(Chapter 42
Thursday, October 10th, 2024)

249
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,566
I need to talk for a moment.

250
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,000
I heard. Everyone keeps talking about it.

251
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,933
- What?
- About Do Ha, that jerk.

252
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,966
It made me angry.

253
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,100
Is this "Husband Material Chan Seong?"

254
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:06,433
What did you say?

255
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,666
Let's be honest. Aren't I better than him?

256
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,466
- Chan Seong!
- Shut up!

257
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,233
You bastard!

258
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,633
Chan Seong!

259
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,566
What are you doing?

260
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,600
Darn it.

261
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,533
You said it was over when we kissed.

262
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,000
I guess it's not.

263
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,566
What? Are you okay?

264
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:32,566
Forget it.

265
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,733
You two deal with each other.

266
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,233
- Chan Seong...
- Don't be lashing out at me.

267
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,766
Chan Seong, let me see your face.

268
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,133
Come on.

269
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:51,933
Chan Seong.

270
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:54,966
(Chan Seong, are you okay?)

271
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,033
(Should I wait? Where are you?)

272
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,066
(Chapter 43
Thursday, October 10th, 2024)

273
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,166
Where's Chan Seong?

274
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,666
You know...

275
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,533
He's fine now.

276
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:44,366
He's just a bit shocked.

277
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,100
What about you?

278
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,633
Me?

279
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,400
Don't you have any concerns?

280
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:05,133
Chan Seong and I are on the worst terms.

281
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:08,666
You know all about it.

282
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
I'm not sure.

283
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,433
Why didn't you tell me?

284
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
About what?

285
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,866
You knew Do Ha and Mi Na went out.

286
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,000
Is that important?

287
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
If I had known, I would've...

288
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,066
Why do you need an excuse for everything?

289
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,800
- What?
- If I had told you,

290
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:55,633
are you saying this would've not happened?

291
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,266
Wait, San.

292
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,533
PJ.

293
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:03,100
Honestly, whether I tell you or not
isn't important.

294
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:09,433
You always beat around the bush.

295
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:13,733
Listening to you, all you need is honesty.

296
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,666
It's frustrating to see you.

297
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,700
I know you know the answer,

298
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,433
but you seem to focus on avoiding that.

299
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,966
What's going on?

300
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,233
How can you say that to me?

301
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,666
If not me, then who will say it?

302
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Ji Yu.

303
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,800
Think well about what will help you.

304
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:51,366
You asked me...

305
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,033
if I had any concerns.

306
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,166
I have someone in mind,

307
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,333
but I realized
after seeing that person struggling.

308
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,066
Yes.

309
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,266
I like this person.

310
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,466
But I can't even express it.

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
All I can do is listen...

312
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,233
like a fool.

313
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,433
I'm done doing nothing.

314
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,700
(Chapter 44
Friday, October 11th, 2024)

315
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
You're pretty.

316
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,800
How many does she take?

317
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,933
She takes photos from the moment
she wakes up until she goes to bed.

318
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Take some for me.

319
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,000
You're so pretty.

320
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,866
You're so pretty.

321
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,300
- I'm not joking.
- Seriously.

322
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
- I'm serious.
- I'm not joking.

323
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,366
I got one.

324
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:14,766
Hey!

325
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,800
I told you to take mine.

326
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
- Don't I look good?
- Look at this.

327
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,333
You look like a thumb.

328
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,500
A thumb.

329
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,533
I said to take photos of me.

330
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:24,600
Pick one for me.

331
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Hey.

332
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,733
San is here.

333
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:30,766
He must be looking for Ji Yu.

334
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,266
Mi Na.

335
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,933
Mi Na.

336
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:39,766
Me?

337
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,966
I need to talk to you.

338
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,500
What's going on?

339
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,566
I know.

340
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,400
Don't you know anything?

341
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,833
I don't.

342
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:03,133
- You're following them?
- Aren't you curious?

343
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:14,200
She's looking.

344
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,666
Hide behind me.

345
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,700
Be quiet.

346
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,900
She's acting cute.

347
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,833
She's pretty. Come on.

348
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,633
But they kind of look good together.

349
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,633
I know.

350
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,733
- San.
- What?

351
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,300
What was that with Mi Na?

352
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:00,866
Did you two know each other?

353
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,966
We do since we go to the same school.

354
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,833
On that day,

355
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,900
when you said you liked someone...

356
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:26,033
By any chance, is that...

357
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,800
- Yes.
- What?

358
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:35,200
I like Mi Na.

359
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,600
(Fragile)
