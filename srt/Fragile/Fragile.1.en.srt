1
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,733
Our time is split
into minutes and seconds,

2
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,233
and no one probably knows
what happens during that time.

3
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,833
Things to do, things to see,
and places to go...

4
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,833
are more than we can count
with our ten fingers.

5
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,800
Even if we have what we want to do
or find what we're good at,

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,366
we're told to go to college.

7
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,233
Our future isn't fixed.

8
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,800
It's just like how our choices
don't have answers.

9
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,600
If we think about it,

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,533
what we can do is... I'm not sure.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,366

Yu Ha Ram.

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,566
Ji Yu, what's with you?
Why are you so late?

16
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,166
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:45,066
- Have you checked your marks?
- Yes.

18
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:46,933
This will split you
into different classes.

19
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,333
When the new semester starts next week,

20
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,200
see the sections there...

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
and go to your new class. Okay?

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,633
Okay.

23
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:22,066
Darn it. One point lower,
I could have been bumped down.

24
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,233
You're right. That's wild.

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
Su Jin, what class are you in?

26
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,433
Class A.

27
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:33,533
What? You studied behind our backs.

28
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,633
You were worse.

29
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,800
Ji Yu, what about you?

30
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Me?

31
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,266
I'm in Class A...

32
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,100
How annoying...

33
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,200
I want to quit the academy.

34
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,533
All of a sudden? Why?

35
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,533
It's not advanced enough.

36
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,066
It's not because of Su Jin?

37
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,533
No, it's that the students switch to
private tutoring in the 11th grade.

38
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,800
One-to-one classes are better.
I bet it's cheaper than an academy.

39
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,133
I don't think so.
Tutoring is obviously more expensive.

40
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,800
How do you know?

41
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,333
- Let's go.
- Okay.

42
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Bye. I'll DM you.

43
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,700
Can't you stay with me a little longer?

44
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,633
Chan Seong, let's go.

45
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,900
Are you leaving?

46
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:08,066
- You don't want to go?
- No, I don't.

47
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:11,200
I want to be with you.

48
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,600
It's chilly. We'll catch a cold.

49
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,600
We could go to my place.

50
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,033
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

51
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,000
Chan Seong, let's go.

52
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,166
PJ, it's late. Go home.

53
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,833
What's with him?

54
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,733
DM me.

62
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,233
Why aren't you reading my DM?

63
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,000
What? Why are you here?

64
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,366
You told me to come.

65
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,966
You could've come with me.

66
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,700
Did you go straight home earlier?

67
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,833
I was at San's before coming.

68
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,833
Come on.

69
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,933
I got to San's and fell asleep right away.

70
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,366
It was almost midnight when I woke up.

71
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,566
I was going to come here
without stopping at his place.

72
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,666
- I'm serious.
- Forget it.

73
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:12,300
I'm sorry.
Was I supposed to come with you?

74
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Never mind.

75
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,933
Are you mad?

76
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:23,466
You're mad.

77
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,866
Why are you mad?

78
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:32,000
Why? What's in your mind?

79
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,333
- You're mad.
- I'm not mad.

80
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,966
- You are mad.
- I'm not mad.

81
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,033
- Yes, you are.
- I am not.

84
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,100
Where's Chan Seong?

85
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,200
He slept in.

86
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,900
But he's coming.

87
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,033
Didn't you say he slept in?

88
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,633
I was implying he'd be late.

89
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,266
You're in trouble, PJ.

90
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,066
- Why?
- You have to go home alone from now on.

91
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,400
What?

92
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,966
Come on. I'll make sure
to look out for her.

93
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:09,300
Right? We'll be inseparable anyway.

94

who only thinks about basketball?

95
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,000
Basketball?

96
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,666
We decided to start playing basketball
every day after school.

97
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:25,500
Really?

98
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,266
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,433
I'm right in front of you.

100
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,533
We'd be together all day
if we were in the same class.

101
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,333
I don't want to go.

102

What are you doing?

103
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,500
You'll be fine. Okay?

104
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,233
Okay. See you later.

Thanks.

106
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:33,433
No way. For real?

107
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:40,800
After that, she couldn't see him
and went crazy.

108
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,900
What? She sounds like a total slut.

109
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,000
She kind of is.

110
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,966
- Also, did you hear that?
- What?

111
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:55,366
Is that for real? She's crazy.

112

- She who?
- You scared me.

Who is she? I just transferred here.
I don't know much.

116

What? It's nothing.

117
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,800
- By the way, is this your seat?
- No.

118
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,333
- Can I sit here then?
- Sure.

119
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,366

Do you know which college Chan Seong wrote
for the meeting with the teacher?

131

Which college did he write?

132
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't know either.

The number you called is busy.
Please leave a message after the beep.

- Look.
- This is crazy.

00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,933
Doesn't he look divine?

This was on at 8 p.m. yesterday.

143

another classroom, right?

Now I remember.
It changed to music, right?

- Hey, I didn't prepare for music class.
- Me, too.

- Let's go borrow the stuff.
- Yes, let's go.

148

- This is bad.
- What should we do?

- No.
- Of course, you did.

181
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,566
- A boyfriend?
- What?

182
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

183
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,100
It's not because of that...

184
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,433
Why did you sigh? What's wrong with that?

185
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:48,700
This isn't the time for that.
You'll be in the 12th grade soon.

186
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,000
So that's why you kept wanting
to quit the academy...

187
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
I told you it's not that.

188
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:02,766
Let's think of what to do.

189
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:05,633
We could move to
your aunt's school district.

190
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:09,100
I'll talk to your aunt
and you could stay with her...

191
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,133
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

192
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,233
- I can handle this.
- Handle what?

193
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,366
Do you think I ruined the test
because of a boyfriend?

194
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:21,066
I could've slacked off or hung out
instead of studying.

195
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:23,766
- Why is it all because of a boyfriend?
- Ji Yu!

196
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:27,833
My mind could've been occupied.
I could've been under the weather.

197
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,266
- You didn't even ask...
- Do you think I don't know?

198
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Know what?

199
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,266
You know nothing!

200
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,666
(- I was so scared. Are you okay?
- Mom made me angry. She's not even home.)

201
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,700
(It's so frustrating.
She knows nothing but thinks she does.)

202
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,000
(She was probably
just concerned about you.)

203
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:08,333
(Did you get home safely?)

204
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,466
Mark.

205
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,533
- Are you happy we're taking a walk?
- He's cute.

206
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,000
- Are you happy we're taking a walk?
- He's cute.

207
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,466
Mark, what do you think?

208
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:40,733
- Are you happy we're taking a walk?
- He's cute.

209
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,833
(Fragile)
