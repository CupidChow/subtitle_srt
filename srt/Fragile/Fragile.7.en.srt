1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:03,500
I sent you DMs and called you, too.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
My teacher had my phone.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,633
Mark, what do you think?
Are you happy we're taking a walk?

5
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:10,633
He's cute.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,533
But you got your phone back after class.

7
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:14,900
I went straight to play basketball.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,633
I'm really sorry.

9
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,766
Are you suspicious of Chan Seong?

10
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:20,300
If you know anything, be honest.

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,800
Thank you.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,200
San.

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,633
Don't spread rumors.

14
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:24,700
Is Ji Yu here?

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
I told you I'll see you, didn't I?

16
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,600
How do you two know each other?

17
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,300
("What Do You Like?")

18
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,066
We bumped into each other
on the way to school...

19
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,300
and he cracked his phone.

20
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,533
Do you really think
I expect you to buy me a meal?

21
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,400
It was an excuse.

22
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,166
Nam Do Ha? Just you two?

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,533
Then you wouldn't have told me
if San hadn't caught you.

24
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,433
What?

25
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,166
This is so upsetting.

26
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:45,833
Chan Seong.

27
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,933
You haven't even been around me.

28
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,966
- Hey.
- You're hiding something from me!

29
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,200
What am I hiding?

30
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,500
You would know better than I do.

31
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,966
Hey, Mi Na!

32
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:55,866
- Hey!
- Hey!

33
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,933
That face again.

34
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,833
Why do you always play the victim?

35
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,966
You still like Chan Seong, don't you?

36
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,066
That's why you only do this to Ji Yu.

37
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,033
What do you know?

38
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,700
I'll do something about the rumor.

39
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,666
It's not my first rumor.

40
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,566
Su Jin was a friend I really liked.

41
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,566
Nam Do Ha!

42
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,166
Why did you do that to me?

43
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,433
You two are silly.

44
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:24,166
I was just being nice,
and you fell for me.

45
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,433
I've never met girls as easy as you two.

46
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,800
You really are trash.

47
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Stop it.

48
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,633
Give it a rest.

49
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,800
It's embarrassing.

50
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,766
By any chance, is the one you like...

51
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,600
Then is it...

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,566
Yes.

53
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,100
(Fragile)

54
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,200
(Chapter 45
Monday, October 14th, 2024)

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,433
(Slut container)

56
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,533
(Did you let Do Ha do you?
I heard you'll do with anyone. How much?)

57
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,333
(I'm next. I put myself on the list.)

58
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,633
(I feel bad for Do Ha.)

59
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,300
(You can't live without boys
since you have no father.)

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,500
(They're all attention seekers.
That's why they hang together.)

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,200
(Dirty slut)

62
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,533
I didn't touch that.

63
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,266
What? Is something wrong?

64
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,666
Ji Yu, why don't you read our group chat?

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I know.

66
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,400
This is a serious offense.

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,766
You're ignoring your fellow warriors
who crushed Nam Do Ha with you.

68
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,066
What do you think about this?

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,233
Well...

70
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,666
Those crazy bastards.

71
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,033
They've gone insane.

72
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,700
- Ji Yu, are you okay?
- Yes.

73
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,600
Mi Na, you didn't get any messages?

74
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,633
Then that's a relief,

75
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,633
but I didn't expect it to be this bad.

76
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,966
Did we go overboard?

77
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,033
It must be me.

78
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,166
It's not you.

79
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,866
We made a scene,

80
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,100
but the kids who send
these types of messages are just crazy.

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You're right.

82
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,133
I've only heard about this.

83
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm just a bit shocked
since I've never experienced this.

84
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
It's okay.

85
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,966
How is this okay?

86
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,633
Then should you make a new account?

87
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,566
Avoiding it won't resolve this.

88
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's take screenshots first.
This is a crime.

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Hold on.

90
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,066
(You can't even see my eyes
face to face.)

91
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,133
(You bastards can't even look at my eyes.)

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,866
(You just run your fingers
like losers behind the screen.)

93
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,700
(I can tell how ugly you'd look,
you rotten bastards.)

94
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,100
(If you send me messages like these again,
I'll ruin all your lives.)

95
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,633
(Get ready to be investigated.
I've screenshotted your DMs.)

96
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,300
You can't stay quiet.

97
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,766
They'll go even wilder if you ignore them.

98
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,100
Thanks.

99
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,266
I wanted to curse them, too.

100
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,533
If anything like this happens again,
don't hide and tell us right away.

101
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,866
They must have nothing better to do.

102
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,233
It's okay. Forget about them.

103
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,366
I'll get over it.

104
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,233
Don't pretend like you're okay.

105
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,600
I feel reassured.

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,233
I'll beat them up if I see them.

107
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,633
Beat who?

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,666
Is it me?

109
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,966
Since we're on the subject,

110
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:31,400
did you send Ji Yu those stupid DMs, too?

111
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,900
Stupid DMs? What do you mean?

112
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,133
If not, never mind. You can go your way.

113
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:42,033
Why? Is someone bothering you?

114
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,033
What?

115
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,766
I don't know what it is, but it's not me.

116
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,866
Aren't you being biased
just because Do Ha's my friend?

117
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,700
Besides that,

118
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,800
you're buddying up when you're taken.
How can we think you're good?

119
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,200
Who said I had a girlfriend?

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,400
I've seen things. Don't play dumb.

121
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,733
I see.

122
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,933
I broke up with her.

123
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,566
I'm serious.

124
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,666
A Ra, let's just go.

125
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,300
About that time...

126
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,266
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,400
Okay. Reflect a lot on it.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,033
On page 101, look at Sentence A.

129
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,433
In front here on "In the light,"

130
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,966
with "of" in the back,
it means "to consider."

131
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:59,066
It can also mean "to reflect on."

132
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,066
(Hi!)

133
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,000
(Hi!)

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,000
(You just read it, you crazy slut.)

135
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,633
(Did you think I'd be scared?)

136
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:30,500
(Is it because you only have your mom?
You're so pathetic.)

137
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,733
(Does your mom know?
You bring home boys when she's away.)

138
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:56,100
If we look at Yi Yuk Sa's life...

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,633
in retrospect to reflect on it,

140
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,900
we realized that doubts are caused
by experiences sometimes, right?

141
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,933
That's why the memory
that triggers doubt...

142
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:09,900
is always held by people,
which we can understand from him.

143
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,633
Then if we look at the choices,

144
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:17,933
"A" is doubt, "B" is experience,
and "C" is memory...

145
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,666
Why are you still up?

146
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,533
I'm just watching lectures.

147
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Really?

148
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,900
Should we talk?

149
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,800
How is it studying by yourself?

150
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:58,100
- It's okay.
- Isn't it hard?

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,233
Do you want a tutor?

152
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,300
If you're going to nag, just leave.
I'm sleepy.

153
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,566
Ji Yu.

154
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,433
I told you I'll handle it myself.

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,633
Fine, I'm not trying to nag.

156
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,966
I'm worried about you.

157
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,166
I want to do whatever I can for you.

158
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:25,366
I should've been more attentive.

159
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,266
I feel bad.

160
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:36,033
Can't you tell me what's bothering you?
Please?

161
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,233
Do you want to move schools?

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
I talked to your dad.

164
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:55,266
He's fine with taking you.

165
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,166
If you want, I'll think about it, too.

166
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,666
Mom, it's not like that.

167
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,533
That time, I was just so...

168
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:06,966
I mean...

169
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,666
I really don't want to go.

170
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:15,100
I'm really serious. I want to be with you.

171
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,100
Okay, I got it.

172
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:26,533
Whatever is bothering you lately,

173
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,733
you're just not ready to talk yet, right?

174
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:35,200
But when you're ready, please tell me.

175
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:42,933
No matter what people say,

176
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,566
I'm always on your side.
You know that, right?

177
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,900
Yes, Mom.

178
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,066
(Chapter 47
Wednesday, October 16th, 2024)

179
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:13,300
We're going home.

180
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,700
What's wrong? Need to use the bathroom?

181
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,500
No, it's not that.

182
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,300
Are you sick?

183
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,166
Mi Na.

184
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,166
What is this?

185
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,533
For crying out loud. Let's go.

186
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,766
- Let's go.
- Bye.

187
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,133
Have a good time.

188
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:30,733
Sorry.

189
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,766
- Bye.
- I'm jealous.

190
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,366
San, just a moment.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
Did Chan Seong leave already?

192
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,000
He left early today.

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,666
What? Why?

194
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,000
He hasn't been doing well lately...

195
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,266
since that time.

196
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:58,833
Call him.

197
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,866
It's so small. Look at its coat.

198
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,933
I know. It's so cute.

199
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,933
Where is it going?

200
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,000
It's Su Ho.

201
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,633
I didn't expect that from him.

202
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,033
Come on.

203
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,800
He wouldn't be human
if he's mean to animals, too.

204
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,666
Let's go.

205
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:12,533
(Can you come out for a second?
I'm in front of your house.)

206
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,566
Are you doing better?

207
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,233
Yes, I'm feeling better.

208
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,400
Did you wait long?

209
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,900
No, I didn't wait that long.

210
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,500
- Sorry.
- What?

211
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:33,966
I shouldn't have avoided it.

212
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,366
I was embarrassed
for letting you see me like that.

213
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,666
No, I'm sorry.

214
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:48,200
Because of you, you had to...

215
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,100
No, it's not because of you.

216
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,500
I was just angry.

217
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Still, I hit him first.

218
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,833
- You know, right?
- Yes, I know.

219
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
- Ji Yu.
- What?

220
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:14,966
People make mistakes,

221
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,033
just like you and me.

222
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:29,600
But at this point,

223
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,666
we're both a bit...

224
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,833
Then...

225
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:54,366
how about we give it some time?

226
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,666
To figure out what to do.

227
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,833
To see what's better.

228
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:13,666
Okay, let's do that.

229
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,733
You study during break time?
That's not right.

230
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:31,600
I know.

231
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,866
A Ra, do you feel an urge to study?
Do you think about it?

232
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,266
We have a test coming up soon.

233
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,433
But am I the only one taking it?

234
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,933
So? What do we do after the test?

235
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,166
Isn't it too early?

236
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,300
- That way, we can have the best time.
- The best?

237
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,166
Then how about coming over to my house?

238
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,966
My mom will be away on a business trip.

239
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,366
- Really? We can sleep over?
- Yes.

240
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,066
Let's have a pajama party.
All of you bring your pajamas.

241
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,500
I should tell Ye Ri, too.

242
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,300
- What?
- Get off me.

243
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,066
What?

244
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,566
Mi Na looks after Ye Ri the best.

245
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,866
I know.

246
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,066
I'll bring something better than pajamas.

247
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,066
What is it?

248
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,900
- It's a secret.
- What?

249
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,300
- What is it?
- Hey.

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
(Slut container)

251
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Don't block my way.

252
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,866
Aren't you going too far?

253
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,833
You should seriously stop.

254
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,833
Let go.

255
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:57,100
You stop before I report you.

256
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,233
- What?
- Did you think I don't know?

257
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:09,366
This is you.

258
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
(You crazy slut. You left your friend
for a boy. You can't live without boys.)

259
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,233
(How ridiculous you are.
When I send you DMs, you read them.)

260
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,400
Are you shocked that you got caught?

261
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,333
(Don't make me angry.
You don't know what I'm capable of.)

262
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,533
No, it's not that...

263
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What is this?

264
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,966
Then who...

265
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,633
What is this? Why did you bring me here?

266
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,233
Why is she here?

267
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,000
Did you two make up?

268
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:00,366
Why?

269
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,800
Tell me.

270
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:07,633
Si Jung.

271
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,566
(Calling alclssus0330)

272
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:33,700
Was it really you? Why?

273
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,266
Are you crazy?

274
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,933
Su Jin, getting involved with Ji Yu
was hard for you, so I...

275
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,900
What? Do you know what you did?

276
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,666
You two hate each other's guts anyway.

277
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:56,200
- What?
- I was ending things once and for all.

278
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,766
Is that so bad?

279
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,300
- Si Jung.
- You only feel bad for Su Jin, right?

280
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,500
Have you ever given me
so much as an excuse?

281
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,100
You two don't know.

282
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,566
When we hung out,
you two were inseparable.

283
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Do you know how awful it feels
to be a third wheel?

284
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:34,800
Ta-da!

285
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,533
- My gosh.
- What's that?

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,933
Where did you get it?

287
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,366
My dad made this plum wine. I stole it.

288
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,400
That's wild!

289
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,466
We can't drink. We're still minors.

290
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,266
Why not? Seniors drink 100 days
before the CSAT.

291
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:48,300
This can be our drink
before the exam, too.

292
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,133
Do you even know how to drink?

293
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,266
No, but we can find out by drinking this.

294
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,966
Our youth is...

295
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,866
- Now!
- Now!

296
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:58,900
Bottoms up!

297
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,633
It's sweet.

298
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,566
- I can feel it running down.
- I know.

299
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:05,933
How strong is this?

300
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,133
You don't eat but drink well.

301
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,733
I guess I'm cut out for it.
Let's have another.

302
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,433
- Hey, Mi Na.
- Yes?

303
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,433
What's going on with San?

304
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,433
Yes, give us the scoop.

305
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,366
He likes me. It was love at first sight.

306
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:24,166
Look at you, Mi Na.

307
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,400
Cut that out.

308
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
Are you two going out then?

309
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,266
We're not at that point yet.

310
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:35,433
I'm just meeting him since he likes me.

311
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,566
Since we're at it, tell him to come.

312
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:40,366
- Right here?
- Send him a DM to tell him you miss him.

313
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,800
Would he come right away if he likes you?

314
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,633
Hey, this is my home.

315
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,700
Sorry, I'm drunk.

316
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,966
Ignore her. Her switch is off.

317
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,933
Okay.

318
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:02,800
- Why are you here?
- Me? Well...

319
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:08,800
Mi Na said he missed me, so...

320
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:10,800
And you don't miss her?

321
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,566
What do you like about Mi Na?

322
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:17,766
She's just pretty.

323
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,866
She's really kind and mature.

324
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,033
How far did you two go?

325
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,133
Stop it. You'll suffocate him.

326
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,633
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

327
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,533
Mom's calling me.

328
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:44,900
- Let me answer this.
- Okay.

329
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,900
- Wake Ye Ri up.
- Okay.

330
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,766
I said I'm fine.

331
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,166
Don't worry. I'll sleep soon.

332
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,266
Okay, Mom. Bye.

333
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,800
I feel tipsy.

334
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,866
- Lean on me.
- Okay.

335
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,266
- San.
- Yes?

336
00:23:58,366 --> 00:23:59,466
Next time.

337
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,866
When you're sober.

338
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,200
(Fragile)
