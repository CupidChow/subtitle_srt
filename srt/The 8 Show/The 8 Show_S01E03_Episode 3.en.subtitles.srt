1
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,279
CHOOSE A NUMBERED CARD
AND STEP THROUGH THE CURTAIN

2
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,530
"Numbered cards"?

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,241
THE RULE BOOK WILL BE IN YOUR ROOM,
ACCESSED THROUGH THE DOOR

4
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,858
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight,

5
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,693
fifty-nine,

6
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,237
sixty.

7
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,448
It's 210,000 won every minute.

8
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,367
Twenty-one.

9
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,537
I want to buy a 1,000-won pen.

10
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,831
SPECIAL PRICE

11
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,124
Prices are 100 times higher.

12
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,264
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM

13
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
FOURTEEN CAMERAS IN THE ROOM

14
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,422
I assume they were entertained

15
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,466
watching us struggle
when the show started.

16
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,012
They probably found it entertaining
to see us react to the varying prize money

17
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,556
when we were eagerly climbing stairs

18
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,309
'cause we thought
it could earn us more time.

19
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,852
But they kept watching, and--

20
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,020
They got bored.

21
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,689
They're tired of it.

22
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,360
Yes. I don't think
they find it amusing anymore.

23
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,987
-"Amusing"?
-But it's strange.

24
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,200
What was it
that they found so entertaining earlier?

25
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,409
Wasn't it interesting?

26
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,829
One person was foaming at the mouth,
while another got a nosebleed.

27
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,208
I found it funny, like a comedy show.

28
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,168
Hold on.

29
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,505
Does that mean
that's how we have to earn time now?

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,466
What? With my seizure?

31
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,134
I doubt it would be that.

32
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,054
I think we need to come up with
something entertaining.

33
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,847
"Something entertaining"?

34
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,812
CLIMBING THE STAIRS EXTENDS TIME

35
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,316
Yeah, I bet they're having a lot of fun.

36
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,069
They must be laughing at us,

37
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,155
watching as we become obsessed with money
and run like headless chickens

38
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,157
while they sit in their lofty castles.

39
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,994
Do you really want something fun?

40
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,497
Want me to show you something really fun?

41
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,250
Fine. Just you wait.

42
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,461
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

43
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,255
Greetings, this is 3rd Floor.

44
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,967
I'm assuming you are now bored
watching us climb stairs.

45
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,803
So the first event
I've prepared for you today

46
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,639
is mukbang. Here we go.

47
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,817
You can't have mukbang without ASMR.

48
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,161
What? Yeah.

49
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,375
Hey, 7th Floor.

50
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,836
Was time added?

51
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,174
No.

52
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,177
Oh, I see.

53
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,222
So what brings you here?

54
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,183
Well, if you're done eating…

55
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,643
An after-meal smoke?

56
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,318
I like you, 3rd Floor.

57
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,405
Sorry?

58
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,157
There is

59
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,328
something about you
that sets you apart from the others.

60
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,580
What do you mean?

61
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,834
You climbed the stairs
for 1st Floor earlier.

62
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,170
You don't just think about yourself.

63
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,924
Well, I guess so.

64
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,134
It's the same for the others.

65
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,971
You seem to be more considerate.

66
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,766
You haven't sent down your waste bags.
I sent mine.

67
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,439
This might be the first time
I've seen you smile.

68
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,366
It did bother me
that it was so easy to earn time,

69
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,577
but I thought the stairs was the answer.

70
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,623
Honestly, that's what I wanted to believe.

71
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,044
I thought going up and down the stairs

72
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,256
with sweat on our brows could provide us
with a reward for honest labor.

73
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,508
At least something like that.

74
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,301
I guess I was wrong.

75
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,263
This may be for the best.

76
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,933
Climbing the stairs was exhausting.

77
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,062
Don't you think
it might be easier to entertain them?

78
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,398
What do you think "entertainment" is?

79
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,316
Anything funny, I guess.

80
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,401
"Anything funny"?

81
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,653
You're right.

82
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,364
But what comes after that?

83
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,782
After that?

84
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,162
They'll get bored
with funny things soon enough.

85
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,789
And when they do,
they'll stop giving us time.

86
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,961
Right now, the hosts aren't interfering
with the show at all.

87
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:46,632
Yet they're prompting us
to entertain them of our own volition.

88
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,301
By using time, which is money.

89
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,555
Just like how people watch
what creators and influencers do

90
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,141
and press "like" or donate money.

91
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,019
But once they are bored,
they'll stop rewarding us.

92
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,397
Intoxicated by the rewards,

93
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,067
we'll give them what they truly want
to satisfy our thirst for money.

94
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,028
What's the thing

95
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,779
they truly want?

96
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,159
Real entertainment.

97
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,579
"Real entertainment"?

98
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,917
Once we all gather again,
we'll probably start sharing ideas.

99
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,546
Some of them will suggest
doing violent and provocative things.

100
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,298
How about professional wrestling?

101
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,676
Sure, wrestling is good.

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,262
Yeah, it's very entertaining and all.

103
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,182
We must control the discussion.

104
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,101
But don't you think it's too dangerous?

105
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,146
It's not like
there's an ambulance at the ready.

106
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,066
-Yeah, what if we get hurt?
-Yeah.

107
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,029
Please keep the proposal I'm about to make
between us for now.

108
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:55,034
Like you said, we'll focus on "funny"
from the entertainment categories.

109
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,038
I was thinking of a variety show.

110
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,291
We create a variety show
or something like that.

111
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,919
-I guess something funny?
-Yes.

112
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,962
Something funny?

113
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,465
-Like a skit?
-I don't do skits.

114
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,387
How about a dating show?

115
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,850
It's a popular kind of show
that guarantees solid viewership.

116
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,646
"So which participating couple
will stay together till the end?"

117
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,316
Or is that a bit much?

118
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,487
How about a talent show?

119
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,449
Do you really think non-showbiz people
like us can entertain them?

120
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,244
No. It's actually not a bad idea.

121
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,915
Skits and dating shows
would take a while for us to prepare,

122
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,836
but a talent show is something
we could do right away.

123
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,089
How about someone test it out?

124
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,969
We could try it and see
if time gets added before deciding.

125
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,639
Does anyone have a talent
that they can perform right now?

126
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,641
For God's sake.

127
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,269
Of all…

128
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,565
Since no one is volunteering,
I'll start it off.

129
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,367
Can I order a recorder?

130
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,708
Isn't a recorder a bit lame
for a talent show?

131
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,461
It's probably better to start off mellow

132
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,213
than to hit them hard from the start.

133
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,841
Ultimately, it will be inevitable,

134
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,678
but we should delay it
as much as possible.

135
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,982
Wow, 7th Floor…

136
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,032
I just had an eargasm.

137
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,493
He's a martyr.

138
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,539
He sacrificed himself
to avert people's attention to pure fun.

139
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,541
7th Floor, you're godlike.

140
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,834
You are simply…

141
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,504
Hey, look.
Didn't we just get 20-something hours?

142
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,965
We learned a hidden rule
after much trial and error.

143
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,133
We got a whole day!

144
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,759
7th Floor, you're awesome.

145
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,386
Were you in a circus or something?

146
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,971
It's a humble hobby of mine.

147
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,766
We should all prepare something
for the talent show.

148
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,184
We may have something funny.

149
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,397
Since we have more time now,

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,109
we can all think of what to do
for the talent show by tomorrow.

151
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,529
Actually, we have something more important
to discuss right now.

152
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,989
When do you want

153
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,991
to end this show?

154
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,081
Why are you thinking of leaving already?

155
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,251
Can't we talk about this

156
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,754
when everyone's made enough money?

157
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,714
At that rate, we may stay here forever.

158
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,632
He's right.

159
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,760
We're earning money here
to spend out there.

160
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,637
It might be good to draw a line
that's acceptable to all.

161
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,933
How will you decide what's acceptable?
Everyone is making different amounts.

162
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,644
What he said.

163
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,647
People on higher floors
may want to leave early

164
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,941
since you make more money.

165
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,860
In my opinion,

166
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,031
1st Floor should be the one to decide.

167
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,992
He earns the least out of all of us.

168
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,952
Even if it's difficult,

169
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,539
it's only right that we stick together
until he wants to leave.

170
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,541
Yeah, you decide.

171
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,461
How much will be enough for you?

172
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,922
There's no pressure.

173
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,636
I…

174
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,478
want to make one billion won.

175
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,647
I just need…

176
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,150
a billion won.

177
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,693
"Just"?

178
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,784
So you make 14.4 million won a day.

179
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:51,080
Assuming that you use 400,000 won a day,
it would take…

180
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:57,837
It would take about 75 days,
roughly two and a half months.

181
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,797
Yes.

182
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,677
-You're right.
-I'm quick with money, you see.

183
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,512
Suit yourselves.

184
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,598
Calculating the numbers,

185
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,184
if 1st Floor gets a billion,
2nd Floor gets two billion.

186
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,894
I get three billion.

187
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,355
4th Floor gets five billion.

188
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,357
5th Floor gets eight billion.

189
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,693
6th Floor gets 13 billion.

190
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,319
7th Floor gets 21 billion.

191
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,363
And 8th Floor gets 34 billion.

192
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,907
It's lucrative if we spend less.

193
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,077
After setting two months as our goal,

194
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,664
we decided to earn time with our talents
instead of the stairs.

195
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,083
We chose to buy supplies
for our talent show

196
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,711
with the time
7th Floor's crafty nose earned us.

197
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,629
Why bother lining up?

198
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,216
How come he never
discusses anything with us?

199
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,553
Give me ten roof tiles
so I can destroy them.

200
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,435
I also want ten roof tiles
and four wooden boards.

201
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,065
The talent show sparked
an odd competition.

202
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,737
They're all subtly checking each other out
so they can outperform everyone.

203
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,698
But as for me, more than ever…

204
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,076
I'm about to lose my mind.

205
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,663
Staying in the back seat.
Blending in with the crowd.

206
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,750
That was my life's motto
and the secret to a safe life.

207
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,837
I've never needed to be funny
or have a talent.

208
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,590
That one wild run in my life
brought me here to face this hell.

209
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,717
THE TALENT SHOW

210
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,638
You've waited for me all this time
And I want to live my life for you

211
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,642
Yes. A song is a nice,
tame start to a talent show.

212
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:39,271
The day you sat by me
And comforted me when I was down…

213
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,564
10 HOURS

214
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,774
REAL-TIME DONATION COUNT

215
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,276
1ST: 7TH FLOOR (24 HRS)
2ND: 5TH FLOOR (10 HRS)

216
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,780
As expected, 6th Floor shows off
his strength by breaking roof tiles.

217
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,038
15 HOURS

218
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,793
2ND: 6TH FLOOR (15 HRS)

219
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,888
Being conscious of 6th Floor,
2nd Floor did cool kicks and a punch.

220
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,643
17 HOURS

221
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,269
A better result than expected.

222
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,397
I can't believe how good they are.

223
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,273
This is driving me nuts.

224
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,609
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

225
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,444
It's just a sprain. It'll be fine.

226
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,154
The swelling looks bad.

227
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,991
Next up is 4th Floor.

228
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,951
Another song?

229
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,339
1 HOUR 50 MINUTES

230
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,882
Good work.

231
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,759
What? That's it?

232
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,386
Damn it.

233
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,642
Come on, don't be like that.
Give us more time. Pretty please?

234
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,394
Kisses.

235
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,070
Five minutes.

236
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,948
5TH: 4TH FLOOR (1 HR 50 MINS+5 MINS)

237
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,743
Wow. That really killed the mood.

238
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,912
Okay. Does anyone want to volunteer next?

239
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,128
1st Floor, do you have anything to show?

240
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,213
Well, I…

241
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,757
It's okay.

242
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,341
It's fine.

243
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,762
The losers always go last
in a talent show.

244
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,555
Since there are two more after me,

245
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,142
I will be forgotten.

246
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,312
Me!

247
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,189
I'll go next.

248
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,026
My heart is racing like I'm on stage.

249
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,916
My God.

250
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,585
Are you kidding me?

251
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,174
Eighteen?

252
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,718
6TH: 3RD FLOOR (18 MINS)

253
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,309
That was a bit disappointing.

254
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,019
No, not at all.

255
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,521
You did well.

256
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,399
We have two more people to go.

257
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,695
Just say you'll go first.

258
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,282
It's only the two of you.
It'll be better to get it over with.

259
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,201
What?

260
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,622
Me. I'll go next.

261
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,083
Sure.

262
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,476
Wow, he's really good.

263
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,357
Okay, up we go.

264
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,378
30 HOURS

265
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,672
Thirty hours? Awesome!

266
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,634
So far, we have earned

267
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,471
seventy-four hours and 13 minutes.

268
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,473
He kept acting like he had nothing.

269
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,475
We've earned around three days.

270
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,144
I can't trust anyone in here.

271
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,606
After the last person finishes,
we'll check the total time,

272
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,066
then we can talk again.

273
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,108
All right.

274
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,069
8th Floor.

275
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,697
I don't have to do it out here, do I?

276
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,201
No, not necessarily. Still…

277
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,205
If I don't have to do it here,
I want to do it in my room.

278
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,334
Do you wanna sleep with me?

279
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,923
What do you mean?

280
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,299
You heard me. Sex.

281
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,263
8th Floor, this is a talent show.

282
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,769
Talent shows are where we show off
what we're good at, no?

283
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,272
I'm amazing at it.

284
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,028
I decline.

285
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,407
Why?

286
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,787
That's right. This is wrong.

287
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,051
-What is she doing?
-1st Floor.

288
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,769
Me?

289
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,772
I really shouldn't.

290
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,109
What's she up to? Everyone's watching.

291
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,822
It's not me.

292
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,337
Winner.

293
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,593
Can they really do that?

294
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,095
Let her be.

295
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,723
She said it's her talent.

296
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,131
69 HOURS

297
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,384
I guess she really is good.

298
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,802
Goodness me.

299
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,430
But why 69 hours of all numbers?

300
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,808
Sorry?

301
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,155
3rd Floor.

302
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,783
Wanna sleep with me?

303
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,996
Sleep with me.

304
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,042
Come on, let's do it.

305
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,011
3rd Floor.

306
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,848
Sleep with me.

307
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,058
Please?

308
00:23:55,142 --> 00:24:00,939
Until the waters of the East Sea run dry

309
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,484
And Mount Baekdu is worn away…

310
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,785
Wanna sleep with me?

311
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,294
Not counting the time consumed,

312
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,713
we've earned around 120 hours.

313
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,214
Well done, everyone.

314
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,883
Don't you think it's a bit unfair?

315
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,136
I mean, some of them flopped.

316
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,345
LAST PLACE IN THE TALENT SHOW

317
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,890
Still, everyone participated,
so it was fair.

318
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,849
Excuse me.

319
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,437
Now that we know how to earn time

320
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,107
and don't have to run anymore,

321
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:48,111
what about the waste bags and the trash…

322
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,280
Oh my. You're right.

323
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,365
You were still keeping them.

324
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,161
Of course. There's no reason
for you to keep them anymore.

325
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,914
-Hey.
-Yes? What is it?

326
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,042
You're right, 1st Floor.
It slipped our minds.

327
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,794
No, it's fine.

328
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,506
I volunteered to do it.

329
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,633
But

330
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,302
my room is very small,

331
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,847
and it's really getting unbearable.

332
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,891
Of course. It's only fair.

333
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,809
So what do we do now?

334
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,977
Isn't it obvious?

335
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,231
We'll keep them in our rooms like before.

336
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,691
I don't like the sound of that.

337
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,943
So what?

338
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,820
We can use your room, then.
It's the biggest anyway.

339
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,198
You can't send them to my room.

340
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,827
The delivery chute only goes down,
doesn't it?

341
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,579
We can use your bathroom upstairs.

342
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,832
Hey, let's not argue.

343
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,836
Well, how about we just choose
a new bathroom?

344
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,508
Wouldn't that be better
than keeping the waste in every room?

345
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,554
1st Floor was kind enough to keep it.

346
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,806
Who else would volunteer to do the same?

347
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,768
I'm not asking anyone to volunteer.
I was thinking of it as a game.

348
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,564
We can play a game to pick the bathroom
or something like that.

349
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,816
We can turn it into a show.

350
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,777
I love it. One person takes the fall.

351
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,029
I love the thrill.

352
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,658
Well, how would we choose the room?

353
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,243
Drawing lots?

354
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,536
Let's vote.

355
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,249
-What?
-Let's vote rather than test our luck.

356
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,042
What kind of crap is that?

357
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:30,088
Being picked the most must mean
they deserve to keep the waste.

358
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,214
Cut the crap.

359
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,258
You're calling it a vote,

360
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,052
but it's really choosing
one person to pick on.

361
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,429
It's not picking on anybody.

362
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,098
We'd only be voting
for the best person for the job.

363
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,808
It's democratic.

364
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,060
And who'd be best at keeping poop?

365
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,646
Who? You?

366
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,732
-Watch it.
-What?

367
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,233
Okay, then.

368
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,236
Who wants to vote?

369
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,322
Me.

370
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,165
Okay, that's three of you.
And four, including me.

371
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,418
Are the four of you against it?

372
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,463
I'm not really against it, but…

373
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,175
Actually, I guess we have no choice.

374
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,470
Hold on. They say that this is a vote,

375
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,181
but won't they just vote for the worst
in the talent show?

376
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,142
That's right. Yes, you.

377
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,937
You and I are in a pickle.
You got 1.5 hours. I got 18 minutes.

378
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,107
SECOND TO LAST PLACE IN THE TALENT SHOW

379
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,400
Okay, then.

380
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,404
I came up with the idea
of picking a room to use as a bathroom.

381
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,450
-Hold on.
-So if everyone wants to vote, I'll do it.

382
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,243
Has she really lost her mind?

383
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,953
3rd Floor, how about…

384
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,124
Well,

385
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,628
I guess if everyone wants to do it,
I don't mind.

386
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,675
-Sure.
-Okay.

387
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,219
Jesus, what is 4th Floor thinking?

388
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,599
So who are you going to vote for?

389
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,601
-Me?
-Yes.

390
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,855
It would be either me or 3rd Floor.

391
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,858
It probably won't be you,
so don't worry too much.

392
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,195
How do you know that?

393
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,614
There's a good chance
1st Floor will be chosen.

394
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,492
What about 1st Floor?

395
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,372
He's been keeping our waste until now.

396
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,542
Won't everyone want to keep it that way?

397
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,961
There's a theory called
the broken windows theory.

398
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,296
If a place is already filthy,

399
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,676
people won't feel guilty
throwing away waste there.

400
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:45,432
I don't think my conscience
will let me vote for him.

401
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,683
Don't you feel the same?

402
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,311
Yes. Of course.

403
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,941
I think this vote is just a process
to get 1st Floor to accept reality.

404
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,819
And accepting it will help him endure.

405
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,948
The more I think about it,

406
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,034
the more it feels wrong
to toss them all to one person.

407
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,203
The way I feel right now,

408
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,665
it might actually be a relief
if I kept it instead.

409
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,168
Really?

410
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm just saying that's how I feel.

411
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,676
Excuse me.

412
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,682
Oh, 4th Floor.

413
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,976
What brings you here?

414
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,021
You're here too, 7th Floor.

415
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,690
1st Floor. Is he not here?

416
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,859
Where did he go?

417
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,902
4th Floor.

418
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,111
My gosh.

419
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,113
Let me be blunt.

420
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,033
About the vote,

421
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,911
I want to vote for 8th Floor.

422
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,496
What?

423
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,040
Why are you outside?

424
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,584
It's just that the room stinks.

425
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,129
That's why I'm outside.
Don't worry about me.

426
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,964
Oh, this is terrible.

427
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,469
Seeing what you're going through,
I just feel so bad.

428
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,765
Which room would suffer the least
from becoming a bathroom?

429
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,725
8th Floor's.

430
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,893
Her room's the biggest.

431
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:16,105
And things won't come down the chute
at night 'cause she's at the top.

432
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,774
Plus, she makes the most.

433
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,361
But money doesn't really have
much to do with this, does it?

434
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,323
Well, haven't you heard of
"oblesse noblige"?

435
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,533
Or something like that?

436
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,285
You know how much more she makes.

437
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,622
So, you know,
she should take on more responsibilities.

438
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:36,334
It's awful to hand over all the waste
to 1st Floor like we have been.

439
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,546
1st Floor, how long will you put up
with this in such a small room?

440
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,463
So?

441
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,508
Who are you trying to win over?

442
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,802
What?

443
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,806
I'm not trying to win anyone over.
We're just having a discussion.

444
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,307
Have you perhaps

445
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,436
thought about who you will vote for?

446
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,606
But aren't you close with 5th Floor?

447
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:05,113
The thing is, she's too nice,
so she's not all that reliable.

448
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,492
4th Floor says she convinced 1st Floor
to vote for 8th Floor.

449
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,495
The soft-hearted 1st Floor
didn't explicitly voice his opinion,

450
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,456
but she saw his eyes waver in her favor.

451
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,251
And finally, 2nd Floor.

452
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
2nd Floor.

453
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,503
-Get lost.
-Okay.

454
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:23,923
Not her.

455
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,843
We still have four votes
with the three of us and 1st Floor.

456
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,303
Shouldn't that be enough?

457
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,723
7th Floor. Are you inside?

458
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,434
I can't get caught in here.

459
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:35,852
I really can't.

460
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,356
Oh, so you are here.

461
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,151
What were you doing?

462
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,864
Just smoking.

463
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,240
Why don't we talk?

464
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,242
Sure.

465
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,244
See you later.

466
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,162
Right. Bye.

467
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,418
That was close!

468
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,088
It'd look weird if you got caught.

469
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,590
Of course!

470
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,800
It won't just be weird.

471
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,387
He'll probably throw a fit if he finds out
we're trying to vote for 8th Floor.

472
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,140
Right. Who do you think
6th Floor will vote for?

473
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,725
I mean, isn't it obvious?

474
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,061
Probably one of us or 1st Floor.

475
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,021
Right. Most likely.

476
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,522
Vote for 3rd Floor.

477
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,901
I thought 1st Floor,
but 3rd Floor was bad at the talent show.

478
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:29,030
I asked 8th Floor, and she said
she'd vote for whoever I vote for.

479
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,658
Let's keep this simple.

480
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,744
I'm not sure
it was a good idea to tell 7th Floor.

481
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,205
I blurted it out since he was here.

482
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,041
You don't think he'll join them, do you?

483
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,877
No. He's not the type to do that.

484
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,215
He didn't even send
his waste bags down to 1st Floor.

485
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,050
You never know what people might do.

486
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,636
All right?

487
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,304
Sure, all right.

488
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,724
The two of us need to stick together,
no matter what.

489
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,142
Of course.

490
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,603
Promise me you won't betray me.

491
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,271
Of course not!

492
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,899
I'm totally a woman of my word.

493
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,533
Everyone was given a day to think
before the anonymous vote.

494
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,370
But I feel antsy for some reason.

495
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,288
Me, 7th Floor…

496
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,542
After the stair climbing
and the talent show,

497
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,794
our third event to earn time

498
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,130
is "Vote for Your Bathroom."

499
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,589
VOTE FOR YOUR BATHROOM

500
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,091
Let us begin the vote.

501
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,051
1st Floor, please go first.

502
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,567
We'll now count the votes.

503
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,863
3rd Floor.

504
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,709
-Yeah, one vote is nothing.
-Right.

505
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,752
3rd Floor.

506
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,341
8th Floor.

507
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,688
Okay. 8th Floor.

508
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,691
Me?

509
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,783
8th Floor.

510
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
3rd Floor.

511
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,216
Why are the votes turning out like…

512
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,342
All right.

513
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,761
3rd Floor and 8th Floor
have three votes each,

514
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,805
so it's currently a tie.

515
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,313
It's a blank vote.

516
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,107
What? A blank vote?

517
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,983
Yes, this is the last vote.

518
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,285
What do you want?

519
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:24,997
Vote for 3rd Floor.

520
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,544
I think you're having the worst luck.

521
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,088
Your floor number is too low
compared to your skills.

522
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,506
Two months is a long time.

523
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,634
Let's spend it in comfort.

524
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,762
How?

525
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
How could we do that?

526
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,854
I guess I wasn't talking to a wall.
There are many ways.

527
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,482
I could hide some food
and give it to you later.

528
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,819
Or if you need anything,
I could buy it for you.

529
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,987
But why

530
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,990
3rd Floor out of everyone?

531
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,409
There's 4th Floor too.

532
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,952
3rd Floor

533
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,705
sucks so bad.

534
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,125
That dance!

535
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,337
What he did was an insult to dancing.

536
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,465
Can't argue there.

537
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,904
All right.

538
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,364
8th Floor.

539
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,871
Me?

540
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,169
Give it to me.

541
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,181
Is it really me?

542
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,892
8th Floor,

543
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,145
your room has been picked as the bathroom.

544
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,733
Wow, I've never been voted
for something like this.

545
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,068
Totally incredible.

546
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,780
Don't people normally applaud
when you get elected?

547
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,407
Oh, you're right.

548
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,659
A round of applause.

549
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,121
We earned 24 hours just for voting.

550
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,207
Wow, that's more than I expected.

551
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,419
Yes. It seems they considered this
a form of content.

552
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,089
How could they not?

553
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,842
I spent 24 hours going around campaigning,
just like in modern society.

554
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,889
I'm relieved that 8th Floor doesn't seem
too unhappy about the results.

555
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,849
By the way…

556
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,770
I wonder who voted for me.

557
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,605
Sorry?

558
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,357
Well, I got three votes.

559
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,568
If one is from 6th Floor
and another is from 8th Floor,

560
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,863
I was wondering
who the last vote was from.

561
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,076
In hindsight,
I don't think it was 2nd Floor.

562
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,453
That means it has to be 4th Floor.

563
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,748
I was wondering if she really betrayed me

564
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,500
after all that talk.

565
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm also curious,
but does it really matter?

566
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,010
I know, but--

567
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,469
Just forget about it.

568
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,515
-Still, we--
-It's over now anyway.

569
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,143
Care for a smoke?

570
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,896
Yeah. Sure.

571
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,650
-All right, then. It's in my room.
-Right, sure.

572
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,901
-Come on up.
-Okay.

573
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,657
This will come in handy
when it's bright out.

574
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,205
Thank you

575
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,167
for listening to me.

576
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,882
How are you going to do all this
by yourself?

577
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,137
Who do you want to give it to?

578
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,432
Sorry?

579
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,393
Everyone is coming to me,
trying to sway me,

580
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,063
but I don't know
what they're talking about.

581
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,399
The whole situation sucks, but to be fair,

582
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,695
we should listen to you
since you've suffered the most so far.

583
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,660
I would've voted for her
even without your input.

584
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,954
She deserves it.

585
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,290
She needs to learn
how to sacrifice for others.

586
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,418
For me,

587
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,962
it was just because

588
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,715
her room is the biggest.

589
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,385
It will be easier

590
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,846
for her to endure the waste.

591
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,391
That's also true.

592
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,232
That'll be a no.

593
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,235
Wait, what did you say?

594
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,778
What's going on?

595
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,865
I asked for her room card
to use the bathroom,

596
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,118
but she said no.

597
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,370
-What?
-Let me.

598
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,539
Excuse me, 8th Floor.

599
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,708
-We voted earlier.
-Yes, we did.

600
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,753
-And your room got the most votes.
-That's right.

601
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,382
So from 8:00 a.m. to midnight,

602
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,592
we decided to use it as a bathroom.

603
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,470
I'm not scolding you or anything.

604
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,223
I'm just clearing it up
in case you misunderstood anything.

605
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,808
No, there's no misunderstanding.

606
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,976
What?

607
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,186
I know that's what we agreed to do.

608
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,232
If you do, give me your card.

609
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,152
You even asked for applause earlier
for winning the vote.

610
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,570
This is ridiculous.

611
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,118
Thanks for your applause.

612
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,495
"Thanks"?

613
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,664
8th Floor.

614
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,291
I understand how you feel,

615
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,336
but we're all in the same boat,
so let's be considerate of each other.

616
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,254
Wait.

617
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,173
"In the same boat"?

618
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,550
Sorry?

619
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,094
This is why I shouldn't be kind to people.

620
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,847
-Bye.
-Has she gone mad? That little…

621
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,766
But we already agreed on the rules.

622
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,643
She can't back out all of a sudden.

623
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,397
Well, I guess it won't be easy
to accept at first.

624
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,441
Let's give her some time.

625
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,152
If only that were the case.

626
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,821
Sorry?

627
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,698
No, never mind.

628
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,162
For fuck's sake. What a bunch of dipshits.

629
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,331
"Dipshit"?

630
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,750
Wait. You're all gonna walk away?

631
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,045
But how will we relieve ourselves today?

632
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,173
She needs some time to process all this.

633
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,675
Just let her be today. Use your room.

634
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,053
Seriously, this is unbelievable.

635
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,846
How can she walk out on us?

636
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,057
-I know.
-What's she gonna do about it?

637
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,642
We all agreed on it.

638
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,190
Yeah. What's she gonna do about it?

639
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,859
At least that's what I thought then.

640
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,219
But 8th Floor responded
through the delivery chute.

641
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,930
Are you serious?

642
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,515
"I am…"

643
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,561
What the hell is this?

644
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,479
"…different."

645
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,732
Fucking bitch.

646
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,528
We all thought, "What's she gonna do?"
But then we realized…

647
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,407
we were all fucked.
