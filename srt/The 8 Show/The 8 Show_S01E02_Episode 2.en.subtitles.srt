1
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,687
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

2
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,523
Catch a tiger by the toe

3
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,568
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

4
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,323
Here I am.

5
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,076
Maybe I should've picked the 1st floor.

6
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,266
What's going on?

7
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,194
Oh my God!

8
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,324
This is gonna be fun!

9
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,761
It's so lame.

10
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,317
I want a full-length mirror.

11
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,069
A slip, a silk one.

12
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,821
A mattress.

13
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,325
And a blanket!

14
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,243
A microfiber one.

15
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,579
And a portable toilet too.

16
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,124
No more to spend!

17
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,724
So food and drinks are provided.

18
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,435
What about a table?

19
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,854
Protein.

20
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,900
Iron.

21
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,360
Perfect.

22
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,421
How pretty!

23
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,868
Your expressions are so funny!

24
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,495
"Funny"?

25
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,625
We just learned that the prize money
for each room is different.

26
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,086
Everyone should share theirs.

27
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,713
How much do you all get?

28
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,714
For me,

29
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,633
80,000 won a minute.

30
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,801
You get 80,000?

31
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,678
I get 30,000 won.

32
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,098
-20,000 won.
-130,000 for me.

33
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,142
Wait. What is this?

34
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,935
Everyone's is different?

35
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,313
And you, 7th Floor?

36
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,273
How much do you make a minute?

37
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,816
I get 210,000 won.

38
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,695
And 8th Floor
should get exactly 340,000 won.

39
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,573
How do you know?

40
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,202
Did you just calculate the numbers
in your head?

41
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,998
No. If you think about the prize money
going from the 1st to the 8th floor,

42
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,625
there's a pattern.

43
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,754
If you add the two preceding numbers,
you get the next one.

44
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,382
1st Floor said he gets 10,000 won.

45
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,092
2nd Floor gets 20,000.

46
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,218
Yes.

47
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,552
You're right.

48
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,138
Yes. Add those two numbers,
and you get three.

49
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,808
That's why 3rd Floor
is getting 30,000 won.

50
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,768
Yes, it's 30,000 won for me.

51
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,813
I'm right above 3rd Floor
on the 4th floor,

52
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,566
so if I add 2nd Floor's 20,000
and 3rd Floor's 30,000, yes,

53
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,567
I get 50,000 won.

54
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,737
Wait. I'm getting 80,000 won, so…

55
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,490
That's the sum of 3rd Floor
and 4th Floor's prize money.

56
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,658
Then the next floor--

57
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,827
6th Floor's is five plus eight,
which is 130,000 won.

58
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,955
The same goes for me,
and I get 210,000 won.

59
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,415
That's how 8th Floor gets…

60
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,376
340,000 won.

61
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,711
Yes, that's right.

62
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,548
It's the Fibonacci sequence.

63
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,261
I've heard of that.

64
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,431
But what does it have to do
with our prize money?

65
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,765
Why does it apply here?

66
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,435
I wouldn't know the hosts' intentions,

67
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,312
but they seem like an interesting lot.

68
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,982
The Fibonacci sequence

69
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,484
creates a golden ratio.

70
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,403
-A golden ratio?
-Yes.

71
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,321
In a Fibonacci sequence,

72
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,116
if you divide a number
by its preceding number,

73
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,621
the ratio converges to approximately 1.6
as the numbers increase.

74
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,874
This 1 to 1.6 ratio
is called the golden ratio

75
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,752
because, for humans,
it provides a sense of security

76
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
and is perceived as beautiful.

77
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,424
For example, the ratio
of a credit card's dimensions

78
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,967
is close to the golden ratio.

79
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,431
Coincidentally, the floor cards
we picked up on our way in…

80
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,808
Are the size of a credit card.

81
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,810
But isn't this unfair?

82
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,480
This was all random.

83
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,856
This is really fucked up.

84
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,691
You're the ones who picked them.

85
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:08,154
Stop whining,
and let's take a look at everyone's rooms.

86
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:14,327
8th Floor gets 340,000 per minute,
489.6 million won a day.

87
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,957
7th Floor gets 210,000 per minute,
302.4 million won a day.

88
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,545
6th Floor gets 130,000 per minute,
187.2 million won a day.

89
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,550
5th Floor gets 80,000 per minute,
115.2 million won a day.

90
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,804
4th Floor gets 50,000 per minute,
72 million won a day.

91
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,850
3rd Floor gets 30,000 per minute,
43.2 million won a day.

92
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,939
2nd Floor gets 20,000 per minute,
28.8 million won a day.

93
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,276
This is so damn small.

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,819
Watch your head.

95
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,448
1st Floor gets 10,000 per minute,
14.4 million won a day.

96
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,159
This is so annoying.

97
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,372
I could've chosen the 8th floor.

98
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,792
No point regretting it now.

99
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,086
We chose the cards at random.

100
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,715
I didn't get much choice.
There were only two cards left.

101
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,968
You still managed to pick
better than I did.

102
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,178
And, you know…

103
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,018
What kind of show doesn't provide
such important information?

104
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,438
This should be illegal.
We should report it.

105
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,524
Still, you guys are so lucky.

106
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,487
I thought 10,000 won per minute was a lot.

107
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh, 1st Floor.

108
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,033
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,077
We should've been more considerate.

110
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,995
Sorry?

111
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,330
Please don't be!

112
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,419
I wasn't trying to make you uncomfortable.
I was just unlucky.

113
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,337
I had other cards to pick from.

114
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,257
Besides, my legs are like this,

115
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,510
so I would've had trouble
with a higher floor.

116
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,980
I love the look on your faces!

117
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,524
Do you think this is funny?

118
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,194
That little…

119
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,112
What?

120
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,156
No one's in the wrong here.

121
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,658
Stop blaming each other.

122
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,119
It's not like we picked
the higher floors on purpose.

123
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,832
Today's cardio is done!

124
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,254
Whether you get 10,000
or 340,000 won a minute, in the end,

125
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,632
don't we all have the same goal?

126
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,760
Keep the show going
for as long as possible

127
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,012
and maximize our profit.

128
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,181
Isn't that our goal?

129
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,266
This is fucked, but he's right.

130
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,976
If you're all done whining,

131
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,562
shall we go eat?

132
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,483
Right. Let's all go eat now.

133
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,651
Come on, let's go.

134
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,944
The food and water.

135
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,113
How much will you send down?

136
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,206
It's crappy enough to get paid less
for being on a lower floor.

137
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,458
Do you want us to eat less too?

138
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, no.

139
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,674
I thought of a way for us
to share the food equally.

140
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,927
May I explain?

141
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,142
Each person takes one meal kit.

142
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,147
From the 8th floor to the 1st floor,
one per person, which is fair.

143
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,609
They look so good!

144
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,820
This show puts us in an extreme situation.

145
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,490
Working as a community
is more vital than ever.

146
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,328
We need to unite as one
and trust each other.

147
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,209
That means there will be four left
after 1st Floor takes his.

148
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,169
What?

149
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,422
Why are we giving him four more?

150
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,590
No. That's not what we're doing.

151
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,594
Nobody will be left starving
if we each take one.

152
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,431
But if anyone wants more,

153
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,643
you can come down to the 1st floor
and share what's left.

154
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,439
A system where no one's at a loss.
Everyone has to give up a little,

155
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,276
but everyone can share the leftovers,
so no one loses out.

156
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,696
Naturally, this will build trust among us.

157
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,531
Have the seasoned ones.

158
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,782
-These?
-Yes.

159
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,700
Why?

160
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,119
'Cause it's hot.

161
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,705
-Are you finished?
-Eat up.

162
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,166
Yum. It's good.

163
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,050
Do you have any idea
what's in store for us?

164
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,510
Sorry?

165
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,638
We don't know what to expect,
so it's scarier.

166
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,100
Earlier, you said
you didn't know what to expect,

167
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,269
so you were scared.

168
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,692
Yes. I think I have a rough idea
of what they want.

169
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,321
-What's that?
-Hey!

170
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,948
What are you doing?

171
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,202
What the hell are you doing?

172
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,704
We only have 15 minutes left!

173
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,216
Which one looks better?

174
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,927
She didn't buy them with time, did she?

175
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,264
Hey. If you want to buy clothes,
you should do it in your damn room!

176
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,724
Why fucking buy them out here?

177
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,644
Because if I do,
I can't wear them out here.

178
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,605
I want to wear them out here.

179
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,858
Why the swimsuit? There's no water.

180
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,944
-For tanning.
-You crazy bitch.

181
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,071
Do you have a death wish?

182
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,156
Talk it out. Don't intimidate her.

183
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,121
Is it because of this?

184
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,628
We can always extend that thing. Time.

185
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,922
How would we do that?

186
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,217
None of you know? Really?

187
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,010
How to extend it?

188
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,974
It's the stairs!

189
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,185
-The stairs?
-Yes.

190
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,688
There's a ton of stairs here.

191
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,524
The time extends whenever we step on them.

192
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,528
-Do you have proof?
-Proof?

193
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,864
Wait. What was it again?

194
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
Stop messing around and tell us.

195
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,870
I'll tell you if you apologize to me.

196
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,079
What?

197
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:36,542
I'll tell you if you apologize
for cursing at me before.

198
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,503
I'm so freaking sorry.
I apologize instead.

199
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,297
We have no time. Tell us already!

200
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,673
I guess that's a no.

201
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,383
You motherfucker!

202
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,427
Use your words.

203
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,554
-What's your problem?
-Just get it over with.

204
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,055
Can't you see everyone?

205
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,063
-No!
-I can't let it end like this.

206
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,232
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

207
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,366
Who cares if she's wrong?
We have less than ten minutes!

208
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,201
-Okay.
-Let's give it a go.

209
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,892
For fuck's sake! Are you sure this is it?

210
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,606
It's still going down!

211
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,983
Less than 30 seconds left!

212
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,803
It's over? Just like that?

213
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,310
Back to 24 hours!

214
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,734
I told you, didn't I?

215
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,445
I told you it's the stairs.

216
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,447
That's what we've been doing.

217
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,493
To check out my room and everyone else's
and to get the meal kits?

218
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,204
I saw how the time extended then!

219
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,375
I'm pretty smart, aren't I?

220
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,837
Just like that,
we discovered a hidden rule.

221
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,463
Climbing stairs extends the time.

222
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,674
FOOD AND ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED
SPEND TIME TO EARN MONEY

223
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,718
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS
CLIMBING THE STAIRS EXTENDS TIME

224
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,261
I thought it was all over.

225
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,554
That was close.

226
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,643
Yes. I think I have a rough idea
of what they want.

227
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,563
Conflict. They want us
to fight each other.

228
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,691
Crises from the outside

229
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,069
will only make us cooperate and persevere.

230
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,529
But internal conflicts…

231
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,283
If we fall apart internally,

232
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,618
it's irreparable.

233
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,539
Yes, we need to stay united
through cooperation and perseverance.

234
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,917
Man, that 7th Floor is one smart guy.

235
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,546
I'll use this as long as possible
to avoid buying it again.

236
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,173
Three…

237
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,135
Two sheets should be enough.

238
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,854
It wasn't enough.

239
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,737
It pisses me off
the more I think about it.

240
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,616
I make 40 million every day.
I shouldn't skimp on things like this.

241
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,243
Don't chicken out. Just buy it!
Yeah, let's do it!

242
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,747
Excuse me. I'm gonna go big here.
Get me a portable toilet.

243
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,873
A simple one.

244
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,462
Yes.

245
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,463
Bring it.

246
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
I can't get a refund, can I?

247
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,569
That crazy bitch.

248
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,324
I can't believe she bought clothes.
It pisses me off.

249
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,410
Damn it. She's so annoying.

250
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,748
We did great.

251
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,001
This is all for us later.

252
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,753
Look how much money we made.

253
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,901
Okay, shall we get started?

254
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,446
STAIR CLIMBING

255
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,536
+210,000 WON
+20,000 WON

256
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,204
+30,000 WON
+50,000 WON

257
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,998
+340,000 WON
+80,000 WON

258
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,791
+130,000 WON
+10,000 WON

259
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,252
After learning
that stair climbing extended our time,

260
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,420
we climbed up and down

261
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,340
until our hearts were about to burst
and our legs were shaking.

262
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,719
The more time we gained,
the hungrier people got,

263
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,304
so the 1st floor became popular.

264
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,691
We were worn out every night,

265
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,943
but we couldn't complain.

266
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,389
I don't even feel like I've eaten.

267
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,226
Eating once a day

268
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,604
and nibbling on leftover food like this
is barely enough.

269
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,274
We go up and down those stairs
over and over every day.

270
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,359
It's all too harsh.

271
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,111
Even if the prices
were 1,000 times higher,

272
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,030
I'd like to buy some food.

273
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,411
-Like those hot dogs downstairs.
-I want burgers.

274
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,746
Fried chicken for me.

275
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,417
Let's split up.

276
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,213
We should divide our work.

277
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,636
So you want us to split into two teams
and climb the stairs every other day?

278
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,055
Yes. We can work one day,
then rest the next.

279
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,141
We'll give the leftover food
to the team that worked.

280
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,102
The working team can get two meals a day.

281
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,271
A single meal should be enough
on days off.

282
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,314
Yes. I agree with this.

283
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,528
One meal is enough when we're not working.
It's better to rest, isn't it?

284
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,113
I agree.

285
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:22,948
Same here.

286
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,700
Let's try it.

287
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,495
We'll see how much time we get.

288
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,043
How about we split up like this?

289
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,549
I'm switching teams.

290
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,342
We don't get along.

291
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,762
Me?

292
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,311
Is anyone willing
to switch teams with 2nd Floor?

293
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,188
The whiny chick. The thug.

294
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,732
The wacko.

295
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,733
THUG, WHINY CHICK

296
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,235
Who'd want to join that team?
The members speak for themselves.

297
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,655
Excuse me. I don't mind which team I'm on.

298
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,876
This is nice.

299
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,129
Two men on each team is perfect, isn't it?

300
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,339
Yes, this is great.

301
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,426
It was an excellent idea
to split into two teams.

302
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,846
Despite the hard work,
the prospect of resting the next day

303
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,140
is enough motivation.

304
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,436
And the best part is

305
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,689
you can eat to your heart's content
on the days you work.

306
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,026
"Those who do not work shall not eat."

307
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,744
-Are you okay?
-I almost hurt my back!

308
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,245
I'm sorry, 4th Floor.

309
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,955
-Whatever.
-I'm really sorry.

310
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,416
I'm so sorry. Really.

311
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:01,797
Are you okay?

312
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,678
Yeah, I'm okay.

313
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,942
Wipe that smile off your face
and get to work.

314
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,445
We're not gaining any time because of you.

315
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,656
What are you doing?

316
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,773
I'll fill in.

317
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,484
Sorry?

318
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,445
Get some rest. I'll fill in for you.

319
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,157
Any objections?

320
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,122
-No, I can--
-Forget it.

321
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,208
I feel stiff when I don't exercise.

322
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,126
I can…

323
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,754
How admirable.

324
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,886
THE NEXT DAY

325
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,411
You must be tired
from working two days in a row.

326
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,871
It's fine.

327
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,587
THE DAY AFTER

328
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,774
Should I help

329
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,400
or not?

330
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,154
Should I help or not?

331
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,367
Help? Or not? Should I help or not?

332
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,036
Should I help or not? Help or not? Wait…

333
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,955
Oh! Excuse me! Mr. 1st Floor.

334
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,260
Please go rest, 1st Floor. I'll do it.

335
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,469
Sorry, what?

336
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,679
Goodness, no.

337
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,430
-No, let me.
-I have to do it today.

338
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,226
Really. Look, I ate too much yesterday.

339
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,186
I'm having trouble digesting.

340
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,023
Yeah, so please go rest and recover.

341
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:07,983
Goodness.

342
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,943
I'm so sorry.

343
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,902
It's really fine.

344
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,363
Sorry, let me through.

345
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,575
Excuse me. Coming through.

346
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,495
God, we're all tired too.

347
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,540
We're all running
like our lives depend on it.

348
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,306
-Please have a seat.
-Sit here.

349
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,517
Shouldering extra work for a teammate.

350
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,019
How awesome am I?

351
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,021
I got this!

352
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,614
3rd Floor. You can't be here like this.

353
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,075
-Let's go.
-Wait, give me five more seconds.

354
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,038
Come on. Let's get up.

355
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,955
It's not…

356
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,873
Try to get up.

357
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,708
Gently, please. Yeah.

358
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,129
Please have a bite to eat.

359
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,255
Enjoy your meal.

360
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,173
Thank you.

361
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,008
This way.

362
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,718
You're going to eat?

363
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,637
Sorry?

364
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,555
Are you actually gonna eat?

365
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,727
Come on, 4th Floor.

366
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,939
I mean, honestly speaking,

367
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,901
shouldn't 3rd Floor be eating instead?

368
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,989
Do you really need both meals
when you haven't even worked?

369
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,786
Think you're clever, don't you?

370
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,581
You have one extra
since 8th Floor doesn't eat anyway.

371
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,334
Why are you tripping?

372
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,090
I'm not saying you shouldn't eat.

373
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,551
You know? I was just saying it's not fair.

374
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,389
You should eat--

375
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,611
3rd Floor, please go on in.

376
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,279
You worked instead of me today.

377
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,366
-Sure.
-Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,203
You think we worked instead of you
for the fucking food?

379
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,248
You think he could eat this
with a clear conscience?

380
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,165
Am I wrong?

381
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,669
No, you're right.

382
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,548
Don't mind them. Just go eat.

383
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,885
They're just bitching
because they're fed up and tired.

384
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,472
Yes, she's right.

385
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,727
You should go and eat, 1st Floor.
It's just how it is.

386
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,020
No need to mind me. Yeah.

387
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,189
No. Please.

388
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,154
Go on. You should go and--

389
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,824
Come on. Just go in and eat.

390
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,617
-Thank you, 3rd Floor.
-Sure.

391
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,369
-No, still, he--
-Come on.

392
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,872
Just go eat. He said he was fine with it.

393
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,875
Are you okay?

394
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,586
Of course.

395
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,921
Because of this asshole,

396
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,299
I ended up coming
to this godforsaken place…

397
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,216
IN YOU, I TRUST

398
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,428
…and climbing a lifetime's worth
of stairs, you son of a bitch.

399
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,846
WEASEL

400
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,514
It's all your fault.

401
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,853
My legs.

402
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,524
Food is here.

403
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,116
What's all this?

404
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,204
Seriously, what the hell?

405
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,872
-3rd Floor.
-Yes?

406
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,879
Something fell, right?

407
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,966
I thought it was food,
but they sent down poop bags!

408
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,636
-For God's sake.
-1st Floor said to send them down.

409
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,180
I've given it some thought.

410
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,433
Since I'm not great at climbing stairs

411
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,644
and people keep filling in for me,

412
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,564
I thought of what I could do to help.

413
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,525
And, well…

414
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,193
1st Floor said he was torn up

415
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,862
about how he was impeding us
due to his condition.

416
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,324
I thought we'd be even
if you all sent down…

417
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,744
your waste bags to me.

418
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,288
Really?

419
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,516
While pondering what he could do
for the team instead of physical labor,

420
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,893
he said the delivery chute caught his eye.

421
00:30:55,562 --> 00:31:01,651
It occurred to him that we could send
things other than meal kits through it.

422
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:09,117
1st Floor's proposal and our acceptance
established a sanitary worker among us.

423
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,288
When everyone fulfills their roles,

424
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,207
society reaches equilibrium
and functions smoothly.

425
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,669
And 1st Floor had found it.

426
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,756
A newfound self-value worth bartering.

427
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,524
Those less prone to hunger
share their food.

428
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,278
Get some rest.

429
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,281
I'll take it from here.

430
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,575
Those with fitter bodies
share their manpower.

431
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,914
Those who can't share those things
offer their space for communal use.

432
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,125
All in all, it's a pretty fair deal.

433
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,087
I'll see you later.

434
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,424
Hello, 1st Floor.

435
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,386
This will make it
more comfortable for you.

436
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,806
There's no need. We're fine.
Please do it later.

437
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,027
Are you done eating, 3rd Floor?

438
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,489
Not yet. I think I ate too fast.
I don't feel good.

439
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,406
I see.

440
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,997
What are you looking at?

441
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,083
The time…

442
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,420
It has been extending irregularly lately.

443
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,592
It shot up before midnight yesterday,
but now it has stopped increasing.

444
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,388
Do you think
it's because we're not climbing enough?

445
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm not sure. Everyone's doing their job.

446
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,442
Did you see that?
We just got ten more minutes.

447
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,446
But everyone's taking a break
after the meal.

448
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,614
Did someone go up?

449
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,716
Fuck. What's wrong with that thing?

450
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,263
I told you.
They're getting stingier with time.

451
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,515
It's barely going up.

452
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,602
Do they want us
to ramp up the workload or what?

453
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,938
We're not Olympic athletes.

454
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,608
I'm over this.

455
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,820
-I'm sorry?
-What?

456
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,488
I'm not doing this anymore.

457
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,075
But we can't just stop working.

458
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,326
What are you doing?

459
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,078
It's not fun anymore.

460
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,997
Good luck, you three.

461
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,498
Just shut up and do it!

462
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,876
Why should I?

463
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,591
Hey. Shouldn't you be working harder
than the rest of us?

464
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,261
You make way more than we do.

465
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,139
Shouldn't you put in
a bit more effort than us?

466
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,979
Shouldn't you
and the people on the lower floors

467
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,523
work harder instead?

468
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,941
What?

469
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,068
Think about it.

470
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,862
You don't want to use your money,

471
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,532
so you've used our shared time
to buy toilet paper, wet wipes,

472
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,617
and other necessities.

473
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,369
Technically,
if we're using time to buy items,

474
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,415
aren't those on the top floors
paying far more than you guys?

475
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,750
That wacko…

476
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,835
After all, time is money here.

477
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,587
…isn't wrong.

478
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,341
An hour is only worth
1.2 million won to 2nd Floor,

479
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,094
but worth a whopping 20.4 million won
to 8th Floor.

480
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,847
Since we're using the time we share,

481
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,767
the higher floors
are technically spending more money.

482
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,187
I didn't take her as a thinker.
She's surprisingly sharp.

483
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,316
Let's keep climbing the stairs
instead of wasting time arguing.

484
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,693
The show's going to end at this rate!

485
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,946
Hey, let's climb with them.

486
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,697
We should help out.

487
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,617
Are you sure
climbing stairs gives us more time?

488
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,535
What?

489
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,036
It's strange.

490
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,414
We've been climbing the stairs
at the same rate.

491
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,089
That crazy bitch.

492
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,654
We've actually lost time
instead of earning it.

493
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,867
What if it doesn't go up anymore?

494
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,743
You're right.

495
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,955
We've been at this for over six hours.

496
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,499
We haven't earned a minute.

497
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,918
It'll be midnight soon,
so we must go to our rooms.

498
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,962
We can't do more today.

499
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,923
What? It just went up.

500
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,969
Hey, it just went up!

501
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,220
-Twenty minutes?
-Finally!

502
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,722
Wasn't that 20 minutes?

503
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,348
It must be lagging.

504
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,933
I guess it's working again now.

505
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,560
Hey, I knew it.

506
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,937
We were worried for no reason. I knew it.

507
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,647
-What a relief.
-Yeah.

508
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,482
I'm so glad.

509
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,028
I guess it'll go up,
even if it takes time.

510
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,654
It's midnight.

511
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:40,907
Let's all go in.

512
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,783
Great job today.

513
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,334
Let's go inside. Good work.

514
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,084
Everyone, come outside! Get out here!

515
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,421
I don't think we've been rewarded
our time. Hurry up, and come out!

516
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,714
Everyone, start running.

517
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,132
Everyone!

518
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,051
Let's run, everybody.

519
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,388
But we didn't even get our time
for yesterday's work.

520
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,181
What if it's of no use again?

521
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,392
Still, it's the only option we have.

522
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,310
Start climbing the stairs, everyone!

523
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,024
This is fucking bullshit.

524
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,291
-She fell on her back!
-4th Floor!

525
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,542
-What?
-She just--

526
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,543
Hold on.

527
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,378
-It's an epileptic seizure.
-What?

528
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,006
It's epilepsy! Don't touch her!

529
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,883
-Oh, epilepsy.
-Wait, we need to--

530
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,427
Do you have medical training?

531
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,055
-Yes, I was a nurse.
-Is there medicine for this?

532
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,557
She needs Phenytoin.

533
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,816
Stay where you are.

534
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,192
What are you saying?

535
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,028
Don't do anything. She won't die.

536
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,696
What?

537
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,781
Epilepsy doesn't kill.

538
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,242
Leaving her like this for so long
may damage her brain.

539
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,869
The medicine won't be cheap.

540
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,456
If we use up the little time we have,
the game is over!

541
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,333
You're not even human.

542
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,170
Don't get in my fucking way.

543
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,102
We need medicine for epilepsy! Phenytoin!

544
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,993
This is too funny.

545
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,373
Don't you see what I see?

546
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,625
Don't you all see that?

547
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,005
Forty hours?

548
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,719
This is so much fun.

549
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,096
It wasn't the stairs

550
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,182
that gave us more time.

551
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,350
Then what was it?

552
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,405
What, then?

553
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,699
What gives us more time?

554
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,617
It must be…

555
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,164
entertaining to watch.

556
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:45,294
PHENYTOIN
