1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,052
I thought I'd be different.

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,852
I didn't dream of becoming the president,
a novelist, a K-pop star, or a landlord.

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,479
But I still had hopes and dreams.

4
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,774
None had me standing on a bridge,

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,194
looking down at the river
and about to jump in.

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,531
Mr. Bae Jin-su!

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,120
"MR. BAE JIN-SU!"

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,541
"COME ON OUT
AND PAY UP WHAT YOU OWE!"

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,335
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

10
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,129
My baby's trying to sleep.

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,881
Goodness, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,508
There's a rat living here
who owes 900 million.

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,510
-Oh dear. Let's go inside.
-Hey!

14
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,056
You said you'd pay us back soon,
that you'd hit the jackpot!

15
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,390
What the heck?

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,854
Hey, Bae Jin-su!

17
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,815
Bae Jin-su, stop, you punk!
Bae Jin-su! You punk!

18
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,833
Excuse me. We're filming here.

19
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,711
You can pass through over there.
Please go that way.

20
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,507
That way, please.

21
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,885
-Thank you.
-Where did that bastard go?

22
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm sick and tired of these loan sharks.

23
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,475
I never wanted to borrow from them.

24
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,060
Excuse me. Who are you?

25
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,645
Sorry?

26
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,689
I'm just passing through.

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,484
Excuse me.

28
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,614
Wow, celebrities.

29
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,373
Out of curiosity,
why do you film in this area so often?

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,667
-Sorry?
-Never mind.

31
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,588
My neighborhood has become
a symbol of poverty.

32
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,675
All I wanted was to escape this place.

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,761
How long do you plan on living here?

34
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,639
Won-seok left his money with me.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,725
Do you know how much I made for him? 600%.

36
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,520
He borrowed 500 million to invest.

37
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,896
He now has three billion.

38
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,232
He even quit his job.

39
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,612
Why bother saving pennies
from your measly salary?

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,115
You can't even buy a house in Seoul.

41
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,910
Our generation needs
a new way to become rich.

42
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,454
Real money is made by investing.

43
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,748
Trust me, save all you can.

44
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,917
Three billion? I'll make you five.

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,003
Go big or go home, kiddo.

46
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,713
Let's go.

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,133
You still have a chance.

48
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,720
That weasel is the reason

49
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,473
I took out a bank loan and borrowed
from loan sharks in the first place.

50
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,353
IN YOU, I TRUST

51
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,272
Come on, answer.

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,399
The person you're trying to reach
is unavailable.

53
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,943
The news keeps reporting
about small businesses going under…

54
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,861
THIS IS JIN-SU

55
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,863
…but new businesses emerge daily.

56
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,990
Based on statistics,

57
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,826
the chance of winning the lottery
is one in 8,145,060.

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,329
Yet thousands of tickets are sold daily.

59
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,790
Furthermore, only a handful
profit from stock trading,

60
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,918
but thousands of new accounts
are created daily.

61
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,377
Why, you ask?

62
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,630
Because we're deluded.

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,466
"You'll go broke, but I'll get rich."

64
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,259
"You'll lose, but I'll win."

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,970
-"You'll go under, but I'll flourish."
-Dumbass.

66
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,892
Misfortune grows from the delusion
that you are different from others.

67
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,519
"Make a word out of 'poverty.'"

68
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,063
"Over?"

69
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,150
"Correct. Your life is over."

70
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,862
I even gave him my severance pay,
not that it was much.

71
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,905
Son of a bitch!

72
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,491
But I haven't heard from the bastard
in six months.

73
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,412
A part-time job at a convenience store.
9,860 won an hour.

74
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,830
TOTAL PAY 19,720 WON

75
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,415
TOTAL PAY 29,580 WON

76
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,833
TOTAL PAY 39,440 WON

77
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,420
Even if I try to save on meals
by eating expired gimbap for free,

78
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,256
I only make about 78,000 won a day.

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,507
DAILY WAGE 78,880 WON

80
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,135
It doesn't even cover the interest
on my 900 million won loan,

81
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,428
which grows every day.

82
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,432
"SO I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO LOOK FOR A BETTER-PAYING JOB"

83
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,518
Does anyone know how to work with rebar?

84
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
This way.

85
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,687
WELDING

86
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,813
Next up is welding.

87
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,649
Ever since I was little,
my grandma would tell me

88
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,652
that one must learn a skill
to make a living.

89
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,822
Only now do I realize
she was absolutely right.

90
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,073
This way for woodwork!

91
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,159
Why didn't she emphasize it more?

92
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,538
She should've made sure I understood,
even if she had to beat it into me.

93
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,164
PLASTERING, DAILY WAGE 150,000 WON

94
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,874
After four years of college,

95
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm still a useless,
good-for-nothing idiot.

96
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,133
What is the highest-paying job
that doesn't require any skills?

97
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,637
While stock traders make tens of millions,

98
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,225
no, hundreds of millions of won per hour,
working in high-rises,

99
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,978
I get to clean the windows
of those buildings.

100
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,696
High-rise window cleaning.
80,000 won an hour.

101
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,323
It's lucrative but dangerous,

102
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,034
so you can only work
four hours a day by law.

103
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,869
Oh fuck!

104
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,245
Eight times four is 32.

105
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,748
A total daily wage of 320,000 won.

106
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,293
But I'm scared, so I don't know
if I could fill all the hours.

107
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,423
Even if I were to clean
all the buildings in Seoul,

109
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
it wouldn't be enough to pay off my debt.

110
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,010
It's too late.

111
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,723
I feel like I'm enslaved,
paying interest for the rest of my life.

112
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,896
That's why I decided
to choose the most rational option.

113
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,774
Let's do it, Bae Jin-su!

114
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,581
1,000,000 WON DEPOSITED

118
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,015
Seven figures…

119
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,352
Someone is sending me a million won
each time they message me.

120
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,731
Do they want to buy the time
that I've given up?

121
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,945
4,003,000 won?

1,000,000 WON DEPOSITED

1,000,000 WON DEPOSITED
PLEASE GET IN THE VEHICLE

124
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,008
They want me

125
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,636
to get in this car?

126
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,527
Excuse me, is this like

127
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,698
a suicide prevention program?

128
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,077
I mean…

129
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,205
You're from the Seoul City Government,
aren't you?

130
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,416
This limo is very nice.

131
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,585
I've seen a couple pass by

132
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,753
but never been in one.

133
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,558
What's this?

134
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,363
"Welcome to The 8 Show."

135
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,575
"This show doesn't require
any skills or knowledge."

136
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,413
"The only thing required
is the time you were going to throw away."

137
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,547
"Food and accommodation will be provided,

138
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,384
and the prize money
will accumulate over time."

139
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,012
"Once time is up, the show will end."

140
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,016
"Should any participants die,

141
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,436
the show will immediately end,
regardless of time."

142
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,898
"Die"?

143
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,903
"Take extra care
for the safety of participants."

144
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:36,409
"If you do not want to participate,
take the cab fare and leave the premises."

145
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,370
Four stacks of one hundred
50,000-won bills. 20 million in total.

146
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,455
"If you wish to participate,

147
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:46,377
please choose one of the numbered cards
and step through the curtain."

148
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,504
What in the world is this?

149
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,840
Food and accommodation provided.

150
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,509
They'll pay me
just for spending time here.

151
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,052
And no one will die?

152
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,305
That means it's not dangerous.

153
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,348
This is easy money.

154
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,560
Is this a prank for a TV show?

155
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,273
But you'll need my consent
to air this, you know…

156
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,526
They sent a million won per message.
That's already six million.

157
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,529
They're giving me
an extra 20 million just for coming here.

158
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,824
Plus, they prepared a limo
and a fancy theater.

159
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,826
Who the hell are these people?

160
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,794
Wait. Why are some numbers missing?

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,422
Damn, I don't fucking know.

162
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,175
What if they're organ harvesters
or something?

163
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,803
Okay. I should leave.
Twenty million doesn't grow on trees.

164
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,973
Oh, that's right. I'm really sorry.

165
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,601
I have some urgent business
to attend to, and I…

166
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,436
I just remembered.

167
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,188
I hope everything goes well.

168
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,939
All right, good luck.

169
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,858
I wish you well.

170
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,866
You're making it harder for me to leave

171
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,118
by sending me money.

00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,122
CONVENIENCE STORE OWNER
SORRY, THINGS ARE HARD

174
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,999
BUT HERE'S THE 220,000 WON FOR ONE WEEK

175
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,211
YOU CAN REPORT ME TO THE LABOR OFFICE,
BUT WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

176
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,212
Fuck.

177
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,632
A week's work
and only 220,000 won to show for it.

178
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,384
This is my reality.

179
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,844
Even if I leave,

180
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,681
I'll have to find a new job
and work forever to pay off my debt.

181
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,765
PAY US BACK, BAE JIN-SU

182
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,938
I was about to jump off a bridge.
What's there to fear?

183
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,066
Fine. You can have my organs.

184
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,069
Either way, I'm not going back
to work for minimum wage.

185
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,363
Fuck it. How hard can it be?

186
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,282
I was hanging from a rope
on a 40-story building earlier.

187
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,121
Let's stick with the average.

188
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,125
I was curious.

189
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,919
If they could afford million-won messages

190
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,839
and shell out 20 million
for just coming here,

191
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,800
how extravagant could their show be?

192
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,782
Wow, this place is fucking huge.

193
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
Twenty-four hours?

194
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,288
Is this over in 24 hours?

195
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,834
Hey.

196
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,127
Hey!

197
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,547
It's locked.

198
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,525
Stairs?

199
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,280
Am I on the third floor?

200
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,175
Aren't there elevators?

201
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,159
I see. The number is the floor.

202
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,371
What is this?

203
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,253
I guess you can never
judge a book by its cover.

204
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,936
Is this fake?

205
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,441
It's just a screen.

206
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,320
And these are all cameras.

207
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,032
Why are there so many?

208
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,078
What the hell?

209
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,394
"Please hand in all your belongings,
including your clothes,

210
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,022
and change into the uniform provided."

211
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,820
Get changed here?

212
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,954
Man, what a waste.

213
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,797
"You can check the accumulated prize money
on the scoreboard."

214
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,048
"Scoreboard"?

215
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,800
SCOREBOARD

216
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,678
"Food and drinks are free."

217
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,597
"You can use the intercom
to buy anything else you need."

218
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,391
"Intercom."

219
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,351
"But the cost of the item

220
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,563
will be deducted from the individual
prize money at a special price."

221
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,024
"A special price"?

222
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,987
"Items to be used outside the room
can be purchased in the square."

223
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,155
"The square"?

224
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,448
THE SQUARE

225
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,866
I see. The square.

226
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,913
"Participants must stay in their rooms
from midnight to 8:00 a.m."

227
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,167
"You cannot block the cameras."

228
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,546
"Breaking a rule will result in
half of the prize money being deducted."

229
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,714
What? Half?

230
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,219
THE SHOW BEGINS AT MIDNIGHT

231
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,474
A minute left?

232
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,018
Hold on. A minute?

233
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,233
What? What the hell?

234
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,568
THE SHOW BEGINS NOW

235
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,611
What's going on?

236
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,240
Wait a minute.

237
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,159
What the hell?

238
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,120
Wait, hold on.

239
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,672
Damn it!

240
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,258
What is this?

241
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,011
This place is full of surprises.

242
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,650
What's this?

243
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,985
These are all fake.

244
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,987
Crazy bastards.

245
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,829
What's that?

246
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,914
"30,000 won."

247
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,062
90,000 won next?

248
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,621
90,000 won. 90,000 won in three minutes!

249
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm making 30,000 won a minute. Fuck yes!

250
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,924
1 HOUR LATER (56 MINUTES, TO BE EXACT)

251
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,472
I get paid 30,000 won per minute.

252
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,310
Right, I've been here
for a little less than an hour.

253
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,562
In other words, my hourly wage here

254
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,564
is 1.8 million won.

255
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,858
Okay, I need to calm down.
Calm down. All right.

256
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,944
The timer in the square
read 24 hours before.

257
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,863
If I calculate how much I make a day…

258
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,032
It's 180 times 24. How much is that?

259
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,325
Let's see.

260
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,452
Four times three is 12.

261
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,912
So…

262
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,707
Wait, that's a little over 40 million won.

263
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,419
Fuck. In one day, I'm making
what my friend makes in one year.

264
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,462
Attaboy, Jin-su.

265
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,465
Yeah, this is the best decision
you've ever made.

266
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,054
But can I only stay here for a day?

267
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,306
It doesn't mention how long.

268
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,770
I could probably repay my loan
if I stayed here for two weeks.

269
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,647
It's so cold
that it's making me want to pee.

270
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,650
Is the bathroom outside?

271
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,987
YOU MUST STAY IN YOUR ROOMS
FROM MIDNIGHT TO 8:00 A.M.

272
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,281
BREAKING A RULE
DEDUCTS HALF OF THE PRIZE MONEY

273
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,283
Half?

274
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,326
Hello? I…

275
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,789
I really need to use the bathroom.
Could I step out for a quick second?

276
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,875
Hello?

277
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,502
Hello…

278
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,546
Seriously? I can't go to the bathroom?

279
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,761
Could you at least turn the heater on?
It's just…

280
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,138
It's pretty cold in here.

281
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,726
Hello? Can you hear me?

282
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,021
This says I can buy anything I want.

283
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,690
Of course. I knew it.

284
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,902
Who in their right mind would give away
30,000 won every minute for nothing?

285
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,405
They want me to use the prize money.
That must be it.

286
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,572
Excuse me.

287
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,493
I want to purchase a blanket
and a hand warmer.

288
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,916
What? Hold on. 1.1 million? No, wait.

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,251
Hold on. Let me cancel.

290
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,378
I choose "N" here. No. Right.

291
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,462
You know,

292
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,591
there must have been a misunderstanding.

293
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,469
I want one hand warmer. A single unit.

294
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,762
Not a whole box.

295
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:51,018
I want to buy one blanket
and one hand warmer, please.

296
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,354
110,000? No, wait…

297
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,065
How much is…

298
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,942
1.1 million? Hold on.

299
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,944
Just give me a second.

300
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,950
BUT THE COST OF THE ITEM
WILL BE DEDUCTED AT A SPECIAL PRICE

301
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,660
"A special price."

302
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,997
Let me cancel the order for now.

303
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,544
I finally understand
the rules of this show.

304
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,840
I make 43 million won a day
at a rate of 1.8 million an hour.

305
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,426
That means the price is…

306
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,306
How much is a newspaper
that you can buy at a convenience store?

307
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,560
A newspaper that's 1,000 won outside
costs 100,000 won here.

308
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,562
It's exactly 100 times more expensive.

309
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,108
They're paying me 30,000 won a minute,
but prices are 100 times higher.

310
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,902
I get it now.

311
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,571
I see exactly what this show is about.

312
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,406
That's right!

313
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,868
They want to see how much I can save
living in such a terrible place.

314
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,913
Whoever they are,
they have no fucking clue who I am.

315
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,749
Did they really think I'd go,

316
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,461
"I'm freezing here!
Give me a blanket, please!" or something?

317
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,588
I'm a pro at being poor.

318
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,345
Can I get a kilogram of old newspapers

319
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,932
and a couple of used cardboard boxes?

320
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,228
I'll take them.

321
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,441
So that's 120,000 won.
Four times three is 12.

322
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,735
That's only worth four minutes.

323
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,414
This is nice.

324
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,667
This is great.

325
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,671
That was a necessary expense.

326
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,674
All right. I'll spend just 200,000 won
until tomorrow.

327
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,802
I'll spend 200,000
and take home 43 million.

328
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,928
My 43 million.

329
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,933
My 43 million.

330
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,567
Hey! Excuse me!

331
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,321
I need a plastic bottle.
Can you get me an empty one fast?

332
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,781
Make it fast!

333
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,844
They simulated the sunrise too?

334
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,608
"Time is precious."

335
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,568
"Time is money."

336
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,279
Stuff that boomers love to say.

337
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,866
But I wonder if they've ever experienced
what I am going through.

338
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,244
An experience where time truly, actually,

339
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,455
factually, absolutely equals money.

340
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,664
Excuse me!

341
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,375
Is everyone there?

342
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,129
Let's all come outside
and introduce ourselves.

343
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,131
There's someone.

344
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,175
Is there anyone else?

345
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,385
You should all come outside.

346
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,887
Hey, over here!

347
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,348
Okay. Three people.

348
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,933
Sure.

349
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,321
Wait,

350
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,032
how are you standing on water?

351
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,451
This is fake.

352
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,620
There's light coming from up there.

353
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,208
Have you seen that by any chance?

354
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,292
Come on over.

355
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,044
The time…

356
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,963
Time was added.

357
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,258
It was definitely 24 hours yesterday.

358
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,229
Hello…

359
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,275
Nice to meet you.

360
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:11,945
Hello.

361
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:25,959
By the way, do you think
time will be added every day?

362
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,252
Good question.

363
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:29,963
Wow.

364
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,382
If time continues to get added,

365
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,303
doesn't it mean
we might be trapped here forever?

366
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,728
Why are you dressed…

367
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,357
I don't think so.

368
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,651
There aren't many rules right now,

369
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,988
but there must be a reason
for time being added.

370
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,073
I'm sure there are hidden rules.

371
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,992
Do you think so?

372
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,953
You probably know better.

373
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,503
Do you think this is all of us?

374
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,921
One, two, three…

375
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,758
Wait. We only have six here.

376
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,218
There.

377
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,433
Hey there.

378
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,353
Why not come join us
rather than sit by yourself?

379
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,149
She must be shy, don't you think?

380
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,902
I think she might just be rude.

381
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,618
So you're on the 2nd floor.

382
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,079
You're on the 8th floor.

383
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,541
The 3rd floor,
and you, miss, on the 4th floor.

384
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,751
I'm on the 5th floor.

385
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,961
Then the 6th and 7th floors.

386
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,839
Wait. Who's on the 1st floor, then?

387
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,091
Hello.

388
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,346
I see everyone's here.

389
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,225
Sorry, I'm a bit slow.

390
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,019
-Do you need a hand?
-No, it's fine.

391
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,479
It's okay. I'm used to it.

392
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,398
I'm staying on the 1st floor.

393
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,982
My name is--

394
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,234
Why bother?

395
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,861
We won't see each other
once we're out of here.

396
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,114
Let's go by our numbers.

397
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,909
All right. It'll be tough
to memorize everyone's name anyway.

398
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,331
Sorry, does anyone happen to know
where the bathroom is?

399
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,416
There isn't one.

400
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,333
Pardon?

401
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,973
What's this?

402
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,394
These are all models.

403
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,687
Everything here is fake.

404
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,813
Really?

405
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,408
What?

406
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,370
What the heck?

407
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,164
It really is all fake.

408
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,875
Fakes that look real.

409
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,672
Wait. That means bathrooms…

410
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,757
They don't exist.

411
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,634
That's over the line.

412
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,846
It seems they deliberately removed
all the basic infrastructure

413
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,016
like water pipes and sewage.

414
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,728
The same goes for our outfits.

415
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,481
They appear real at first glance,

416
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,858
but there's nothing actually there.

417
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,820
Yeah, exactly.
Why did they have to remove the pockets?

418
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,821
How inconvenient.

419
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,157
No kidding. Since I didn't have pockets,

420
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,911
I had nowhere to put my room key.

421
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,538
I placed it in my boxers for now.

422
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,956
Yeah, exactly.

423
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,459
But what am I gonna do without a bathroom?

424
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,548
Yesterday, I thought
we'd only have to survive one day,

425
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,719
so I bought one of those things
for camping and long-distance driving.

426
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,637
A waste bag.

427
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,764
I bought one of those.

428
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,141
-What?
-Yeah.

429
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,893
But where do you put it?

430
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,645
In your room?

431
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,564
We can't bring items out of our rooms,

432
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,607
so I guess so.

433
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,403
That means
we'll have to keep buying waste bags

434
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,739
at 100 times the normal price.

435
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,076
I don't think
we'll have to buy them at that price.

436
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,327
We have another way.

437
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,246
"Items for use outside the room

438
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,415
must be purchased
via the intercom in the common area."

439
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,709
"A special price will apply."

440
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,339
It was on page four of the rule book.

441
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,218
But are you sure we can do this?

442
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,097
What if it's more expensive
than purchasing from our rooms?

443
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,724
I'm not sure.

444
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,770
The price is 100 times more expensive
in the room,

445
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,857
which means they don't want us
to have a lot of resources.

446
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,235
They've also forbidden us

447
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,196
from bringing room items outside
and placed a delivery chute here.

448
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,576
I'm assuming they want us
to purchase items as a group.

449
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,995
Why don't we buy something as a test?

450
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,247
We need to know the rules.

451
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,875
But I'm scared.

452
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,503
I don't see a scoreboard here.

453
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,631
What if it costs more out here?

454
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,469
In that case,
how about we vote to make it fair?

455
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,555
There's no need to vote. Just try it.

456
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,019
A pack of Marlboro Red and a lighter.

457
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,479
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

458
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,024
What? Weren't we planning
to buy from here anyway?

459
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,453
Wait! Did you see that?

460
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,371
Time was subtracted.

461
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,123
As soon as the item arrived,

462
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,168
the scoreboard flashed,
and there was less time.

463
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,461
How much less?

464
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:05,340
It was 30 minutes earlier,
so it got shorter by two minutes.

465
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,594
It looks like we purchase items here
with time instead of money.

466
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,804
A pack of Marlboro and a lighter--

467
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,805
It's 5,000 won.

468
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,893
A pack of Marlboro Red is 4,500 won,
and a lighter is 500 won.

469
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,977
So 5,000 won in total.

470
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,895
Yes.

471
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,398
5,000 won for two minutes.
It means a minute costs about 2,500.

472
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,859
Does that mean it's better
to buy from here?

473
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,238
It would've cost 500,000 won
if we had bought it in our rooms.

474
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,324
-Right.
-Maybe the room money got deducted?

475
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,785
The money remains the same!

476
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,121
-Wait…
-The money is still there!

477
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,290
-When did she go up there?
-When did you go up there?

478
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:44,045
Well, he suddenly bought the items,

479
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,381
so I got a little worried.

480
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,258
But the money remains the same.

481
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:53,012
We can buy stuff we need using that, then.

482
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,515
We don't know how long we're gonna stay.

483
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,770
We only have 35 hours left.

484
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:05,149
If we spend all the time buying things,
won't that end this whole thing?

485
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:06,859
That's right.

486
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,863
We still don't know
how or when the time will be extended.

487
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,784
Based on the scale of this place
and the prize money,

488
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,661
along with all the pretentious items,

489
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,915
I doubt they prepared all this
for just a couple of days.

490
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,461
Money doesn't grow on trees
for rich people either.

491
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,338
If this goes on for days,

492
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,425
the prize money will grow.

493
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,135
You know,

494
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:37,140
they say the richest of the rich
make money just by breathing.

495
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,683
There are oil tycoons

496
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,269
who engrave their names
in the desert and stuff.

497
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:45,398
What else? Some people spend
hundreds of billions a day to go to space.

498
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,235
Building a show like this
could be pocket change for them.

499
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,822
How the fuck would I know?
I was never rich.

500
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,743
Let's first discuss and narrow down
what we should buy as a group.

501
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,494
Only the necessities.

502
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,583
We said we'd narrow down what to buy,
but it was easier said than done.

503
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:07,628
My room is super dry.
We should have toners and lotions.

504
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,297
While one says they need something…

505
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,882
I don't use lotion.

506
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,508
…another says they don't need it.

507
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,803
We should buy pillows for sleeping.

508
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,346
A necessity for someone…

509
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,765
I bought mine yesterday.

510
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,892
How did you sleep without one?

511
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,312
Let's add pen and paper
since we all use them.

512
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,355
What? Is someone studying here?

513
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,232
…was utterly useless to another.

514
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,276
I need to buy sanitary pads.

515
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,447
The result of the combined intelligence
of eight Homo sapiens,

516
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,950
which reached the peak of intelligence
after millions of years of evolution…

517
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,582
our first purchase
was eight plastic buckets,

518
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,793
eight rolls of toilet roll,
four packs of sanitary pads,

519
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,795
four garbage bags of two types,

520
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,965
and four packs of cigarettes
for the welfare of the smokers.

521
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,093
You're saying this is our bathroom?

522
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,010
Yes.

523
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,104
All that fucking arguing
just to buy ourselves bathrooms.

524
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,157
36 MINUTES LATER
(AFTER TENDING TO PERSONAL NEEDS)

525
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,202
Wait, so when are we getting our food?

526
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,163
I'm starving to death here.

527
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,916
Tell me about it.

528
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,877
I didn't even have dinner yesterday.

529
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,464
They said they'd provide food and drinks.
I wonder why it's late.

530
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,924
What?

531
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,260
Haven't you eaten?

532
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,554
I already ate.

533
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,641
Where?

534
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,186
The delivery chute in the room?

535
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,231
It brought food.

536
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,860
It had lots of meal kits and water.

537
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,779
Lots of them? How many?

538
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,783
Twelve meal kits and 12 bottles of water.

539
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,411
Twelve? What did you do with them?
Did you eat them all?

540
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:08,416
There were different meal kits,
so I took bite from each and left them.

541
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,418
And I used the water to bathe.

542
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,794
What?

543
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,423
I tasted of all the meal kits

544
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,342
and used all the water in the morning.

545
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,761
What the hell?

546
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,597
Hey, I mean…

547
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,684
If there were 12 of them,
they clearly weren't for one person.

548
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,936
Why would you take them all for yourself?

549
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,313
They weren't for me?

550
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,608
Come on. Of course not.

551
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,278
Common sense dictates
that if they gave you 12 of each item,

552
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,155
they were meant to be shared.

553
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,451
Now that you mention it, I guess so.

554
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,837
Stop it. Okay?

555
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,963
Come on, stop.

556
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,341
It was delivered to her room,
and it was the first day.

557
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,344
She must have thought
everyone got some too.

558
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,640
8th Floor, it'd be great
if you could share what's left.

559
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,516
Well…

560
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,602
What do you mean, "Well"?

561
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,313
Why the fuck is she stalling?
It's making me anxious.

562
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,399
What is it? You don't want to share?

563
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,819
You want us to starve
while you stuff your face?

564
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,739
That's what I'm saying.

565
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,283
You shouldn't be making decisions
by yourself.

566
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,619
Stop playing games.

567
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,206
I'm not interested in the meal kits.

568
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,921
Why is she taking off her jacket
all of a sudden?

569
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,090
I only eat one meal a day.

570
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,220
I'll give you all of them except for one.

571
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,764
I was just thinking though.

572
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,477
They told us not to bring items
out of our rooms,

573
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,689
so I wondered how to share them.

574
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,902
All right. Put this back on already.

575
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,320
My goodness.

576
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,324
She may not have known
we didn't have food,

577
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,619
and we can share the food from now on,
so it's not a problem.

578
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,247
They're not letting us leave our rooms
with any items

579
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,417
while providing food and drinks
to only 8th Floor.

580
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,961
They want us to send food down the chute.

581
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,212
The delivery chute?

582
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,172
Yes.

583
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,844
Based on the building's structure,

584
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,639
the chutes should all be connected.

585
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,725
Didn't you say there were 12?

586
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,478
It doesn't match the head count.

587
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,813
She's right.

588
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,190
Twelve meal kits for eight people.

589
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,483
That means

590
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,696
if you each take two…

591
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,532
I won't get any.

592
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,242
What do we do, then?

593
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,746
The top floors could eat all three meals,

594
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,875
while the bottom floors
may end up starving.

595
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,963
From the 8th floor to the 7th,
the 6th, the 5th,

596
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,632
the 4th, the 3rd, the 2nd, and the 1st.

597
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,635
This system creates
an unequal social pecking order.

598
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,597
The lower floors, in particular,
are at a disadvantage.

599
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,390
First, let's see

600
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,851
if we can send it down
through the delivery chute.

601
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,978
We'll figure out how to share after.

602
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,439
8th Floor, I'm sorry to ask,

603
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,108
but could you try sending down
the remaining meal kits?

604
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,318
I'll give it a try.

605
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,279
I had nowhere else
to throw them away anyway.

606
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,283
Wait a second.

607
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,869
Would you mind

608
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,708
if we all went upstairs
to check things out together?

609
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,878
-All of you?
-It's our first day.

610
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,631
I'd like to check in person,

611
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,592
just for future reference.

612
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,718
He's right.

613
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,512
You're the only one who knows

614
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,807
how many meal kits and waters
there initially were.

615
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,352
So it'd be good if we could all check.

616
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:02,191
I know you all want to check,
but barging into someone's room like that…

617
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,485
It's not like we're in our own place.

618
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,155
We use those rooms
as bathrooms and everything.

619
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,407
Actually, I don't mind.

620
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,325
Follow me.

621
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,676
If you think about it,
they're a scary bunch.

622
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,803
-Sorry?
-The people who made this.

623
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,473
We have an apparent rule book,

624
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,601
but it doesn't mention
the show's objective or how it progresses.

625
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,937
They left out all the important parts.

626
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,899
We don't know what to expect,
so it's scarier.

627
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,373
-Hey, let me.
-It's okay.

628
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,125
No, really. It's a long way up.

629
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,335
-Thank you.
-No problem.

630
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,256
You're so nice, 3rd Floor.

631
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,384
She's right.

632
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,136
How kind of you.

633
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,053
It's nothing.

634
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,599
And you were spot-on
with the prices earlier too.

635
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,184
How were you so accurate?

636
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,603
I used to work at a convenience store.

637
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,815
I remember the prices of most things.
Feel free to ask me if you're curious.

638
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,733
I can…

639
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,276
Thanks.

640
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,863
Goodness, let me help.

641
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,490
-Oh, sure.
-It's okay.

642
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,741
What the heck is this?

643
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,456
What? What's going…

644
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,253
Wow. What's all this?

645
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,305
Why is the room so big?

646
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,684
8th Floor, you have a bathtub?

647
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,771
Are your rooms different?

648
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,274
I bought these just this morning.

649
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,611
Not only was the size different…

650
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,784
How much did that go up by?

651
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,162
It went up
by hundreds of thousands at once.

652
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,206
Hundreds of thousands…

653
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,958
Are you serious?

654
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,502
I only get 50,000 won.

655
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,921
You get 50,000 won?

656
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,382
What?

657
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,301
I get 10,000 won.

658
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,762
Per minute.

659
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:40,474
That means each floor
has a different rate of increasing money.

660
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,477
This is some fucked-up bullshit.

661
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,729
What is?

662
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:50,359
As it turns out, 8th Floor's hourly wage
was way beyond any of ours.

663
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,945
For her, the show was worth
around 500 million won each day.
