1
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,241
Shit. Ketchup got on my…

2
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,574
Give me a pillow.

3
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,617
You up?

4
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,670
7th Floor. Are you awake?

5
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,261
What happened?

6
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,472
Isn't it obvious? You got caught.

7
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,268
I know you were working with them

8
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,354
to be on equal footing with us,
but that's boring.

9
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,356
No one would watch.
It needs to pack a punch.

10
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,399
Don't you think so?

11
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,319
You know how the system here works.

12
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,071
It's designed for the top
to control the lower floors.

13
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,200
We had a nice little setup.

14
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,577
Why side with them when you're so smart?

15
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,620
That's no fun.

16
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,414
What are you?
Some kinda limousine liberal?

17
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,709
The eight of us are in the same boat.

18
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,962
Isn't it best to earn as much money
before the show ends?

19
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,298
Trust me, they'll thank us later.

20
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,181
What's their fucking deal?

21
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,309
They probably did it
to prevent us from buying weapons.

22
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,227
Weapons?

23
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,729
She's probably right.

24
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,860
There's no other reason

25
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,696
to break our room intercoms.

26
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,824
Don't fret. I'll make you rich.

27
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,578
Should we have bought something?

28
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,914
I feel so bad for 7th Floor.

29
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,583
Why would they take an unconscious man?

30
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,294
Maybe they're trying
to bring him to their side.

31
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,004
"To their side"?

32
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,466
Because 7th Floor
is on one of the top floors.

33
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,553
With the chute and all, it'll be difficult
for them if he's in the middle.

34
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,224
That would be really bad news.
He was the only smart one of us.

35
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,684
Hey.

36
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,852
I'm smart.

37
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,272
Sure.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,817
I doubt 7th Floor would do that.

39
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,945
He worked so hard
to make sure we'd all do well.

40
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,780
Right?

41
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,284
I'm pretty close to 7th Floor.
We smoke together and stuff.

42
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,368
Right.

43
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,878
You all haven't received one, right?

44
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,047
A meal kit.

45
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,716
No, I haven't had one yet.

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,219
And why aren't they coming out?

47
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,763
Right. Do you think something's up?

48
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,056
What the heck is that?

49
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,566
Why am I getting a bad feeling?

50
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,693
Why does he have his arms…

51
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,610
7th…

52
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,324
7th Floor, are you feeling okay?

53
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,328
I'm going to announce
how things will be run from now on.

54
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,455
We currently have about 160 hours left.

55
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,040
Until the end date we agreed on,

56
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,959
your goal is to maintain
the remaining hours.

57
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,171
In other words,
you must earn 24 hours each day,

58
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,130
just like before.

59
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,965
Hey, what's going on?

60
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,134
What do you mean by "your goal"?

61
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,094
Aren't we meant to do this together?

62
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,891
Are you ordering us to earn time
while you guys weasel out?

63
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,517
No way. Surely not.

64
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
7th Floor. That's not it, is it?

65
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,856
You can refuse if you wish.

66
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,983
It's your choice.

67
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,986
-But meals won't be provided.
-You're gonna starve us to death?

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,780
The game will end if you do!

69
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,239
We won't let you die.

70
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,658
Everyone knows what that means.

71
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,662
They'll keep us on the brink of death,
feeding us only enough to survive.

72
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,706
We've starved for three days,

73
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,251
so we all know
just how terrible this threat is.

74
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,296
If you earn time
by participating in the games,

75
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,425
you will be rewarded with coins.

76
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,344
Water and meal kits are a coin each.

77
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,596
Items bought through the delivery chute

78
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,807
in the square will also cost you coins.

79
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
A coin is equivalent to three hours.

80
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,354
In other words, you will receive a coin
for every three hours you earn.

81
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,438
What if we fail?

82
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,690
You won't be given any coins.

83
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,942
You crazy bastards.

84
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,777
-Are you kidding me?
-2nd Floor, wait.

85
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,695
Take another step. I dare you.

86
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,740
This one's made for cops, so it's no joke.

87
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,660
No need to overthink this.

88
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,287
To purchase a meal kit
and a bottle of water,

89
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,997
you need two coins.

90
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,499
Since a coin equals three hours,

91
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,211
you can go through a day with no issues
by earning just six hours a day.

92
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
Since you've all done it so far,

93
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,551
you know that six hours per person
isn't that difficult.

94
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,470
He's saying we won't eat
if we don't earn time.

95
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,347
They didn't just win him over.

96
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,183
He's become their lackey
to leech off of us.

97
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,476
Come on, 7th Floor.

98
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,353
Don't you think this is too much?

99
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,814
We've all worked together until now.

100
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,483
I don't get why you're putting
everything on us suddenly!

101
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,902
Yes, he's right. How can you be so cruel?

102
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,030
We're all a family while we're still here.

103
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,325
You're basically saying
you're going to exploit us!

104
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,580
You motherfucker!

105
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,420
I told you this was no joke.

106
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,798
Anyone else?

107
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,263
1st Floor.

108
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,990
This is too brutal. I can't watch.

109
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,368
Wow! Look how much time we're earning!

110
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,704
Nothing has changed.

111
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,414
We came here for money,

112
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,543
and we'll leave with a sum
we can't imagine earning outside.

113
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:27,340
You're just working slightly harder
to achieve that now.

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,052
The floors decide our roles.

115
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,056
And you just happen to be
on the working floors.

116
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,320
This box contains the games

117
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,073
that you will be playing.

118
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,700
You'll choose one from here.

119
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,954
Only the winner will escape punishment.

120
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,790
What's the penalty?
Are we going to get tased again?

121
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,208
That depends on the game.

122
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,502
You'll find out once you play.

123
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,963
Why don't you choose first, 3rd Floor?

124
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,133
Hey.

125
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,452
It's hide-and-seek.

126
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,247
-Hide-and-seek?
-Yes.

127
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,832
Before we start the game,

128
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,961
please choose eyes, tongue, arms, or legs.

129
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
What do you mean?

130
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,383
Eyes, tongue, arms, or legs.

131
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,176
Choose one each.

132
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,386
Tell us why.

133
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,598
Why are you making us choose?

134
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,767
-Because--
-It'll be more fun to keep it a secret.

135
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,312
-That fucking bitch.
-2nd Floor.

136
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,066
What do I do?

137
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,110
What do I do?

138
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,030
What do I choose?
What are they trying to do?

139
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,364
For me…

140
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,243
I choose arms.

141
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,705
Oh God, I'm about to go nuts.

142
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,749
I'll choose

143
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,669
legs.

144
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,717
I choose tongue, then.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,469
Then it's eyes for 2nd Floor.

146
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,390
Shall we tie them up, then?

147
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,017
Tie us up?

148
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,229
Please handle them with care.

149
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,566
6th Floor is the seeker,
and the four of us are runners.

150
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,195
This hide-and-seek has
two unique elements.

151
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,114
First, runners are given a penalty

152
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,575
based on their chosen body part.

153
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,330
Secondly, we aren't out of the game
when 6th Floor finds us,

154
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,248
but when he hits us.

155
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,501
All right. Are you all ready?

156
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,296
-Let's go!
-Ten!

157
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,340
HIDE-AND-SEEK

158
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,383
Nine!

159
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,260
-Eight!
-Hurry up and hide!

160
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,720
Seven!

161
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,306
Six!

162
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,725
Five!

163
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
Four!

164
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,063
Three!

165
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,024
Two!

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,527
-One!
-Here we come!

167
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,573
Where are you guys all hiding?

168
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,451
Hey!

169
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,499
Over there.

170
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,632
Stop!

171
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,972
1st Floor, you're out!

172
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,225
Over there!

173
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,185
Quick! Hurry!

174
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,988
That makes two!

175
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,451
Okay, we have two left!

176
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,954
Where are you guys all hiding?

177
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,458
Ready or not

178
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,378
Here I come

179
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,258
Where are you? I can't see you.

180
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,054
Where are they?

181
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,442
What? This is so fun!

182
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,485
Why you little…

183
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,378
-That's enough.
-Let go!

184
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,384
The game's over. You got three.

185
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,269
Look how the time has skyrocketed.

186
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,901
3rd Floor stayed hidden until the end,
so he's the winner.

187
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,361
Congratulations.

188
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,034
As I mentioned earlier,

189
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,994
3rd Floor is exempt from the penalty.

190
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,621
One of the three losers

191
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,206
will be punished at random.

192
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,208
Let's get ready, then.

193
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,125
4th Floor.

194
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,134
The penalty is a random swing.

195
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,263
The winner, 3rd Floor,
will cover his eyes,

196
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,098
spin ten times on the spot,

197
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,684
and begin swinging the bat.

198
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,270
The one to be hit
will be chosen at random.

199
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,147
But don't you think this is too much?

200
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,066
As I said,

201
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,736
you need to earn at least 24 hours a day.

202
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,365
If you don't earn that much
from this punishment,

203
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,368
we'll have to proceed
to the next game immediately.

204
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,331
I hope you choose wisely.

205
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,420
"I'M SORRY!"

206
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,130
-"IT'S OKAY, 3RD FLOOR!"
-"DO IT!"

207
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,214
"I'LL BE FINE."

208
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,340
"I'M SO SORRY!"

209
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,300
One!

210
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,135
Two!

211
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,386
Three!

212
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,637
Four!

213
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,139
Five!

214
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,432
"DO IT ALREADY!"

215
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,641
Seven!

216
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,893
"3RD FLOOR! I'M OKAY!"

217
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,185
Eight! Nine!

218
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,729
"JUST FUCKING DO IT!"

219
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,022
Ten! Swing!

220
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,652
You've been chosen.

221
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,704
1st Floor. I'm sorry.

222
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,795
Oh no, he's bleeding. Oh my.

223
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,301
Breathe. You have to breathe.

224
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,476
Earning 26 hours from the first game
is very impressive.

225
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,061
You get a coin for three hours,

226
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,647
but as a token of our gratitude
for your diligent work,

227
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,440
we'll give you nine coins.

228
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,152
Now, please write down the number of coins
you want to receive.

229
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,695
What the heck is this?

230
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,657
If the total number of coins
you've written down exceeds nine,

231
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,034
we will take back
all the coins you earned today.

232
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,744
What kind of bullshit is this?

233
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,122
Are you implying that if the sum
of our numbers is greater than nine,

234
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,750
we'll leave empty-handed?

235
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,794
-All of us?
-That's right.

236
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,128
Fuck.

237
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,380
He's smart, isn't he?

238
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,548
You are forbidden from discussing this.

239
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,717
If caught cheating,
you'll all be responsible,

240
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,427
and we'll confiscate all the coins.

241
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,804
Please keep that in mind.

242
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,889
You should at least give us time
to discuss--

243
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,807
From now on,

244
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,393
please stay silent.

245
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,894
Here you go.

246
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,564
Group responsibility.

247
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,110
We are rewarded individually
but punished as a team.

248
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,320
That diabolic bastard.

249
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,115
No talking or even glancing at each other.

250
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,074
Got it?

251
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,701
All right, let's see.

252
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,370
Nine coins in total, and four of us.

253
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,539
If we get two coins each…

254
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,042
that leaves one extra.

255
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,878
What a waste.

256
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,173
Honestly, since I'm the winner,

257
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,883
don't I deserve to get three?

258
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,136
One person can get an extra one.

259
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,597
Yeah, okay. Nine coins.

260
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,976
Wait.

261
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,395
Is it fair for the winner to get three?

262
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,064
Getting hit again as a penalty
is bad enough.

263
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,275
What if 1st Floor thinks
he deserves three?

264
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,865
And 2nd Floor might find it unfair
since she got beaten up the most.

265
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,659
So if they each write three…

266
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,667
Wait. Yeah, hold on a minute.

267
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,378
I can't trust 5th Floor either.

268
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,214
She could write down three
just because she's hungry.

269
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,799
She could easily do that.

270
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,219
Damn, I can't trust anyone here.

271
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,263
They'll only think about themselves.

272
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,682
There's no one smart on this team.

273
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,061
I'm their only hope. I have no choice.

274
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,317
Come on. This isn't right.

275
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,860
I need water, at least.

276
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,364
Wait, what if they all write three?

277
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,744
If they have a conscience,
they should let me survive, at least.

278
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,389
The total number of coins
you've written down

279
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,683
is seven.

280
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,229
Seven?

281
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,273
We'll provide the quantity written down,
so please use it wisely.

282
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,901
They all wrote two except for me.

283
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,987
I might have overthought this.

284
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,614
The team's brain, my ass.

285
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,494
I only have one coin,
so I have no choice but to use it for…

286
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,166
7th Floor. You son of a bitch.

287
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,836
You backstabbing fucker.
You goddamn son of a bitch.

288
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,922
This is exactly why
you shouldn't trust a four-eyes.

289
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,093
That's right.

290
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,303
Just hang on a bit longer.

291
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,267
It's Twenty Questions.

292
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,102
Twenty Questions?

293
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,147
Is this some kind of game
where they pummel us 20 times?

294
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,315
Each of you will take turns
asking questions.

295
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,402
Whoever guesses the correct answer
within 20 questions

296
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,987
will be the winner.

297
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,738
And just like yesterday,

298
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,325
the winner will be given the right
to carry out the penalty.

299
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,871
It's not that great
to carry out the penalty.

300
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,539
Shall we begin?

301
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,541
TWENTY QUESTIONS

302
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,209
Okay, we'll begin now.

303
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,669
Come on, let's focus.

304
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,297
In this game,
it's best to guess the big category first.

305
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,466
Doing so is key
to finding the answer within 20 questions.

306
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,135
Is it a person?

307
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,013
-No.
-Is it alive?

308
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,433
-Does it have a shape?
-No.

309
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,769
Does it refer to an action, then?

310
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,770
Oh! An action?

311
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,107
I guess it could count as an action.

312
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,527
Do you do it alone or as a team?

313
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,113
You can't do it alone.

314
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,948
You need at least two.

315
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,035
Is it painful or pleasant?

316
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,745
It's very pleasant.

317
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,539
You need at least two people,
and it's pleasant?

318
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,340
Could it be

319
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,507
something sexual?

320
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,426
This isn't sexual.

321
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,930
What are you thinking of?

322
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,476
Is it something

323
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,063
that we all know?

324
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,398
Yes.

325
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,651
You'd be stupid not to know by now.

326
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,860
I have the answer.

327
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,903
-Wait.
-I--

328
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,197
Have you thought it through?

329
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,823
I'm sorry, but I'm confident.

330
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,408
-You should take--
-No, really.

331
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,202
I think I have the answer.

332
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,828
Is it "game"?

333
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,664
Wrong!

334
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,166
That was ten questions.

335
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:56,421
If you take a guess,
it's considered a question.

336
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,298
Hold on. A game?

337
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,133
She's quite sharp.

338
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,635
I think I got it.

339
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,720
If I'm right, the answer is…

340
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
Wait, hang on.

341
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,809
If I win now,
I'll be handed the bat again.

342
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,853
Is this perhaps an opportunity?

343
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,107
To let 2nd Floor answer correctly.

344
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,192
To let her hold the weapon.

345
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,237
Yes, she's a fighter.

346
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,489
Have you all given up?

347
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,616
No, I'll answer.

348
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,660
I'll take a guess.

349
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,038
If it's not a game,

350
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,790
is it "quiz"?

351
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,545
-Wrong.
-That was 11 questions.

352
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,047
I gave her a hint
in the guise of a wrong answer.

353
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,842
2nd Floor, please catch on
and think of the answer.

354
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,552
Let me take a guess.

355
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,886
Shoot, 1st Floor.

356
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,804
Sorry?

357
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,181
We all know what this is.

358
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,558
Why are you stepping in?

359
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,811
-It's not a game and not a quiz either.
-1st Floor, wait.

360
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,980
But we all know the answer.

361
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,441
No, don't. Hold on.

362
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,277
Dude.

363
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,529
Stop!

364
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,989
No!

365
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,369
I think I have the wrong answer.

367
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,121
What? That's lame.

368
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,540
-I take it back.
-Are you teasing us?

369
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,876
That was one heck of an assist.

370
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,669
1st Floor, you've caught on too.

371
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,714
All right. 2nd Floor, please.

372
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,757
Me.

373
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,674
She's got it!

374
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,135
"Twenty Questions"?

375
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,889
Correct!

376
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,186
Okay, 2nd Floor is the winner.

377
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,103
Congratulations.

378
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,148
Yes, finally, here comes our opportunity.

379
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,071
We're finally here.

380
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,783
We gave 2nd Floor the weapon of justice.

381
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:52,162
All we need now is for her
to be brave enough to swing the weapon.

382
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,178
Please.

383
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,265
Don't waste this golden opportunity.

384
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,352
Please don't let us… down.

385
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,975
You fucking bitches!

386
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,768
Seven.

387
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,770
Eight.

388
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,730
Nine.

389
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,940
Ten! Swing it!

390
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,359
She isn't some swordswoman

391
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,446
who slashes her enemies
just by sensing the wind.

392
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,116
Why did I expect 2nd Floor

393
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,702
to beat them up with her eyes covered?

394
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,497
She probably never even thought

395
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,376
about attacking them
with the baseball bat in the first place.

396
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,548
Once you get used to being a victim

397
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,676
and fully give in like that,

398
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,345
you come to accept it.

399
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,558
When you survive day by day,

400
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,478
trading blood, sweat, and pain
for money and time,

401
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,482
enduring each day
while hurting each other,

402
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,567
you start accepting it to be natural.

403
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,366
After a few days like that,

404
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,037
we were eventually met with a catastrophe.

405
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,497
On this day.

406
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,542
Today, you earned a total of nine coins.

407
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,378
However, the total number of coins
you've written down

408
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,505
is ten.

409
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,343
According to the rule,
we won't be giving you any coins today.

410
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:16,181
Our collective wishful thinking
of "I guess one extra won't hurt"

411
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,475
had coincidentally come at the same time

412
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,186
and snowballed into a great misfortune.

413
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,438
That means…

414
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,024
It's as I said. No one will get any coins.

415
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,151
If you have coins left, use them.

416
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,402
If you don't have any…

417
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,446
Well, I guess you'll have

418
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,406
a slightly tougher day.

419
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,158
I thought things couldn't get worse.

420
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,869
Hunger and thirst had become chronic.

421
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,787
"A slightly…"

422
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,456
And discomfort and squalor
became the norm.

423
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,958
"…tougher day"?

424
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,502
I didn't think it could get any worse.

425
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,130
Thanks for your effort.

426
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,049
When we realized there was no hope left…

427
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,175
You're all dismissed.

428
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,718
…we finally gave up.

429
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,555
But the one thing…

430
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,973
What are you doing?

431
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,349
Hurry up and get moving.

432
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,852
…the haves should fear is
a group of have-nots with nothing to lose.

433
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,187
Get back to your rooms.

434
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,648
Dismissed!

435
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,032
Hurry back to your rooms!

436
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,540
Looking back, you've all worked
without any rest this week.

437
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,585
You're bound to get edgy
when you're exhausted.

438
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,920
How about this?

439
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,050
As an incentive,
whoever returns to their room first

440
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,177
will be given one coin.

441
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,264
Let's not move an inch.

442
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,807
Any of us.

443
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,645
You all know nothing will change

444
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,607
if we budge now.

445
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,650
He's right.

446
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,322
Hold your ground, no matter what.

447
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,657
Their words were a wake-up call.

448
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,453
Yes. Perhaps this moment
was our final showdown.

449
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,080
Always losing, beaten up,
and kicked around,

450
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,958
we've never tasted victory.

451
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,837
Our first taste of victory
will act as the turning point,

452
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,464
bringing us level again.

453
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,008
It will be a ray of light
in pitch-black darkness.

454
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,260
And this brilliant ray of light

455
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,263
will send a powerful warning
to those on the higher floors,

456
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,640
making them unable to face--

457
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,557
Ten.

458
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,768
We'll give you ten coins.

459
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,438
You have a minute to step up.

460
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,651
Yes. I'll give you one minute,
like he said.

461
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,569
After exactly one minute,

462
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,906
I'm sure you're all aware
that we have no choice

463
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,324
but to resort to force.

464
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,583
We were given one minute,

465
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,127
but it didn't even take ten seconds.

466
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,837
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,590
I'm diabetic, so I am not feeling well.

468
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,508
And even now…

469
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,512
All our efforts were in vain,
and we, on the lower floors,

470
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,847
once more,

471
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,058
yet again

472
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,726
and again,

473
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,396
recorded yet another failure.

474
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,066
To be honest, I even had this thought.

475
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,819
If someone had to die

476
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,987
for this dreadful show to end…

477
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,616
I know it's wrong,
but I hoped for an accident,

478
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,286
whether it be from shock,
weakness, starvation, or whatever.

479
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,706
When I realize again and again

480
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,000
that there's absolutely no hope
in this place,

481
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,503
and finally become certain of it…

482
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,629
I want…

483
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,966
…my desire for "someone else to die"
will turn into…

484
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,509
I want

485
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,220
to die.

486
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,640
I know for sure that will happen.

487
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,852
Give me whatever you have.

488
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,229
So I can

489
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,189
kill myself.

490
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,154
You're not killing yourself.
You still have work to do.

491
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,159
Just go to sleep, you punk.

492
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,494
Wanna get shot to sleep?

493
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,872
-Should I?
-They're right.

494
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,375
It'd be better to save your energy.

495
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,171
It will be tougher tomorrow.

496
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,007
This premonition that my remaining life

497
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,593
will serve merely as a tool
for them to earn more money

498
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,303
will likely be right.

499
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,513
FOOD AND ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED
SPEND TIME TO EARN MONEY

500
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,767
How did it never cross my mind
that the true meaning

501
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,104
behind the no-death rule was actually
that I'd be worked to the bone?

502
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,746
I had it before I knew it.

503
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,206
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,458
1st Floor, a man of many talents,

505
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,336
had magically slipped us each a note.

506
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,256
And that note awakened
my long-dead spirit.

507
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:01,966
A revolution?

508
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,095
When 1st Floor sends the signal,

509
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,766
we're to ride down the delivery chute
to the first floor the next morning.

510
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:15,063
Fortunately, the delivery chute
is just big enough for an adult male.

511
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,069
One person may be weak,

512
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,530
but if the weak unite unexpectedly,

513
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,615
they will become that much stronger.

514
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,244
Why haven't I ever thought of this?

515
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,168
The slightest hope is what keeps us going.

516
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,504
That is all that's required.

517
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,423
A today better than yesterday.

518
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,801
A tomorrow better than today.

519
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,177
These small hopes

520
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,221
are what motivate us to live on.

521
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,724
Especially if that hopeful tomorrow

522
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,726
is what you eagerly anticipated.

523
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,897
We played a similar game,
endured similar violence,

524
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,066
and had to face similar absurdities,

525
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,402
but none of it felt the same as yesterday.

526
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,446
1st Floor's signal will change everything.

527
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,156
The world and the universe.

528
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,909
If I can hang on just until then…

529
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,791
It makes a noise.

530
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,019
What on earth is he talking about?

531
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,979
What makes a noise?

532
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,523
What does he mean?

533
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,113
The noise.

534
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,823
I can hear it.

535
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,209
It's here!

536
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,298
Having fun?

537
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,718
Sorry?

538
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,889
Are you having fun living like this?

539
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,392
I'm afraid I don't follow.

540
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,896
All you need to do is sit back

541
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,856
and watch others work, no?

542
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,857
It's all right.

543
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,151
Not too bad.

544
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,322
You have high standards.

545
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,157
I find it incredibly entertaining.

546
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,665
This is hard. Why can't I get it in?

547
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,249
Come on, your stance is wrong.

548
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,337
Don't bend your wrist.

549
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,464
Picture tapping it
with the back of your hand.

550
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,382
There.

551
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,802
Nice!

552
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,053
The delivery chute noise.

553
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,639
I completely overlooked it.

554
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,266
It could've been really bad.

555
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,520
But what if this is a trap?

556
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,438
What makes you think so?

557
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,815
It's dramatic

558
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,901
to catch us escaping
when they already know.

559
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,654
Wouldn't it be easier for them

560
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,323
to wait until we make a noise
and then catch us?

561
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,366
Yes. He's right.

562
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,326
He's clearly signaling

563
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,954
for us to revolt against them.

564
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,040
If that's so,
why did he treat us like this until now?

565
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,876
It was that prick 7th Floor

566
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,962
who kept this game so brutal.

567
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,508
So close! I want to go again.

568
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,557
Wait!

569
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,516
No!

570
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,227
Hey, are you okay?

571
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,689
It was 2 minutes and 45 seconds.

572
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,898
One final chance.

573
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,900
Why are you guys so weak?

574
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,862
We just had 15 more seconds to go.

575
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,072
Let's try it one last time.

576
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,741
Everything is going as planned.

577
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,370
8th Floor, 6th Floor, and 4th Floor
are all bored with watching us.

578
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,041
The fact that they're bored
means they have their guard down.

579
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,252
The only person
I'm worried about is 7th Floor.

580
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,170
HOLDING FOR 3 MINUTES

581
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,256
We can only hope that he's on our side.

582
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,845
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,933
Excuse me.

584
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,478
I've had a stomachache for some time now.

585
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,065
Could you buy me some medicine?

586
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,691
That's the signal.

587
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,487
"I have a stomachache"
is the signal for us to take action

588
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,988
and lay the trap for them.

589
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,365
It's time to execute the plan.

590
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,575
Sure. Okay.

591
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,871
The key, please.

592
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,216
I'd like to order
medicine for stomachaches.

593
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,510
It's the morning of the 47th day.

594
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,011
I couldn't sleep a wink.

595
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,180
My body is trembling again

596
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,309
out of fear, anxiety,
anticipation, and excitement.

597
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,854
My heart is about to explode,

598
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,774
but unless it really does,
I must take action.

599
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,359
There is no place to step back.

600
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,904
We've been driven to desperation,
cornered into this moment.

601
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,156
There is absolutely no other…

602
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,788
The long night has passed,

603
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,667
and the dawn of revolution
has finally shone upon us.

604
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,653
Help me!

605
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,614
Help!

606
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,576
Help me!

607
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,663
My stomach is killing me!

608
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,665
What's going on?

609
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,543
-I'm not sure.
-Help me!

610
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,503
Help!

611
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,630
Oh God, my stomach.

612
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,299
What's going on?

613
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,720
I think something's wrong with me.

614
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,889
What's the matter?

615
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,935
Please, help.

616
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,277
Help me!

617
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,488
My stomach hurts so much.

618
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,200
My stomach… Help!

619
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,117
Hold on.

620
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,286
These bastards.

621
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,370
Help.

622
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,622
Use it if something seems off.

623
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,374
Wow, this is making me excited.

624
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,586
It's like I'm being ripped apart.

625
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,299
My stomach hurts so much.

626
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,178
My stomach.

627
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,576
Fuck.

628
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,087
Give it here.

629
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,425
You fucking bastards.

630
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,885
Little pieces of shit.

631
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,972
There's never a dull moment.

632
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,516
-Hit him.
-What?

633
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,560
Hit him!

634
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,624
My hand is all better now, you bastard.
