1
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,681
2nd Floor.

2
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,643
I didn't do anything.
I'm a victim, too, you know!

3
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,478
I only did what I was told!

4
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,980
2nd Floor!

5
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,987
This should be enough.

6
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,323
We were safe at last.

7
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,326
Along with safety came a sense of relief.

8
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,579
And that sense of relief

9
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,039
led to an explosion of suppressed anger.

10
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,168
The sorrow we've been holding back
finally broke loose.

11
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,546
You fucking bastards!

12
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,342
You son of a…

13
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,095
You son of a bitch.

14
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,306
Why did you do that to me?

15
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,187
No one stopped him.

16
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,147
His anger was justified,

17
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,650
so his violence was also deemed justified.

18
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,778
You're no different.

19
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,488
You just got lucky.

20
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,824
You think you're a hotshot?

21
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,284
I…

22
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,765
Fuck.

23
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,226
We came back from the brink of death,

24
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,395
but we didn't have it in us
to be as brutal as them.

25
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,580
The battery had been removed.

26
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,124
You did it, didn't you?
So that it wouldn't work?

27
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,128
Why did you tell us about the noise?

28
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,047
You were giving us a hint, right?

29
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,383
You know,

30
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,426
I'm a chicken and a coward.

31
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,137
I would've done the same
if they'd threatened me too.

32
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,098
Please be honest.

33
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,893
Say something.

34
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,981
Tell us you had no choice but to wait
for the opportunity to save us.

35
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,276
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,778
What?

37
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,405
All I can tell you…

38
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,161
is that I'm sorry.

39
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,500
After a long discussion,
we decided to set him free.

40
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,336
If it weren't for him,

41
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,463
we would still be slaves.

42
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,593
After being released,
7th Floor quietly wiped away his tears.

43
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,265
They looked like tears
that expressed his long-withheld emotions.

44
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,935
He, too, must have longed for this day.

45
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,229
We earned so much time.

46
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,567
They must have loved it.

47
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,486
But why doesn't it feel like we've won?

48
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,909
Because they've made so much more money.

49
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,038
The revolution was rewarded
with a substantial duration of time.

50
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,375
In the end, I could only direct my anger
at my own unlucky hand,

51
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,294
which picked one of the lower floors.

52
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,754
It's okay. I'll give you food.

53
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,213
After the skirmish,

54
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,716
the three top floors
were confined to their rooms.

55
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,301
What changed was

56
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,637
that their rooms were no longer
their own sweet, personal spaces.

57
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,141
All rooms were open 24 hours a day.

58
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,061
They're now communal rooms
that everyone can freely use.

59
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,399
Why aren't you going inside?

60
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,028
I'm just a bit shocked, 3rd Floor.

61
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,197
Sorry?

62
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,591
All this was bought with the money
we earned with our sweat and blood.

63
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,843
I can't believe this.

64
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,303
Money

65
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,597
sure is sweet.

66
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,475
It's been so long

67
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,937
since I last saw bath water.

68
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
My goodness.

69
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,499
Isn't this the thing
you use instead of dental floss?

70
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,169
This place is literally a hotel.

71
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,587
I could live here forever.

72
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,299
That's a bidet.

73
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,390
She has 21.9 billion,
earning 340,000 won per minute.

74
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,642
My goodness.

75
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,478
I still can't believe my eyes.

76
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,399
Should we just spend it all?

77
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,444
We can buy what we want,

78
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,070
like that bidet over there.

79
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,613
Things like that.

80
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,618
You think that would be okay?

81
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,831
Forget it.

82
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,875
She's no different from us.

83
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,710
She'll need the money outside.

84
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,943
I feel full for the first time
since I got here.

85
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,487
-Yeah.
-Same here.

86
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,655
It's a feast, isn't it?

87
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,573
A total feast.

88
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,620
It would be perfect

89
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,789
if we could have a drink right now.

90
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,167
-If only we had drinks here.
-Totally.

91
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,169
But we can't buy food and drinks.

92
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,297
Back in the day,
I used to buy deodeok from the market

93
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,591
to make deodeok wine.

94
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,012
I mean, I don't know about wine and beer,

95
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,598
but won't we be able to make
something similar to soju?

96
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,892
Look. We have plenty of water over there.

97
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,103
If we could, that'd be just…

98
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,271
Wow. That'd be great.

99
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,190
I personally

100
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,945
enjoy drinking just a tad,

101
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,698
so I even took one-day classes
to learn how to make alcoholic drinks.

102
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,077
But I don't remember
how I made them anymore.

103
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,079
-I can't quite remember how.
-Wait.

104
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,540
Can't we do anything with money here?

105
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,833
-What do you mean?
-Well…

106
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,127
Perhaps we can buy the recipe

107
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,755
for making alcoholic drinks.

108
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
This means we can buy it, right?

109
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,180
I think so.

110
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,975
The price also pops up
when we buy something.

111
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,976
Wait, look.

112
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,686
It's 100 million won.

113
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,314
That's a huge sum for us,
but she makes that in half a day.

114
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,566
It should be fine, right?

115
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,202
That hurt!

116
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,371
Can we use your money? 100 million won.

117
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,750
You can, but can't you untie me first?

118
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,753
Being tied up isn't really my thing.

119
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,839
I'd rather tie up others.

120
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,675
-I can't do that.
-What?

121
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,681
Damn it.

122
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,359
HOW TO MANUFACTURE ALCOHOL

123
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,321
It's done.

124
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,031
Should I try it first?

125
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,372
Just to be safe, don't swallow it.

126
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,124
Spit it out after tasting it.

127
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,003
Hey, I told you not to swallow.
You should've spit…

128
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,423
How does it taste?

129
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,884
It's sour at first.

130
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,637
But it's bitter overall.

131
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,513
How should I put it?

132
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,224
It tastes like you might end up dead

133
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,560
if you are not careful with it.

134
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,229
It's thrilling.

135
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,328
This tastes so disgusting,

136
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,455
but I can't help but down it.

137
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,666
-Right? I told you.
-Yeah, really.

138
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,211
5th Floor, let's make some more of this.

139
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,712
Of course.

140
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756
-Here.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,351
7th Floor makes it look like
it's some expensive whiskey.

142
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,353
It looked like a whiskey commercial.

143
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,312
I know, right?

144
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,064
Yeah, totally.

145
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,782
This is nice.

146
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,243
It feels like we're camping.

147
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,871
It really does.

148
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,917
A good camping trip
should always end with ramyeon.

149
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,712
Oh, ramyeon.

150
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,548
I crave it so much.

151
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,133
And the soup too.

152
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,176
Koreans must have their soup.

153
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,472
I don't think we've had any soup
since we got here.

154
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,143
Because we can't buy food and drinks.

155
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,146
Would you all care for… some ramyeon?

156
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,648
What?

157
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,401
Ramyeon.

158
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,703
It's hot!

159
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,620
It's so hot!

160
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,456
Wow, that was hot.

161
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,877
What are you doing?

162
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,128
Come on, quit it.

163
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,966
Can't you see this?

164
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,970
I added sliced green onions
and a lot of eggs.

165
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,723
Doesn't it smell great?

166
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,312
Try it.

167
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:52,980
It's delicious.

168
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,815
I'm serious.

169
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,488
The soup is amazing!

170
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,494
Why don't we

171
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,996
make a toast with the soup?

172
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,003
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

173
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,647
How long

174
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,024
do you want to do this for?

175
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,735
If you're sleepy,
you can head back to your room.

176
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,363
No, I mean this show.

177
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,116
Don't you think we should stop?

178
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,033
What?

179
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,208
I thought we had already agreed

180
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:41,380
that we would stay
until I made one billion won.

181
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,261
1st Floor. About that one billion…

182
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,140
I'll cover what's short when we leave.

183
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,558
Sorry?

184
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,602
Since one billion won is what you need,

185
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,353
I can just give you

186
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,731
some of my prize money.

187
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,026
Didn't we all witness

188
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,237
what we did to each other
just to earn some damn time?

189
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,741
But don't you think there are

190
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,619
plenty of other ways to earn time?

191
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,539
I actually came up with a few things.

192
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,708
Those aren't enough to earn time anymore.

193
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,046
You guys all know
we've already crossed the line.

194
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,589
Once it's crossed,

195
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,341
we can't go back.

196
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,885
But still, don't you think it's unfair?

197
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,511
We suffered so much.

198
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,680
We should use them to earn more time--

199
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,973
Can you actually do it?

200
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,893
-Do what?
-Use them to earn time.

201
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,353
Can you really do it?

202
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,312
Yeah, why not?

203
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,648
No, I bet you can't.

204
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,608
-I can do it!
-Do it right now, then.

205
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,985
She's tied up.

206
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,074
Go on. Get your revenge on her,
satisfy your desires, or whatever.

207
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,159
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

208
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,285
She can't resist.

209
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,332
3rd Floor.

210
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,409
Let's leave this place as human beings.

211
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,745
This is our last chance.

212
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,290
The very last chance for us

213
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,502
to leave with our decency intact.

214
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,940
-What gives?
-What?

215
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,444
The stars,

216
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,113
aren't they beautiful?

217
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,073
Yeah, I guess they are.

218
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,159
But after living here so long,

219
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,038
I'm starting to wonder
if the window is the entire sky.

220
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
What do you mean?

221
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,208
That's all we can see from here.

222
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,006
The outside world. Reality.

223
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,342
They're fading away, being forgotten

224
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,263
into darkness or nothingness.

225
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,154
Perhaps she's right.

226
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,407
This might be our last chance
to leave with our humanity intact.

227
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,952
I want to see the real sky.

228
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,464
What a turn of events.

229
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,740
My daughter loved it
whenever I showed her this.

230
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,284
If she takes after you,
she must be adorable.

231
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,080
Maybe I should've kept
a photo of her secretly.

232
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,916
We're leaving soon anyway.

233
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,628
Get her all the delicious food
with all the money you made.

234
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,672
Get her all the wonderful things.

235
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,637
So we agreed to end the show

236
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,681
when the remaining time ran out.

237
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,685
The higher floors, who were tied up,
agreed with our decision,

238
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,687
though they didn't have much say.

239
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,566
We ate well,

240
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,318
fed them well,

241
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,989
and even took good care of them.

242
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,491
-It's all right.
-I don't want to.

243
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,667
Excuse me. Can you scratch me here?

244
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,836
My philtrum, right above my lips.

245
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,629
It's so itchy.

246
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,596
No, a little more to the side.

247
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:41,972
-Here?
-That's it.

248
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,850
That feels good.

249
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,816
That feels nice.

250
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,068
At times, I'd imagine such scenarios.

251
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:55,986
Thank you.

252
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,988
But our days were uneventful,

253
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,199
and time passed just fine.

254
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,262
We washed our worn-out, filthy uniforms

255
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,640
and our hair using dry shampoo.

256
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,810
All freshened up, we were ready to leave.

257
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,688
It's time for us to go back

258
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,650
to the outside world and reality.

259
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,237
This really is our final night.

260
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,155
It really is.

261
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,116
You did really well to hang in there.

262
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,910
You too.

263
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,246
You did great.

264
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,665
That goes for everyone.

265
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,088
Come on.

266
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,297
2nd Floor, come on.

267
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,175
You were all amazing. All of you.

268
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,427
Farewell, everyone.

269
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,722
It was both great and fucking shit.

270
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,600
Let's never meet again.

271
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,354
8TH FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
25,666,090,000 WON

272
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,731
7TH FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
16,319,960,000 WON

273
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,650
6TH FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
10,053,930,000 WON

274
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,443
5TH FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
6,212,280,000 WON

275
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,153
4TH FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
3,890,340,000 WON

276
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,947
3RD FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
2,333,540,000 WON

277
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,740
2ND FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
1,533,620,000 WON

278
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,450
1ST FLOOR'S EXPECTED PRIZE
766,890,000 WON

279
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,546
What the fuck! Everyone, come outside!

280
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,010
What's wrong with that thing?

281
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,600
Why did we get so much time?

282
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,479
We definitely had nine hours left
at 10:00 p.m. yesterday.

283
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,190
That means they've given us
nearly 37 hours.

284
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,570
We barely earned 12 to 24 hours
when we climbed stairs or got tased.

285
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,991
Does this make sense?

286
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,954
They would never give out time for free.

287
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,373
Did you guys do something?

288
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,167
Did you?

289
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,002
I didn't do anything.

290
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,298
I just cleaned and packed up last night.

291
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,633
I didn't do anything special.

292
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,677
Yes, the same goes for me.

293
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,597
What the fuck is going on, then?

294
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,140
Follow me.

295
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,103
5th Floor!

296
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,314
Check for anything unusual.

297
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,861
She's snoring.

298
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,407
Isn't the food here yet?

299
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,784
I'm starving.

300
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,995
I'll give you some later.

301
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,915
I don't see anything unusual.

302
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,917
What on earth is going on?

303
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,127
What?

304
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,005
Is something wrong?

305
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,551
We need to strip her.

306
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,138
-What?
-Everyone except 5th Floor, get out.

307
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,933
I'm gonna check with my own eyes.

308
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,227
What?

309
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,395
Leave, all of you!

310
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,857
What? No, don't leave!

311
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,653
No! Are you seriously stripping me
so you can make money?

312
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,988
-Did you find anything?
-I don't see anything.

313
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,910
Something must be up.

314
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,459
We tried our best to find out
why we earned more time for a while,

315
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,919
but we found nothing.

316
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,632
Seriously, what in the world is happening?

317
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,177
One thing is for sure.

318
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,765
The culprit is among us.

319
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,934
Hey, come on.

320
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,812
Let's not raise suspicions

321
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,107
when we're not even certain.

322
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,277
She's right.
We've been through so much together.

323
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,449
Maybe the hosts were bummed
that this was ending,

324
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,618
so they are giving us extra…

325
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,081
Fuck. What am I saying?

326
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,876
There are no free rides
in this game, fool.

327
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,711
We can't be sure of anything,

328
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,006
but something entertaining to watch
must be happening.

329
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,424
"Entertaining."

330
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,259
Fucking hell.

331
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,679
What the hell is so "entertaining"?

332
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,311
What could it be?

333
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,813
What is happening right now?

334
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,412
4th Floor.

335
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,831
There's blood…

336
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,252
Who did this to you, 4th Floor?
Who did it?

337
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,673
Her tooth was pulled out.

338
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,801
Fuck you.

339
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,805
I told you to untie me! You motherfuckers!

340
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,141
I'm so sorry.

341
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,185
Did you see who did it?

342
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,813
I woke up and found myself like this.

343
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,608
What will I do now?

344
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,363
It hurts.

345
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,494
There is a victim,
but there's no perpetrator.

346
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,287
Wait.

347
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,790
Why wasn't there a victim yesterday?

348
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,084
No victim?

349
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,381
If the injury wasn't visible physically
but was somewhere we couldn't see…

350
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,465
That means…

351
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,052
Wait! Hold on!

352
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,054
What's going on?

353
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,389
His shoes!

354
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,818
What happened?

355
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,073
His toenails…

356
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,242
They have all been pulled out.

357
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,665
Why so surprised?

358
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,000
Why didn't you tell us?

359
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,835
Whoever did this to me

360
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,962
must be one of you anyway.

361
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,631
You want to end the show?

362
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,217
It won't end that easily.

363
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,013
Isn't this getting fucking interesting?

364
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,186
Who is it?

365
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,356
Which one of you bastards

366
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,942
is behind all this?

367
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,613
2nd Floor, please don't get too angry.

368
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,489
We can talk once you've calmed down.

369
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,574
Was it you?

370
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,619
No, it wasn't.

371
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,079
It's you, isn't it?

372
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,041
We shouldn't have set you free.

373
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,086
After all, you lived in luxury
by siding with them.

374
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,590
You're doing this
because the show is about to end,

375
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,507
aren't you?

376
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,677
Don't do this, 2nd Floor.
It was all in the past.

377
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,014
And it's all thanks to him
that we were set free.

378
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,098
Did you help him?

379
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,726
2nd Floor, why are you being like this?

380
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,144
-Is it you?
-Sorry?

381
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,313
Because you didn't make a billion?

382
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,314
It really isn't me.

383
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,607
It must be you, then.

384
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,108
No! It's not me. How could I--

385
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,695
Then did he pluck out
his own fucking toenails or what?

386
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,658
What about you, 2nd Floor?

387
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,202
What?

388
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,246
Is it really that important to you
who the culprit is?

389
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,165
Don't you get it?

390
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,168
No matter who the culprit is,

391
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,961
at least one of us five,

392
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,632
or even more than that,
doesn't want the show to end.

393
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,633
That's important.

394
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,134
Don't you see it?

395
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,430
Have you all lost your minds?

396
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,265
Have you gone insane?

397
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,102
Have you all forgotten

398
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,436
how we escaped that hell?

399
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,322
The remaining half a day
has become three days.

400
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,199
Just as 6th Floor said,

401
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,785
perhaps this show
will never come to an end.

402
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,788
Who is it?

403
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,208
Who is it?

404
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,088
What the heck? Who are you?

405
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,675
As if what you did wasn't enough.
You're gonna attack me too? You fucker!

406
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,094
Get lost! I said get lost!

407
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,224
Don't break the door.

408
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,476
Don't break it! Please stop!

409
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,811
Please leave!

410
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,274
Come on, you motherfucker!

411
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,525
Come at me!

412
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,111
I was wrong.

413
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,656
They weren't trying to break in
but to prevent me from getting out.

414
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,533
Sorry.

415
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,828
This is the only way
to prevent anything from happening.

416
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,874
What are you doing,
locking me up like this?

417
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,753
Two meal kits
and two bottles of water a day.

418
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,921
Please just stay inside your room

419
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,840
until this show ends.

420
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,508
2nd Floor!

421
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,386
Hold up. Just open this for a second.

422
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,345
2nd Floor.

423
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,681
2nd Floor!

424
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,392
Please don't go.
Just open this, and let's talk.

425
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,561
2nd Floor.

426
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,236
Should I

427
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,739
go inside too?

428
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,657
No.

429
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,328
Feed and take care of the tied-up people.

430
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
Let's hold on for just a few more days.

431
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,279
2nd Floor's method wasn't in line
with liberal democracy.

432
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:27,450
It was clearly violent and tyrannical.

433
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,953
But it was a sure way
to stop the mysterious crimes.

434
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,040
With everyone locked up, nothing happened.

435
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,167
Time simply passed.

436
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,587
2nd Floor did not question anyone.

437
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,632
She simply gave us food and water.

438
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,510
The show was forcibly coming to an end.

439
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,929
Why is she making all the calls here?

440
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,098
Does she think she's the boss?

441
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,313
She could've tried to talk this over,
but installing a lock all of a sudden?

442
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,606
Unbelievable.

443
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,233
This is absolutely ridiculous.

444
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,986
Locking the door won't solve anything.

445
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:03,903
Wait.

446
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,948
She said we get two of each.

447
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,534
Next time I see her,
I'll tell her for sure.

448
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,537
Something like this is unacceptable.

449
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,667
This dried squid is delicious.

450
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,272
You should try eating a bit more.

451
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,150
5th Floor.

452
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,236
My tooth hurts so much.

453
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,740
I've been lying in bed all day,

454
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,950
and I'm struggling to digest.

455
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,203
Come on, 5th Floor. I told you, didn't I?

456
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,873
Can't you just untie my hands?

457
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,627
I told you being tied up is not my thing.

458
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,929
I can't even move

459
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,933
because I'm tied up like this.

460
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,561
It feels like
my whole body is being paralyzed.

461
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,939
5th Floor, you really are a bad person.

462
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,484
Here.

463
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,749
Listen.

464
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,376
Well,

465
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,753
can't we at least

466
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,048
untie their hands?

467
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,675
Just leave them.

468
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,303
It's just that

469
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,807
they've been tied up for days.

470
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,434
They're not criminals.

471
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,358
They're all nice people.

472
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,275
It's just…

473
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,737
This wouldn't have happened
if they hadn't come here.

474
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,740
There's not long to go,
so let's untie them.

475
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,534
-It's all over now.
-Enough.

476
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,540
Stop with your nonsense.

477
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,042
Do you think I want to do this?

478
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,878
This is driving me crazy too!

479
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,188
What? How did you…

480
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,274
2nd Floor untied me.

481
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,570
-Really?
-Yes.

482
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,991
She said she gave it some thought
and felt bad about tying us up.

483
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,621
5th Floor, she untied me too.

484
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,165
I can finally breathe.

485
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,918
It's been so tough, hasn't it?
I'm happy you pulled through.

486
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,005
What about 6th Floor?

487
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,798
I'm not sure.

488
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,802
Maybe she's still angry with 6th Floor.

489
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,096
Yes, you're right.

490
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,641
I'll go to 6th Floor.

491
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,768
That sounds good.

492
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,475
Did 2nd Floor

493
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,394
happen to come by here?

494
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,276
2nd Floor

495
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,488
untied both 4th Floor and 8th Floor.

496
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,575
-She did?
-Yes.

497
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,119
She set them free.

498
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,913
They're all outside.

499
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,838
She came by earlier.

500
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,506
Right?

501
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,383
What did she say?

502
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,094
That she'd set me free.

503
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,681
She told me to wait,
as she had to go get something.

504
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,683
Right?

505
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,394
I knew it. 2nd Floor is so kind.

506
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,231
Well,

507
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,858
could you please

508
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,152
untie me?

509
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,324
She's going to untie me anyway.

510
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,413
I shouldn't.

511
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,291
2nd Floor will come and untie you herself.

512
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,542
No.

513
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,045
Actually,

514
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,673
I'm scared.

515
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,883
What?

516
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,302
The truth is, 2nd Floor tried to kill me.

517
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
What are you talking about?

518
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,639
I'm serious.

519
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,516
She tried to kill me.

520
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,101
2nd Floor is the culprit.

521
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,021
She pulled out all my toenails,

522
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,315
beat me up, and left.

523
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,194
No, she couldn't have.

524
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,113
Don't you know how much she hates me?

525
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,283
You know I'll die
if you leave me like this.

526
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,747
She'll surely kill me when she comes back.

527
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,294
I'm really scared.

528
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,300
No.

529
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:03,429
No, 2nd Floor is not that kind of person.

530
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,848
I'll talk to her.

531
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,350
You have no idea

532
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,478
what that bastard did to me.

533
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,856
She didn't just pull my toenails out.

534
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,275
She did some really fucked up shit to me!

535
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,735
I will…

536
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,824
never fucking forgive her
for what she did.

537
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,994
If something like that happens again,
I might really die.

538
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,996
I swear…

539
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,135
Hey, don't leave. Stay.

540
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,890
Stay with me.
