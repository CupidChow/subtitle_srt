1
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,230
-Mom.
-Yes?

2
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,690
Why are we going home?

3
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,820
You said I had to stay at the hospital
to get better.

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,823
Well, you can get better at home too.

5
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,201
It's been a long time
since you've been home, right?

6
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,080
But I like it here.

7
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,292
They have a bed, and it's warm too.

8
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,503
Daddy fixed up the heater.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,213
It won't be cold.

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,090
Upsy-daisy.

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,301
Let me help.

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,470
-Thank you.
-Let's go home, Da-in.

13
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,763
What about you, Dad?

14
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,183
If you go wait at home first, sweetie…

15
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,100
ELEPHANT CIRCUS

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,728
…I'll be there in the blink of an eye.

17
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,825
You go on first, Da-in.

18
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,633
How could they do such a thing?
Doesn't she have a rare disease?

19
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,219
We don't have the money.

20
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,554
Even so, how could they?

21
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,599
How could the hospital kick out
a sick little girl?

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,851
Don't they give a damn if she dies?

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,854
Thank you for letting us use the car.

24
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,567
Taking the subway
would've been tough for her.

25
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,028
She can make it home comfortably.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,864
Also…

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,201
please don't forget my request.

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,666
Can't you think this through?
Your daughter loves you so much.

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,881
ILYEONG HOSPITAL

30
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,137
POLICYHOLDER: NO SANG-GUK

31
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,030
Would you please wake up?

32
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,082
You have to stay awake.

33
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,885
I said you must stay awake!

34
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
We gotta get out of here now.

35
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,891
Pull yourself together, okay?

36
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,309
Wake up.

37
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,186
Wake…

38
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,649
Are you awake now?

39
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,068
Awake…

40
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,778
Drink some water first.

41
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,828
What did you mean by "get out of here"?

42
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,124
No screaming, no acting surprised,

43
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,001
and no going berserk, okay?

44
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,877
Listen carefully.

45
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,213
You can change rooms.

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,881
It costs a billion won.

47
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,508
Sounds familiar, right?

48
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,762
Remember how 1st Floor always went on
about making a billion won?

49
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,349
I had no idea the money was for that.

50
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,560
Honestly, he put up with a lot.

51
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,771
He secretly had a grand scheme all along
to change rooms.

52
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,737
1st Floor proposed that we cooperate

53
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,409
to try to overthrow 8th Floor
and her manipulative and tyrannical rules.

54
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,578
Of course he suggested that

55
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,622
since I'm risking my life
for everyone's sake,

56
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,584
I get first pick of the rooms.

57
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,295
He's basically telling me
to take 8th Floor's.

58
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,174
The offer was too good to refuse.

59
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,136
If you agree with the plan,
flare your nose three times.

60
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,937
We have more people.

61
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,024
Wouldn't it be better to just attack her?

62
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,069
I doubt she'll shoot us with the gun,
don't you think?

63
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,283
Bang!

64
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,956
Isn't it just sexy?

65
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,417
Sorry?

66
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,087
The way blood splatters.

67
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,631
It's rather avant-garde.

68
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,760
I want to shoot for real.

69
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,471
Not paint cans,

70
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,640
but a real person.

71
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,193
Maybe it's better

72
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,114
to shoot everyone…

73
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,907
"And end the show."

74
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,413
Those were her exact words.

75
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,084
I was so scared that she might shoot me.

76
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,504
Don't even think about
going up against that girl.

77
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,714
It'd be best to be careful with her.

78
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,633
What if

79
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,886
we raid her at night?

80
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,179
You see,

81
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,433
she doesn't sleep at night these days.

82
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,517
What?

83
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
Well,

84
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,854
she just paints.

85
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,151
There are already paintings titled
from Number 5 to Number 9.

86
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,868
I bet she's watching us now
through the CCTV.

87
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
We must do it during the day.

88
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,502
She plays golf out in the square
when the sun is out.

89
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,425
Good shot! That was great!

90
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,679
Did she buy any additional weapons?

91
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,348
"Weapons"?

92
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,518
Coco is a new addition.

93
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,770
"Coco"?

94
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,691
It doesn't look like it,

95
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,860
but it's hella vicious.

96
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,574
After playing golf,
she always takes a bath in her room.

97
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,619
Yes, you're getting better by the day.

98
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,870
That's our only chance.

99
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,957
The only time she puts down her gun.

100
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,880
We can rush in,
take away the gun, and attack her.

101
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,382
It will naturally lead to close combat,

102
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,636
so we need someone to take the lead.

103
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,762
I'll do it.

104
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,347
I can do it.

105
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,431
But

106
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,100
there's another issue.

107
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,937
What other damn issue could there be?

108
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,817
Well, there's no one to untie
and set you guys free.

109
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,236
What?

110
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,947
You know, while she's playing golf,

111
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,242
I have to be her caddie.

112
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,369
Good shot, 8th Floor!

113
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,789
We've got 5th Floor.

114
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,295
What are you doing out here?

115
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,799
The sunlight is so nice, isn't it?

116
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,926
She's the only one

117
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,428
who's free to move except for you.

118
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,682
You have to convince her, no matter what.

119
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,559
4th Floor…

120
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,563
you are our only hope.

121
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,564
Please.

122
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,444
You know who I am, right?

123
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,573
Of course. Our lovely 4th Floor.

124
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,450
-That's good.
-What is?

125
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,369
Come here for a second.

126
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,039
Well, you've been by yourself recently,

127
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,457
and I wanna have a chat.

128
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,126
Why don't we have a chat?

129
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,676
These are my favorite plates.

130
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,973
I nabbed them from 8th Floor's room
to give to you.

131
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:05,479
By the way,
how did you end up coming here?

132
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,065
You look like you were well-off.

133
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,151
I'm pretty good at reading people.

134
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,570
I was well-off once.

135
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,868
But I blew all my money.

136
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,369
How?

137
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,373
My husband was a famous dermatologist,
so he made a lot of money.

138
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,669
But he never showed me any respect

139
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,880
and cheated on me all the time.

140
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,051
At first,
I went there to blow off some steam.

141
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,764
I couldn't help
but be drawn to his kind words.

142
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,017
He asked me to lend him some money.

143
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,105
I ended up giving him the house,
my husband's building, all our money.

144
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,735
When I could finally see things clearly,
my husband had already sued me,

145
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,530
and I had absolutely nothing left.

146
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,408
What a motherfucker.

147
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,786
I was the fool.

148
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,331
I always tend to delude myself.

149
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,249
When you leave this place,

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,460
just bump off all those bastards.

151
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,130
With that money,
hiring a hitman will be pocket change.

152
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,883
Goodness me.

153
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,803
You make it sound so fun.

154
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,850
Thank you, 4th Floor.

155
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,812
4th Floor convinced 5th Floor
with all her heart.

156
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,398
She told her about 1st Floor
and the billion won

157
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,318
and how everyone was exhausted
from the psychological torture.

158
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,779
She made it sound even more tragic.

159
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,074
Is there anything I can do?

160
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,660
You just need to do what I tell you.

161
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,162
I'll do it.

162
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,747
Whatever it is.

163
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,126
5th Floor.

164
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,216
But

165
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,136
under one condition.

166
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
At last, it's D-Day.

167
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,614
All right. Shall we go play golf?

168
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,741
But we had a bad start.

169
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,409
Shall we take a day off?

170
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,871
My Coco looks tired as well.

171
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,168
All the more reason you should exercise!

172
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,796
Coco, if you feel lethargic,

173
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,465
you should move more.

174
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,176
Come here, sweetie.

175
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
Good dog. Let's go over there.

176
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,599
Listen, I set up the hazards
and the course, all ready to go.

177
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,808
It will be so much fun!

178
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,020
But 4th Floor's quick thinking
got our plan back on track.

179
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,691
By the way,

180
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,652
what did you talk about
with 5th Floor last time?

181
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,570
Sorry?

182
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,656
Well, you guys were crying
and hugging each other.

183
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,492
I almost joined you out of curiosity.

184
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,868
Oh, that?

185
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,912
I guess you saw everything.

186
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:13,167
We listened to
each other's old stories and stuff.

187
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,673
Good shot.

188
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,135
Your swing is exquisite today!

189
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,638
What do you call this swing?

190
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,767
I mean, wow!

191
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,852
You're just like Pak Se-ri.

192
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,230
We should take it up a notch, right?

193
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,238
Are you okay?

194
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,156
Yes, I'm okay.

195
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,873
Where did the ball go?

196
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,459
It must've gone really far.

197
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,753
It went super far.

198
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,130
I know, right?

199
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,093
8th Floor,
I think one went that way earlier.

200
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,010
Look over there.

201
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,428
-Over there?
-Yes.

202
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,181
Over there. Right there!

203
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,599
That's it, right?

204
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,309
That was such a great shot.

205
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,199
Come on. Up you go.

206
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,703
Hold on. My legs.

207
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,582
It's because you haven't moved
for so long.

208
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,000
Stretch them out a bit.

209
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,882
Your swing is amazing today.

210
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,301
-Out of this world!
-You reckon?

211
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,596
What's wrong, Coco?

212
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,984
Are you okay, Coco?

213
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,903
You're okay, Coco.

214
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,614
It doesn't seem okay though.

215
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,583
-5th Floor, I'm so sleepy.
-Are you okay, 3rd Floor?

216
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,667
Get a grip.

217
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,586
My shoulders ache too.

218
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,879
I can't get a grip.

219
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,881
We just have 7th Floor left.

220
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,468
I seriously can't get up.

221
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,802
I might fall asleep.

222
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,262
You can't stay like this.

223
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,513
Get up. Let's go.

224
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,977
Hide!

225
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,939
5th Floor, I can't go any further.

226
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,148
We must go, 3rd Floor.

227
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,691
Just a bit further.

228
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,031
8th Floor, what's wrong?

229
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,659
I think I just saw someone pass by.

230
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,576
What?

231
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,204
Where? I don't see anyone.

232
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,538
-I can't move.
-Keep going.

233
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,670
Maybe 5th Floor
was out for a second earlier.

234
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,338
Isn't that right?

235
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,966
Look how clever Coco is!

236
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,050
What's wrong, Coco?

237
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,760
-What? Coco.
-Coco.

238
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,762
Where are you going, Coco?

239
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,472
Wait, you're almost done.

240
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,311
I'm having a seizure! I'm dying!

241
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,857
Damn that bitch.

242
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,694
8th Floor, wait for me!

243
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,409
Coco, where are you going?

244
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,791
3rd Floor.

245
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,876
3rd Floor, come here. We have to hide.

246
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,878
This way. Gosh.

247
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,380
Come on, over there.

248
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,383
What's wrong, Coco?

249
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,509
Where did you go?

250
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,553
8th Floor.

251
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,179
That fucking dog.

252
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,635
8th Floor!

253
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,804
Oh no!

254
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,150
What's going on here?

255
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,792
8th Floor!

256
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,418
Welcome.

257
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,046
The parking lot is full.
Please turn right…

258
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,298
Excuse me!

259
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,802
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm afraid you can't park here.

260
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,138
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
I'll be out in ten minutes.

261
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,683
Ma'am. There are parking spaces
on the floor below.

262
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,353
What's up with you?
Didn't I say I'd be quick?

263
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,023
I'm a VIP customer.
Do you realize how much I spend here?

264
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,152
Wait. You are…

265
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,948
It is you.

266
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,741
-Is this your job?
-What is it?

267
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,659
You know her?

268
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,620
Come on, she was in school with us.

269
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,207
The loudmouth who said
she'd be a K-pop star. The poor girl.

270
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,585
Let's go. We don't have time.

271
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,089
I mean, in a way, she's dancing.
I guess she made it.

272
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,091
She must've debuted in the parking lot!

273
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,884
Did you see? I was shocked.

274
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,386
She was like this.

275
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,721
Stop it! People might see!

276
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,284
Fucking hell.

277
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,376
Shit! I should've done that
from the start.

278
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,555
What about your golf session?

279
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,473
Oh, you see,

280
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,059
I scored a hole-in-one.

281
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,144
Sorry?

282
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,481
Why isn't she waking up?

283
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,025
She should be up by now.

284
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,111
I didn't smack her that hard.

285
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,781
I think she's just taking a good nap.

286
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,106
I don't know why we cried.

287
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,276
For some reason,
seeing the sunlight brought us to tears.

288
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,153
A true liberation.

289
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,115
6th Floor, our biggest threat,
couldn't move due to his back.

290
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,201
8th Floor was tied up with Coco,

291
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,120
and her only weapons,
the Taser and the pistol,

292
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,372
were in our hands now.

293
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,041
We were finally…

294
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,836
Sorry, just one thing before we go on.

295
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,423
Remember the deal we made?

296
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,802
Would you mind if I did it now?

297
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,929
What deal?

298
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,764
5th Floor

299
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,351
helped us out with one condition.

300
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,939
Give me a medical scalpel,

301
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,109
some gauze, bandages, styptics,

302
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,861
anesthetics, antibiotics, disinfectants,

303
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,614
and a pair of medical gloves, please.

304
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,207
What?

305
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,876
What is it?

306
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,545
What are you doing?

307
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,463
Ma'am?

308
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,631
Damn it. Wait.

309
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,637
Why are you doing this?

310
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,931
You're who I think you are, right?

311
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,516
-Sorry?
-Hello.

312
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,601
-Hey, do you have a pen?
-One second.

313
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,523
Could I get an autograph?

314
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,152
-Goodness.
-You are him, right?

315
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,071
I was a huge fan.
You were the king of stealing bases.

316
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,282
-We're big baseball fans.
-Really. Here.

317
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,326
I see. Okay, sure.

318
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,455
Your names?

319
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,707
-It's Oh Seung-jun.
-And Cho Min-ah.

320
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,542
What's the mileage on this?

321
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,044
Thank you.

322
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,545
You don't wanna make money?

323
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,463
I know.

324
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,548
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

325
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,591
-Sure.
-Thank you.

326
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,675
-Thank you.
-Bye.

327
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,180
-Fancy running into him here.
-Right? He's nice.

328
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,600
Happy?

329
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,603
Sorry?

330
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,230
Are you happy signing autographs?

331
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,276
Come on, boss.

332
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,571
You got kicked off the team for gambling,

333
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,615
and you are happy signing autographs?

334
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,994
Damn it.

335
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,705
"Damn it"?

336
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,375
What, you gonna beat me up too?

337
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,795
Hey, do you realize
how many cars you sold this month?

338
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,006
You need to get your act together.

339
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,092
Get your stuff together, all right?

340
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,975
That motherfucker.

341
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,685
What?

342
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,196
Wait, my pants. Why are you…

343
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,573
why are you doing this?

344
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,826
5th Floor's one condition
for helping us was…

345
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,285
I'm getting my revenge.

346
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,164
I'm going to make 6th Floor a eunuch.

347
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,381
The anesthetics. I'm not under anesthetic!

348
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,641
I treated him perfectly using antibiotics,

349
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,852
so he shouldn't have trouble moving.

350
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,402
I proposed that we use
8th Floor's money to switch rooms.

351
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,447
However, 1st Floor answered calmly.

352
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,159
I saved up money for this very moment.

353
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:16,329
I want to do this with my money
if nothing else.

354
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,416
Of course. You're so manly, 1st Floor.

355
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,711
So pretty girls are "big sis,"
and high rollers are "so manly"?

356
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,005
We agreed amicably on all the rooms.

357
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,800
4th Floor went to the 8th floor,
and 8th Floor went to the 4th.

358
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,263
And 1st Floor, who had dreamed of this,
would become 6th Floor.

359
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,724
Everyone else was happy
with where they were.

360
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,018
Of course, I'd like a higher floor too.

361
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,812
But everyone was rational,
and we reached an agreement.

362
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,689
With no one to protect us,

363
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,984
we created
our own ending of poetic justice.

364
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,528
I'd like to…

365
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,490
change rooms.

366
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,211
I'll change them.

367
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,008
What is this?

368
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,551
Why is there an envelope?

369
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,428
-What?
-What is it?

370
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,181
What does it say?

371
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,609
What?

372
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,488
What on earth

373
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,114
does it mean?

374
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,536
What is the meaning of…

375
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,830
-What's wrong?
-I mean…

376
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,333
Those sons of bitches.

377
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,709
-What?
-What is it?

378
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,378
What? What's the matter?

379
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,673
"As long as the show continues,

380
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,260
you can purchase and own rooms
with your prize at any time."

381
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,929
"You can purchase each room

382
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,806
at the prices listed below."

383
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,849
"1st floor, ten billion won."

384
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,395
"2nd floor, 20 billion won.
3rd floor, 30 billion won."

385
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,231
"8th floor, 340 billion won."

386
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,691
What?

387
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,484
We didn't understand at first,

388
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,697
as we thought we could switch
to the rooms we wanted.

389
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,076
However, we only purchased
the instructions for changing rooms.

390
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,538
And for a ridiculous price at that.

391
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,083
After seeing the prices,
everything became so clear.

392
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,003
There were ways to buy and sell.

393
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,631
But in reality,
there was nothing we could buy.

394
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,800
In other words,

395
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,720
our fates were sealed from the beginning.

396
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:41,141
What's going to happen to me now?

397
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,393
Oh no, 1st Floor.

398
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,146
The prize difference
following the Fibonacci sequence,

399
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,858
which I had attributed to
the hosts showing off,

400
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,319
and the price of each room

401
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,197
was chosen to be
the natural order of the show

402
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,702
and the golden ratio in the creator's eyes
watching us from above.

403
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,872
All the money I saved up until now…

404
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:06,958
What do I…

405
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,044
What should we do, 7th Floor?

406
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,421
Come on, 7th Floor.

407
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,632
You always have the answer.

408
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,926
Come on, say something!

409
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,977
You don't seem to know
the audience very well, Mr. Yu.

410
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,482
Just as people spend money
on delicious cakes such as this…

411
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,655
they spend money
for a satisfying experience.

412
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,700
So why do you insist on
portraying the real world?

413
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,578
People are sick and tired of their lives.

414
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,207
That message you're trying to get across?
They know it already.

415
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,463
We just need to throw them

416
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,216
something fun and entertaining to watch.

417
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,593
But with all due respect, sir,

418
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,430
wouldn't that be an insult
to the audience?

419
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,408
Mr. Yu, I took you for a smart man,

420
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,118
but you're totally clueless.

421
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,121
My dear Mr. Yu.

422
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,915
You used to be such a big shot
back in the day.

423
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,338
Give me a call

424
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,174
when you want to make something fun,

425
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,594
not stuff like this.

426
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,350
This was incredibly boring to read.

427
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,936
What kind of title is "Downfall"?

428
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:50,895
I don't know.

429
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,022
I have no idea at all.

430
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,067
I pretended all this time
to be a know-it-all.

431
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,947
But I'm fucking clueless.

432
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,953
They're screwing us over.

433
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,249
There's no way to change rooms.

434
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:23,011
He was assigned a double shift
because they didn't want to hire anyone.

435
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,598
What a ridiculous way to save money.

436
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,767
If he doesn't get surgery now,
he won't make it.

437
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,351
And he has no insurance.

438
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,189
This is some bullshit.
God, those penniless bastards.

439
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,900
Exactly.

440
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,902
He apparently dozed off due to overwork,

441
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,196
but why did he have to crash into my car?

442
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,240
He needs surgery
by tomorrow at the latest, right?

443
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,159
I'll do it.

444
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,704
I just need to stand surety, right?

445
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,959
Whether it's money for surgery
or a settlement, I'll take care of it.

446
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,461
Tell them to do the surgery.

447
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,506
Let's

448
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,716
end it now.

449
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,679
We can

450
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,558
all chip in
and give 1st Floor his money outside.

451
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,393
What do you say?

452
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,103
Right?

453
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,485
There's nothing more we can do here.

454
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,321
Let's get out of here.

455
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:37,877
No.

456
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,840
Nobody move.

457
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,301
-1st Floor.
-Not like this.

458
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,428
I can't end the show like this.

459
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,972
Don't you agree?

460
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,598
This is wrong.

461
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,350
1st Floor.

462
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,437
Stay where you are.

463
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,606
Nobody moves!

464
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,736
3rd Floor.

465
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,240
Tie 2nd Floor up.

466
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,373
Use the tape.

467
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,168
Hurry up.

468
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,176
7th Floor, tie 4th Floor up.

469
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,095
Do it right now!

470
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,822
This place is so much fun.

471
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,908
I love it.

472
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,203
Did you see how much time we just earned?

473
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,040
Isn't this just amazing?

474
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,754
What the heck?

475
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,214
-She's here again.
-That attention seeker.

476
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,257
Who?

477
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,385
A washed-up performance artist.

478
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,638
Since no one was hiring her anymore,

479
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:15,099
she held her own shows
and accrued hundreds of millions in debt.

480
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,519
Now that she's broke,
she performs here without permission.

481
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,897
Call the police. She's making a racket.

482
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,708
We should all stay here longer! Come on!

483
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,502
Let's stay here!

484
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,181
We were like an audience
waiting for a performance.

485
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,188
Ladies and gentlemen.

486
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,399
Thank you for your patience.

487
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,360
I now present to you a performance

488
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,113
you've never seen before.

489
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,781
Oh, 1st Floor.

490
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,083
-1st Floor!
-1st Floor!

491
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,667
Be careful!

492
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,753
1st Floor!

493
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,297
1st Floor, watch out!

494
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,890
-1st Floor.
-Oh dear!

495
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,433
1st Floor, just come down!

496
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,018
-Are you okay?
-You crazy bastard!

497
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,311
It's too dangerous.

498
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,068
-Come down!
-Please come down!

499
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,363
What's gotten into him?

500
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,949
-I told you to come down!
-1st Floor, please come down!

501
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,548
Is he doing this to get more time?

502
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,845
-Go for it, 1st Floor!
-Oh dear!

503
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,888
What do we do?

504
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,716
-1st Floor!
-Be careful!

505
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,927
1st Floor!

506
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,305
-Oh no, 1st Floor!
-What do we do?

507
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,516
Hold on tight!

508
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,896
1st Floor!

509
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,649
Hold on tight!

510
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,571
What do we do?

511
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,878
What do we do?

512
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,714
-Hold on.
-1st Floor, hold on tight!

513
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,799
Be careful!

514
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,052
Oh my God!

515
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,804
The fire…

516
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,123
Oh no!

517
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,211
1st Floor.

518
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,380
1st Floor! Hang in there.

519
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,134
He can't stay here.

520
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,802
He needs to go to the hospital.

521
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,556
Can you breathe?

522
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,142
Open the door, you bastards!

523
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,186
He's going to die!

524
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,650
Give me anything. Right now.

525
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,320
I'll buy whatever you have,
so end this show!

526
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,905
Just give me anything.

527
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,948
Whatever's the most expensive.

528
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,700
Diamonds, gold bars,

529
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,037
anything to use up all this time! Fuck!

530
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,497
Right now!

531
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,510
1,440 hours?

532
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,181
Fucking hell.

533
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,059
-Stop now!
-Open your eyes.

534
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,269
Fuck!

535
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,815
Why is it going up?

536
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,110
Because it's so touching.

537
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,614
Look at all of you
desperately trying to save him.

538
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,158
How can you not be touched?

539
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,079
That's why I said that…

540
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:18,999
at this rate,

541
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,545
we may never be able to leave this place.

542
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,349
1st Floor, open your eyes.

543
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,684
1st Floor, wake up!

544
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,270
You can't give up!

545
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,022
Just stop it, please!

546
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,527
What more do you want to see,
you bastards?

547
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,445
What more?

548
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,780
1st Floor.

549
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,074
Just hang in there.

550
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,540
Don't let them see.

551
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,964
1st Floor, please breathe.

552
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,716
1st Floor, open your eyes.

553
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,471
3rd Floor.

554
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,033
Hurry, 3rd Floor!

555
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,124
Hey, stop that!

556
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,418
Come on, hurry!

557
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,688
Fuck. The stairs.

558
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,036
Yes, he got them all.

559
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,247
-1st Floor! We're almost done.
-1st Floor.

560
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,915
-Just a little longer.
-1st Floor!

561
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,712
I don't want to leave!

562
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,468
You can't see us now.

563
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,053
What will you do?

564
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,014
What more can you fuckers do?

565
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:44,895
It won't open.

566
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,222
Motherfuckers.

567
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,756
It was only when we showed them nothing

568
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,468
that they finally set the time to zero.

569
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,683
-1st Floor!
-1st Floor!

570
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,644
-It's open!
-1st Floor, come on!

571
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,776
1st Floor.

572
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,205
I…

573
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,126
wanted to rise higher.

574
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,174
I've spent my whole life at the bottom.

575
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,388
1st Floor.

576
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,432
A nobody like me

577
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,560
shouldn't have been greedy.

578
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,148
Stay awake, all right?

579
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,983
1st Floor.

580
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,611
I apologize…

581
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,285
to my daughter.

582
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,248
I'm so sorry, everyone.

583
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,212
I'm so sorry.

584
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,769
1st Floor.

585
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,275
The ending is too mawkish…

586
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,741
but this isn't all that bad.

587
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,664
Hey, you fucking sons of bitches!

588
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,380
"Congratulations."

589
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,008
"The prize money will be wired
to your bank account."

590
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,095
About two and a half months had passed

591
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,432
while eight people
disappeared from society.

592
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:18,854
In there, we saw all kinds
of criminal activities and horrific events

593
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,065
that a normal person would never believe

594
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,568
even if they heard them,

595
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:29,239
but naturally, the world remains oblivious
that they ever took place.

596
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:51,136
At first, the shock
of witnessing 1st Floor's death,

597
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,471
the infinite money,

598
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:56,475
and the ephemeral time
utterly destroyed me.

599
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,227
I struggled to get back to life.

600
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,358
Also, after going through
psychological torture,

601
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,902
my body demanded I sleep all day.

602
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,280
I just slept day in and day out.

603
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,492
I had the same dream over and over.

604
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,036
I dreamed of it so many times

605
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,373
that I wasn't sure
if I had really been to such a place,

606
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,293
if I had really met those people,

607
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,047
or if any of it had even happened.

608
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,800
Even though it seems unbelievable…

609
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,597
if those events hadn't been real,

610
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,975
I wouldn't see
this ridiculous sum of money

611
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,726
sitting in my account.

612
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,689
The identity of the host,

613
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,567
who was thorough and deducted
half of my prize for shooting the cameras,

614
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,196
the cruel people on the upper floors,

615
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,739
and 1st Floor's death

616
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,450
started fading from memory.

617
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,913
However, we shouldn't forget.

618
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,873
We mustn't forget.

619
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,545
Even if everything else was forgotten,
we had to remember one thing.

620
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,344
To do this,
I had to gather the participants.

621
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,724
Though I did not know their names,
ages, jobs, or anything else,

622
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,142
I still had to find them.

623
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,232
And there was only one way to do that.

624
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,320
It was time I used up
this abundant surplus of money I had.

625
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,156
YOU'RE INVITED TO THE FUNERAL OF 1ST FLOOR

626
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,285
We had to hold
a funeral for 1st Floor somehow.

627
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,288
We must remember him.

628
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,665
SEPTEMBER 21, 2024
SEONGSAN HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL, HALL ONE

629
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,307
2ND FLOOR

630
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:39,846
Am I the only one here?

631
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,140
No.

632
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,162
Here, have some more.

633
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,715
I found

634
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,509
1st Floor's family.

635
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,469
My goodness.

636
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,179
How?

637
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,016
I was looking into it to hold his funeral,

638
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,354
and there weren't
many circus troupes in Korea.

639
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,690
So…

640
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,235
it didn't take long.

641
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,319
I see.

642
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,364
But they thought

643
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,075
that 1st Floor was working overseas.

644
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,120
What do you mean?

645
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,875
I met 1st Floor's wife.

646
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,673
She said her husband's colleague
came to see her.

647
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,551
He said he came back to Korea first

648
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:04,055
and that he visited her
at the request of 1st Floor.

649
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,724
And

650
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,393
he gave her a bankbook

651
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,188
with enough money for a lifetime.

652
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,731
Who could it be?

653
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,109
She said it was a man in his thirties.

654
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,196
Apparently, he spoke formally,
was wearing glasses,

655
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,822
and had his hair

656
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,451
pulled back all neat like this.

657
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,581
It must be 7th Floor.

658
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,498
Right.

659
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,502
I was the one
who promised to give him the money.

660
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,672
I couldn't find them.

661
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,673
I knew it.

662
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,220
I did mention before
that you weren't so smart.

663
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,141
Excuse me.

664
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,810
This is 1st Floor's funeral, right?

665
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,606
And the chief mourner is 3rd Floor?

666
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,025
Yes.

667
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,152
There's a wreath delivery.

668
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,155
It's from… What was the name again?

669
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,283
MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
6TH FLOOR

670
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,038
6th Floor?

671
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:12,707
Yeah.

672
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,751
Judging by the flowers,

673
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,878
he must be doing well.

674
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,838
I thought it would be from 7th Floor.

675
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,760
I guess it's only us
on the lower floors here, then.

676
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,848
Come on. He might not have seen the ad.

677
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,892
He would've come if he knew.

678
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,520
He even went to see 1st Floor's family.

679
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,355
Oh, right. Here.

680
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,691
Have you seen this?

681
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,109
Look at this.

682
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,944
8th Floor.

683
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,196
"This is not art."

684
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:47,117
PERFORMANCE ARTIST SONG SERA
DESTROYS ART GALLERY WITH AN EXCAVATOR

685
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,536
8th Floor was an artist?

686
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,621
To be exact, a performance artist.

687
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,418
8th Floor had hired an excavator at night
and destroyed an art gallery.

688
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,672
She then left the title on a sign.

689
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,843
THIS IS NOT ART

690
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,721
She had to spend all her money
to compensate for the damages

691
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,390
done to the gallery and works,
and she was arrested.

692
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,393
I knew she'd end up like this.

693
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,605
Still, going to prison and all…

694
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,109
Like that, we went our separate ways.

695
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,904
We did not ask anything about each other.

696
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,867
Not even where we lived
or how our lives were.

697
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,454
We simply encouraged each other.

698
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:44,841
1st Floor.

699
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,721
Would it make any difference
even if we tried hard to live a good life?

700
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,264
This damn world.

701
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:56,936
CHEER UP, DON'T LOSE HOPE
WE'LL KEEP MARCHING AHEAD!

702
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,496
So the story ends like this
at the funeral.

703
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,294
You finally came to your senses, Mr. Yu.

704
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,839
I knew you'd be able to
come up with something good.

705
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,634
This is one hell of a story!

706
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,013
Hey, but you didn't show much

707
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,224
about the higher-floor people
in the ending.

708
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,892
I'm more curious about them.

709
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,603
Well, I'm still contemplating it.

710
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,606
The viewers won't want
the higher-floor people to turn out well.

711
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,525
They'll feel more at ease that way.

712
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,653
Yeah. Well, I guess so.

713
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,991
But we're living great lives, aren't we?

714
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,664
Sorry?

715
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,583
To tell you the truth,
I was in this show too.

716
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,212
I almost had a heart attack reading this.

717
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,216
How else do you think
I have so much money?

718
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,769
No, don't tell me this is real.
