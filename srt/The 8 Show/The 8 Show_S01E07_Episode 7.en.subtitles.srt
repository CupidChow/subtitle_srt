1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,011
5th Floor.

2
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,887
5th Floor!

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
Hurry! Wake up!

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,392
It's over now!

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,478
The show is all over!

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,064
5th Floor.

7
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,362
It's so refreshing!

8
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,032
5th Floor!

9
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,744
Shall we head home now?

10
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,220
5th Floor, thanks so much for everything.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,263
Don't cry, 5th Floor.

12
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,058
It just feels so unreal.

13
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,977
Try the hot dog.

14
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,646
1st Floor grilled it to perfection.

15
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,523
-Try the beer too.
-Really?

16
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,946
Wow, it's delicious.

17
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,284
Hey, you did a great job.

18
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,578
Let's get our prize money.

19
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,796
We're finally leaving.

20
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,550
Wait. Hold on a second.

21
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,718
Where's 2nd Floor?

22
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,680
2nd Floor?

23
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,723
Over there.

24
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:37,240
"You crazy bitch"?

25
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,901
What on earth is going on?

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,618
Run! Bang!

27
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,582
Dear me.

28
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,794
No wonder I had trouble reading.

29
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,887
But I don't get what this all means.

30
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,249
Please

31
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,793
untie my hands for just a second.

32
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,379
I want to hold you.

33
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,721
Hand me the tape!

34
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,956
Get that bastard!

35
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,632
You bastard!

36
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,011
You little…

37
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
Oh, over there!

38
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,255
Smith and Wesson M36.

39
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,716
And…

40
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,594
four bullets.

41
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,566
Thank you, 5th Floor.

42
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,028
I really mean it.

43
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,910
I thought they were a bunch of wimps,

44
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,078
but they can also play dirty.

45
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,830
I've got to give it to them.

46
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,768
One of you pulled out
eight of my toenails,

47
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,853
but two were left intact.

48
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,273
I'll admit that I underestimated you guys.

49
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,484
Sorry about that.

50
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,652
I mean it.

51
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,987
So, who was it?

52
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,073
Who was it?

53
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,824
You better speak up.

54
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,414
-Was it you?
-No, it wasn't me.

55
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,041
I swear.

56
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,169
Was it you?

57
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,339
No, it wasn't me!

58
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,885
You?

59
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,681
It was you, wasn't it?

60
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,016
We all know you have beef with me.

61
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,144
I understand.

62
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,481
I understand why you tied me up
and beat the hell out of me.

63
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,693
However, one of you
really crossed the line.

64
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,279
One of you here must know

65
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,739
that you've done something unspeakable.

66
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,743
I mean, really!

67
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,330
For fuck's sake.

68
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,749
Shit. I'm speechless.

69
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,510
Do you know what I thought about
while I was tied up?

70
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,887
"How will I find that bastard?"

71
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,431
No.

72
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,144
"How will I find the bastard
in an interesting way?"

73
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,187
So I came up with a game.

74
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,356
Russian roulette.

75
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:09,942
You all know it?

76
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,528
RUSSIAN ROULETTE

77
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,614
I've loaded the gun with one bullet.

78
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,366
The chances

79
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,452
are one in five.

80
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,747
I'm gonna shoot one person at a time.

81
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,417
Obviously, I won't aim at your heads.

82
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,836
I wouldn't wanna kill you.

83
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
I'll shoot your legs instead.

84
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,089
It'll be excruciating, I guess.

85
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,799
Let's go one by one.

86
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,594
I bet it'll be fun.

87
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,351
Who is it?

88
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,436
The culprit.

89
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,146
I said I don't know.

90
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,692
One.

91
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,487
Two.

92
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,156
I said I don't know!

93
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,867
Three!

94
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,922
Fucking hell. Aren't you lucky?

95
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,758
But you still deserve a fucking beating.

96
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,679
You arrogant bitch.

97
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,733
Our dear Mr. Limousine Liberal.

98
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,777
You know the culprit?

99
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,697
No. I don't know who it is.

100
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,031
So you have no idea.

101
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,158
Okay.

102
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,120
All right.

103
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,122
Here we go.

104
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,624
It'll sting a little.

105
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,127
One.

106
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,337
Two.

107
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,465
Three!

108
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,221
Fuck! That scared the shit out of me!

109
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,689
Hey.

110
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,858
Wrap his leg.

111
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,819
Goddamn it!

112
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,327
Wrap it tightly.

113
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,956
He's bleeding a lot, right?

114
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,007
This can do real damage.

115
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,931
Oh my.

116
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,892
Our dear Mr. 1st Floor.

117
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,894
Such a shame.
You've only got one good leg.

118
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,812
Please don't.

119
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,898
Please, 6th Floor.

120
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,441
No, please. Not my leg.

121
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,151
Not my leg.

122
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,987
No, not my leg!

123
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,993
I prayed for the first time in my life

124
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,454
to help me catch
the bastard who did this to me.

125
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,413
With all my heart.

126
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,165
Please! I'm begging you.

127
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,833
Spare my leg!

128
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,585
Pray.

129
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,046
Perhaps your prayers will be answered.

130
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,174
One.

131
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,136
Two!

132
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,555
Please don't!

133
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,274
-Three!
-Wait!

134
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
Please wait!

135
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,402
I know!

136
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,737
I…

137
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,451
I know who did it.

138
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,954
No. I mean, I know how to find out.

139
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,206
You know "how"?

140
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,250
You don't know "who." What bullshit.

141
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,252
A witness. There's a witness.

142
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,337
A witness?

143
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,381
The…

144
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,218
the people who watch through the CCTV.

145
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,766
The CCTV!

146
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,394
Buy the footage from that day.

147
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,397
We even bought
the recipe for making booze.

148
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,523
You can surely buy it.

149
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,275
You can do anything with money here!

150
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,945
That's ingenious!

151
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,238
I'm certain you can!

152
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,117
-Where are you going?
-To my room.

153
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,536
Why?

154
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,371
To watch the footage.

155
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,250
Why would you watch it?

156
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
Because it's fun!

157
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,254
Who will it be?

158
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,840
I hope we're in for a surprise.

159
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,426
I'm just dying to know.

160
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,971
Where are you going?

161
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,556
Sorry?

162
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,474
Stay and watch them!

163
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,603
Okay.

164
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,199
You know the footage
of 6th Floor's toenails being pulled out?

165
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,243
We'll buy the footage.

166
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,828
From my room, please.

167
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,916
Oh! 100 million won?

168
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,667
I will

169
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,045
watch it alone in my room.

170
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,884
Fun is meant to be shared, you know?

171
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,803
7th Floor.

172
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,681
Are you okay?

173
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,902
Who was it?

174
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,445
Tell us.

175
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,404
Be quiet!

176
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,573
Everyone will find out soon enough.

177
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,618
The real culprit.

178
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,245
100 million won, gone.

179
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,460
It's just like the movies!

180
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,758
Wow, I really love this kind of event.

181
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,842
A surprise!

182
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,261
Who is it?

183
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,892
My palms are sweating.

184
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,916
1st Floor.

185
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,255
It was you, wasn't it?

186
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,106
That son of a bitch!

187
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:18,912
I'm sorry.

189
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,377
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,671
Thinking about what he'd done to me,

191
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,631
I was so furious,

192
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,009
upset, and…

193
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,635
And you needed more money.

194
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,304
Right?

195
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,680
Was that so wrong of me?

196
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,771
Those people used us to make money.

197
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,607
Don't we have the right to do the same?

198
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,027
Why are we the only ones to always suffer?

199
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,321
Why?

200
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,543
Oh my!

201
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,173
1st Floor is a total maniac!

202
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,302
Look at you lapping it all up!

203
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,518
To be honest,
I didn't want the show to end.

204
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,604
How could I…

205
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,566
How could I possibly leave this place?

206
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,485
Regardless of what happens to me,

207
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,738
I wanted to stay here,
even if it was just a little longer.

208
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,906
And that's why I…

209
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,074
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,078
I mean, still,

211
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,082
how could you pull out a girl's tooth?

212
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,003
You evil bastard! You lunatic!

213
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:54,049
I need a dental implant at this age
because of you!

214
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,680
I'm gonna kill that bastard

215
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,932
and end the show.

216
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,609
6th Floor! That prick is the culprit!

217
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,570
-Hey, 1st Floor!
-1st Floor, that bastard!

218
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,906
Please don't do this!

219
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,011
What?

220
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,061
You're too aggressive, 6th Floor.

221
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,354
From the very start.

222
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,028
He looks like he's injured.

223
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:56,945
4th Floor.

224
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,032
-Can you come tie him up?
-What?

225
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,451
Okay.

226
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,548
5th Floor is just too soft at heart.

227
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,467
Don't blame her too much.

228
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,189
That bastard.
I'm going to kill that bastard.

229
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,398
That scumbag.

230
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,068
He tricked me, the bastard.

231
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,903
That won't do, 5th Floor.

232
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,281
It won't do. Or else I can't free you.

233
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,200
Okay?

234
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,412
I got back at him for you.

235
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,498
His back snapped in two.

236
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,583
It'll be much worse for him to be alive.

237
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,046
No one can die in here.

238
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,589
Not ever.

239
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,927
Can you promise me that?

240
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,057
Can you?

241
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,233
Look at the time, everyone.

242
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,696
One surprise event after another!

243
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,447
I simply adore being here.

244
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,286
Isn't this just beautiful?

245
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,832
I bet there's more fun waiting ahead.

246
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,083
I'm so excited.

247
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,008
8th Floor had 5th Floor treat 7th Floor.

248
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,220
Then she made us move 6th Floor
to his room.

249
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,513
Speed it up a bit.

250
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,765
Then she tied us up one by one

251
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,268
and confined us to our rooms.

252
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,522
Just like that,
our revolution came to an end.

253
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:56,940
Get some rest.

254
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,943
We were numb to the pain.

255
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,280
Just last night,
we'd slept in such comfort.

256
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,824
It all feels like a dream.

257
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,452
As if it had never happened.

258
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,747
As if we'd always been in this pain.

259
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,832
As if it had never left us.

260
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,710
Will this pain ever end?

261
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,921
No, is this even real?

262
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,966
Perhaps I'm still dreaming.

263
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,097
Every day, 8th Floor purchased
footage of us writhing in pain

264
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,140
and watched it.

265
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,726
It was quite expensive,

266
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,854
but she earned way more,
so she was able to.

267
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,733
I think I need something more stimulating.

268
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,696
We've sweat and bled.

269
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,783
Beat, stabbed, and tased one another.

270
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,244
Incitement, deceit,

271
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,287
treachery, and extortion.

272
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,874
To deceive, to be deceived,
and to deceive again.

273
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,254
We've just about done everything

274
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,005
humans can do to each other.

275
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,637
It's dying.

276
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,472
The flame.

277
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,726
They've seen all there is to offer.

278
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,146
It's become boring.

279
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,398
Stimulation.

280
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,152
What's the ultimate stimulation?

281
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,320
I pondered about that yesterday.

282
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,572
Stay still.

283
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,409
What would they find truly exciting?

284
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,412
Something they haven't seen yet.

285
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,165
You won't be injured or anything,

286
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,791
since the show must go on.

287
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,795
And if you get hurt,
5th Floor will be there to help.

288
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,267
SLEEP DEPRIVATION TORTURE

289
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,603
Wait.

290
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,326
One thing that the Geneva Conventions
forbid under any circumstances,

291
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,954
even in wartime
when people kill one another ruthlessly,

292
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,874
is using human bodies for experiments.

293
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,588
The stimulation was no longer for the show
but just for the sake of it.

294
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,216
To cause pain to another person

295
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,553
without a basis of reason.

296
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,516
The simple act of one individual
inflicting pain on another.

297
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,020
Nothing is quite as stimulating
as a never-before-seen act.

298
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,024
It is unique,
and even its dullness is not an issue.

299
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,692
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,988
Touching the deepest parts of the human,
though perhaps never fully understood how.

301
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,365
I'm sorry.

302
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,453
I'm sorry!

303
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,348
4th Floor fed us,

304
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,142
taped us when the tape fell off,

305
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,230
and continued torturing us
by depriving us of sleep.

306
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,856
Oh, please let me go.

307
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,984
5th Floor appeared to have lost all hope.

308
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,944
Despite our desperate cries for help,

309
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,280
she only maintained our bodily functions,

310
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,740
just enough to keep us alive.

311
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,537
So that we were unable to die,
forever in pain.

312
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,880
Are you okay, 3rd Floor?

313
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,469
7th Floor, how are you…

314
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,055
Weren't you tied up?

315
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,765
Me?

316
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,352
Why would I be? I'm 7th Floor.

317
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,521
What?

318
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,356
You didn't know?

319
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,698
I guess you had no idea.

320
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,120
You're the only one like this.

321
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,831
This…

322
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,335
What?

323
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,795
This is all…

324
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,257
happening in your head.

325
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,280
Oh no!

326
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,201
Oh, I feel the suffering of the world!

327
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,499
I know, right?

328
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,629
It's like I can feel their pain too.

329
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,637
This won't do.

330
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,682
Should I set them free, then?

331
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,979
I must paint.

332
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,482
Sorry?

333
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,487
I'm overwhelmed with emotion.

334
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,073
This feeling…

335
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,994
I must express this feeling.

336
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,767
What do you think?

337
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,815
8th Floor.

338
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,655
I'm deeply touched.

339
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,408
What's the title of the painting?

340
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,958
Both the title
and the painting are luxurious.

341
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,919
Just like you.

342
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,629
Then don't you think…

343
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,051
I deserve to buy a purse?

344
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,847
Of course, 8th Floor.

345
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,855
Oh, wait.

346
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,319
I have one more thing to buy.

347
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,197
What is it?

348
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,784
Coco.

349
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,453
Coco, how do you like my new purse?

350
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,338
"Woof, woof! It's so pretty!"

351
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,674
It's pretty, isn't it?

352
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,639
"Woof, woof."

353
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,476
I'm so sick and tired of this.

354
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,355
4th Floor.

355
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,441
What?

356
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,402
I'm in a bad mood today.

357
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,029
I'm sorry.

358
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:12,865
What is it?

359
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,909
Did you relieve yourself again?

360
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,079
Come on! You barely even eat!

361
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,622
It's not that.

362
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,626
For pulling your tooth out, 4th Floor,

363
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,669
I'm truly…

364
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,463
I'm truly sorry.

365
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,345
You surprised me then.

366
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:36,973
It's fine.

367
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,268
With time,

368
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,311
I came to understand you.

369
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,024
We are all dead serious
when it comes to money.

370
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,445
And in a way,
I'm making more money thanks to you.

371
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,905
I'll just get a dental implant.

372
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,493
1st Floor.

373
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,162
In this place,

374
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,206
I don't consider myself a human.

375
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,376
I'm just, how should I say it, a player.

376
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,797
A human being should behave humanely,

377
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,717
but a player only needs to perform well.

378
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,888
That's why I'm putting up with this,

379
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,348
cleaning human poop

380
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,975
and now dog poop as well.

381
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,147
I'm really serious about the show now.

382
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:28,816
4th Floor.

383
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,569
Yes?

384
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,821
Do you really mean it?

385
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,326
About what? The dog poop?

386
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,329
That you're serious about the show.

387
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,915
I mean,

388
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,169
do you think
I'm cleaning up after you for fun?

389
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,258
Aren't you going to eat more?

390
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,558
You can leave with much more.

391
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,647
You can make

392
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,984
an amount you couldn't even
begin to imagine.

393
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,406
What?

394
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,577
You can change rooms.

395
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,082
What the fuck are you saying?

396
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,750
You can

397
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,503
change rooms.

398
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,089
There's a way

399
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,384
for you to become 8th Floor.

400
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,713
Ten thousand won.

401
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,144
First floor.

402
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,738
By any chance…

403
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,951
is there a way

404
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,412
to change rooms?

405
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,174
A billion won.

406
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,639
When do you want to end this show?

407
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,307
In my opinion,

408
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,519
1st Floor should be the one to decide.

409
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,688
Yeah, you decide.

410
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,024
How much will be enough for you?

411
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,777
I…

412
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,742
want to make one billion won.

413
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,329
I just need…

414
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,874
a billion won.
