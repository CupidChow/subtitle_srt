1
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,601
"If you wish to participate,

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,646
choose one of the numbered cards and…"

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,940
I have trouble making decisions.

4
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,667
No, not this one.

5
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,213
All right.

6
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,886
A hundred times more?

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,847
That's just crazy.

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,475
How can a blanket cost four million won?

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,772
Do you guys have something
like a sleeping bag instead?

10
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,440
The cheapest one.

11
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,028
Is that the cheapest there is?

12
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,700
Okay. I'll take it.

13
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,411
Right. And do you have a…

14
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,289
I forget what it's called.

15
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,801
IF THERE'S TIME TO EAT,
THERE'S TIME TO SET YOUR MIND

16
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,845
IF I SET MY MIND THREE TIMES A DAY,
JUST LIKE I EAT THREE MEALS

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,013
IT WILL CHANGE MY LIFE

18
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,476
All right! You got this!

19
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,921
Are humans living
or in the process of dying?

20
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,217
In medicine, the rule of threes
defines the human ability

21
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,261
to survive in extreme conditions.

22
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,763
Three minutes without air.

23
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,515
Three weeks without food.

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,559
And three days without water.

25
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,729
I am dying.

26
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,606
According to theory,

27
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm gonna die today.

28
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,697
We all wondered what she would do.

29
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,034
-But in reality…
-Get lost!

30
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,037
…we were the ones powerless
to do anything.

31
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,125
1st Floor.

32
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,796
What is he doing over there?

33
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,092
Trying to chase the crows away.
He said they irritate him.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,512
He still has the energy to do that?

35
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,850
8th Floor, to be honest,

36
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,562
I may look extremely fit,
but I'm really weak and feeble.

37
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,023
8th Floor locked herself in her room.

38
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,776
I have to eat three meals a day,
no matter what.

39
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,696
She had plenty of food and water,
so she had no reason to leave.

40
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,323
If you don't share the food…

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:05,119
By doing nothing,
8th Floor was putting our lives at risk.

42
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,374
And there was absolutely nothing
the rest of us could do.

43
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,959
Looks like we earned more time.

44
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,296
They must enjoy watching us suffer.

45
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,215
Fuck.

46
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,510
Why are you all out here doing nothing?

47
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,846
How come I'm the only one begging?

48
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,432
Shouldn't we all be at her door?

49
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,558
Why should we?

50
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,394
It's all your fault.

51
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,354
What do you mean?

52
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,523
You convinced everyone
to vote for 8th Floor.

53
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,109
You were disrespectful to your higher-up.

54
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,944
What do you mean, "higher-up"?

55
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,861
What else?

56
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,322
Just because she got lucky
and picked the top floor

57
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,074
doesn't mean she's my higher-up.

58
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,035
She's depriving everyone of food
for no reason.

59
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,289
I wouldn't be doing this
if I were 8th Floor.

60
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,291
I would be nice to those below me.

61
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,959
Wait.

62
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,461
I didn't mean it like that.

63
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,671
That stupid bitch.

64
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,930
5th Floor.

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,601
What?

66
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,061
8th Floor.

67
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,814
Who wants to eat?

68
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,696
Doesn't your prize money get reduced
by bringing these out?

69
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,613
Is that so?

70
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,158
It's okay. I'm rich.

71
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,662
Come on over, everyone.

72
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,248
8th Floor brought out the meal kits.

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
Wow. They look so delicious.

74
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,716
-Slow down.
-Take your time.

75
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,635
Take your time eating.
You'll get indigestion.

76
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,180
8th Floor.

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,307
Thank you so much.

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,308
5th Floor?

79
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,478
I'm so glad. This is great.

80
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,107
Are you okay?

81
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,572
I've had enough.

82
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:07,825
2nd Floor.

83
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,577
Wait.

84
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,121
What do you…

85
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,998
What do you mean?

86
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,836
What good is the money
if we starve to death?

87
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,421
I'm gonna use up all the time.

88
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,299
What are you doing?

89
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,429
I won't starve myself to death
just so that brat gets her way.

90
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,722
I won't do it.

91
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,182
I'm going to end this.

92
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:32,809
Just wait.

93
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,977
Let her blow off steam.

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,982
No, 2nd Floor.

95
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,151
Please.

96
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,904
I can't leave like this.

97
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,781
Please, 2nd Floor.

98
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,159
I can't leave until I make a billion won,
even if it kills me.

99
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,453
Please, 2nd Floor.

100
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,580
2nd Floor.

101
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,500
I beg you, 2nd Floor. Please?

102
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,044
He's right. Fuck it.

103
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,547
What's the point of leaving?

104
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,633
I'd rather die than leave like this.

105
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
The poop!

106
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,683
I'll keep it.

107
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,066
I'll apologize to 8th Floor
and nullify the vote.

108
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,943
And I will keep

109
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,612
everyone's poop.

110
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,242
Frankly, it's only fair.

111
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,120
In the talent show…

112
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,169
I did the worst.

113
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,345
When 1st Floor couldn't climb the stairs
because of his leg,

114
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,764
he volunteered to keep all the poop.

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,601
I should've done what he did,
but I had no courage.

116
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,560
In fact,

117
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,480
I was a coward!

118
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,607
I've been pondering
whether I should say this…

119
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,319
but it's the right thing to do.

120
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,445
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,405
Are you okay with this?

122
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,451
Whether I'm okay with it or not
is irrelevant.

123
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,827
The bathroom is nothing.

124
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,372
I'd rather keep the poop
to get a sip of water and a bite to eat

125
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,542
than wait until someone dies
and the show ends.

126
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,710
Me too!

127
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,006
I'll keep the poop too.

128
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,929
Honestly, I hardly earned
any more time than 3rd Floor.

129
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,847
And I convinced everyone to vote…

130
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:37,975
for 8th Floor.

131
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,481
So let's

132
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,733
share it.

133
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,652
The poop.

134
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,364
Fuck. She's actually crying?

135
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,616
That's right.

136
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,244
You'd also do anything for food, huh?

137
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,538
4th Floor.

138
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,414
Let's go together.

139
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,052
Wait. Hold on.

140
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,137
I'm sorry,

141
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,557
but may I go talk to her
instead of you two?

142
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,891
-What?
-Sorry?

143
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,892
It's just that…

144
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,440
I don't think this matter
should be resolved based on emotions.

145
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,154
8th Floor. It's me, 7th Floor.

146
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,240
None of us are doing so well.

147
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,160
Our lives will be in danger
if we go another day without water.

148
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,207
There were some things
we failed to realize.

149
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,210
You contributed greatly
to the talent show,

150
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,338
but we all overlooked your efforts.

151
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,256
We apologize.

152
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,803
3rd Floor and 4th Floor
have volunteered to keep the waste.

153
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,973
They also wanted to apologize
for not being fair.

154
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,113
The door opened.

155
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,034
That's what I thought.

156
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,869
I knew something was off.

157
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,457
I knew it didn't make sense
when voting was suggested.

158
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,710
Can I finish what I was doing?

159
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,503
Sure.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,888
But is everyone really mad at me?

161
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,684
They all kept coming to my door.

162
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,605
No. They were all worried
that you were upset.

163
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,316
Me? Getting upset gives you wrinkles,

164
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,902
so I'm not easily upset.

165
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,945
What a relief.

166
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,490
I thought

167
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,284
I was being unreasonable,

168
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,620
but everyone understands.

169
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,470
How refreshing.

170
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,181
Honestly, I love this place.

171
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,600
It's so fun, and you get paid too.

172
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,602
I want to stay here as long as possible.

173
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,354
Right.

174
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,857
I bet I earned us lots of time
by not giving you guys food.

175
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,192
Didn't it?

176
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,070
Oh, yes.

177
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,406
In that case, since you all apologized,

178
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,741
can I buy some clothes?

179
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,494
-I'm tired of these.
-Sure, if you'd like.

180
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,704
For the last few days,

181
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,248
I've been thinking a lot
about some games to play.

182
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,625
This will be so exciting!

183
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,462
You look so cool, babe.
That outfit was made for you!

184
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,089
-You nailed it!
-Really?

185
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,674
Even better than before.

186
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,593
How do I look?

187
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,555
You look gorgeous.

188
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,849
Right, she does. It suits you perfectly.

189
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,477
2nd Floor was particularly upset
about buying clothes with our time,

190
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,104
but 7th Floor convinced us.

191
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,523
At least things ended
with us on equal terms.

192
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,441
"Equal terms"?

193
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,194
We had to apologize and buy her clothes.
Is that truly "equal"?

194
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,071
The fact that we can apologize

195
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,992
means that we're still
on equal terms with 8th Floor.

196
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,036
If we succumbed to her
instead of just apologizing,

197
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,123
we wouldn't be able to carry on
with the show in the same way.

198
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,750
We would have all ended up

199
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,793
as 8th Floor's slaves.

200
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,628
He has a point.

201
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,922
If she'd thought to herself,

202
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,300
"Starve them a bit,
and they'll do anything I say,"

203
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,177
and controlled us through provisions,

204
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,304
we'd have had no choice but to obey.

205
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,055
Food was on the line.

206
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,766
It truly is a relief

207
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,518
that she's more interested
in clothes than food.

208
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,106
And that someone
as smart as 7th Floor is on our side.

209
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,818
And the very next day,

210
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,780
we finally got our hands on the meal kits

211
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,073
we were all dreaming of.

212
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,422
They say

213
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,510
the three pillars of life
are sex, sleep, and food.

214
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,970
Fuck that bullshit.

215
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,806
Nothing matters but food!

216
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,516
Food!

217
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,392
It's food!

218
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,439
This is the life.

219
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,650
This is what it means to be alive.

220
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,035
Of course, the poop makes its way down
from the 8th floor.

221
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,371
4th Floor takes half,

222
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,456
and I take the rest.

223
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,791
But who cares?

224
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,127
Nothing is free in this world.

225
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,340
If I can't put up with this,
I don't deserve the money.

226
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,010
And…

227
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,721
I'll handle mine.

228
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,598
-2nd Floor and…
-Just keep the others'.

229
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
Thank you so much.

230
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,434
…1st Floor are saints.

231
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,894
I can take care of mine.

232
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,445
Hang the fuck on.
Is 4th Floor really taking her share?

233
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
Why is there so much?

234
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,116
BELIEVE, AND YOU WILL ACHIEVE

235
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,917
8th Floor said
that while we were starving,

236
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,295
she was coming up with games
for us to play.

237
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,504
How about the King Game?

238
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,422
KING GAME

239
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,008
She suggested it excitedly
as if it were an amazing idea.

240
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,843
Agreed?

241
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,763
Doesn't it involve making people do
dirty things and stuff?

242
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,684
It doesn't just involve dirty things.

243
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,769
You just say what you want others to do.

244
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,105
It's not like I'm against sexy games.

245
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,442
It sounds fun and hot.

246
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,444
Seriously? The King Game?

247
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,989
I mean, we're not kids.
Aren't we a bit old for this?

248
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,616
Do they want money that badly?

249
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,075
Who on earth would do this?

250
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,785
I think it's a good idea too.

251
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,415
Unlike the talent show, there's no concern
about unequal contributions.

252
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,042
I'm in as well!

253
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,961
Me too.

254
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,341
Whatever.

255
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,134
I'm in too.

256
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,596
What a great idea.

257
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,264
8th Floor, you're amazing.

258
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,558
I loved playing this game in college!

259
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,768
You all did, right?

260
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,354
Are we really playing it?
You're the best, 8th Floor.

261
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
This is the K ball or the king ball.

262
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,029
The balls are inside this box.

263
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,614
Whoever picks the K ball

264
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,952
picks two numbers from one to seven
and tells them what to do, whatever it is.

265
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,626
Three?

266
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,045
Is it my destiny number or what?

267
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,464
I got the K!

268
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,424
I'm the king.

269
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,885
I choose two and five.

270
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,220
Until the next round,

271
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,263
hold hands.

272
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,685
Come on.
That's not how you play this game.

273
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,770
You have to do something more fun.

274
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,439
But I'm the king.

275
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,983
I think this is fun.

276
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,317
Okay, then.

277
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,195
Who has two and five?

278
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,701
Man, don't lace your fingers.

279
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,703
I'm sorry. I--

280
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,664
No. You can't let go until the next round.

281
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,374
You're so bad.

282
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,753
You call this fun?

283
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,631
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,511
Yes! I'm the king!

285
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,100
Since the practice round is over,
why don't we take it up a notch?

286
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,395
Six and seven should share
a nice, proper kiss.

287
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,650
Ready, set, go!

288
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,985
Hold on.

289
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,155
I just need to prepare myself.

290
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,033
Come on, it's just a kiss.

291
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,994
Ready, set, go!

292
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,874
Oh my God.

293
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,378
One more time.

294
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,175
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,972
We only got an hour and a half,
even after the kiss and holding hands.

296
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,432
Man, they're so stingy.

297
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:39,850
That was fun.

298
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,980
It's me.

299
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,524
What should I do?

300
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,195
Three…

301
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,282
and seven.

302
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,536
French kiss.

303
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,663
French kiss?

304
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,873
For fuck's sake.

305
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,254
Who's her partner?

306
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,137
Come on. Hurry up and make out!

307
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,307
What if I don't?

308
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,312
What happens if I refuse?

309
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,440
-Sorry?
-Isn't it up to the king anyway?

310
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,775
Let's take it up a notch.

311
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,736
I'll do anything but that.

312
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,738
Fine.

313
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,117
In that case,

314
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,955
I feel pairing 2nd Floor and three
won't be much fun to watch.

315
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,374
Let's go with two instead.

316
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,543
Who has two?

317
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,089
I want two and 2nd Floor to fight.

318
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,090
A single round.

319
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,676
It's finally here.

320
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,302
The very moment 7th Floor

321
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,515
was most hung up on and eager to avoid.

322
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,016
Perfect.

323
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,104
Shit, they say only pussies fight girls.

324
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,148
You sure you aren't one?

325
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,151
For a girl as lanky as you,
you're full of hot air.

326
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
I'm going to fight for real.

327
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,166
-I won't go easy.
-Bring it on.

328
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,792
-No, come on.
-Wait.

329
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,489
Oh no. What do we do?

330
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,950
You're amazing.

331
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,671
She's so cool!

332
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,881
Oh God.

333
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,134
2nd Floor said she used to work out.
She wasn't joking.

334
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,138
No matter what field you're in,

335
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,225
being a professional means
you're leagues ahead of any amateur.

336
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,562
Even a rookie like me can tell
that 2nd Floor is pulling her punches.

337
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,983
In other words,
the obvious winner of this fight is…

338
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,318
Do you surrender?

339
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,871
Oh no!

340
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,877
Wow, 2nd Floor!

341
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,677
That didn't sound good.

342
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,931
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

343
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,016
It's just a sprain. It'll be fine.

344
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,877
Oh no, please stop.

345
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,343
Oh dear!

346
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,723
-He's gonna kill her!
-Please stop them.

347
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,683
Why? No one's given up yet.

348
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,114
Stop!

349
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,409
-Surrender!
-Oh no!

350
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,368
-6th Floor!
-6th Floor!

351
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,371
-6th Floor!
-Stop it!

352
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,414
Please, 6th Floor!

353
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,332
Stop. It's over.

354
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,042
-Calm down.
-Please, 6th Floor.

355
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,710
-You must stop!
-Surrender!

356
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,295
-Say it!
-2nd Floor.

357
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,504
-Stop!
-Surrender!

358
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,839
Are you okay, 2nd Floor?

359
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,758
Stop it!

360
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,096
This is unbelievably fun.

361
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,267
What a mess.

362
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,199
That's about 50 hours, right?

363
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,754
6th Floor.

364
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,673
I know it was a game,
but how could you take it that far?

365
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,842
He's right. You took it too far.

366
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,470
She's in bad shape now.

367
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,682
Isn't that what a fight is like?

368
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,144
If someone tells us
to fight again in the future,

369
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,813
will that happen again?

370
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,900
If you're cheeky.

371
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,445
No.

372
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,115
Let's exclude things like fighting
from now on.

373
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,492
We have no way to treat injuries.

374
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,953
It could cause permanent damage.

375
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,664
Will it just be things like kissing, then?

376
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,375
Time will run out quickly, you know.

377
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,253
But we can't keep doing that.

378
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,506
I can't beat people up.

379
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,010
How about imposing penalties?

380
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,852
Right now, we have to obey
whatever the king says, right?

381
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,856
Why don't we impose a penalty
we can choose instead?

382
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,442
Then you won't have to fight
if you don't want to.

383
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,360
Won't everyone just choose to disobey?

384
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,778
No one will want to obey.

385
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,280
We'll impose a harsh penalty

386
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,032
so you can only disobey
when you really can't do it.

387
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,996
I've seen someone
test this out on YouTube.

388
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,748
This thing is a bit noisy.

389
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,002
It's not life-threatening or anything.

390
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,755
You get shocked for a moment.
Just slightly.

391
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,635
Don't people knock horses down
with tasers?

392
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,018
Those are the super strong ones.

393
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,312
I don't think you can buy those.

394
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,605
It might sting a little.

395
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,940
Are you speaking from experience?

396
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,569
No, I've never been tased myself.

397
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,865
That sounds so fun!

398
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,867
I wanna try being tased.

399
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,786
Are you serious? As a penalty?

400
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,996
Yes, of course.

401
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm gonna get tased. I'm 100% sure.

402
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,959
She definitely won't. I'm 200% sure.

403
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,419
It's gonna be so much fun.

404
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,922
I think this is a better option

405
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,049
than fighting.

406
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,091
That's true.

407
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,929
Yes, that might be better.

408
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,806
Fighting when we all live together

409
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,891
is just awful.

410
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,101
I understand, but--

411
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,603
It's decided, then.

412
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,067
How do I use this?

413
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,998
A taser.

414
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,210
One person will be punished every round.

415
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,045
Actually, possibly none.

416
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,340
Ultimately, I have a one in eight chance
of being chosen.

417
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,800
That's 12.5%.

418
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,762
Let me think. Isn't 12.5% actually low?

419
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,222
Wait a minute.

420
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,684
In other words,
I'm safe 87.5% of the time.

421
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,519
And if I pull through this,

422
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,688
I'm rewarded
with loads of time and a fortune.

423
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,315
Okay, let's think this through.

424
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,318
If the time is extended by 24 hours,
that's 43 million won.

425
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,403
Since it's one in eight,

426
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,447
let's say I'll be punished
once a week at the most.

427
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,203
"Recruiting taser experiment subjects.
Once a week."

428
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,788
"300 million won a week."

429
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,709
It's actually not a bad offer.

430
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,923
In fact, there's no reason not to do it.

431
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,341
It would be stupid not to.

432
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,763
However, with every chance
of earning a fortune

433
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,433
comes an equal risk of failure.

434
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,728
The greatest risk here
is lack of experience.

435
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,565
My heart races at the thought
of this uncharted territory of pain.

436
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,861
But the police wouldn't use it
if it were lethal.

437
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,116
Hence, it has to be someone else
who gets tased first.

438
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,826
For that to happen…

439
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,372
My anxiety's upsetting my stomach.

440
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,796
I must try my hardest in the game.

441
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,807
How is 2nd Floor doing?

442
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,603
She'll be in more pain today
than yesterday.

443
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,313
She can't join us.

444
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,400
Nice makeover.

445
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,456
The same rules apply as yesterday.

446
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,708
If you don't want to obey
the king's orders,

447
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,877
you can be tased instead.

448
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,966
It looks like a letter.

449
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,304
Please be king. K!

450
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,141
Damn it. It just had to be unlucky four.

451
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,185
Wow!

452
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,939
I'm the king!

453
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,982
Why does it have to be that wacko again?

454
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,442
Okay. Four

455
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,861
touches five's

456
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,364
breasts.

457
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,241
What?

458
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,951
Touch them under the clothes.

459
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,577
Has she lost her mind?

460
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,996
How could she order
something so vulgar and immoral

461
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,083
while laughing nonchalantly
with such an innocent face?

462
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,167
What should I do?

463
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,504
I have five.

464
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,965
I can't watch this.

465
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,633
Four? Who's four?

466
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,137
Wow, he's the lucky one!

467
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,431
My goodness.

468
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,478
Let's get started, then.

469
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,355
Begin on the count of three.

470
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,026
Is this really okay?

471
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,944
One.

472
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,738
Can I really do this?

473
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,406
This is crazy!

474
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,450
Two.

475
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,578
-Three!
-Hold on a second. Wait.

476
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,715
What am I supposed to do?

477
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,841
Let's go again.

478
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,136
One.

479
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:28,433
Two.

480
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,643
Three!

481
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,980
Zap me. Wait, no, I mean…

482
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,483
I'll take the penalty.

483
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,694
No, it's okay. Just go ahead--

484
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,821
No, it's fine. I'll take the penalty.

485
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,324
-It's really okay.
-I'll take the taser.

486
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,705
That's right, Jin-su.

487
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,584
This is the right thing to do.
You are a man of morals.

488
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,463
In fact, I must look awesome right now.

489
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,175
Yes. It's better to be a gentleman
than a scumbag.

490
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,178
Wait a second.

491
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,351
You could get hurt,
so you'd better sit down.

492
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,727
Fuck me.

493
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,730
Going first was the last thing I wanted.

494
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,444
They say it's better to get
the worst part over with, but this…

495
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,363
I have no idea what it'll be like,

496
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,615
so I feel like I'm suffocating.

497
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,243
It won't be that bad, will it?

498
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,703
Okay. You got this.

499
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,289
Yes, okay. You can do it.

500
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,833
Let's do this, Bae Jin-su!

501
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,792
Okay, I'm ready--

502
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,467
3rd Floor!

503
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,052
3rd Floor!

504
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,096
Are you okay, 3rd Floor?

505
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,056
-Are you okay?
-3rd…

506
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,690
You said it wouldn't hurt too much.

507
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,234
That's what I thought.

508
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,113
Sixty hours.

509
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,490
We just earned 60 more hours.

510
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,828
At least that earned us a lot of time.

511
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,506
Are you okay, 3rd Floor?

512
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
It's so wet.

513
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,442
You should've just touched my breast.

514
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,944
No, you did well, like a real man.

515
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,029
I'd like you all

516
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,072
to leave, please.

517
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,449
3rd floor.

518
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,491
Please leave.

519
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,826
Please.

520
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,552
I never want to experience
pain like that again.

521
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,056
Next time, I'm touching
whatever it is I'm told to touch!

522
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,641
I'll literally obey any order!

523
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,060
Only those with experience will know

524
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,646
just how unpleasant
and disgusting this agony is.

525
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,360
Once more, it's time to draw
the express ticket to hell.

526
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,155
There's no way I'll be punished
two days in a row, right?

527
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,241
Please let it be the king. The king!

528
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,911
The king!

529
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,413
Yes! I'm the king!

530
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,583
Fuck.

531
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,462
My chances now are one in seven or 14%.

532
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,130
-I choose one…
-Please.

533
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,217
Yes! I'm safe!

534
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,344
Come on, please.

535
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,429
Please, not me.

536
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,514
And two.

537
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,266
It's not me.

538
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,978
Finally. I'm finally safe.

539
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,692
Sudden relief
after the emotional rollercoaster

540
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,820
released dopamine through my brain,
bringing an absolute catharsis.

541
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,739
Well, who has one and two?

542
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,408
It's me.

543
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,785
And me.

544
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,328
What?

545
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,539
-Do you want to go again?
-No.

546
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,291
I can't stand violent things.

547
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,460
I'll flip a coin instead.

548
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,505
If you guess correctly,
then you're off the hook.

549
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,215
If you get it wrong,

550
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,717
there's a penalty.

551
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,968
What? Wait.

552
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,889
I thought you only got the penalty
if you disobeyed the king.

553
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,807
Well…

554
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,603
We said the king can do whatever they want
if the selected people and the king agree.

555
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,605
Right, 2nd Floor?

556
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,233
Yeah.

557
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,445
Let's do it.

558
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,453
The chance is 50-50.

559
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,747
All right. I'm going to flip it now.

560
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,957
Neither the confident 2nd Floor

561
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,169
nor the aggressive 6th Floor
could mask their fear.

562
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,337
More so after seeing me yesterday.

563
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,554
All right. Take a guess.

564
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,098
Heads is the star, and tails is the heart.

565
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,016
Tails.

566
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,560
Well,

567
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,645
heads.

568
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,564
So exciting! I'm on my toes!

569
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,776
What?

570
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,364
It's heads!

571
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,450
CHOSEN FOR PENALTY

572
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,079
Fuck.

573
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,165
2nd Floor was brave until the end.

574
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,918
She had the spirit of a true warrior.

575
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,336
It'll sting a little.

576
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,629
Fuck you.

577
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,819
What are you doing?

578
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,197
From what I saw yesterday,
I thought we'd need this.

579
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,158
That's how I was yesterday?

580
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,286
She's so damn heavy.

581
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,372
How is she heavier than him?

582
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,457
We earned an extra two days.

583
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,629
We're earning so much time from this.

584
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,798
This is so electrifying!

585
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,759
"Electrifying"? That nutjob.

586
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,679
She really needs an "electrifying" lesson.

587
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,514
We're 30 days into the show.

588
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,016
It's the third day
of the lucky Pikachu experience.

589
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,811
Yet again, someone else is the king.

590
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,106
I'm the king again.

591
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,275
Are some people simply born lucky?

592
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,278
Picking the eighth floor,
evading the penalty,

593
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,613
and becoming the king over and over.

594
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,906
Three.

595
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,826
Yes! Just don't call out seven.

596
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,704
And…

597
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,081
Please, no. Not seven.

598
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,000
-Not--
-Seven.

599
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,794
Who picked three and seven?

600
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,135
Slap each other's faces

601
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,012
until one of you surrenders.

602
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,597
The loser is penalized.

603
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,056
It's a match.

604
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,391
No hard feelings.

605
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,312
-You okay with that?
-Yes.

606
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,022
No hard feelings.

607
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,815
Slapping?

608
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,109
Why would she make us do
such destructive things?

609
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,444
The answer…

610
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,783
struck me right across the face
as soon as the game began.

611
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,870
This game is perfect for breeding anger

612
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,122
and hatred among the contenders.

613
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,208
Animosity grows as it progresses.

614
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,921
Despite knowing that fact, I cannot stop.

615
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,673
No, I won't.
I don't want to experience it again.

616
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,343
Therefore, I'll do it.

617
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,262
I'll give it my all, grit my teeth, and--

618
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,310
I give up!

619
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,188
She went easy with the first slap.

620
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,920
This is so fucking humiliating.

621
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,259
Is that 2nd Floor?

622
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,554
She must be here to apologize
for slapping and tasing me.

623
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,099
What's the point?
I was already hurt and humiliated.

624
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,600
It's fine, 2nd Floor.

625
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,353
-Just leave me--
-That's not it, 3rd Floor.

626
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,313
1st Floor has something to say.

627
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,648
What?

628
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,441
Is something wrong?

629
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,278
This game that we're playing now…

630
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,572
it's been…

631
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,202
rigged from the start.

632
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,247
What?

633
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,166
I'm fully convinced
after seeing today's results.

634
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,085
This game

635
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,753
has never been

636
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,172
fair or just.

637
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,681
Would you care to guess?

638
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,598
Star for heads.

639
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,767
Heart for tails.

640
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,021
Heads.

641
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,606
No, you're wrong.

642
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,445
Why don't we go again?

643
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,784
How did you do that?

644
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,119
It's a simple trick.

645
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,999
4th Floor caught the coin she tossed
in between her palms.

646
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:55,916
Tails.

647
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,128
Only after hearing their choices…

648
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,046
Heads.

649
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,380
…did she show the results.

650
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,716
That's the wrong way.

651
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,761
You can feel the sides
when you catch it with your palms,

652
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,222
and you can flip it around
for the desired results.

653
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,433
Wait, who received the…

654
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,560
I mean, who avoided the penalty?

655
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,729
It was 6th Floor.

656
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,773
What the fuck is going on?

657
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,566
But that's not all.

658
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,111
There's a bigger trick.

659
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,446
Think carefully

660
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,574
about who kept becoming the king.

661
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,284
Don't tell me…

662
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,883
Where are you?

663
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,222
Who is the king?

664
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,439
I am.

665
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,481
Really?

666
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,358
That's great.

667
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,611
Your first time, right?

668
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,489
Yes.

669
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,552
How…

670
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,096
What are you doing? You startled me!

671
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,809
Jesus, I could have another seizure
if you surprise me like that.

672
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,811
It's acetone.

673
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,732
Table tennis balls made of celluloid
will react to acetone.

674
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,067
They'll probably turn slightly sticky.

675
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,070
That's how you chose the king.

676
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,492
I don't know what you're talking about.

677
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,660
The lower-floor participants…

678
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:42,791
are aware that someone
has been manipulating the game.

679
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,797
If we confront them with assumptions,

680
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,051
they won't admit it
and will become defensive.

681
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,345
In that case,
even if they did rig the game,

682
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,680
we might lose any evidence of it.

683
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,557
They're bound to slip up soon.

684
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,936
I think we should wait for that moment.

685
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,813
Do you think they'll let you off
if they discover…

686
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,817
you were behind all this?

687
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,988
If you can't take responsibility for it…

688
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,368
let the game be played as it should be.

689
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,869
I'll be looking forward…

690
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,289
to tomorrow's results.

691
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,631
Come on, 1st Floor. You're the king,

692
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,883
so tell us what you want us to do.

693
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,136
Four and six.

694
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,640
I'll flip the coin.

695
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,600
Who has the numbers?

696
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,518
Yes, four.

697
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,770
That's me.

698
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,938
And six?

699
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,280
Looks like it's me.

700
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,910
I choose heads.

701
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,997
I'll choose tails, then.

702
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,417
I'll flip it, then.

703
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,002
One second.

704
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:13,257
Could you catch the coin
with the back of your hand?

705
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,221
Okay.

706
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,240
Okay, then.

707
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,124
Tails.

708
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,712
Me?

709
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,216
-This is lame.
-What?

710
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,177
What do you mean, "lame"?

711
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,263
I know. You said it'd be fun
when we were deciding on the penalty.

712
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,181
Yes.

713
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,350
I guess I did back then.

714
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,977
But it's getting kind of lame now.

715
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,562
No. Not at all.

716
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,358
I'm having the time of my life.
This is so exciting, isn't it?

717
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,318
What a hoot. This is so much fun.

718
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,903
Keep your promise.

719
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,760
Finally…

720
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,645
we're about to get even.

721
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,517
See?

722
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,227
You act all high and mighty,

723
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,104
but you're a mere human

724
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,648
who pisses herself
like the rest of us when zapped.

725
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,983
Tell me if I'm wrong!

726
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:58,255
Okay, I'll count to three
and press the button.

727
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,592
One.

728
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,053
Two.

729
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,223
Three.

730
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,481
What the hell are you doing?

731
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,212
Why?

732
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,297
It's lame to be predictable.

733
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,891
We need a twist.

734
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,352
Don't you agree?
