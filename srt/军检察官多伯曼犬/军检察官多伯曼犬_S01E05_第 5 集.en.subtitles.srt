1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,528
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,696
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:36,995
6 YEARS AGO

5
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,553
OPERATING

6
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,057
CEO Cha of IM Defense Industry, who's
being investigated by the prosecution

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,977
for charges of leaking military secrets
and theft, died in a car accident,

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,106
and his family, who's with him in his car,
is told to be completely unconscious.

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,733
Meanwhile, due to CEO Cha's death,

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,902
-Yes, Auntie.
-all of the cases may be closed.

11
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,237
My meals? I do eat them on time.

12
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,572
Due to CEO Cha's death,

13
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,700
this case has no right to an arraignment.

14
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,953
Therefore the final conclusion
for this case is non-indictment.

15
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,333
It's sad news for the late
CEO Cha Ho-chul,

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,170
and for me,
who must close the investigation

17
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,631
without being able to reveal the truth.

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,301
May he rest in peace.

19
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,183
I mean it.

20
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,817
IM Defense Industry,

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,736
which was under legal management
after CEO Cha Ho-chul's death,

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,322
has been purchased after just a month.

23
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,991
In two weeks, precise inspection
of IM Defense Industry…

24
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,203
CEO CHA HO-CHUL

25
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,306
I got this place, thanks to you,
Prosecutor Yong.

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,016
It's something you wanted,

27
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,770
so I, too, will be at ease for a while.

28
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,942
You played a big role,
so you deserve an appropriate reward.

29
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,030
I'm going to make a law firm
that IM invests into.

30
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,825
A law firm that specializes
in military lawsuits.

31
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,995
You take it, Prosecutor Yong.

32
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,580
Thank you, General.

33
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,965
Tae-nam will only be
the owner of IM until he enlists.

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,431
Until he enlists, you said?

35
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,726
So look after Tae-nam until then.

36
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,228
Yes, ma'am. Don't worry.

37
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,486
Actually, what comes next
is the real issue.

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,614
The one who will take this place

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,742
after Tae-nam enlists.

40
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,246
As long as I'm wearing this uniform,
I cannot be in this place.

41
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,956
So it must be someone

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,126
who can rule IM in my place.

43
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,298
Well?

44
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,052
Can I trust you, Prosecutor Yong?

45
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,017
If someone has to be above me,

46
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,019
that could only be you, General.

47
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,938
I'll serve you with my utmost loyalty.

48
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,786
Doctor!

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,677
You're a disgrace
to all servicepeople of Korea.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,470
You wretched little worm.

51
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,436
Watch your language, please.

52
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,064
You bastard!

53
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,774
As soon as I get out of here,

54
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,276
I'm a civilian.

55
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm not your subordinate anymore.

56
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,392
You cannot get discharged,
Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

57
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,730
You must stay here and fight alongside me.

58
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,400
Because that's your fate.

59
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,031
I, too, am waiting for you

60
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,159
to be out of oblivion.

61
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,337
LAWYER YONG MOON-GOO

62
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,595
Mr. Noh enlisted without any trouble.

63
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,431
What remains now is Tae-nam's trial.

64
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,683
You don't need to worry about the trial.

65
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,311
Are you saying I don't need
to do anything about it?

66
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,520
That's right.

67
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,981
So something must have your back.

68
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,232
Good.

69
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,236
By the way, about that
military prosecutor brat…

70
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,198
You mean Doh Bae-man?

71
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,449
He's very annoying.

72
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,410
I got a bad feeling about him.

73
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,790
He was a hound dog I unleashed
into the military to make my work easier,

74
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,585
but after he tasted money,
he was getting impudently greedy.

75
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,881
He'll get some offers from law firms based
on the tricks he did in the military.

76
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,758
But that's it.

77
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,303
He'll go back to the sewers,
where he came from.

78
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,057
Because that's his fate.

79
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,451
Did your discharge report to
the Division Commander go well?

80
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,079
What happened to my parents

81
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,748
wasn't just a car accident,

82
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,793
but an incident intentionally caused
by someone.

83
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,130
Is that what I'm forgetting about?

84
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,513
I've been waiting for that question.

85
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,228
Did you get all of your memories back?

86
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,106
And who the culprit is too?

87
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,693
The index finger that's been cut off.

88
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,278
And a servicewoman.

89
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,989
And she is Noh Hwa-young.

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,704
Like you said, if that
servicewoman is Noh Hwa-young,

91
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,998
and if she caused an accident
to kill my parents,

92
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,250
why did she save me?

93
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,961
It's an alibi.

94
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,216
The goodwill of saving a child
proves that it wasn't intentional.

95
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,680
My father passed away,
and only I survived.

96
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,808
I regained my consciousness in a week.

97
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,227
Dad…

98
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,647
My survival was god's grace,

99
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,775
but it was a cruel miracle.

100
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,531
After I learned that they killed my father
making it look like an accident,

101
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,742
I had no time to be sad.

102
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,875
Three years to get my body back.

103
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,797
Two years to become a military prosecutor

104
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,134
at the fourth division, where
Noh Hwa-young would become the commander.

105
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,557
Doh Bae-man, the person
who has the same fate as I do,

106
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,893
but is one of them,

107
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,229
without knowing anything.

108
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,024
One year to stand in front of you.

109
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,909
I've waited for six years for this moment.

110
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,832
I need you no matter what,
Military Prosecutor Doh.

111
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,128
And I'm sure you'll need me, too.

112
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,719
Cha Woo-in.

113
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,430
How helpful was telling the truth
in your life?

114
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,224
What?

115
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,394
It seems like you think
all of your words and thoughts are true.

116
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,522
I don't even remember
my parents' faces anymore

117
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,148
because it's such a long time ago.

118
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,151
-Military Prosecutor Doh.
-To you, who has been planning revenge

119
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,571
for six years, it's crystal clear,

120
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,576
but I don't want to be stopped
by an unclear past.

121
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,332
Lawyer Doh Bae-man?

122
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,961
Yes.

123
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,172
Is something bothering you?

124
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,840
Nothing.

125
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,467
You may continue.

126
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,012
You have an amazing history
as a military prosecutor.

127
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,722
And the "Imperial Military Service" case

128
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,974
was an achievement even prosecutors
on the outside couldn't achieve.

129
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,395
That's not all. I heard you're
the only military prosecutor with the rate

130
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,315
of more than 90 percent of getting
guilty verdicts in the army,

131
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,399
the marines, and the air force.

132
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,945
Now then, you just need to get
100 percent rate of innocent verdicts

133
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,322
at our law firm.

134
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,157
Please start as an EP.

135
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,577
How is equity at the level of an EP
with 25 years of experience?

136
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,914
It's amazing and unmatched
in this industry, right?

137
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,834
Of course. It is the first time
in our law firm too.

138
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,878
Please join us

139
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:16,008
and unfold your beautiful future,
Lawyer Doh Bae-man.

140
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,261
My future…

141
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,722
I'll accept your offer.

142
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,518
Thank you so much.

143
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,489
Didn't Doh Bae-man say anything else
after the shooting range?

144
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,950
No.

145
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,369
See?

146
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,039
Did you think he'd be on our side if you
told him about his parents' accident?

147
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,292
Doh Bae-man prioritizes
money over revenge,

148
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,128
and he chose the future over the past.

149
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,879
He didn't choose yet.

150
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,799
Because not all of his memories are back.

151
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,386
But now…

152
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,054
Now?

153
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,058
He's confused.

154
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,811
Hey, he has been
working for Yong Moon-goo.

155
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,646
And that was ultimately for Noh Hwa-young.

156
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,065
How will he be able to deal with
the fact that he's been living

157
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,942
for those who killed his parents?

158
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,736
Give up on Doh Bae-man.

159
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,113
Let's take him out of our plan.

160
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,240
No.

161
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,951
No changes will be made
to my initial plan.

162
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,288
I must make him do it
because he can't help it.

163
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,206
Because he can't help it?

164
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,087
Minister.

165
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,258
The President hasn't approved it yet.
It's too early for that.

166
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,218
I give you my congratulations beforehand.

167
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,180
Isn't it weird?

168
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,600
It didn't feel that amusing
when I heard I was chosen internally,

169
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,270
but now it feels real
after being congratulated by you.

170
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,484
Are you running with the soldiers
at this early hour, again?

171
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,943
We're running right now.

172
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,363
Since you're a Division Commander now,
skip it for them from time to time.

173
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,950
You must think of your
subordinates following you too.

174
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,953
Let's talk more
when we drink later in the evening.

175
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,624
Sure.

176
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,884
…will be made.

177
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,553
Hyeoncheong City is going to support
the tourist complex,

178
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,141
and make the project go smoothly through
the cooperation of related departments.

179
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,393
If this project goes according to plan,

180
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,396
a rental-type skyscraper hotel
standing 172m tall

181
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,148
will be built in Hyeoncheong.

182
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,527
Next. The National Defense Committee
selected the report

183
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,614
on Lee Jae-sik's hearings, a candidate
for the Minister of National Defense.

184
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,201
Allegations of corruption in the military
provisions with IM Defense Industry,

185
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,495
is expected to be wrapped up
without any charges.

186
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,727
THE RAPE CASE AT CLUB CARTEL

187
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,815
I was really pissed off since Noh Tae-nam
ran away to the military.

188
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,610
So I'm really thankful that
you're taking over right away like this.

189
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,531
Noh Tae-nam tried to avoid a pile
of garbage, but ran into a pile of crap.

190
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,244
About Alan, the accomplice…

191
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,872
It looks like he learned about
Noh Tae-nam's enlistment on the news.

192
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,709
So it means Noh Tae-nam
and Alan have parted ways.

193
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,751
Right.

194
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,796
Gosh. That bastard Alan.

195
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,340
He said he was kidnapped
by a red-haired woman,

196
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,676
and yelled at us
to catch her, flipping out.

197
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,261
I got so sick of that.

198
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,431
Bae-man's desk is…

199
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,849
It's over there.

200
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,517
Would you like to take a look?

201
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,937
We feel so empty
whenever we see his desk too.

202
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,230
If I may…

203
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,232
Sure, of course.

204
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,027
-Then I'll go organize the files.
-Okay.

205
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,240
I'll keep it to myself that
you provided the video.

206
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,742
So you won't have any trouble.

207
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,952
Thank you, Detective Doh.

208
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,795
I just found out you two worked together
only after he got discharged.

209
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,173
It's a small world.

210
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,008
Yes.

211
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,801
His military experience got approved

212
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,596
and became a partner lawyer
in a big law firm.

213
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,141
Looks like Bae-man's hard days
are all over, so I'm happy,

214
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,935
but it seems like he isn't.

215
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,686
He seems worried about something.

216
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,524
And when I ask him the reason,
he says it's nothing.

217
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,654
Today's his first day at the law firm.

218
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,999
I'm Office Manager Park Da-young,
and I'll work for you

219
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,001
starting today, Lawyer Doh Bae-man.

220
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,127
Nice to meet you.

221
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,103
DOH BAE-MAN

222
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,691
DOH BAE-MAN

223
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,114
It's a special gift from our CEO.

224
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,950
A fortune-teller said that

225
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,703
you lack luck with money
based on your physiognomy.

226
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,746
I lack luck with money…

227
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,876
Nice to meet you, Toad.

228
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,754
It's a gift for maintaining dignity.

229
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,423
Maintaining dignity.

230
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,550
That is important.

231
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,353
Here.

232
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,149
Lawyer Doh.

233
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,026
Your first client is waiting.

234
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,902
Already?

235
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,196
That's quick.

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,782
It's my first day,
and I didn't even start working.

237
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,159
I'll bring him in.

238
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,368
Okay.

239
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,091
-He's the CEO of Kang's Solution--
-CEO Kang Ha-joon.

240
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,177
So you know him.

241
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,387
Okay, then.

242
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,646
I guess we never said hi properly.

243
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm Kang Ha-joon.

244
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,736
You can go now.

245
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,072
I don't want to be involved
in what you guys are doing.

246
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,077
Is that why you escaped
to this place right after your discharge?

247
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,080
If you're not here as a client,

248
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,290
we don't have nothing to talk about.

249
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,668
Get out.

250
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,091
Noh Hwa-young was an officer 20 years ago
at a supply transportation battalion.

251
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,844
That day, she drove a truck herself
and went out, which was not planned--

252
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,387
I said, get out.

253
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,806
Can't you hear me?

254
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,978
And there was an accident.

255
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,984
Later, she tried to join the flats
by fabricating the driving log,

256
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
but someone found out,

257
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,155
and Noh Hwa-young argued that
the cause of the accident was

258
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,698
control issues in the truck
due to poor maintenance.

259
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,117
But that was fabricated too.

260
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,579
The skid mark left at the scene
is proof that Noh Hwa-young

261
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,624
didn't step on the brake
until there was a collision.

262
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,001
There were tons of evidence
just overflowing,

263
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,962
but the military discarded all of it.

264
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,633
Those rotten military prosecutors

265
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,637
like you did, Doh Bae-man.

266
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,852
Why should I believe you?

267
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,146
Chief Yeom Sang-jin.

268
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,358
The military investigator
who revealed all those fabrications.

269
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,861
Go meet him and check.

270
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,161
The unresolved past can come back to you
in the present at any time.

271
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,372
I'm here to tell you this.

272
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,790
Lawyer

273
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,042
Doh Bae-man.

274
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,566
The unresolved past can come back to you
in the present at any time.

275
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,152
I'm here to tell you this.

276
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,636
If he's ready to accept the truth,
he will come to see you again.

277
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,222
That will be the beginning.

278
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,444
I need to hear the answer.

279
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,447
What is it that I cannot remember?

280
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,325
Let's go for a walk.

281
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,167
This is such a suffocating place.

282
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,503
No wonder everyone waits
for the day to leave.

283
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,215
Those guys are being discharged today.

284
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,428
Why are you involved in this?

285
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,098
Because it's all my fault.

286
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,893
It was my fault that your parents' case

287
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,521
was not properly resolved.

288
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,316
Please give me a clear answer.

289
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,945
Did Division Commander Noh Hwa-young

290
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,823
cause the accident on purpose?

291
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,034
Bae-man. The answer to that…

292
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,540
You told me the answer to that

293
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,334
twenty years ago.

294
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,433
Sir!

295
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,697
Bae-man.

296
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,616
Look at me.

297
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,748
I am a serviceman
who works with your mom and dad.

298
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,959
It's okay.

299
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,961
Don't be scared.

300
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,380
Bae-man.

301
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,883
This is an accident.

302
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,969
An accident that no one wanted.

303
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,181
So…

304
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,726
No?

305
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,063
What do you mean?

306
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,490
She was smiling.

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,369
That servicewoman was.

308
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,754
NOH HWA-YOUNG

309
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,219
The reason I was unable
to leave this place.

310
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,929
The beginning of everything,

311
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,473
was actually you, Bae-man.

312
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,684
It was because of what you,

313
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,645
the only survivor of the accident said.

314
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,805
MY AUNTIE

315
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,520
-Hello?
-Bae-man, where are you?

316
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,231
A drinking party for getting a job?

317
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,733
Yes, Auntie.

318
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,152
I see!

319
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,072
I bought a suit for you
at a department store today.

320
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,076
When I imagine you
defending your client in court,

321
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,120
wearing that suit,

322
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,415
it really makes me happy!

323
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,209
Call a chauffeur when you're done, okay?

324
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,642
Military Doh.

325
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,729
I heard you got discharged.

326
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,106
Congratulations.

327
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,025
Get lost.

328
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,444
I don't feel like playing with you today.

329
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,863
You bastard.

330
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,532
We have so many things between us,

331
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,576
so you can't just leave like this.

332
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,079
We should finish our conversation
at least, don't you think?

333
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,916
We couldn't continue
because of that scary servicewoman.

334
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,002
Get lost! Don't make me
lose my appetite for liquor.

335
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,296
Really?

336
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:11,092
Then how about we talk
about something funny?

337
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,974
Hey.

338
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,311
What's your relationship with Noh Tae-nam?

339
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,106
You were at Cartel

340
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,776
on the day he got caught.

341
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,322
Did you make Noh Tae-nam your "sponsor?"

342
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,032
By wagging

343
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:38,119
your tail like this?

344
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,551
You rude bastard.

345
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,183
Get up.

346
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:22,289
Would it sound too cruel
if I say that what I need is your scar?

347
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,041
Because that cannot be purchased
with money.

348
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,808
And I will get that opportunity for sure.

349
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,652
Thank you so much, Mr. Noh!
I will do my best!

350
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,656
I swear I will make
your conscription project a success.

351
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,910
It's a shame that I won't be
able to serve you, Division Commander.

352
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,991
How's your son's trial going?

353
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,494
Lawyer Yong Moon-goo is taking care of it.

354
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,871
Well, everyone in that trial
is working for you,

355
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,831
so you have nothing to worry about.

356
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,502
Back in time, if you summoned
military judges and prosecutors

357
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,796
and disciplined them,
it would've been over.

358
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:04,427
Is that lawyer going to be the CEO of IM?

359
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,428
Yes.

360
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,641
A trial is one thing,

361
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,477
but putting him
in charge of the company seems…

362
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,479
It's just for the formalities.

363
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,273
Here.

364
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,028
The past was great.

365
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,949
They took all the power because they hated
the country being ruled by a serviceperson

366
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,492
and it ended up like this.

367
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,702
Don't you think so, Hwa-young?

368
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,083
You're right.

369
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,379
But in order to innovate the military,
society must change too.

370
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,549
And in order to change society,
we must be in politics.

371
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,927
And I think that's why
you turned to politics, Minister.

372
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,682
Yes.

373
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,102
You practically read my mind.

374
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,022
That's why I've only kept you

375
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,567
by my side for a long time, Noh Hwa-young.

376
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,532
It would've been great

377
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,159
if you were a man.

378
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,870
Don't you think?

379
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,793
The food will get cold. Please go ahead.

380
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,635
-Drink up.
-Bottoms up.

381
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,932
Hey, have a glass.

382
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,310
Attention.

383
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,352
Hey.

384
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,187
Attention!

385
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,983
I have an offering to
give to Tae-nam today.

386
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,027
Wow.

387
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,446
-What is it?
-Gosh, you bastard.

388
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,324
You call this perfume an offering?

389
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,410
Tae-nam. Have you heard of GHB?

390
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,331
Liquid drug.

391
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,961
One drop of this, and it's a game over.

392
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,672
It reduces those tedious steps
before the actual game.

393
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,468
Well, girls who care about the steps
are tedious and boring.

394
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,219
We have to get to
the main game right away.

395
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,097
Get them totally drunk, cause a blackout,
and lose all memories!

396
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,683
Like propofol.

397
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,771
I have this girl named Se-na
in my fan club.

398
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,482
I'll bring her tomorrow.

399
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,445
Hey.

400
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,031
Hey, turn your phone off!

401
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,699
Gosh, it's noisy.

402
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,333
Hey, I hate the sound
of your ringtone, you bastard!

403
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,545
Hey.

404
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
Who are you?

405
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,257
Trainee 13!

406
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,802
Snap out of it!

407
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,389
Wake up!

408
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,811
You're not here for camping!

409
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,689
You're not here for fun!
Get the hell up, now!

410
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,288
Trainee 13.

411
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,707
Pick up the precious food
and put it back on your tray, now!

412
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,545
Do it report repeat, now!

413
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,467
So what? Hey, you were forced
to come here too!

414
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,469
How dare you give me orders!

415
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,848
All of you except for Trainee 13,
get down on your hands!

416
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,186
Seriously…

417
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,146
Get down, now!

418
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,483
When I say "one,"
you say "Fellow soldiers!"

419
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,109
and when I say "two," you say "Are one!"

420
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,194
One!

421
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,528
-Fellow soldiers!
-Fellow soldiers!

422
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,530
-Two!
-Are one!

423
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,615
Do it automatically!

424
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,408
-Fellow soldiers!
-Fellow soldiers!

425
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,910
-Are one!
-Are one!

426
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,246
Trainee 13 didn't do anything
wrong by flipping his tray!

427
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,750
It's your fault for meeting a fellow
trainee who complains about food!

428
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,793
Understood?

429
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,212
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

430
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,047
-Fellow soldiers!
-Fellow soldiers!

431
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,882
Fellow soldiers! Are one!

432
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,717
If you go alone, you can go faster,

433
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,261
but if you go together,
you can go farther!

434
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,387
Understood?

435
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,389
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

436
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,850
-Fellow soldiers!
-Fellow soldiers!

437
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,602
-Are one!
-Are one!

438
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,270
-Fellow soldiers!
-Fellow soldiers!

439
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,732
Trainee 8! Hold your gun right!

440
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,692
-Yes, sir!
-Trainee 13!

441
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,236
-Life your head!
-Get down there.

442
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,862
Let's keep going!

443
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,281
Your leg!

444
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,075
Yes, sir!

445
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,368
Two!

446
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,871
March in place!

447
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,164
March!

448
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,628
Get up!

449
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,507
-Go faster!
-Don't put your hands down!

450
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,359
What are you doing?

451
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,955
We're getting him trained
just as you ordered,

452
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,248
but is it okay to go on--

453
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,917
Train him by the book
and don't go easy on him.

454
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,253
Train him just like the other trainees.

455
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,046
Yes, Division Commander.

456
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,801
If there's anything worth noting,
report it to me right away.

457
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,886
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,680
The first trial
for the Rape Case at Club Cartel

459
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,267
is going to be held
at the General Military Court.

460
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,811
Mr. Noh Tae-nam was indicted
with a rape charge,

461
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,940
and as the defendant's attorney requested,
the trial will not be open to the public.

462
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,359
And Major General No,
the Division Commander

463
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,696
and Mr. Noh's mother, will be present
at the trial to observe it as well.

464
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,489
-Here she comes!
-Move.

465
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,574
There she is.

466
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,576
-Make way.
-Don't push.

467
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,381
Bang!

468
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,603
Do you have anything to say
to your son before the trial?

469
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,021
Please say something!

470
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,276
It's my first time going to
the military court without Prosecutor Doh.

471
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,653
This feels so empty.

472
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,989
But didn't you say
you're the next one to be discharged

473
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,824
after Prosecutor Doh's discharge?

474
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,203
Yes, I was, but things got complicated.

475
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,123
It's a sign from god that
I should wear this uniform a bit longer.

476
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,334
That's great.

477
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,920
I was worried that both of you,
who are heavily experienced,

478
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,799
would leave at the same time,
so I couldn't sleep.

479
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,177
Aren't you thankful for me?
So be nice to me while I'm still here.

480
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,972
Prosecutor.

481
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,854
You two go ahead first.

482
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,856
-I'll follow you soon.
-Sure.

483
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,825
You must be Military Prosecutor Cha.

484
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,329
I'm acquainted
with Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man,

485
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,039
so it's sad that he's not here.

486
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,083
It sounds like if Prosecutor Doh was here,

487
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,544
you would've been able to
control him as you like.

488
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,045
Don't say such a thing.

489
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,965
Prosecutor Doh is very hard to deal with.

490
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,594
Let's play fair today.

491
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,140
-Someone's life depends on this trial.
-I think so too.

492
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,767
I'll see you at the military court.

493
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,274
Here's a briefing about the cases
assigned to you.

494
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,735
The first case is about
an air force officer

495
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,194
assaulting a pregnant woman
who was passing by on the street

496
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,071
and got charged by a military
investigation bureau.

497
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,825
He assaulted a pregnant woman
he doesn't know, and she miscarried…

498
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,329
And that serviceperson is the youngest son
of Jinso Construction, right?

499
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,831
If you make him get acquitted,
you'll get additional incentives.

500
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,751
The second case is about
a son of an assemblyperson

501
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,419
taking narcotics on his military leave.

502
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,047
-The case occurred--
-Okay. That's it.

503
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,798
What?

504
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,468
You can stop now.
Because I don't need to hear anymore.

505
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,012
Where are you going?

506
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,806
You have to meet the other EPs
in ten minutes.

507
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,434
I'm going to the military.

508
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,518
What?

509
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,274
The fortune-teller got it right
that I have no luck with money.

510
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,152
Make lots of money
and die from that, Toad.

511
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,165
Lawyer Doh! Where are you going?

512
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,460
All rise!

513
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,006
Division Commander is coming!

514
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,148
All be seated!

515
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,737
Since everyone,
including the prosecution, is here,

516
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,616
-the General Military Court…
-They said it's not open to the public,

517
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,368
but the court
is filled with servicepeople.

518
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,246
This is a true "military" trial.

519
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,624
That's Division Commander
Noh Hwa-young alright.

520
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,837
On October 30, 2021,

521
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,755
-in a club in Gangnam…
-This will be fun.

522
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,133
What will be fun?

523
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,219
The fact that we're both here
as military prosecutors will be fun.

524
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,347
I joined the military because of money,

525
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,184
and you joined it
because of your personal vengeance.

526
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,479
We're the servicepeople who are
not supposed to wear the court robe.

527
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,564
Then why are you back?

528
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,901
The culprit of my parents' accident

529
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,737
was General Noh Hwa-young.

530
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,490
Just like you said.

531
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,162
I will get rid of those who were involved

532
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,081
with my parents' case, even for a bit,

533
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,127
and those who try to stop me.

534
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,303
WITNESS

535
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,431
THE FIRST TRIAL

536
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,641
Ms. Han Se-na.

537
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,561
Can you please tell us about
what happened on the day of the incident?

538
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,610
I went into the club called
Cartel with Alan,

539
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,488
and I was ushered to a private room.

540
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,450
I went there because he said
we're going to have coffee.

541
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,994
Who else was there

542
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,496
besides Alan?

543
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,673
Noh Tae-nam, who's sitting right there,
and a big dog were there.

544
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:36,011
They kept offering alcohol to me,
but I refused.

545
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,138
Because I felt so uncomfortable.

546
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,808
Just have one glass, Se-na.

547
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,976
One glass.

548
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,644
But I drank just one glass

549
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,356
because I felt like
I was ruining the mood.

550
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,777
Did you lose consciousness
after drinking that alcohol?

551
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,280
Yes.

552
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,366
I drank only one glass, but I felt weird.

553
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,245
Your Honor. I hereby submit the record
of GHB, or so-called liquid drugs,

554
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,955
which was found in Ms. Han's urine,

555
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,208
as evidence of use of narcotics
for the purpose of date rape.

556
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,587
TESTED POSITIVE FOR GHB

557
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,425
-I resisted, but Noh Tae-nam beat me up.
-Hey.

558
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,844
Your idol star's concert
is just around the corner.

559
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,763
He broke a liquor bottle and…

560
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,266
How can you call yourself Alan's fan?
You crazy wench!

561
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,018
And he…

562
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,605
So you felt that your life was at risk,
so you could neither fight back

563
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,190
nor try to run away
because you were drugged.

564
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,693
That's right.

565
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,778
In this court, where the gunfires
of the law can be heard,

566
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,198
they're the only people
who can feel emotions,

567
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,118
but they wouldn't dare to show that
in front of Noh Hwa-young.

568
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:46,040
Because they're the audience brought
in for Noh Tae-nam's trial show.

569
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,168
A savage military trial,
which does not even have

570
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,755
a screen to cover a rape victim,
which is a basic need.

571
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,599
This is the broken liquor bottle
found at the crime scene.

572
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,393
The fingerprints of Alan
and Noh Tae-nam were found.

573
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,065
I submit the doctor's written diagnoses
on the rape of the witness

574
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,944
and a video file of the rape
that was illegally recorded, Your Honor.

575
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,410
You weren't nervous, and you did well.

576
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,663
I give you a "pass."

577
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,666
But this trial won't be easy.

578
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,418
Why?

579
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,629
You'll see.

580
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,509
Defense attorney, would you like
to conduct a cross-examination?

581
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,802
Yes, Your Honor.

582
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,103
First, I give you my deepest
sympathy for suffering

583
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,896
such a horrendous incident.

584
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,112
I mean it.

585
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,836
How did you get to know Alan the singer?

586
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,636
I was in his fan club,
and I got close to him.

587
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,514
So you have developed
a personal relationship

588
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,350
with a singer you liked,
close enough to see him outside.

589
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,730
So it must've been like a dream for you.

590
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,651
The defense attorney is using the fact
that the witness is acquainted with Alan

591
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,446
as a tool to turn what's clearly a rape
into consensual sex.

592
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,739
Don't be so quick to judge.

593
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,991
That's not true at all.

594
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,080
I, too, agree with you,
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

595
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,333
Which means, I think
Ms. Han Se-na was raped.

596
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,172
Is that good enough?

597
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,883
So whether it was consensual sex
or rape by force,

598
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,552
wouldn't be the point
in this trial, would it?

599
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,637
That's right, Your Honor.

600
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,222
Defense attorney, you may continue.

601
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,643
According to the evidence
submitted by the military prosecution,

602
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,521
Ms. Han testified that
she drank narcotics used for date rape.

603
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,984
When this drug is consumed with alcohol,
it causes headaches, altered vision,

604
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,445
and severe memory loss.

605
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,780
I repeat.

606
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,534
It causes serious problems
in vision and memory.

607
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,289
Let me ask you.

608
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:36,210
Was the one who threatened you
by breaking a bottle the defendant?

609
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,963
It was.

610
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,425
And Alan's fingerprints were
also found from the bottle.

611
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,094
But you were drugged,
so you could neither recognize

612
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,597
nor remember people at that time.

613
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,600
Can you be sure, witness?

614
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,145
Objection, Your Honor.

615
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,482
I think this is an important point.
Defense attorney, you may continue.

616
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,235
The drug you drank
caused a problem in your memory.

617
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,655
Which means all of your memories
are just assumptions.

618
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,573
Assumptions, not facts!

619
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:26,927
It means your testimony cannot guarantee
its credibility or consistency.

620
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,096
I rest my case, Your Honor.

621
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,183
The examination on the witness
requested by the defense

622
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,102
will take place tomorrow, at this hour.

623
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,837
Who spiked the liquor?

624
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,923
Alan did. That's his method.

625
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,093
I see.

626
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,679
Consistency is
the most important thing in trials.

627
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,724
A lie becomes the truth
if it's consistent,

628
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:18,020
and the truth becomes a lie
if it's inconsistent.

629
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,980
And you, Lawyer Yong Moon-goo,

630
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,232
makes that for me, right?

631
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,820
By the way, I saw Doh Bae-man earlier.
What happened?

632
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,405
That bastard got discharged.

633
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,163
We need to talk.

634
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,333
You're back?

635
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,752
Yes, as you can see.

636
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,089
You made a big decision
when I didn't know.

637
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,425
What's the reason?

638
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,344
You'll find out eventually.

639
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,680
Some jerks do well for one day
and leave a big impression,

640
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,515
and some jerks do badly for one day

641
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,394
and get thrown out,
though he did well for 364 days.

642
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,938
Well, a human heart
is a sly thing, that's for sure.

643
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,442
I am sorry.

644
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,699
Well, the camaraderie
we have been building

645
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,743
will not collapse overnight.

646
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,371
Since you're wearing
a military uniform again,

647
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,790
our contract can be renewed too.

648
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,381
Renewal of the contract
depends on you, Lawyer Yong.

649
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,049
And I only follow you.

650
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,386
You breathed some outside air,
and you're even more disciplined.

651
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,806
I like that.

652
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,976
You're going to block
the critical hit with that, right?

653
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,853
Yes.

654
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,898
-I will summon Alan as a witness.
-Not Alan.

655
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,442
Mr. Noh's weak point.

656
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,364
Yes,

657
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,700
my prediction was right.

658
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,536
Did you know?

659
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,829
How--

660
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,165
How did you find out?

661
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,293
I'm asking how did you find out?

662
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,130
I found out while working on
his conscription project.

663
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,717
And I also realized that
this trial is a trial

664
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,301
in which you will never lose.

665
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,429
Doh Bae-man.

666
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,267
You really are someone
I would not like as an enemy.

667
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,196
Seriously!

668
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,198
Prosecutor Doh!

669
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,160
You're going to come back so soon,

670
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,787
so why did you leave like
a lover who has turned cold?

671
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,124
On the day you packed, I was…

672
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,751
I was crying so much.

673
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,836
Did you, Yoon Sang-ki?

674
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,920
Here.

675
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,965
Hey, by the way,
why does this place seem so unfamiliar?

676
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,633
Was the outside that nice?

677
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,886
You're back for real, right,
Prosecutor Doh?

678
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,972
-Yes.
-Then are the two of us…

679
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,432
Prosecutor Cha!

680
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,477
Are the four of us going to
work together forever?

681
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,353
I must get going now.

682
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,902
Hey, what do you think her MBTI is?

683
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,407
Subsection Chief Ahn, you were too hasty.

684
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,285
-Come on!
-What the…

685
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,959
The military court has been in my hands
for the past five years,

686
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,588
but it seemed like
a different court today.

687
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,217
You said earlier that I'll see.

688
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,718
What will I see?

689
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,888
It's about Noh Tae-nam.
Don't put your everything into this trial.

690
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,015
What does that mean?

691
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,767
I'm saying, don't try too hard.

692
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,936
You're bound to lose, anyway.

693
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,987
General,

694
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,865
I'd like to ask you not to come
to the military court tomorrow.

695
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,368
Why? Did you lose confidence?

696
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,579
I never even imagined that
I'm going to lose this trial.

697
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,667
I was the one who had Mr. Noh enlist
in order to protect him.

698
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,129
That sounds like there's a reason

699
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,090
I shouldn't be at the military court.

700
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,887
Sometimes, even a son has some things
he doesn't want to show his mother.

701
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,933
Something that he doesn't want to show me…

702
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,937
I summon Alan as the witness.

703
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,730
WITNESS

704
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,692
THE SECOND TRIAL

705
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,451
My mother is late.

706
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,330
-General No isn't coming today.
-What?

707
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,541
She's not coming to her son's trial?

708
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,585
Call her and tell her to come, right now!

709
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,420
I told her not to come.

710
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,922
Why? Just why?

711
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,382
The verdict will be out today.

712
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,385
She has to sit here until then,
glaring at that military judge!

713
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,888
Defendant, order in the court.

714
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,598
Defense attorney,
you may examine the witness.

715
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,433
Let go.

716
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,735
Witness, you have a trial
coming up soon, don't you?

717
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,362
What you're going to say from now on

718
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,781
will be used as a reference
for your trial, too.

719
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,825
Yes.

720
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,622
That broken liquor bottle

721
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,291
is evidence collected
by the police at Cartel.

722
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,628
According to the military prosecutor,
it was a weapon used

723
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,797
by the defendant, Noh Tae-nam,
to threaten Ms. Han Se-na.

724
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,217
Let me ask you a question.

725
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,680
Did the defendant, Noh Tae-nam,
threaten Ms. Han with that broken bottle?

726
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,023
You take all the blame for this case.

727
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,442
What are you saying?

728
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,987
Why should I get blamed for everything?
Noh Tae-nam enjoyed it too!

729
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,489
Let's be honest.

730
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,950
To be frank,

731
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,912
you were the only one who enjoyed it.

732
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,706
You know,

733
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:16,127
I know even more about Noh Tae-nam
than he does about himself.

734
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,591
If you refuse my offer, you'll spend
the rest of your life in trials,

735
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,344
and your golden days will be wasted away.

736
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,598
This one's weak compared
to what you've been doing all this time.

737
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,688
-Are you blackmailing me?
-Yes, I am blackmailing you.

738
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,401
Because I can do everything
for Noh Tae-nam.

739
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,028
That bottle…

740
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,157
-I was the one who broke it.
-Objection.

741
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,326
The witness is saying something
that's completely contradictory

742
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,286
to what he said to the police.

743
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,999
That will be taken care of
at the civilian court.

744
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,543
Defense attorney, you may continue.

745
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:03,216
You just said that
you broke the liquor bottle.

746
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,970
Was it to threaten Ms. Han?

747
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,182
I make threats, but…

748
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,569
I didn't threaten Han Se-na.

749
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,531
I threatened Noh Tae-nam
to record a video.

750
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,455
So he was blamed
just because he's a serviceperson!

751
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,623
What if he schemed it with the victim?

752
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,334
It was his fault!

753
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,380
-Your Honor!
-Prosecution, this is a warning.

754
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,883
Please stop interrupting
the trial anymore.

755
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,969
Defense attorney, you may continue.

756
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,598
So, the defendant, Noh Tae-nam,

757
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,017
recorded the video
because you threatened him?

758
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,810
Yes.

759
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,314
What you just said
may be used against you at your trial.

760
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,357
Would that be okay?

761
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,946
Yes. It's all true.

762
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,992
They did scheme it.

763
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,036
That bastard.

764
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,664
Noh Tae-nam, the defendant,

765
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,167
only recorded the scene
because he was forced to.

766
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,418
This means

767
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,672
the defendant, Noh Tae-nam,
did not participate in rape.

768
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,591
That's just wild speculation, Your Honor.

769
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,428
Defense attorney,
do you have grounds for your claim?

770
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,805
Of course, I do.

771
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,975
I submit the defendant's
medical record as evidence.

772
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,984
Male erectile disorder.

773
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,736
Also called, erectile dysfunction.

774
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:53,827
It's a type of male sexual dysfunction,
in which his penis cannot become erect.

775
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,204
It was impossible for the defendant

776
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,332
to have sexual intercourse
with Ms. Han from the start.

777
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,965
-Hey, it's okay.
-Dude, it's fine.

778
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,469
-Wow, this is crazy.
-It's okay.

779
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,346
In conclusion,

780
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:17,100
the defendant is unable to have
sexual intercourse with the victim at all,

781
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,185
and he was forced to record the video.

782
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,568
Yong Moon-goo,
how could you do this to me?

783
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,945
Defendant.

784
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,197
Is what your attorney said true?

785
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,742
Is it true that
you have erectile dysfunction?

786
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,246
Hey, how dare you ask me that?

787
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,457
Do you think this is funny?

788
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,875
Defendant, please be seated.

789
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,338
Did you bring me here
so you can reveal that I'm a loser

790
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,425
who can't even do anything with a girl
and humiliate me in front of these jerks?

791
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,386
Defendant, be seated. This is a warning.

792
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,597
Shut up, you military judge bastard!

793
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,724
Make him leave the court, now.

794
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,100
Let go!

795
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,370
FORMER CEO NOH
OF IM DEFENSE INDUSTRY ACQUITTED

796
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:31,591
Thanks to this coincidental case,
you gained a lot of things.

797
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,178
Mr. Noh's enlistment,
which you wanted too badly,

798
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,972
and the world's interest in you…

799
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,642
But…

800
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,852
What I gained from this trial is…

801
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,064
You must be talking about the position

802
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,734
as the CEO of IM, which I promised.

803
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,240
You don't hide what's on your mind.

804
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,408
My mind never changed.

805
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:01,287
I swear I'll remain loyal to you, General.

806
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,877
Lots of reporters are in front
of the Division headquarters.

807
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,254
Shall we just go past them?

808
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,090
No, stop in front of them.

809
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,175
Yes, ma'am.

810
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,482
If you get revenge
with a passionate heart,

811
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,192
you can't figure out your foe correctly.

812
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,239
You judged that
Noh Tae-nam participated in rape.

813
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:40,535
Are you comforting me or ridiculing me?

814
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:44,289
So you couldn't even see
the obvious evidence.

815
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,832
Are you here to just say that--

816
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,544
I'm not back just to put
that measly Noh Tae-nam in prison.

817
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,881
Cha Woo-in, listen to me.

818
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,135
From now on, I'll be your hound dog.

819
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:01,472
A Doberman,
which does not let go once it bites,

820
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,683
whether the flesh
of the bitten one gets ripped off,

821
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,476
or whether its teeth fall out.

822
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,651
But if you act up and get in my way,

823
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,112
I'm going to put you in prison first.

824
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,121
Because I will be the one
to punish Noh Hwa-young.

825
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,625
That's what I've been wanting.

826
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,335
Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

827
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,200
NOH HWA-YOUNG

828
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,833
Yes, General.

829
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,337
Tae-nam ran away.

830
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,007
Damn it.

831
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:46,077
You pulled me into a messy,
tangled spiderweb, Cha Woo-in.

832
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,331
-Use Doh Bae-man.
-The boot camp was in a frenzy overnight.

833
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,625
Where is Doh Bae-man?
I'm sure he has other intentions.

834
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,794
So is this case
the start of the contract renewal?

835
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,672
Never let Mr. Noh get out. Never!

836
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:01,175
I'll return him, so no one
would know that he left the base.

837
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,803
Trainee 13! One, two!

838
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,807
There's only one way to catch a spider.

839
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,143
You have to pull the whole spider web.

840
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:18,067
