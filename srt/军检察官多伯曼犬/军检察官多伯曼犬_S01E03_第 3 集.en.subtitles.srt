1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,737
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,904
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,072
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,411
We face dozens of forks in the road
for judgments each day,

5
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,789
and a choice made
in a short moment changes fate.

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,418
A choice is fate.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,550
What is the fate
that's waiting for me now?

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,147
Shall I accept that fate, or reject it?

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,402
That's also a choice.

10
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,204
A FEW DAYS AGO

11
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,921
You…

12
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,091
-Do you wear this thing out?
-I wear it from time to time.

13
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,261
Did you wear it recently too?

14
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,348
What are you so curious about?

15
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,850
I just wear it because it's not like me.

16
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,852
Because I can become someone else.

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,021
Someone else?

18
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,065
It's a way to change things up
when I'm sick and tired of my uniform.

19
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,610
But is just owning a wig a violation

20
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,737
of the military officer dress code?

21
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,614
No.

22
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,116
Keep driving.

23
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,373
Military Prosecutor Doh.

24
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,582
Yes?

25
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,835
What is it?

26
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,921
The new division commander's car
is in front of us.

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,133
Right.

28
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,395
General Noh opened the doors
to the division commander position,

29
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,314
which had been tightly shut
to servicewomen until now.

30
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,526
There have been a few female
two-star generals,

31
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,362
but it has created quite a buzz
since this is the first time

32
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,740
a female division commander
was appointed to a key infantry division.

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,785
-Mother, I can explain everything.
-General Noh said…

34
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,328
Shut up.

35
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,832
The story I heard
from Lawyer Yong Moon-goo is enough.

36
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,126
Because what you will say
is just an excuse.

37
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,886
Are you going to make that face
in front of everyone?

38
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,888
Don't you know what kind of day today is?

39
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,056
I will correct it.

40
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,643
You must never forget that
you're Noh Hwa-young's son.

41
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:12,150
Let's talk about this trouble you caused
in my office after the inauguration.

42
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,241
Yes, Mother.

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,286
-Salute.
-Salute.

44
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,337
She's here.

45
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,967
How does it feel to be the first one
to break the army's glass ceiling?

46
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,136
It is hard for a servicewoman
to get a star.

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,556
It's one female general
for 100 male generals.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,310
So it's more like a bulletproof ceiling,
than a glass ceiling.

49
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,398
Do you have anything to say
to the other servicewomen?

50
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,360
Rather than trying to defeat
servicemen and compete…

51
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,987
I can't believe they're all here
for her inauguration.

52
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,156
It really is a hot issue.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,449
They must acknowledge that

54
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,244
they're not servicewomen,
but just one of the many servicepeople.

55
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,121
I'll be leaving soon,
so serve her well, Prosecutor Cha.

56
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,540
She's someone you can serve
as a role model.

57
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,961
The first female general
cannot be my goal.

58
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,297
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young
did that, so you want to go higher.

59
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,924
That's what you mean?

60
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,594
Present arms!

61
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,554
-Salute!
-Salute!

62
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,766
Salute!

63
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,979
FAREWELL AND INAUGURATION CEREMONY
FOR THE 34TH AND 35TH DIVISION COMMANDERS

64
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,689
Order arms!

65
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:38,069
I am infinitely honored to command
the fourth infantry division

66
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,862
starting today.

67
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,616
I will not lose my pride
in protecting the survival

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,118
and prosperity of this country,

69
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,954
and be perfectly equipped in
operation readiness

70
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,874
and deal with any kind of emergency.

71
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,627
Peace cannot be predicted
by a single individual…

72
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,171
Do you have the courage
to investigate those with stars

73
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,173
like General Noh as a military prosecutor?

74
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,343
Investigations are done with facts,
not courage.

75
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,513
If they are guilty, then I must.

76
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,224
How amazing.

77
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,602
The only position that can make
criminals in military uniforms

78
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,479
stand trial is a military prosecutor.

79
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,690
That's not going to be easy.

80
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,443
Servicepeople have ranks.

81
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,528
I'll protect my subordinates' safety…

82
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,864
There's no rank higher than the law.

83
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,075
I'll make this division a battlefront
where people are at its heart,

84
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,578
and contribute to the army of this nation.

85
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,664
Present arms!

86
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,708
-Salute!
-Salute!

87
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,295
Salute!

88
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,802
THE BATTLEFRONT ARMY BASE
FULL OF SPIRIT

89
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,250
Mother, where are we going?

90
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,629
That child you beat up has become blind.

91
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,757
So I will make sure that
you never do such a thing again.

92
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,467
I'm sorry, Mother.

93
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,895
Get out.

94
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
Mother.

95
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,707
I'm scared. This is…

96
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,668
Get down there.

97
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,380
Get down there!

98
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,812
Mother, is this real?

99
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,067
Do you know what the most
important thing in a grenade is?

100
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,194
Gunpowder.

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,531
Fifty grams of gunpowder shatters
the cartridge covering the grenade

102
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,200
and its shards scatter
all around the place.

103
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,912
But there's something
more important than gunpowder.

104
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,124
It's this safety pin.

105
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,627
It turns into a battle weapon
only when this is removed.

106
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,755
Mother, what are you doing?

107
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,090
Hold it tight.

108
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,509
It'll explode the moment
your hands loosen up.

109
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,095
Mother, please don't do this!

110
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,683
I will reach a place

111
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,811
women in military uniforms
cannot even dream of going.

112
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,397
I will make sure
that there's no man above me.

113
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,942
In order to do so, you must
become the perfect human being.

114
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,945
You must never be a flaw
in this path I'm taking.

115
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,497
Answer me!

116
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,332
Are you going to disobey me again?

117
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,543
-No, I will never do that again, Mother.
-Did you learn your lesson?

118
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,379
Yes, I did. Please believe me.

119
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,137
No.

120
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,224
A lesson learned without pain
is meaningless.

121
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,768
In order to make it a real lesson,

122
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,103
it must be accompanied
by an unforgettable memory.

123
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,816
You have one hour.

124
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,487
The moment your hands loosen up, it will
explode in four seconds. Remember that.

125
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,365
No, please!

126
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,283
Mom!

127
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,576
Mom…

128
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,537
Mom!

129
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,913
Mom…

130
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,446
Never forget what happened today.

131
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,785
Always keep in mind

132
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,371
that I'm your safety pin.

133
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,774
Mother, I talked to Se-na about the video
so she would understand.

134
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,526
It won't be a problem.

135
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,570
Lawyer Yong Moon-goo
will take care of that.

136
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,614
You stay out of this now.

137
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,830
By the way, you…

138
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,125
What favor did you ask to
a military prosecutor?

139
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,171
Did Lawyer Yong report that
to you as well?

140
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,633
You dared to ask a military prosecutor
to help you evade your military service?

141
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,765
I asked a military prosecutor
so nothing will go wrong.

142
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,643
So there will not be a single flaw
that can be in your way.

143
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,394
Who's that military prosecutor?

144
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,272
I can never tell you that.

145
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,567
Do you think I can't find out
who that military prosecutor is?

146
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,403
Mother, I really don't want to do
military service…

147
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,577
I will never come
to this place, where you're at.

148
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,912
Never.

149
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,300
Why did you report to her
the favor I asked Doh Bae-man?

150
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,388
You knew how my mother would react.

151
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,892
Are you doing that on purpose
to see me go crazy?

152
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,770
Come here right now.

153
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,063
Now!

154
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,367
Oh, my. Congratulations.

155
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,744
Wow, General Noh, you're now in a position

156
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,872
that suits you perfectly.

157
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,874
Please have a seat.

158
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,460
Division Commander!

159
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,755
Congratulations on being inaugurated!

160
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,006
Salute!

161
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,760
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

162
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,178
Welcome.

163
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,937
So this is how the office
of a female division commander looks.

164
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,480
Congrats, Noh Hwa-young.

165
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,319
I was just kidding.

166
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,738
Division Commander, salute!

167
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,786
The first female division commander
since the military was established.

168
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,663
You truly are amazing.

169
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:32,334
Please disregard all unnecessary gibberish

170
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,754
and only think of the safety
of the nation.

171
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,133
The divisions must stand upright
in order for the military to--

172
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,593
This is just the beginning.

173
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,637
I'll solve all things
you've been putting effort into,

174
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,764
one by one, starting now.

175
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,019
They say it took 40 years
to get new canteens for the military.

176
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,270
Times have changed,

177
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,565
so I'm going to build a new military,

178
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,151
starting with this 4th Division.

179
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,369
I couldn't help it from my position.

180
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,537
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,623
What?

182
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,082
Your position?

183
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,712
I really want to rip your mouth
both horizontally and vertically.

184
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:20,132
I got stomped on
with military boots because of you!

185
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,053
I must report everything
that happens to you to General Noh.

186
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,056
That's the rule set by General Noh.

187
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,894
General Noh this, General Noh that.

188
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,564
So stop working for me
and go work for my mother, okay?

189
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,400
And don't be a damn tattletale
in the middle.

190
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,367
Lawyer Yong Moon-goo, you lack nothing.

191
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,620
Sometimes I think about it,
but it makes no sense.

192
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,165
You're damn old, but you have no family,
and you only stick to my mom…

193
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,923
By any chance, do you like my mom?

194
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,804
Get out. I can't stand the sight of you.

195
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,100
How did your visit to the hospital go?

196
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,560
What about the video?

197
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,479
That wench Se-na doesn't have it.

198
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,897
Alan has it.

199
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,028
Then I'll check it myself.

200
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,702
You.

201
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,746
Did you know that Doh Bae-man
has a servicewoman bodyguard?

202
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,831
A servicewoman?

203
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,834
Are you saying you guys got
your butts kicked by a woman?

204
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,752
Did she shoot you?

205
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,964
If I was shot, then it wouldn't
be this resentful!

206
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,216
My boys all got whipped

207
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,761
by that servicewoman with a single wiper!

208
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,266
Now listen.

209
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,310
From now on, I'll do it on my own.

210
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,771
Whether I slice him
or run him over with a car,

211
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,732
you stay out of this.

212
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,775
Perfect timing.

213
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,737
That jerk will be discharged
in a few days.

214
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,282
Once he's discharged, he's neither
a prosecutor nor a serviceman.

215
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,617
What does that mean?

216
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,077
So does that mean

217
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,497
he won't have any more public authority?

218
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,125
He'll be just a lawyer.

219
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,087
Then the story changes.

220
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,093
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

221
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,512
Please check if these two
are from the same wig.

222
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,722
Okay.

223
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,265
When will the result be out?

224
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,517
Even if they were produced
at the same factory,

225
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,395
the results may differ depending
on how much it has been used.

226
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,981
It'll take a while to
review them thoroughly.

227
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,733
Okay, I see.

228
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,160
Does this mean Military Prosecutor Cha
is involved with Alan's disappearance?

229
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,789
I'm the one who's saying it,
but it sounds so ridiculous.

230
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,500
If the wig that was in Cha Woo-in's car

231
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,378
and the wig found at Alan's scene
are the same, then she is.

232
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,214
You're going to be
discharged in a few days,

233
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,759
so why are you obsessed with
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in?

234
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,805
It's because I want to get discharged
properly in a few days, Sang-ki.

235
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,017
If I find Alan and give him
to Noh Tae-nam,

236
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,186
then I'll impress him for sure.

237
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,731
And if I get him exempt from
his military service too, then…

238
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,733
Then?

239
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,778
I won't be a petty partner lawyer
for Law and One.

240
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,406
I will take over Yong Moon-goo's position.

241
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,617
It's coming.

242
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,374
Then what should I do?

243
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,751
If Cha Woo-in is that Red Wig Girl,

244
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,006
I'm sure she used a van for at least
nine people to take Alan's gang away.

245
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,549
Find that car.

246
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,510
Find out whom it belongs to,
and where it went.

247
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,262
Yes, sir.

248
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,347
Then what about you?

249
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,476
I'll be after Cha Woo-in's true identity.

250
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,522
If Cha Woo-in really has something
to do with Alan's disappearance,

251
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,858
and if she is, what the reason is.

252
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,266
Yes, that looks good.

253
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,477
And I'd like to
try the jacket on with it too.

254
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,729
-With the one you saw earlier?
-Yes.

255
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,403
What the heck?

256
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,510
The dress is fine,

257
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,346
but the length of the jacket
seems a bit awkward.

258
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,306
Can I check out something else?

259
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,438
What are you doing?

260
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,898
Because I like this purse.

261
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,289
-I'll buy this one.
-This is…

262
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,083
-Let me buy this, please.
-What's wrong with you?

263
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,419
What do you think you're doing?

264
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,630
-I'll pay.
-That'll be 7.8 million won.

265
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,966
-What?
-It's 7.8 million won.

266
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,428
A 12-month installment plan, please.

267
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,518
Here, it's a discharge gift.

268
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,733
Are there still shops that forge
and sell things like this?

269
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,529
Where is it at?
I'm going to go raid that place.

270
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,323
Sadly, this is genuine.

271
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,284
Jeez, my precious money…

272
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,744
This isn't fake?

273
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,371
It's genuine?

274
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,127
Wow, you're fast.

275
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh, my.

276
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,381
Bae-man.

277
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,593
Bae-man!

278
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,306
Purses are so lucky.

279
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,266
Women love them so much.

280
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,977
Oh, my.

281
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,731
You served a full term as an officer
and are getting discharged,

282
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,692
and now you're really being good to me.

283
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,780
Gosh, I don't have to suffer anymore.

284
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,996
Bae-man.

285
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,916
When you get discharged,

286
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,043
you're going to get me new purses
every season, right?

287
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,462
-Here.
-It depends on how you do.

288
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,009
And rice. Right.

289
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,387
A military prosecutor came
to our station for a case.

290
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,390
-A military prosecutor?
-Yes.

291
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,394
I really wanted to ask her
if she knows Military Prosecutor Doh.

292
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,231
Jeez, but there are tons
of military prosecutors out there.

293
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,066
I'm not interested.

294
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,777
I'm not even going to pee
toward the base now.

295
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,612
Is that so, civilian?

296
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,530
-Rice.
-Right.

297
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,075
MILITARY OFFICER PERSONNEL RECORD
CHA WOO-IN

298
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,789
After quitting Stanford Law School
in the U.S.,

299
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,333
she has no record for three years?

300
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,963
I'm sure the answer lies

301
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,966
in this three-year gap.

302
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,724
Hello?

303
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,685
Is this Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man?

304
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,478
Who is this?

305
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,856
I called you because
of the military service project.

306
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,695
Where are you at right now?

307
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,667
You're a doctor at MMA who does
conscription physical exams?

308
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,960
That's right.

309
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,297
But our VIP is so healthy.

310
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,506
Will it be possible?

311
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,468
Conscription is like a fish net,
in which only the big fish can get out.

312
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,137
That's just like the court.

313
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,265
A weird fish net that only
catches small fish.

314
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,350
Just write up the diagnosis properly.

315
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,645
I'll take care of it, so he gets
the conscription exam result you want.

316
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,816
-I'll pay you handsomely for the fish net.
-I don't need money.

317
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,151
I want something else.

318
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,404
What do you want? Tell me.

319
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,449
My colleague from medical school
caused a medical accident.

320
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,785
He's now indicted by 4th Division,
where you're at now.

321
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,704
The division I'm at?

322
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,834
When a military prosecutor decides
to turn someone into a criminal,

323
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,545
he or she can search and seize
dozens of places,

324
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,715
and make that person guilty
even by changing the indictment.

325
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,176
Of course, it's also possible
the other way around.

326
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,762
So if you lose the case on purpose,

327
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,847
my friend can be found innocent, right?

328
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,515
Like nothing happened?

329
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,485
Is your friendship deep enough
to make you dare

330
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,361
to attempt making a deal
with a military prosecutor?

331
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,738
That's amazing.

332
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,240
Friendship? No way.

333
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,367
My service is almost finished.

334
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,412
If I want to get a job at the hospital
where that jerk's father is a director at,

335
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,539
I should show
at least this much sincerity.

336
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,957
So it's for a job?

337
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,503
I'll wait and see the trial result
and take care of the conscription.

338
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,629
Farewell.

339
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,963
Hey.

340
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,758
Are you sure that your friend
caused a medical accident?

341
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,135
Yes.

342
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,637
How are you so sure?

343
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:13,058
He's someone who should not become
a doctor from the get-go.

344
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,644
THE MEDICAL ACCIDENT CASE OF
PRIVATE FIRST CLASS HWANG CHUL-SEUNG

345
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,439
Now, the briefing on the medical accident
of Private First Class Hwang Chul-seung.

346
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,361
Private First Class Hwang
is naturally healthy,

347
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,739
but while he was playing soccer,
he suddenly experienced paralysis,

348
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,242
and was immediately taken to
a military hospital.

349
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,494
The diagnosis was quadriplegia.

350
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,413
-What was the cause?
-A day before he collapsed,

351
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,083
he went to the military hospital
for minor herniated disc,

352
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,794
and the treatment he got
at the time seems to be the cause.

353
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,420
Quadriplegia…

354
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,633
The indicted medical officer is
strongly denying his charges.

355
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,806
Let's get started with the investigation.
Let's hear from the suspect first.

356
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,475
What? Are you going to take it?

357
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,062
I thought Military Prosecutor Cha
was working on it.

358
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,440
I'd like to handle it since this is
my first case after being appointed.

359
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,777
It's the last case during
my service as well. I'll wrap it up.

360
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,990
What is it?

361
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,534
-You have a problem with that?
-Understood, sir.

362
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,036
Then I'll be by your side
taking over duties.

363
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,166
Where's Private First Class Hwang now?

364
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,668
He said he couldn't trust
the military hospital,

365
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,753
so he's hospitalized
at a civilian hospital.

366
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,423
JUNGMOON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

367
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,563
Mom.

368
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,524
I'm sorry.

369
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,529
Mom.

370
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,866
Don't cry.

371
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,492
I won't cry.

372
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,873
I will recover and get up.

373
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,418
Don't worry.

374
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,558
I'm Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in

375
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,977
from the military law office
of the fourth division.

376
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,981
Military Prosecutor, please help my son.

377
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,905
Can you make a statement?

378
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,242
Yes.

379
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,590
There was a fight
between Medical Officer Jung

380
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,467
and a nursing officer.

381
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,178
Medical Officer Jung, did you drink?

382
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,055
What are you talking about?

383
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,099
I'm not drunk!

384
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,061
Wait, you did drink.
Then you shouldn't see patients.

385
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,522
Jeez, how dare you nag at me?

386
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,984
I can do it without you, so get out!

387
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,028
-Hey.
-Private First Class Hwang Chul-seung.

388
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,155
-Pull your sleeve up.
-Yes, sir.

389
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,620
MEDICAL OFFICER
ALCOHOL

390
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,290
A medical officer treated a patient
while he was drunk?

391
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,667
Yes.

392
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,003
We need the statement
from that nursing officer.

393
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,261
We'll come see you again.

394
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,485
It was true that
I wasn't in the room at that time,

395
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,322
but we didn't fight because he was drunk.

396
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,324
But Private First Class Hwang's
statement is different.

397
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,200
He said he definitely smelled liquor.

398
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,704
That… I think he must've been mistaken.

399
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,708
He might've mistaken the smell of alcohol
at the hospital as the smell of liquor.

400
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,834
Yes, that's right.

401
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,087
If you didn't fight with him,
then why did you leave the room?

402
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,466
I'm sure she went to help out
in another room that was short-handed.

403
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,509
-Right?
-Yes.

404
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,597
Hey, military hospitals are always
short on equipment and manpower.

405
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,016
Though it's full of sick soldiers.

406
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,812
The charge gets more serious if you
obstruct the investigation with perjury.

407
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,897
You're aware of that, right?

408
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,483
Medical Officer Jung didn't
do anything wrong.

409
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,485
He treated the patient without any issues.

410
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,835
Did you

411
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,421
answer them correctly?

412
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,591
I did just as you told me to.

413
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,302
Yes, well done.

414
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,392
You drank and treated patients
that day, didn't you?

415
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,935
I didn't.

416
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,020
I can't drink at all, not even a drop.

417
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,731
I don't have alcohol dehydrogenase at all.

418
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,025
Private First Class Hwang has testified.

419
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,987
Do you believe a patient
with quadriplegia?

420
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,950
His sensory organs weren't normal
even before the symptoms started.

421
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,202
Look, a healthy soldier got quadriplegia

422
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,287
because of your treatment--

423
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm doing free medical service here and
you're accusing me of being a charlatan?

424
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,836
Please calm down, okay?

425
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,797
Even if you serve the country
as hard as you can,

426
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,425
the military is where
even the smallest mistake

427
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,801
is reprimanded.

428
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,137
What are you saying…

429
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,764
This military prosecutor
actually knows something.

430
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,184
No patients
know exactly how their condition is.

431
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,979
He had a severe herniated disc
from the start,

432
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,189
so that must've been
pressuring his nerves.

433
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:57,402
So you're saying he got paralyzed
because he neglected his herniated disc?

434
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,945
Regardless of the treatment?

435
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,197
Yes, that's right.

436
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,243
Even if they look fine on the outside,
so many people are sick on the inside.

437
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,912
Patients like that are like bombs.

438
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,708
You could be blamed for everything if you
treat them without knowing anything.

439
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,626
How can you say that as a doctor?

440
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,046
Doctors are not gods!

441
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,718
We can't predict all abnormal symptoms
going on inside the patients' bodies.

442
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,597
Then you, lady prosecutor,
can you predict the verdict,

443
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,098
by trying super hard?

444
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,642
You can't.

445
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,562
She can't.

446
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,063
She can't predict that.

447
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,733
You can't predict that.

448
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,570
Are you investigating or interfering?

449
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,825
Prosecutor Cha, you must learn
to see the big picture.

450
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,162
You must predict the attorney's next move,
so you can win the trial.

451
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,999
Is that why you acted like his attorney
in the interrogation room?

452
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,045
You couldn't even say anything
to that medical officer,

453
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,339
and you're putting your anger out
on me now?

454
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,633
Do you think you can win against
the defense attorney like that?

455
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,720
That's why I said I'll take
this case, buddy.

456
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,140
If you're not confident, don't come
to the trial. It's not too late.

457
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,941
4TH INFANTRY DIVISION

458
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,401
Prosecution, you may start questioning.

459
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,744
What happened to Private First Class Hwang
who went to the military hospital

460
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,579
to get his herniated disc treated?

461
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,457
This was the cause.

462
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,589
One of them has a contrast agent in it,
and the other has ethanol in it.

463
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,634
This contrast agent is injected
during a nerve block

464
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,804
in order to make it easy
to see tissues and blood vessels,

465
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,683
and this ethanol prevents medical supplies
from getting foggy.

466
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,146
Defendant, can you tell this ethanol
and this contrast agent apart?

467
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,233
They're in identical containers,
and they're not labeled.

468
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,821
I can tell them apart.

469
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,823
Oh, really?

470
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,537
Contrast agents and ethanol
have different viscosity,

471
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,623
so it's easy to tell them apart
by looking at them,

472
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,126
and they also have a different texture

473
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,420
when they're injected into
a patient's body.

474
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,504
Then, by any chance,

475
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,425
can you tell them apart
while you're drunk too?

476
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,051
What if there's a possibility you got

477
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,430
the contrast agent and ethanol mixed
up while you were still drunk?

478
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,974
The nursing officer
who was at the scene testified that

479
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,518
the defendant didn't treat the patient
under the influence of alcohol.

480
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,437
I submit the testimony record
of the nursing officer.

481
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,272
Then I shall submit a record too.

482
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,648
It's a report that ethanol

483
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,776
exceeding the average amount
has been found in the victim's body.

484
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,821
There are tons of cases
where alcohol is found in human bodies.

485
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,117
It is found in yeast-fermented bread
and health supplements too.

486
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,912
That cannot serve as evidence
of that being the cause.

487
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,748
Sustained.

488
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,846
I heard from my client's friend.

489
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,808
-I see.
-But please take it easy.

490
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,938
Your attack was stronger than
I expected, so I was nervous.

491
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,359
If we want to trick them,
we must really trick them.

492
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,152
A trial isn't a joke.

493
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,280
That's true.

494
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,206
We set up a witness,

495
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,417
so you just need to play along a bit.
Then it'll be done.

496
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,879
You will also get paid a lot
for winning the case.

497
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,799
A witness?

498
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,926
I see.

499
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,013
Then please help us until the very end.

500
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,062
Your Honor, I ask to summon a witness.

501
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,523
What witness?

502
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,191
The witness won't be summoned.

503
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,030
But I heard the military prosecution
requested no witness today.

504
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,325
The witness just called us,
saying that he will testify.

505
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,286
What do you think, defense?

506
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,373
Of course, we cannot approve it.

507
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,333
We have not been notified in advance.

508
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,044
As he has to make this difficult
testimony risking his job,

509
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,963
it was difficult for us
to persuade the witness,

510
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,633
and for the witness to make
a decision for himself as well.

511
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,595
Defense. What do you think
about listening to the witness?

512
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,974
I understand, Your Honor.

513
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,018
The witness may be summoned.

514
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,863
Nothing will go wrong.

515
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,158
That military prosecutor
is really good with details.

516
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,918
Witness, please introduce yourself.

517
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,089
I'm a doctor at MMA who does
conscription physical examinations.

518
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,716
What's your relationship
with the defendant?

519
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,551
We're close friends
from the same medical school.

520
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,304
Then do you two meet and drink often?

521
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,388
Yes.

522
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,640
Did you meet the defendant
in the early hours

523
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,267
the day of the incident too?

524
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,144
I did.

525
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,272
Then did you drink with him?

526
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,405
Yes, I drank with him.

527
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,580
The defendant said he didn't drink
on the day of his medical treatment,

528
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,166
but you're saying something
completely opposite.

529
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,543
It is true. He drank with me.

530
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,170
What are you saying? You bastard!

531
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,798
Objection.
The witness is committing perjury.

532
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,133
I'll submit evidence proving
he's not committing perjury.

533
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,262
This was four hours before the incident.

534
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,722
I inquired at this bar,

535
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,809
and they drank two bottles of liquor
and four bottles of beer.

536
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,020
I now submit this receipt
provided by the witness

537
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,188
as evidence.

538
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,361
If you divide this by per person,
that's 0.3 blood alcohol content,

539
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,405
and with that much BAC,
it's difficult to even stand up straight.

540
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,284
It requires about 21 hours for alcohol
to be broken down in the human body

541
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,746
and they left the bar at 4:30 a.m.

542
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,749
The time the defendant treated
Private First Class Hwang was 9:20 a.m.

543
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,626
ETHANOL

544
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,840
It's not enough time to sober up
and treat the patients properly.

545
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,135
The cause of Private First
Class Hwang's quadriplegia

546
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,303
is that the defendant was drunk

547
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,639
and he injected ethanol,
which he shouldn't have.

548
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,228
Defendant, because of your
ridiculous mistake,

549
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,607
a healthy soldier of the Republic of Korea
now has to live the rest of his life

550
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,693
lying in bed.

551
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,530
Do you have a guilty conscience?

552
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,283
Answer me.

553
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,450
Hey.

554
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,328
-What are you doing?
-Do you, or do you not?

555
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,260
The witness is here

556
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,972
after much serious reflection as a doctor,

557
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:27,018
who saves lives, in order to relieve
the injustice faced by a soldier.

558
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,771
Please take that into consideration.

559
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,364
Defense attorney, do you have
an additional defense?

560
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,449
No, I don't.

561
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,625
Why don't we just destroy
that medical officer friend of yours?

562
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,212
I told you to
just help him to be found innocent.

563
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,965
I looked into your relationship
with him while investigating.

564
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,468
You.

565
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,429
You were a skilled resident,

566
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,390
but you actually had
several records of medical accidents.

567
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,144
But that medical officer friend had
a clean record although he had troubles.

568
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,855
That can mean only one thing.

569
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,734
You've been the scapegoat
for the accidents he's been causing.

570
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,737
Not as his friend, but as his servant.

571
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,867
If you get a job at his father's hospital,
you'll keep living like this.

572
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,037
I can't get a job at other hospitals
with my connections anyway.

573
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,499
The VIP you're helping

574
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,711
is Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

575
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,922
You'll get a job at a much better place.

576
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,383
You mean CEO Noh of IM Defense Industry?

577
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,513
But still, I can't testify. I--

578
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,015
Then I have to force you to sit
in the witness' seat.

579
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,977
Did you forget that
I'm a military prosecutor?

580
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,313
You tried to bribe a military prosecutor
to conceal your friend's crime.

581
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,066
-But you said that first--
-I told you

582
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,277
that a prosecutor in this country

583
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,196
can make anyone a criminal
if he or she decides to.

584
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,117
-And the military is even worse.
-Why did you change your mind?

585
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,454
Mr. Noh's military service
exemption must not have any flaws.

586
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,082
But your friend is a potential flaw.

587
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,585
It'll be troublesome if he backstabs us.

588
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,799
You should just testify
all of the facts as they are.

589
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,801
If you make a single mistake,

590
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,722
I'll destroy you first.

591
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,693
You summoned a witness
without letting me know.

592
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,029
And he was not someone
to be investigated either.

593
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,365
-Aren't you going to explain?
-We won the trial.

594
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,783
What more explanations do you need?

595
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,452
Military Prosecutor Doh.

596
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,621
Are you a just military prosecutor, or…

597
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,001
a smart military prosecutor?

598
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,461
Just?

599
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,089
I get a lot of questions
about justice these days.

600
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,970
Can you accurately distinguish
right from wrong?

601
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,473
But shouldn't prosecutors protect justice?

602
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,226
To me, justice applies to
anyone who's on my side.

603
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,940
That truly sounds like you.

604
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,567
Did you get it now?

605
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,827
The Department of Military Justice
sentenced a heavy verdict

606
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,164
of 4 years and 6 months in prison
for the recent medical accident

607
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,833
which is exceptional
for a medical accident case.

608
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,543
Meanwhile, the history
of the military prosecutor

609
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,796
who led the victory in the trial
is now a hot issue.

610
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,840
He is Military Prosecutor
Doh Bae-man, who investigated

611
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,427
the "Imperial Military Service"
of the son of Gusan Bank's president, and…

612
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,390
So he is the one who's going to get
Tae-nam exempt from his military service?

613
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,849
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,935
So he was my subordinate?

615
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,521
Adjutant Yang!

616
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,734
Get an appointment for a meeting
with the Staff Judge Advocate

617
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,070
and Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

618
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,488
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,830
What are you planning to do?

620
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,790
I must give a warning.

621
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,794
Lawyer Yong, go find the video first.

622
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,129
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,476
Help.

624
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,689
-Help!
-Help!

625
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,649
Help!

626
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,321
Help!

627
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,417
What is this place?

628
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,387
Hey.

629
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,473
There was only one van for nine people

630
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,683
that left the parking lot during
the speculated time of the incident.

631
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,893
Who owns the car?

632
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,353
It's owned by a company.

633
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,022
It's a defense industry company
called Kang's Solution.

634
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,526
Okay.

635
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,159
How high up is she going?

636
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,997
The 30th floor…

637
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,765
The CEO of that company is Kang Ha-joon.

638
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,060
He's a new young entrepreneur
in his late 20s,

639
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,313
who has professional technological
power in the mobility industry.

640
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,902
You still wear that watch?

641
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,988
This watch saved my life.

642
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,365
I exchanged my life with this.

643
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,536
7 YEARS AGO, NEW YORK

644
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,814
Hey, you're using your smart brain
to make a gambling program?

645
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,108
After getting a scholarship from my dad?

646
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,780
-Are you this dude's chick?
-What?

647
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,700
Gosh, damn it, it's all broken.

648
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,214
Hey.

649
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,549
Do you know how much that program costs?

650
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,261
Hey, don't you think you're
wasting yourself away?

651
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,140
Are you going to make programs to peep
at someone else's cards all your life?

652
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,811
I'm trying to make money
to raise my business fund.

653
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,355
Then get it from my dad.

654
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,025
-What?
-He wants me to bring you to him.

655
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,694
He said he will invest
in that genius brain of yours.

656
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,114
Mr. Cha…

657
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,075
I miss him a lot more today.

658
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,244
I think of him a lot more too.

659
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,956
He must've seen us taking care
of that garbage too, right?

660
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,211
I'm done.

661
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,838
Come take care of things here.

662
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,319
What about him?

663
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,447
Did you make any progress?

664
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,660
I was convinced that
he is someone I need for my plan.

665
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,538
He's not someone I can look up to,

666
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,915
but he's someone I can't help
but be impressed by.

667
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,462
Taking care of garbage…

668
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,300
So Kang Ha-joon
helped with kidnapping Alan.

669
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,976
-Sang-ki.
-Yes, sir.

670
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,355
I think I solved
the puzzle of Alan's kidnapping.

671
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,201
The case began around 10:00 p.m.
12 days ago,

672
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,495
at a club called Cartel in Gangnam.

673
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,123
Noh Tae-nam and Alan drank together,

674
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:38,295
and Alan brought a girl
named Han Se-na with him.

675
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,926
Se-na was raped there,
and she went to the police station

676
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,387
to report it with her body torn up.

677
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,058
And the person Se-na called for help is…

678
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,352
Se-na.

679
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,686
Cha Woo-in.

680
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,691
Alan played card games
with his friends the next day.

681
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,817
Fifty.

682
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,363
What he did the day before
was already erased from his memory.

683
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,697
But…

684
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,203
an unexpected visitor showed up.

685
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,415
Cha Woo-in can beat
the gangsters up with a wiper,

686
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,627
so five drunken jerks must've
been nothing to her.

687
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,838
The accomplice helped her
to move those unconscious jerks.

688
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,636
And the accomplice is

689
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,014
Kang Ha-joon,
the CEO of Kang's Solution.

690
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,685
Cha Woo-in and Kang Ha-joon

691
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,938
are connected through Cha Woo-in's father.

692
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,984
If we dig into Kang Ha-joon a bit more,
we might find something more about Woo-in.

693
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,988
This is the situation
behind the kidnapping of Alan

694
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,282
I have figured out as of now.

695
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,162
It came out one hour ago.

696
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,208
The conclusion that Cha Woo-in
is that woman in the red wig.

697
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,007
It means she did it
for the girl, Han Se-na,

698
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,385
but she made the situation way worse.

699
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,471
Or…

700
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,765
Perhaps she has other reasons.

701
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,062
Then what are you going to do?

702
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,480
Isn't it obvious?

703
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,816
I must put handcuffs on Cha Woo-in,

704
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,028
so nothing would go wrong with
my discharge plan.

705
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,855
Are you looking for this?

706
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,816
Who are you?

707
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,986
The soundproofing isn't very good here,

708
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,405
so let's talk quietly.

709
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,951
We met before, so don't be too scared.

710
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,373
I'm Mr. Noh Tae-nam's lawyer.

711
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,666
Get out.

712
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,669
Get out! Or I'll call the police!

713
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,765
I know you didn't look for it on purpose,
worried it'd cause harm.

714
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,685
It's been a while since you heard
your mother's voice, right?

715
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,353
Talk to her on the phone.

716
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,410
Oh, my, Se-na! What's going on?
You never call me first.

717
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,704
Mom…

718
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,747
Are you eating properly?

719
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,874
What's going on?

720
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,794
I just wanted to see if you're doing fine.

721
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,464
Hey, there's hardly any work here,
so I'm concerned.

722
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,008
They might call me a paycheck thief.

723
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,220
Mom, I'll call you again. I'm sorry.

724
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:18,056
Don't be sorry. I know you're busy.

725
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,809
I love you, my daughter.

726
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,246
Do you have that video?

727
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,166
I don't.

728
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,252
Even if you don't have
that video with you,

729
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,046
that video must not come out

730
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,883
to the world.

731
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,888
Your mother is up to you.

732
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,353
Farewell, then…

733
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,743
Attention! Salute!

734
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,952
-Salute!
-Salute!

735
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,497
At ease!

736
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,123
Major Seo Joo-hyuk!

737
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,792
Captain Doh Bae-man!

738
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,753
At ease!

739
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,050
I got a report on
the medical accident trial you solved.

740
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,677
Captain Doh is
going to be discharged soon.

741
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,305
He's a talented man
to let the civilian court have him.

742
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,224
What do you plan to do
when you get discharged?

743
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,353
I'm going to work as a lawyer
at a civilian law firm.

744
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,690
Even lawyers these days must have
a specialty to survive.

745
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,776
The experience in the military would help.

746
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,861
Yes, it would.

747
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:01,576
I also heard there are lawyers who work
on conscription corruption out there.

748
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,580
It means they do what brokers do,
when they're lawyers.

749
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,920
By any chance,

750
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,090
are you also interested in
doing things like that?

751
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,601
As a serviceperson and a prosecutor,
I saw and learned many things here.

752
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,605
I am leaving, but I will not forget
my military spirit.

753
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,693
It's a shame
that I won't be able to serve you,

754
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,152
Division Commander.

755
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,619
Right.

756
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,914
See you when you report your discharge,
Captain Doh Bae-man.

757
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,143
My client's…

758
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,317
We're having a meeting, so wait outside.

759
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,028
Would it be okay for me
to talk to you here?

760
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,321
It doesn't matter to me.

761
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,865
What should I do?

762
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:39,090
It's been so long
since I saw that expression.

763
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,218
You had that expression when
I brought you here for the first time.

764
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,430
I will report three things
about Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

765
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,475
Sure, go ahead.

766
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:52,437
First, I secured the suspect
for the car that was used to kidnap Alan.

767
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,815
I think we'll be able
to find Alan within today.

768
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,817
Okay.

769
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,529
Second, I got an appointment
with Mr. Noh Tae-nam at Cartel today.

770
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,450
And he told you not to come with me.

771
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,204
-What's the third one?
-Third…

772
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,456
This is the last report.

773
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,541
After today,

774
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,419
I will not make any more reports to you.

775
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:25,261
Does that mean you're done with me now?

776
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,429
That's right.

777
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,015
What's the reason?

778
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,393
You shouldn't have told
the Division Commander

779
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,729
that I'm taking care of
Mr. Noh's conscription, at least.

780
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,440
Did you really hate me gaining trust
from Mr. Noh that much?

781
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,610
Do you think General Noh would've
never known if I didn't tell her?

782
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,866
From now on, I will join Mr. Noh's team,

783
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,160
directly, without anyone in the middle.

784
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,374
So you're saying

785
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,044
you're cutting our business
because it's solely my fault?

786
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,006
Yes, I did something
you can use as an excuse.

787
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,049
That's good enough, yes.

788
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,093
But I'm warning you.

789
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,637
You, Prosecutor Doh,

790
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,182
messed with General Noh Hwa-young's
most sensitive wrath trigger.

791
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,853
You can't take my place
through that method.

792
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,097
That's a lot of pee.

793
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,265
Please help us.

794
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,273
I took off from the station right away,
but I'm late.

795
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,691
It's okay.

796
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:06,154
Se-na is out of reach,
so I was about to call you, actually.

797
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,283
I wanted to see you because of that too.

798
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,956
This is the video of that scene.

799
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,708
I just got it from Se-na.

800
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,254
It won't be hard to get an arrest warrant
for Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

801
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,979
The key is inside.

802
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,613
We checked the car owned
by Kang's Solution and found Alan.

803
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,699
But these jerks are a total mess.

804
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,451
Okay, good job.

805
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,329
I'm now at Cartel to meet Mr. Noh.

806
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,082
Bring those jerks to Seoul safely.

807
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,593
We found Alan.

808
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,930
I knew you would do it.

809
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,224
Come and have a glass.

810
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,685
Yes, sir.

811
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,068
It's an honor, Mr. Noh.

812
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,582
About my conscription project--

813
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:44,502
Even if our Division Commander is there,
it's what you want, so I must do it.

814
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,921
Yes, that's it.

815
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,466
I wasn't born the son of a general
because I wanted to?

816
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,301
Why should I serve
when everyone else skips it?

817
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,969
That's what I'm saying.

818
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,013
Don't worry.

819
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,557
The doctor of conscription
just needs to stamp a seal.

820
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,476
I'm done casting the doctor already.

821
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,273
But Alan dislocated his shoulder.

822
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,692
But I don't want to do
such a rough, idiotic thing.

823
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,360
I'm too scared to even go see a dentist.

824
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,988
Your illness will only
be written on the document.

825
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,657
You're going to skip it
without anything in your way.

826
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,535
I really like the way you work.

827
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,497
You're different from Lawyer Yong,
who's concerned about my mom.

828
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,416
By the way…

829
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,794
I heard that military people

830
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,797
are considered guard dogs
that protect the nation.

831
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,888
Yes, well, that's right.

832
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,809
The loyal Doberman, who would
bite anyone for the owner.

833
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,687
That's what you are, Prosecutor Doh.

834
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,689
Even your name is Doh Bae-man.

835
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,317
Yes.

836
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,909
You know that, right?

837
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:02,956
That IM Defense Industry is
the top company in the defense industry.

838
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,836
I'm sure you need someone
who knows a lot about the military.

839
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,049
I can never let Lawyer Yong do that job
because he is my mother's shadow.

840
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,676
And,

841
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,679
Lawyer Yong always reports
everything I do to my mother.

842
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,515
Your life is hard too.

843
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,267
So I'm saying…

844
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:28,314
I want you, Prosecutor Doh,
to be in charge of IM's legal team.

845
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,698
Thank you so much, Mr. Noh!

846
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,408
I will do my best!

847
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,787
Don't be so hasty.

848
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,624
It's under the condition that you complete
my conscription project secretly.

849
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,084
Of course.

850
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,879
Go ahead and answer your phone.

851
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,715
I'm going to the restroom.

852
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,598
Tae-nam. It's me, Alan!

853
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,018
That red-haired wench beat me up
and took the video!

854
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,770
Are you listening?

855
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,314
We have to find that video!

856
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,692
We're doomed if it gets revealed!
Do something! Please!

857
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,069
You can do it, right?

858
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,573
-A red-haired wench has the video?
-Yes, that red-haired--

859
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,617
LAWYER YONG MOON-GOO

860
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,702
Hang up for now.

861
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,582
The police will raid Cartel soon.

862
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,001
What?

863
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,636
Team A, go this way.
Team B, this way to the gate.

864
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,554
-Go.
-Yes, ma'am.

865
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,145
What the heck?

866
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,522
I came here for that bastard Military Doh,

867
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,691
but there are cops everywhere.

868
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,486
What in the world is going on?

869
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,113
That's a lot of them.

870
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,217
What the heck?

871
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,096
What the heck?

872
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,807
We're now executing justice!
Get that dog out of here, now!

873
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,684
Executing justice…

874
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,686
Don't you know who I am?

875
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,523
We know who you are, Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

876
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,234
This is an emergency arrest warrant.

877
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,487
We received video evidence. Come with us.

878
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:44,075
Hey, Bolt. Bite them. Now!

879
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,996
Hey, you bastard! Where are you going?

880
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,040
-Cuff him, now.
-Yes, ma'am.

881
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:57,046
I will remember your face!
Just wait and see!

882
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,257
-Take him away.
-Yes, ma'am.

883
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,135
Let go!

884
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,405
You there, stop.

885
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,283
Come here for a moment.

886
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,622
That bastard!

887
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,703
The car…

888
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,465
-Stop!
-Get that car!

889
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,768
What are you doing? Follow them!

890
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:34,769
-Hurry up!
-Go, now!

891
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,020
Yes, boss.

892
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,740
Get to the side!

893
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,041
Get closer!

894
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,967
Damn it.

895
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,844
Stop following me.

896
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,304
Auntie, please stop following me.

897
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,985
Stop the car! 9119!

898
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,152
Damn it!

899
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,030
Hey! Stop the car, you bastard!

900
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,156
Hey, you bastard! You…

901
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,285
I'm going to kill you, you bastard!
Stop the car, you bastard!

902
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,995
-Hey, you bastard!
-Damn it.

903
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,080
I will kill you, you bastard!

904
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,456
Hey!

905
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,559
Damn!

906
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:01,981
Damn it.

907
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,574
What the heck?

908
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,460
Let's go.

909
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,617
What?

910
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,411
What the heck? What's wrong with this?

911
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,478
Cha Woo-in.

912
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,279
That red wig.

913
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,907
My hunch was right.

914
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,669
It wasn't a coincidence
that I found that wig

915
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,048
in the car, right?

916
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,341
It was the bait.

917
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,307
People believe that
they choose their own lives,

918
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,517
but they're wrong.

919
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,979
Even those choices are
already in their fate.

920
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:51,233
Because we never had any choice

921
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,612
to refuse our fates from the start.

922
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:59,116
You cannot get discharged,
Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

923
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,995
You must stay here and fight alongside me.

924
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,667
Because that's your fate.

925
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,541
Tell me. Why did you try to kill me?

926
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,544
I was only trying
to help you come to a realization.

927
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,879
You're not supposed to spit
in the water you were drinking.

928
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,715
That military bastard Doh Bae-man
ran away all by himself?

929
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,217
Mr. Noh decided to resign

930
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,178
from all his positions related to
IM Defense Industry as of today.

931
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,055
-IM is my everything.
-Don't delude yourself.

932
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,350
I'm sorry, but, you lost everything
because you betrayed me.

933
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:09,311
I'll start over from the very bottom.

934
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:13,315
You will find out why we must fight
alongside each other.

935
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:21,949
