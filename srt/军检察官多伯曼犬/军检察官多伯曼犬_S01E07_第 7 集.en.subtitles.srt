1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,653
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,779
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,742
I know that
the monthly payment isn't enough,

5
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,118
but as I'm a serviceperson,

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,912
I'll only accept payment
from the government from now on.

7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,124
Therefore, I refuse to renew the contract.

8
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,500
Salute.

9
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,212
Doh Bae-man!

10
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,173
That bastard!

11
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,603
This is the material on
Military Prosecutor Cha you asked for.

12
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,146
Okay.

13
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,902
When should we schedule
your inauguration as the CEO of IM?

14
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,779
Cancel the inauguration.

15
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,531
Things aren't great at the group
because of Mr. Noh,

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,283
so I'll go straight into the CEO's office.

17
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,452
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,747
What should we do with this?

19
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,090
Burn it all.

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,763
A serviceperson's paycheck
disappears quickly from your bank account.

21
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,432
Don't you think your work
over five years has been wasted?

22
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,975
I do.

23
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,521
I think I'll have nightmares
about the money I gave up on.

24
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,525
Anyway, how did you know I was here?

25
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,401
Please answer my question first.

26
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,322
A month ago, you said you'll cuff
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

27
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,492
-But now--
-I cuffed Noh Tae-nam.

28
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,203
Yes. So what happened?

29
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,207
I decided to work with Prosecutor Cha.

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,294
I guess I can say we're companions
with the same goal.

31
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,340
You and Prosecutor Cha are companions…

32
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:17,220
I don't know how that happened,
but it answered some of my questions.

33
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,390
So I'm asking,

34
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,351
Sang-ki, are you going
to keep working with me?

35
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,562
Well…

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,147
I am, yes.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,482
I'm broke now.
Are you still okay with that?

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,485
Did you think that
I only care about money?

39
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,155
It's sad, actually.

40
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,117
You jerk.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,118
Hey.

42
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,287
I caught Noh Tae-nam.

43
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,914
Who shall handle him?

44
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,461
The military prosecutor is coming,
so behave.

45
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,845
Hey, open the door!

46
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,014
Hey, open it. Let me out!

47
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,599
Hey, can't you hear me?

48
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,647
Hey.

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,525
Hey, Doh Bae-man, long time no see.

50
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,694
You're in charge of me?

51
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,113
Then it's game over. The end.

52
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,157
It's a pity to meet you here.

53
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,911
I feel much better to have an ally here.

54
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,245
Let me out of here.

55
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,248
I got shot here, and it hurts like hell.

56
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,792
So I need to go to the hospital
and get an MRI.

57
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,755
I'll send you somewhere else
after finishing the statement.

58
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,927
Do we have to do that?

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,678
It's just for formalities.

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,139
It's the military,
so I hope you understand.

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,390
Have a seat.

62
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,775
Noh Tae-nam's interrogation started.

63
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,984
Listen carefully.

64
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,197
We'll see if Doh Bae-man doesn't have
any more regrets about Noh Tae-nam.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,324
Are you still doubting Prosecutor Doh?

66
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,660
I don't trust him 100 percent yet.

67
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,538
With news of his arrest, it so happened
that Lee Jae-sik, the new Minister

68
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,708
of the National Defense,
had his inauguration today.

69
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,461
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young,
Former CEO Noh's mother,

70
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,547
left the inauguration in a hurry.

71
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,716
And to make the military
trusted by the people…

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,263
Woo-in, you totally screwed up
the biggest party for servicepeople.

73
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,683
This will ruin Noh Hwa-young
and Lee Jae-sik's relationship.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,853
Minister.

75
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,444
You brat!

76
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,991
-I'm sorry, I did it without realizing it…
-You brat!

77
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,329
I wouldn't have slapped you
if you were a "woman!"

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,164
Yes, I know.

79
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,751
You ruined the most honorable moment
in my 40-year military career!

80
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,878
You, Hwa-young, of all people, ruined it!

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,882
I got humiliated
because of your idiotic son!

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,094
While all servicepeople
and all of Korea were watching!

83
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,765
You're his mother and his boss,
but you couldn't stop anything?

84
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,601
Didn't you even know that he ran away?

85
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,856
Fix this, even if you have to
kick your son out.

86
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,152
I swear that my son
will never be a topic of gossip again.

87
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,779
I will bet my uniform on it.

88
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,365
What?

89
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,617
If my son causes trouble, again,

90
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,911
then I will step down as a serviceperson.

91
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,292
Let's go.

92
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,883
Where's Tae-nam right now?

93
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,053
He's being interrogated
at the office of justice.

94
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,556
I should've listened to you.

95
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,184
I wouldn't have gone through this
if I didn't enlist.

96
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,021
I'm going more crazy
coming back here after getting out.

97
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,317
What was the situation
when you ran away from the boot camp?

98
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,028
Prosecutor Doh Bae-man,

99
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,906
seeing you here tells me,
you're a real military prosecutor.

100
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,328
This interrogation is scripted
already, right?

101
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,748
Just tell me about the situation.

102
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,794
You said this statement is
just a formality, right?

103
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,964
I went to the restroom, and I saw
a freezer truck outside the window,

104
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,716
so I went in there to find food.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,135
It must've been really cold
if it's a freezer truck.

106
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,640
What? Right.
It's so cold that I passed out.

107
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,475
And when you woke up,
you were outside the base.

108
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,768
Yes, that's right.

109
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,524
That means you didn't run away,
but you were taken away?

110
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,654
Hey, that sounds great.

111
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,822
That's it.

112
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,657
I was taken away. Taken away.

113
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,286
But it's confined in here.

114
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,830
I'm claustrophobic.

115
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,039
Get me out of here.

116
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,165
Before that,

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,918
why did you try to leave Korea

118
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,712
on a private jet
if you're not trying to run away?

119
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,798
Leave Korea?

120
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,513
You see, I finally got out.

121
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,933
I mean, I was taken out,

122
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,602
so it would be a waste
if I return immediately.

123
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,604
I was just going
to get some air and return.

124
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,856
That's not very good, actually.

125
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,983
-It isn't, right?
-No.

126
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,235
That part is the biggest hole.

127
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,487
You should fill it in
with some details, okay?

128
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,490
I need to get some rest now.

129
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,037
Are you having fun?

130
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,048
Are you having fun
because I'm playing along?

131
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,279
Noh Tae-nam.

132
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,538
Noh Tae-nam.

133
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,458
Answer me, you bastard!

134
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,919
What?

135
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,254
What are you doing?

136
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,799
I'm a captain with three diamonds.

137
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,344
And you're a trainee,
without even a single bar.

138
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,555
From now on, use honorifics to your
superiors and address them properly.

139
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,475
Hey, are you nuts? Why are you
being this way all of a sudden?

140
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,019
You know how prosecutors are, right?

141
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,189
They can cover up
or grow the case the way they want.

142
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,900
Plus, I'm a prosecutor in uniform.

143
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,360
How do you think that'd be?

144
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,238
You military bastard! Did you just hit me?

145
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,951
Be polite to your superior.

146
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,285
Okay?

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,705
-Say your official rank and name.
-Hey, my mom is your division commander!

148
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,790
Say your official rank and name!

149
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,257
-Hey, this is interrogation by force--
-Trainee Noh Tae-nam.

150
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,431
-Don't you have a number?
-Trainee 30… no, Trainee 13, Noh Tae-nam.

151
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,184
Trainee 13, Noh Tae-nam.

152
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,354
You'll never get out of here now.

153
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,149
You will be stuck
in the military forever, starting today.

154
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,753
It's working now.

155
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,840
Why are you standing?

156
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,049
Where were we?

157
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,595
The night duty worker's
testimony before you ran away.

158
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,888
The CCTV footage from the kitchen.

159
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,225
And a friend's testimony
that you met while on the run.

160
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,353
And the material recorded at the airport

161
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,024
are proving that you ran away,
so Article 30 of the Military Work Act,

162
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,860
desertion from military service,
will be applied.

163
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,946
Desertion from military service.

164
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,120
Sign it.

165
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,464
LAWYER YONG MOON-GOO

166
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,636
What happened?

167
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,347
Yes, I'm figuring out what's going on.

168
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
One thing is for sure.

169
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,061
Doh Bae-man now turned himself
against you and me.

170
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,063
Doh Bae-man isn't the matter right now!

171
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,900
Don't you know how much my reputation
declined because of Tae-nam?

172
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,235
At the Minister's inauguration, at that?

173
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,946
General, please give me some more time.

174
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,796
Salute.

175
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,676
Cha Woo-in.

176
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,762
Salute.

177
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,393
Captain Cha Woo-in.

178
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,104
That military salute,
which you hesitated to do just now.

179
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,688
Do you know why you do it?

180
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,565
According to Article 5
of the Direct Military Rules,

181
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,734
it's a motion of obedience
to the superiors.

182
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,693
You're wrong.

183
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,781
Military salutes began when the
armed knights of the medieval era

184
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,199
lifted their helmet visors

185
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,244
to show their faces to
confirm their identities.

186
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,543
It means, "I'm not your enemy."

187
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,214
Captain Cha Woo-in, at ease.

188
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,174
Do it again.

189
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,140
It means we're fellow soldiers
who are fighting together

190
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,809
in the battlefield,
where bullets are flying.

191
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,811
Do you get it now?

192
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,896
Yes, Division Commander.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,524
Both of you, at ease.

194
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,651
You're both working hard
until this late hour.

195
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,031
The interrogation went on late
into the night due to Trainee Noh's case.

196
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,366
Who interrogated him?

197
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,576
I did.

198
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,995
Report the details
of the interrogation to me.

199
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,165
Are you here as his mother,
or as the division commander?

200
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,292
My report will be based on your answer.

201
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,253
Can't you see my uniform and badge?

202
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,798
I'm sorry, Division Commander.

203
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,677
I got all of his testimony
related to his desertion.

204
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,723
Punish Trainee Noh Tae-nam
strictly according to the rules.

205
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,934
While I'm here, absolutely no one

206
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,478
can be an exception.

207
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,191
I came here to tell you this
as your direct boss.

208
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,402
Get it?

209
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,237
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,339
Yes.

211
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,300
Even if you don't open the door for me,

212
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,094
I'll get out of here soon.

213
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,847
I'll see you after I get out,
you bastards.

214
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,229
Noh Tae-nam did it
because he didn't want to pay off

215
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,147
the money he borrowed from
your father's bank.

216
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,690
What?

217
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,568
You want me to believe that?

218
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,529
I did the stabbing,

219
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,198
but it was Noh Tae-nam
who gave me the knife.

220
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,993
Why are you telling me that now?

221
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,246
For a truce between you and me,

222
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,164
and…

223
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,043
to give you motivation
for the rest of your service.

224
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,212
Make No Tae-nam

225
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,130
your dog.

226
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,470
PERSONAL DETAILS
CHA WOO-IN

227
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,143
FATHER: FORMER CEO CHA HO-CHUL
OF IM DEFENSE INDUSTRY

228
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,645
DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT

229
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,568
Cha Woo-in is

230
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,654
CEO Cha Ho-chul's daughter?

231
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,710
-Hi, Prosecutor.
-Hi, I'll check the scene.

232
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,003
Sure, go ahead.

233
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,058
Yes, I have arrived.

234
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,978
CEO Cha died at the scene,

235
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,439
and there was another passenger.

236
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,899
Another passenger?

237
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,859
-Who was it?
-It was his daughter.

238
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,069
She returned from the US three days ago.

239
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,906
Did she die too?

240
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,449
She's unconscious.

241
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,786
And based on the scene,
she seems hopeless.

242
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,999
General?

243
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,339
It's funny that someone
who wielded a sword mercilessly

244
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,716
at an innocent person
when he was a prosecutor

245
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,052
is saying the word "just."

246
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,180
The daughter of Cha Ho-chul,
who was believed to have died with him

247
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,350
became a military prosecutor,

248
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,603
and has been involved
in Mr. Noh Tae-nam's matters?

249
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,319
NOH TAE-NAM RAN AWAY
FROM THE MILITARY

250
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,387
If there are too many coincidences,
then they're no longer coincidences.

251
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,894
Number 34, your New York
steak burger is ready.

252
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,314
-The New York steak burger is ready.
-The New York steak burger is ready.

253
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,317
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

254
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,154
Welcome.

255
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,285
How's work?

256
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,664
The boss is nice, and it's great.

257
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,253
I was in pain
because of Noh Tae-nam's trial,

258
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,630
but still, Alan got punished.

259
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,427
When I think that I don't
need to see them again anymore,

260
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,679
that gives me the strength to go on.

261
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,806
Se-na.

262
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,061
Remember? I said I'd tell you
everything when the time comes.

263
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,026
I--

264
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,362
The red-haired woman who caught
Tae-nam at the airport and disappeared.

265
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,614
That's your alter ego, right?

266
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,412
Yes.

267
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,039
It was me.

268
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,207
So I was right.

269
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,754
I wondered how you had the video,

270
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,422
but I know now.

271
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,968
I have many more questions,
but I won't ask.

272
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,179
Because I know

273
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,557
you will never give up
on the fight you're in right now.

274
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,647
So, I, too, began fighting against myself.

275
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,568
I won't suffer from
what happened in the past anymore.

276
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,239
Yes.

277
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,618
Let's win.

278
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,211
MINE EXPLOSION AT THE DMZ

279
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,568
-Report the current situation!
-The Company Commander cannot be located!

280
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,530
-It looks like he stepped on a mine!
-Stay in your places

281
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,032
and Koo Hyun-seok,
ask the base for backup!

282
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,667
Snap out of it!

283
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,377
The lives of two people depend on you!

284
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,838
Hey!

285
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,217
I'll go rescue the Company Commander.

286
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,343
But that's a minefield.

287
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,971
Who cares? My subordinate is in there!

288
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,390
I can go through this geography
with my eyes closed!

289
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,475
You guys, don't move!

290
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,477
That's…

291
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,480
an order.

292
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,569
-Battalion Commander!
-Battalion Commander!

293
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,496
-Battalion Commander!
-Battalion Commander!

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,544
-Battalion Commander!
-Battalion Commander?

295
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,720
-Battalion Commander!
-Battalion Commander!

296
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,971
Are you okay?

297
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,266
Company Commander, are you okay?

298
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,355
Search Battalion Commander Won is
the hero of mines who sacrificed himself

299
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,192
and saved his subordinate
from the minefield.

300
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,030
In return for being a hero,
he lost one leg,

301
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,324
and he now has to
walk on crutches forever.

302
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,619
But why is the hero of mines
the first target?

303
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,120
There are two people

304
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,582
who led the collapse
of my father's company six years ago.

305
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,376
Yong Moon-goo and Won Ki-choon.

306
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,671
As the reward, Yong Moon-goo
got Law and One,

307
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,758
and Won Ki-choon became the newest member
of the Patriotic Society.

308
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,511
What did Won Ki-choon do
to IM Defense Industry?

309
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,975
I hereby report the charges

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,145
of leaking military secrets
by CEO Cha of IM Defense Industry.

311
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,067
I have evidence that proves
tens of billions of won in bribery

312
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,236
were exchanged between CEO Cha's
IM Defense Industry

313
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,196
and a Chinese defense company

314
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,658
under the condition
of providing key secrets

315
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,076
of army tanks made in Korea.

316
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,914
All of this was led by CEO Cha Ho-chul.

317
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,378
Leaking military secrets
is serious treason of selling the nation.

318
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,840
CEO Cha Ho-chul must be
punished to the maximum!

319
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,175
JUST STAY ALIVE, I'M COMING

320
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,178
I'm sure you all remember
the mine explosion

321
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,889
that occurred during the search
operation at the DMZ.

322
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,433
There's an honorable serviceperson
who risked his life

323
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,353
to save his subordinate and lost his leg.

324
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,523
He's Search Battalion Commander
Won Ki-choon, the hero of mines.

325
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,941
His autobiography about the accident

326
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,944
and the insight on how his life
changed after that,

327
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,322
titled Just Stay Alive, I'm Coming is now
holding a book signing tour

328
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:26,201
in bookstores across the country,
with the support of the people.

329
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,329
-Here.
-Can I take a picture with you?

330
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,455
Yes, sure.

331
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,833
Thank you.

332
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,171
Now, if you want to take a picture,
please come out.

333
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,716
Yes.

334
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,968
All right, look at your mommy.

335
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,183
He's the hero of reporting six years ago,
and now he's the hero of mines?

336
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,268
Thank you.

337
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,061
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

338
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,648
That jerk isn't someone who would run
to the minefield to save his subordinate.

339
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,943
Because he's the one
who made fake evidence

340
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,571
and destroyed my father.

341
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,075
You look like
you want to shoot him right now.

342
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,329
I'm just so thankful
for your love and interest.

343
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,443
Did you plan this too?

344
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,781
Answer me!

345
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,074
No.

346
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,923
I hereby report the shooting attack case
on Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon,

347
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,049
Division Commander.

348
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,384
The shooter is my soldier?

349
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,929
According to the initial investigation
by the military and the police,

350
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,182
it was revealed that
the shooter is Corporal Lee Han-yong--

351
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,560
I mean, Kim Han-yong,
from the fourth division.

352
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,895
What's his motive?

353
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,022
The investigations
hasn't been revealed yet,

354
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,234
so the suspect is being transported
to our office of justice,

355
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,529
but there's this one very shocking fact.

356
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:30,033
I don't know how to take this, but…

357
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,247
While we were looking into
Corporal Kim Han-yong's history…

358
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,582
The identity of the suspect
of the shooting of the hero of mines,

359
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,710
which happened earlier today,
has been revealed, shocking everyone.

360
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,881
Corporal Kim is the younger brother
of the Company Commander

361
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,717
whom Battalion Commander Won saved
by risking his life.

362
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,303
He has just arrived as we speak.

363
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,473
Why did you threaten
Battalion Commander Won?

364
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,058
Do you hold a grudge against him?

365
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,227
How did you steal the gun?

366
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,481
AMMUNITION STORAGE

367
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,401
THE SHOOTING ATTACK ON
BATTALION COMMANDER WON KI-CHOON

368
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,528
Corporal Kim was a member
of the weapons and ammunition team

369
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,446
in the Military Engineering Battalion
of the fourth division.

370
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,135
He fabricated the document
after the checking on weapons,

371
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,013
and stole the 9mm automatic
revolver K5 for officers, bullets,

372
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,265
and left the base
which were used for his crime.

373
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,726
PERMISSION FOR LEAVE

374
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,480
Salute!

375
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,153
After he left the base, he headed to
the bookstore, the location of the crime,

376
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,031
and it looks like he got ready
for the crime in the restroom.

377
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,419
THE VIDEO OF SHOOTING
AT THE BOOKSTORE

378
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,963
Kim Han-yong fired
blank ammunition, right?

379
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,592
How did you know?
I was just about to report that.

380
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,595
That blank ammunition
doesn't have a warhead,

381
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,931
so it has less recoil
when the trigger is pulled.

382
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,224
It sounds different too.

383
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,393
The live ammunition goes "bang,"

384
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,104
and the blank one goes "boom."

385
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,149
But can you tell that
from that CCTV footage?

386
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,778
It's so vivid that it's as though
you witnessed it.

387
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,198
Shouldn't you already know
that I'm sharp and keen?

388
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,452
If it was blank ammunition,
then he had no intention of murder.

389
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,287
That's not always true.

390
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,456
You can't kill someone
with blank ammunition.

391
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,833
If he planned to load
the gun with live ammunition,

392
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,253
but got nervous and loaded it
with blank ammunition…

393
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,059
Corporal Kim was
in the weapons and ammunition team.

394
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,602
He can tell those apart.

395
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,106
He stole the revolver
with the intention to kill someone.

396
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,066
This is an actual battle.

397
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,694
Live ammunition
was also in his possessions, right?

398
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,238
Yes, a total of eight
live ammunition bullets

399
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,490
were found in Kim Han-yong's pocket.

400
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,617
So it is clearly a murder attempt.

401
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,371
He fired blank ammunition,
but he possessed live ammunition,

402
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,249
so it should be seen as
consecutive action for murder.

403
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,792
Indict him for attempted murder.

404
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,919
Even if he possessed live ammunition,

405
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,922
it's not attempted murder if he was aware
that it was blank ammunition.

406
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,011
Let's think about that a bit more.

407
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,764
An important point is
something else, anyway.

408
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,101
Yes, the point of this case
is the motive for murder.

409
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,314
About why he aimed a gun
at someone who saved his brother.

410
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,949
So he wasn't a part
of your revenge, right?

411
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,452
I will get my revenge with my own hands.

412
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,871
And Kim Han-yong
just made it more complicated.

413
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,793
If I did it, I do say that I did it.

414
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,090
The military lawyer said
he'll be late, so he told us to go first.

415
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,551
Gosh, he's still the same.

416
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,511
Is he someone you know?

417
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,306
He was my predecessor when I worked
at the office of justice of the corps.

418
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,808
I'm sure he's late
because he's playing golf, again.

419
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,853
Anyway, let's make him talk first.

420
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,272
-Yes, sir.
-Subsection Chief Ahn, take a seat.

421
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,192
Kim Han-yong.

422
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,278
Article 53 of the Military Criminal Act,

423
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,197
"Murdering Superior and Preparation
and Conspiracy therefor."

424
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,657
You need to know
when to remain silent too.

425
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,951
This is a serious situation.

426
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,875
A mere soldier shot a battalion commander.

427
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,754
If the victim is your superior,
then the sentencing will be heavier.

428
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,922
Why did you shoot him?

429
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,387
And how could you do that
to the person who saved your brother?

430
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,848
You're an ungrateful bastard.

431
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,852
What is it? Is something bothering you?

432
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,187
What is?

433
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,814
The "ungrateful bastard" part? Or…

434
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,191
the "savior" part?

435
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:19,197
I'm just devastated that I wasn't able
to blow that bastard's head off.

436
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,032
Yes.

437
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,952
You could've killed him.

438
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,913
You took enough live ammunition too.

439
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,123
Why?

440
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,419
Were you scared
when you actually got a chance?

441
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:38,466
Look. He's a totally ungrateful bastard
and a coward.

442
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,844
I know what you're trying to do.

443
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,847
If you provoke me
and get the answer you want,

444
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,224
you'll write up some fiction
based on that again. Isn't that right?

445
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,143
I do not trust

446
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,396
servicepeople like you.

447
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,608
You're a serviceperson now,

448
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,027
and your brother, who's in the hospital,
is a serviceperson too.

449
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,905
Don't you dare talk about my poor brother!

450
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,074
One thing is for sure.

451
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,244
You fired that gun for your brother.

452
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,540
People think that
the hero of mines saved your brother,

453
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,751
but you don't think so.

454
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,880
But there's a reason
that's keeping you from telling us.

455
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,548
Because you not only distrust,

456
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,844
but you also hate servicepeople like us.

457
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,894
We got something important.

458
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,188
That there's something behind
the hero of mines.

459
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,607
You'll be in charge of this case.

460
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,275
I'll support you in my own way.

461
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,651
Yes, sir.

462
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,821
Are you done already?

463
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,324
I came here for nothing.

464
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,075
Hey, didn't you get discharged yet?

465
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,245
Well, it turned out like this.

466
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,414
You're in charge of this case?

467
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,125
Don't you think
you're being too insincere?

468
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,337
Come on, though I'm a military lawyer,

469
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,548
I don't want to defend a jerk who fired
live ammunition at the hero of mines.

470
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,674
I'm doing this because it's my job.

471
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,511
It was blank ammunition.

472
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,638
Looks like you didn't even
read the statement.

473
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,270
Do you even know the name
of the soldier you're defending?

474
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,940
That worthless worm…

475
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,901
Why should I know his name?

476
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,530
If you behave like this,
then who is he going to trust?

477
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,074
He's saying that
he can't trust servicepeople.

478
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,830
Listen. Who are you defending then?

479
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,416
Why don't you quit being a military
prosecutor and defend him then?

480
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,086
Hey, aren't I right, Bae-man?

481
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,675
If you don't do it right at the court too,
then I'll submit a complaint.

482
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,724
Wow, she's so damn rude.

483
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,143
She dares to give me orders
when I'm way more experienced.

484
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,479
Is she your successor in
the office of justice?

485
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,232
Yes, she joined
the office of justice not long ago.

486
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,025
-Please understand.
-You jerk.

487
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,112
How can you keep quiet?
Your former predecessor was insulted.

488
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,615
A good successor sometimes
teaches the predecessor.

489
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,784
What?

490
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,494
Are you saying that to me?

491
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,497
That's how things are for me right now.

492
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,999
We'll see you at the court.

493
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,751
Salute.

494
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,810
Why do you think
Corporal Kim Han-yong shot you?

495
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,186
I think

496
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,772
it's because he's his family.

497
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,110
I'm sure he wanted to let his anger out

498
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,446
after he saw his brother being half-dead.

499
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,283
And I became his target.

500
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,036
It's all my fault.

501
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,246
If only I brought Company Commander

502
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,707
out of that minefield in a good condition.

503
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,628
I have a sensitive question for you.

504
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,255
You have to live with a disability now.

505
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,425
Don't you regret going into the minefield?

506
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,927
Regret.

507
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,679
I regret it so much, yes.

508
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,307
I regret that I couldn't do a better job.

509
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,353
But I never regret

510
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,772
going into the minefield.

511
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,401
Let's take a break.

512
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,701
-Yes, thank you so much for today.
-You did so much today.

513
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,495
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

514
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,080
-Cheer up, Commander.
-Thank you.

515
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,917
-Cheer up.
-Yes, goodbye, thank you.

516
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,335
Thank you.

517
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,513
Military Prosecutor, as you know,

518
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,640
this case is

519
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,686
drawing a lot of attention
from the public, right?

520
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,522
As much as it's drawing attention
from the public,

521
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,941
I will investigate it
strictly and thoroughly.

522
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,984
Yes.

523
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,279
By the way, why did he shoot me?

524
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,702
-Did you find out about his motive?
-What do you think his motive was?

525
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,412
Please give an honest answer,
not a broadcast answer.

526
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,706
How should I know?

527
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,499
I saved his brother,

528
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,501
and he repaid me like this.

529
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,421
Do you wish for leniency?

530
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,382
Leniency?

531
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,592
It'll be applied
to the sentencing I request.

532
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,219
If you write a petition?

533
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,389
How can you mention leniency
after seeing my leg?

534
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,349
You're a military prosecutor!

535
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,935
Whether he fired live ammunition
or blank ammunition,

536
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,854
he fired a gun at his superior!

537
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,273
This is serious treason!

538
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,402
Kim Han-yong must be
punished to the maximum!

539
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,279
Get it?

540
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,697
Leaking military secrets

541
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,825
is serious treason of selling the nation.

542
00:33:55,908 --> 00:34:00,288
CEO Cha Ho-chul must be
punished to the maximum!

543
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,790
You don't need to worry.

544
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,460
Just as you want,

545
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,421
I will make sure that this case serves as

546
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,798
a clear example.

547
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,759
Good.

548
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,219
I'll see you at the court.

549
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,680
Okay, bye.

550
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,452
Well…

551
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,039
How's his condition?

552
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,793
First aid was done quickly,
so it's not fatal.

553
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,130
According to the CT scan, the fragments
of the mine are stuck in his brain,

554
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,007
but we didn't remove them.

555
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,551
Because removing them forcefully
can be more dangerous.

556
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,974
He's actually really lucky.

557
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,982
Is he lucky because it's not any worse?

558
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,198
These two brothers
love each other very much.

559
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,451
Their parents passed away early,
so they were each other's only family

560
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,829
and the older one was
like a father figure too.

561
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,331
Keeping something familiar by your side,

562
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,126
is one of the delirium therapy methods.

563
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,798
He kept trying to escape
despite his arms and legs being tied up.

564
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,051
Looks like he couldn't avoid brain damage.

565
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,427
He can't recognize people,

566
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,930
and he kept saying that
he has to go somewhere.

567
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,641
He's not in a condition
to live a normal life.

568
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,521
LATE CHA HO-CHUL

569
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:02,493
I don't want to defend Kim Han-yong,
but I think I'll go crazy too

570
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,372
if something like that happens
happens to my family overnight.

571
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,672
Why didn't you report about
Division Commander's visit to our office?

572
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,509
We didn't because we knew
you'd react like that.

573
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,555
She was just here to encourage us,
so don't worry.

574
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,599
Are you sure she was
here for encouragement?

575
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,934
You didn't make any mistakes
to her, did you?

576
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,312
No, not as far as I know.

577
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,607
Then why did she call me?

578
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,276
But she ordered us to strictly
punish Trainee Noh Tae-nam.

579
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,028
Strictly… strictly punish?

580
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,614
Strictly punish her own son?

581
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,908
Wow, she is incredible.

582
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,203
She is a scary woman…
I mean, a mother, right?

583
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,496
Seeing Division Commander and Cha Woo-in

584
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,624
shows that servicewomen are more ruthless.

585
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,083
They have no blood or tears.

586
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:56,088
I never thought I'd work
in the military with such ruthless women.

587
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,051
And there's that guy.

588
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,470
That jerk who fired a gun
at the hero of mines.

589
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,598
Not a single day when I can be at peace.

590
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,350
You're saying that again.

591
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,813
-Salute.
-Salute.

592
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,273
At ease.

593
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,527
This is the list of companies that
committed corruption in military supply,

594
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,863
but got covered up without
being taken care of.

595
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,991
Report the civilians to
the investigation bureau,

596
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,953
and strictly apply the law
to the servicepeople

597
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,330
and make them resign or cuff them.

598
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,501
I'm going to watch and see
what you're capable of.

599
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,630
I will carry this out with determination
to cut out rotten flesh!

600
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,258
And Captain Doh Bae-man.

601
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,343
Captain Doh Bae-man.

602
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,136
You need to go somewhere with me.

603
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,429
Follow me.

604
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,106
MYEONGSE CONSTRUCTION

605
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,948
MYEONGSE CONSTRUCTION'S PLANS
IN DISTRICT UNITS

606
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,034
Can I ask you why we're here?

607
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,872
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

608
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,333
She's here.

609
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,219
I'm sure you got the report
on the opinion of the fourth division.

610
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,554
You can't do this!

611
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,181
We made all of the residents move,

612
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,641
and now we only have to dig.

613
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,103
How can you cancel the plan
to build the hotel so suddenly like this?

614
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,065
Us at city hall already
approved this project as well.

615
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,612
We made an agreement
with the previous Division Commander.

616
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,324
And you're going to turn the table now?

617
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,908
But for some reason,

618
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,038
there was no contract
or document about the agreement.

619
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,000
Captain Doh Bae-man.

620
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,835
Captain Doh Bae-man.

621
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:01,630
Explain the legal problems
of building a hotel

622
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,258
in a military area
as a military prosecutor.

623
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,765
According to Article 13 of the Protection
of Military Bases and Installations Act,

624
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,934
it's impossible to build
any new buildings without permission

625
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,313
from the Minister of National Defense or
the commander of the jurisdictional unit.

626
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,191
Especially, the defense bastion
of the fourth division near it

627
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,735
is a key fortress of defense
in the outer area of Seoul.

628
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,407
So if five buildings of rental-type
hotels, 172m in height, are built,

629
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:32,703
the entire defense bastion
will be surrounded, and it'll be useless.

630
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,166
I'm sure you know better than I do
because you've been dealing

631
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,834
with the Construction Act,

632
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,796
but there are two things you can
never defeat in development projects.

633
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,131
Cultural heritages and military bases.

634
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,219
The law doesn't excuse you
just because you didn't know.

635
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,721
But I'm sure that you knew.

636
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,726
Don't build the whole thing and tear it
down after the petition is signed.

637
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,230
It'll be better to review it
by going back to the starting point now.

638
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,484
Did you hear
what our military prosecutor said?

639
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,490
As long as I'm here, the opinion of
the fourth division will not change.

640
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,786
Division Commander!

641
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,668
If you do this,
it's going to cause you trouble.

642
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,837
Can you deal with it?

643
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,427
Are you threatening me
in front of a military prosecutor?

644
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,976
I'm sorry, Division Commander.

645
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,069
This is complicated.

646
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,780
When can I finish all of these?

647
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,706
Salute.

648
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,586
Salute.

649
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,713
Cha Woo-in.

650
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,089
Yes, sir.

651
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,675
Show me your fingernails.

652
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,845
-What?
-I heard that

653
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,848
there are servicewomen with
no sense of discipline who dress up,

654
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:20,102
wear makeup, and get their nails done.
Show me your fingernails.

655
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,567
I knew it!

656
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,986
Peach-colored nail polish!

657
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,448
It isn't.

658
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,994
Wow, you escape everything so well?

659
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,454
You're so lucky.

660
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,873
Staff Judge Advocate.

661
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,667
Do you still only see me
as a servicewoman?

662
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,545
I'm working hard as a serviceperson

663
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,298
and doing my best
to perform as a military prosecutor,

664
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,425
but I just got checked randomly,
which isn't done to servicemen.

665
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,927
I think this is very unfair.

666
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,346
Why should I always prove
that servicewomen are not

667
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,764
different from servicemen?

668
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,517
Well, that's because…

669
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,185
You know.

670
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,023
This isn't an unfair or
a random check or whatever.

671
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,151
I'm saying that there's
discrimination toward servicewomen,

672
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:13,405
so servicemen should
get their nails done too…

673
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,661
Gosh, servicewomen are so scary!

674
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,830
This is why I'm not getting married!

675
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,166
And why is there so much to do?

676
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,751
When can I finish all of these?

677
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,215
I didn't tell you anything,

678
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,217
but you did quite well, Captain Doh.

679
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,013
Are you going to stop everything
the previous Division Commander did?

680
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,686
Do you think I'm here to pick up the mess
my predecessor made?

681
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,064
I didn't mean that.

682
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,150
Those jerks are
not thinking of war at all.

683
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,653
So they build hotels in front of the base

684
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:57,199
and construct 100-story skyscrapers
to make the runway go around.

685
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,122
So how's the trial
for Battalion Commander Won going?

686
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,834
Captain Cha Woo-in is investigating
the reason Kim Han-yong fired a gun.

687
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,253
The reason he fired a gun?

688
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,799
In order to punish someone,
we must find the cause of the case first.

689
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,886
A military prosecutor is taking
the suspect's side to look into the case?

690
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,139
Prosecutors aren't on anyone's side,

691
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,141
whether they are superiors
or subordinates.

692
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,893
This case is about a soldier
shooting a commander.

693
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,898
The vilest crime that destroys
the military from its roots is mutiny.

694
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,068
That is absolutely unacceptable
at my division.

695
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,446
But you're looking for the reason?

696
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,865
Did you bring me here

697
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,743
to get involved in the investigation
and order the guideline?

698
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,454
Watch your mouth, Captain Doh Bae-man.

699
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,456
What Kim Han-yong did is mutiny,

700
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,000
but the most important thing
for us, the military prosecution,

701
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,669
is to find out the truth.
That's what I'm telling you.

702
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,297
I'm going to watch

703
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,549
how all of you do it.

704
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,849
THE PLAN TO BUILD A HOTEL CANCELED
DUE TO OPPOSITION BY THE MILITARY

705
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,942
How dare you come here!

706
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,194
THE PLAN TO BUILD A HOTEL CANCELED
DUE TO OPPOSITION BY THE MILITARY

707
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,738
I'm sorry, Minister.

708
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,406
I couldn't call you beforehand.

709
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,079
You did this, Hwa-young?

710
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,914
I know that you got money from that

711
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,416
through the previous
Division Commander as well.

712
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,836
So I cut it off.

713
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,755
You cut it off?

714
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,091
That sounds peculiar.

715
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,302
That bullet, which made you the minister,

716
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,014
will eventually pierce your heart.

717
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,684
What did you say?

718
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,687
Are you trying to
rule over me now, you jerk?

719
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,857
I thought hard about
how to make you feel better

720
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,443
after my son's incident,
and made this decision.

721
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,487
I will do my very best

722
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,032
to be your shield, Minister.

723
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,955
So you stepped forward

724
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,083
and stopped that, for me?

725
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,173
From now on,
rows of suspects of corruption

726
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,968
in military supply will be
arrested by the fourth division.

727
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,639
You're going to start
renovating the military,

728
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,142
which wasn't done by anyone else.

729
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,440
I wasn't scared of anything
when I was a serviceperson,

730
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,276
but after I got into politics,

731
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:43,073
I'm now scared about
who might shoot me, like you said.

732
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,703
I will protect you, Minister.

733
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:53,542
I've been walking the path
you have created until now.

734
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,919
From now on,

735
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,923
I'm going to start making
the path for you.

736
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,188
I never

737
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,607
abandon someone on my side.

738
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,860
You know it, right?

739
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,375
Won Ki-choon, that loser
who doesn't even have military spirit

740
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,170
might get the order
before I do, Hwa-young.

741
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:43,383
Even the world of politics
is waiting for him to retire.

742
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,011
This is just madness.

743
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,057
I'll relay that to Lieutenant Colonel Won.
He'll be very happy.

744
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,685
When a war breaks out,
he'll use his subordinates as shields

745
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,604
from bullets and hide first.

746
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,232
And a guy like him went into a minefield

747
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,025
to save a subordinate?

748
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,154
That's so ridiculous
even a dog would laugh.

749
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,405
Good grief.

750
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,699
Life sure is interesting.

751
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,713
I never abandon someone on my side.

752
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,466
You know it, right?

753
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,638
I'm sure he can't throw out someone
he has thrown out before again.

754
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,781
-Salute.
-Salute.

755
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,992
What is it?

756
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,577
The Division Commander wants to see you.

757
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,299
I'm sure he found out something.

758
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,135
What?

759
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,803
Who are you talking about?

760
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,265
Kim Han-yong.

761
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,683
That brat who shot you.

762
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,562
I don't know how he found out,

763
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,106
but I'm sure that he knows something.

764
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,274
He…

765
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,486
What are you talking about?

766
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,621
Did you forget everything
while playing the hero?

767
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,629
I'm talking about how you shot
his brother, you stupid bastard!

768
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,555
The trial will begin soon,

769
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,893
and when the truth gets revealed,
your heroic tale will end too.

770
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,562
Please save me, Division Commander!

771
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,230
And I'm going to kill you.

772
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,857
Just give me orders.

773
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,361
I'll… I'll do everything.

774
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,863
Yes.

775
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,574
You must do everything.

776
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,520
CEO YONG MOON-GOO

777
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,160
The investigators
are going to storm in soon.

778
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,830
You must leave first

779
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,457
so you won't be humiliated
in front of your employees.

780
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,043
I'll do that for you.

781
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,922
Prosecutor Yong Moon-goo.

782
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,801
I did not commit any of those charges
you indicted me for.

783
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,554
What's your reason for trying
to frame me for these crimes?

784
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,347
MY DAUGHTER

785
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,977
What can you even gain
by destroying my company?

786
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,897
All of this

787
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,358
was ordered by Noh Hwa-young, right?

788
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,491
Take him to the back door.

789
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,493
Mr. Cha Ho-chul, let's go.

790
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,026
CEO YONG MOON-GOO

791
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,718
Following Cha Ho-chul and Noh Tae-nam,

792
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,179
I'm the third owner of this office now.

793
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,932
Though I'm just a puppet now,

794
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,351
soon…

795
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:48,063
IM Defense Industry will be mine for real.

796
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,826
What can you even gain
by destroying my company?

797
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,539
All of this

798
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,791
was ordered by Noh Hwa-young, right?

799
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,301
Come on.

800
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,391
Dad!

801
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,060
Never lower your guard.

802
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,437
You never know
when or how you'll be attacked.

803
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,400
Wow, you really are different
from other dads.

804
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,319
Again.

805
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,580
This time, you got punched.

806
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,419
Woo-in, you're good enough
to be an actual boxer.

807
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,174
Dad, shall I quit law school?

808
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,218
I'll still be fighting anyway.

809
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,680
You can't quit that!

810
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,831
I have something to show you.

811
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,708
Is it a big catch?

812
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,377
It's so big that
it can break the fishing rod.

813
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,131
You know I can't stand
being curious about something, right?

814
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,966
Bring it to the office of justice now.

815
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,217
Yes, sir.

816
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,596
Cha Woo-in, are you nuts?

817
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,599
A military prosecutor
installed a secret camera?

818
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,853
And I became his target.

819
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,443
It's all my fault.

820
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,196
Even if you're blinded by vengeance…

821
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,448
Please watch this first
before you say anything.

822
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,868
What's the point of watching illegal
evidence we can't use at the trial?

823
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,579
You got me all excited.

824
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,039
Then don't watch it.

825
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,666
It's my trial, anyway.

826
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,464
If you don't get rid of this habit,
you'll be in trouble. I'm telling you…

827
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,763
Hey, this is…

828
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,565
This footage was taken
before he left the hospital.

829
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,943
So he's been acting all this time?

830
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,322
Let's interrogate
Battalion Commander Won now

831
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,116
and re-investigate the mine incident.

832
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,033
No.

833
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,535
Why not?

834
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,329
If we indict him now,
he will get ready for it.

835
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,417
We will really hurt him
when he has his guard down,

836
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,043
totally immersed in playing a hero.

837
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:01,631
It's powerful evidence to smash
his play about being the hero of mines.

838
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,300
That completely fine leg of his.

839
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,885
NOW IN SESSION

840
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,971
THE FIRST TRIAL
FOR THE SHOOTING ATTACK

841
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,973
ON SEARCH BATTALION COMMANDER
WON KI-CHOON

842
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:17,188
I'll show the end of a fake hero
in front of everyone.

843
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,163
DOH BAE-MAN

844
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,208
It's me, Doh Bae-man.

845
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,461
Where are you?
Why aren't you at the trial?

846
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,006
You know that you're neither
interested in this trial

847
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,549
nor capable of being a part of it, right?

848
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,760
What? Do you wish to get killed?

849
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,053
Come here, now!

850
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,264
I'll send you a few pictures
before I get killed,

851
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,766
so please check them out before we talk.

852
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,906
You were late
to Kim Han-yong's interrogation

853
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,908
because you were
at the golf course, right?

854
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:13,119
How many times
did you skip trials to play golf?

855
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,498
And you always got paid
for your activities illegally.

856
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,542
Do you even remember
that I was the one who worked

857
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,628
on the Imperial Military Service case
of Gusan Bank's president's son?

858
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,048
I'm thinking of making a sequel
about Imperial Military Lawyer.

859
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,883
Shall I make it, or not?

860
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,345
Hey, what do you want from me?

861
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:33,223
You understood right away.

862
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,142
From now on, plead in the court

863
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,478
exactly as I tell you,
and don't change anything.

864
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,773
-What?
-Be my avatar in court.

865
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,276
I'll make you a star military lawyer.

866
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,573
There's a wireless earphone
under the desk.

867
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,325
Do the pairing.

868
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,831
Military Lawyer, how long are you
going to be on the phone?

869
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,582
Aren't you going to plead?

870
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,668
Okay.

871
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,597
Witness, you saved
Corporal Kim Han-yong's brother,

872
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,016
the Company Commander…

873
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,562
Witness, you saved
Corporal Kim Han-yong's brother,

874
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,730
the Company Commander…

875
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,650
but we heard that your heroic tale
is different from the truth.

876
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,279
Your Honor, this is unrelated
to this case.

877
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,322
This is an important point
from which we can find out

878
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,782
the motive behind the defendant's crime.

879
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,410
Where did you hear about
that tabloid gossip from?

880
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,121
That's not true.

881
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,622
Witness, please be quiet.

882
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,379
Prosecutor, what do you think?

883
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:50,592
I will not answer a question
that's clearly fiction written by you.

884
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,761
For some reason, I, the defense attorney,

885
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,139
think it's getting
more and more suspicious.

886
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,724
What does that mean?

887
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,227
This is an important trial that's
drawing attention from the public.

888
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,440
This is an important trial that's
drawing attention from the public.

889
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,486
As much as the fact that the defendant
shot the Search Battalion Commander…

890
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:14,616
the questions on the hero of mines
must be answered too, Your Honor.

891
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,535
Are you insulting the witness,

892
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,745
who sacrificed himself?

893
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,334
"If a prosecutor found evidence
that's advantageous

894
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,086
to the defendant during
the investigation and trial…"

895
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,257
"If a prosecutor found evidence
that's advantageous

896
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,135
to the defendant during
the investigation and trial,

897
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,472
he or she must submit it to the court
for the benefit of the defendant."

898
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:40,850
Precedent 2001 TA 23447
from the Supreme Court.

899
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,771
Shall I add something?

900
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,233
A military prosecutor is
neither a punisher

901
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,860
nor a defender of someone.

902
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,196
He or she is the guardian of the law

903
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,949
in this military court
who reveals the truth.

904
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,750
Military Prosecutor, did you investigate

905
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,169
on the Battalion Commander as well
while preparing for the trial?

906
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,381
I did.

907
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,633
I, the judge, think that

908
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,386
the military gets stronger
when the servicepeople are honest.

909
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,764
What do you think, Military Prosecutor?

910
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,641
I agree.

911
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,355
Then I'll speak of what I know.

912
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,364
Yes.

913
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,200
It's a solo performance from now on,
Cha Woo-in.

914
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,747
The day of the mine accident
was extremely foggy,

915
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,083
so it wasn't a good day for a search.

916
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,211
But due to Search Battalion
Commander Won Ki-choon's decision,

917
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,462
it was pushed forward.

918
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,673
Look here, female military prosecutor!

919
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,218
War breaks out unexpectedly.

920
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,555
War doesn't get canceled
just because it's rainy or foggy.

921
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,682
If you don't know the environment
during an operation at the DMZ,

922
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,059
then just be quiet.

923
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:09,230
Even though you're saying that,
there's no record of you

924
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:12,108
going for search and patrol on days
with bad weather during your service.

925
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,194
Here's the evidence.

926
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,407
What the heck? There's none.

927
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,410
SEARCH AND PATROL INCOMPLETE:
WEATHER ISSUES

928
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,414
That location gets foggy quite often.

929
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,542
Once it gets foggy,
it's hard to identify friends or foes.

930
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,754
You can't even tell if the soldier walking
in front of you is a friend or a foe,

931
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,506
or a wild water deer.

932
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,717
If a friendly fire occurs,

933
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,470
things can get worse,

934
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,597
so you don't go on
search and patrols at all.

935
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,642
And are you still going to use war
as an excuse?

936
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,436
What was the reason

937
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,689
you made an exception
and went on a search on that day?

938
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,653
There wasn't any reason.

939
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,407
The second question is,

940
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,118
why did you go into the minefield area?

941
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,164
This is the report from the joint
investigation team of the IV Corps.

942
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,749
The estimated number of mines

943
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,628
scattered in the DMZ
from the Korean War is about two million.

944
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:17,215
The DMZ is the place
with the highest mine density on Earth.

945
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,093
So everyone must only take
the designated path.

946
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,806
But the location of the accident
wasn't on the path with guaranteed safety.

947
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,933
It was this minefield.

948
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,477
Witness.

949
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,356
Why did you divert from the search road
and enter the minefield?

950
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:38,069
I can take that path with my eyes closed.

951
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:42,073
If it was a safe road,
then the mine wouldn't have exploded.

952
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,785
Unless the mine had feet
and walked around.

953
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,418
This is the last question.

954
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,461
Witness.

955
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,755
How did you

956
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,508
get out of the minefield?

957
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,012
I told you, I crawled out.

958
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:05,930
Crawled?

959
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,766
So you carried the company commander,
who weighs 80 kg,

960
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,270
and crawled on the pressure-sensitive
mines with your entire body?

961
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,646
And you even

962
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,773
lost one leg, but you crawled out,

963
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:19,235
enduring all that pain?

964
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,909
You and this trial

965
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,078
are insulting me, the hero of mines.

966
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,790
Military Prosecutor,
you will receive retribution for this.

967
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,668
How dare you mention
ridiculous rumors at a trial?

968
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,900
You bastards! Who do you think you are?

969
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,234
Are you kidding me?

970
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,366
What the heck?

971
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,910
What do you think you're doing?

972
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,955
We will re-investigate
the mine explosion accident

973
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,999
in the DMZ completely.

974
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,126
-Arrest him.
-Yes, sir.

975
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,713
You bastards!

976
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,215
Let go!

977
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,425
How dare you touch me!

978
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,845
The military prosecution
has crucial evidence.

979
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,514
Just come with us quietly.

980
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,600
We cannot show you any more respect.

981
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,269
What?

982
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,854
Evidence?

983
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,565
Go bring it then! Bring it!

984
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,570
Can I show it right now then?

985
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:51,661
Now, I'll show you the evidence

986
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,539
of a play by a fake hero.

987
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,016
You bastard!

988
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,352
Just how much more
are you going to humiliate me?

989
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,646
Do you think you'll be able to
get away with this?

990
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,587
-That really is a prosthetic leg.
-What is going on?

991
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,048
-That really is a prosthetic leg.
-It is a real prosthetic leg.

992
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,386
Hey, you bastard!

993
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,222
Is this what you wanted to find out?

994
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,450
General Noh is here!

995
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,080
I will take complete responsibility
for this case.

996
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,208
The Doh Bae-man I know wouldn't do that
without concrete physical evidence.

997
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,960
-Don't you know how I am?
-From now on,

998
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,878
I'll tell you the clues unofficially.

999
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,798
Now, I'll do my work as a civilian,
not as a serviceperson.

1000
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,800
From now on, work like you're my shadow.

1001
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,802
The truth is still hidden.

1002
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,263
There's someone else
who's looking for that medical officer.

1003
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,557
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

1004
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,142
Maybe we're dealing with

1005
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,645
a monster that's even
worse than our imagination.

1006
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:31,362
