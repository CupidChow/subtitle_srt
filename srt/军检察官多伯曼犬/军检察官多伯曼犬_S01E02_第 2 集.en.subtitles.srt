1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,339
-Dad.
-Yes?

5
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,594
Why is our company named IM?

6
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,849
I named it after you, my daughter.

7
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,102
But my name is Woo-in.

8
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,729
What?

9
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,609
Woo-in, what are your initials in English?

10
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,612
W and I.

11
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,116
That's right. Now, let's see.

12
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,742
Here.

13
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,870
Woo-in, your initials

14
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,666
are W and…

15
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,335
I.

16
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,546
-Is that right?
-Yes.

17
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,839
Turn it upside down.

18
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,552
Ta-da!

19
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,180
Wow! Dad, you're the best!

20
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,600
Yes. Now, if you do this…

21
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,562
It's Woo-in, right?

22
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,896
And if you do this…

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,899
-Your company's name. IM.
-That's right.

24
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,001
I love you, my dear.

25
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,840
How did you draw it?

26
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,260
You drew it very well.

27
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,013
Your company is big.

28
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,640
IM shines so brightly.

29
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,817
Cha Woo-in…

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,820
She definitely is suspicious.

31
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,700
Wouldn't IM Defense Industry come before

32
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,953
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in for now?

33
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,164
IM?

34
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,125
-You mean Noh Tae-nam's company?
-Yes.

35
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,795
I can't stand being curious
about something, just like you,

36
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,839
so I looked into it a bit.

37
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,598
IM Defense Industry
was founded 30 years ago,

38
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,391
and it was a defense SME.

39
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,561
In other words, it was
a cream-of-the-crop SME at the time,

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,521
and it was well-known in the industry.

41
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,442
Now, it has more areas of business,
not only defense, but also aircrafts,

42
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,945
engines, robots, security systems,
and so on.

43
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,571
It grew vastly in scale.

44
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,284
If the defense is its main business,
is it connected to the military too?

45
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,577
Yes, it is.

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,747
Mr. Noh Tae-nam's mother is…

47
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,042
General Noh Hwa-young.

48
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,462
The heroine who broke the glass ceiling.

49
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,840
The first female two-star general
in the history of Korea's military.

50
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,426
They say she kills people
with her gaze, not with a gun.

51
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,179
She truly is scary.

52
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,807
So his mother is General Noh Hwa-young.

53
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,228
This is interesting.

54
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,983
But how could a young jerk
like Noh Tae-nam serve as the CEO?

55
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,697
This once-stable company suddenly was
revealed to have leaked military secrets,

56
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,324
manipulating the market price,
and embezzlement,

57
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,287
so its stock price hit rock bottom,
and the former CEO was arrested.

58
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,123
-Did he fall for the plan?
-Yes.

59
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,375
The company was raided
by a hedge fund group

60
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,752
that short sells stocks,
so it was in legal management.

61
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,798
So at that time, IM Defense Industry
was purchased at a low price.

62
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,634
-And that person is--
-Noh Tae-nam?

63
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,847
Yes, but there's a rumor about him
just being a front man.

64
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,934
It means someone's behind him.

65
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,023
What about the former CEO?
What happened after he lost his company?

66
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,152
The story gets strange from this point on.

67
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,157
CEO CHA HO-CHUL
WAS IN A MYSTERIOUS ACCIDENT

68
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,375
Something bad happened
to CEO Cha Ho-chul who was standing trial.

69
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,961
CEO CHA OF IM DEFENSE INDUSTRY
DIED AFTER A CAR ACCIDENT

70
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,048
CEO Cha Ho-chul died
at the scene of the accident

71
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,425
and a family member
in the passenger seat got badly injured,

72
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
and they're unconscious.

73
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,553
And?

74
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,929
What's strange about that?

75
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,641
The prosecutor who was in charge
of this case was

76
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,518
Lawyer Yong Moon-goo.

77
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,606
If the verdict changes
just because he's rich,

78
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,234
then the law, which should be fair
to everyone, becomes useless.

79
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,279
We, the prosecution,
promise that we will strictly punish

80
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,033
Cha Ho-chul, the defendant, for deepening
the people's distrust in the law.

81
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,868
Are all of your corruption scandals true?

82
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,328
Do you admit everything?

83
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,457
It was a hot issue because Prosecutor Yong
was just a young regular prosecutor,

84
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,708
and he caught a big fish.

85
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,710
Noh Tae-nam and Yong Moon-goo…

86
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,257
That's the same method I used
to get rid of the president of Gusan Bank.

87
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,884
The method?

88
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,094
One.

89
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,930
There's a business enemy
you must get rid of.

90
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,891
Two. Make up a false charge
and frame that enemy.

91
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,311
Three. Ruin their reputation in society
before the trial begins.

92
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,354
Four.

93
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:42,026
Noh Tae-nam takes the position
and Yong Moon-goo benefits from that.

94
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,948
That's right. Yong Moon-goo
established Law and One

95
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,034
as soon as he quit working
as a prosecutor.

96
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,828
Noh Tae-nam established it for him.

97
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,330
He helped him get that whole company.

98
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,735
By the way,

99
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,239
why do you find Military Prosecutor
Cha Woo-in so suspicious?

100
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,490
4TH INFANTRY DIVISION

101
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,658
A hunch.

102
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,162
A hunch that has been
deeply imprinted in my bones.

103
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,459
It's an aftereffect of being concerned
about others since I was very young.

104
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,919
I got trained without realizing it.

105
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,507
I don't know what it is,

106
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,302
but I feel like there's something.

107
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,183
Doubts mean

108
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,019
trust has started.

109
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,402
If you pass through the long,
dark tunnel of doubt,

110
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,239
doubt turns into strong trust.

111
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,744
Even the sturdiest tower of trust

112
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,830
breaks like a glass

113
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,292
once a crack called doubt forms.

114
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,962
And those broken shards

115
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,298
turn into blades.

116
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,552
SE-NA

117
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,347
-Woo-in.
-Se-na, how are you feeling?

118
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,849
I have a favor to ask.

119
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,101
I'll be at the hospital soon.

120
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,651
A FEW DAYS AGO

121
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,487
Se-na.

122
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,242
I couldn't…

123
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,288
call my family. I could only call you.

124
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,336
It's okay.

125
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,839
It will be okay.

126
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,258
I'm here,

127
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,468
so it will be okay.

128
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,855
Hi, I'm Detective Doh Soo-kyung
of Violent Crimes Team 1.

129
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,983
I'm Cha Woo-in.

130
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,151
Can you please tell me
about what happened?

131
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,072
According to Ms. Han Se-na's statement,
she claims to have been raped.

132
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,286
Did Se-na identify the assailant?

133
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,579
Not yet.

134
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,164
I think she knows who it is,
but she is afraid.

135
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,166
Anything else?

136
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,503
It seems like she was drugged

137
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,132
and it took place in a club
in Gangnam called Cartel.

138
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,970
-Did you say Cartel?
-Yes.

139
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,934
Se-na said you're her friend.
And that you're a prosecutor.

140
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,686
I'm a military prosecutor.

141
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,731
Military prosecutor? In which division--

142
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,858
Let's have Se-na hospitalized first.

143
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,777
Yes. If you give us
the contact info of the hospital--

144
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,946
I'll call you again.

145
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,490
Okay.

146
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
Se-na.

147
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,067
I think I did something I shouldn't have.

148
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,818
Calling the police, I mean.

149
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,782
I'm in a video.

150
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,702
Those bastards recorded a video
with a phone.

151
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,999
What should I do now?
What if they blackmail me with it?

152
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,711
What if they upload it online?

153
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,589
It drives me crazy just thinking about it.

154
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,345
Se-na.

155
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,019
Woo-in, let me ask you a favor.

156
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,147
You're a military prosecutor, right?

157
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,318
If we say you're a prosecutor,
wouldn't they be scared too?

158
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,286
I have

159
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,747
that video.

160
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,084
What?

161
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,877
No one can watch that video.

162
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,463
I didn't even tell the police yet.

163
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,050
How come you have that video?

164
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,969
It's difficult to tell you that just yet.

165
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,388
I'll tell you when the time comes.

166
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,318
What's important now
is that we need this video,

167
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,362
for you and for me.

168
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,740
For you too?

169
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,951
The trial cannot start without this.

170
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,499
But it's your decision.

171
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,129
If you want to keep it hidden
so no one knows,

172
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,715
or if you want to make them pay
for what they did.

173
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,183
I just want to keep it hidden.

174
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,186
I don't even want to recall it ever again.

175
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,107
Okay.

176
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,029
If that's your decision,
then let's go with that.

177
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,490
If I don't make a problem out of it,

178
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,993
then they will leave me alone, right?

179
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,788
I'll protect you.

180
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,791
Don't worry.

181
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,634
Idol singer Alan's concert,
which was scheduled for tomorrow,

182
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,469
has been cancelled.

183
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,804
His agency revealed that Alan

184
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,682
has suddenly gone off the grid
and has disappeared.

185
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,559
And as the fans' complaints poured in…

186
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,327
-Hello?
-Have you seen the news?

187
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,037
The news?

188
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,914
Alan has disappeared.

189
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,847
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

190
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,312
The call cannot be connected…

191
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,855
What's wrong with this bastard?

192
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,656
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

193
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,496
Are you still unable to get a hold of him?

194
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,206
He's not answering.

195
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
You know that bastard ghosts all the time.

196
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,712
His stress levels exploded
with his concert coming up.

197
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,047
He did ghost often,

198
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,925
but still, he always answered your calls.

199
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,178
That's true. He knows how I am.

200
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,723
It means he didn't go hide.

201
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,269
Something happened
at Cartel that day, right?

202
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,314
Why are you bringing up Cartel?

203
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,733
It has nothing to do with that place.

204
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,198
I've always been preventing
all of your troubles

205
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,075
before they happened.

206
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,703
No wonder I call myself
your legal bodyguard,

207
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,288
not your legal representative.

208
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,000
Solving it before it's taken
to court is my way of solving it.

209
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,841
No wonder you were a prosecutor
of the special branch.

210
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,593
You really know how to push people.

211
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,763
I liked it when you did it
to take care of things,

212
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,974
but it makes me feel like crap
to have you do it to me.

213
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,270
It has something to do with
that female college student, doesn't it?

214
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,947
Did you

215
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,949
record a video again?

216
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,952
Just how much of my private life
do I need to reveal?

217
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,798
Hey, you got a scratch on your face.

218
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,925
What?

219
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,515
Hey, are you crazy?

220
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,147
Hey. Your idol star's concert
is just around the corner.

221
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,150
How could you scratch his face
and call yourself a fan?

222
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,736
How can you call yourself Alan's fan?
You crazy wench!

223
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,156
That hurts.

224
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,366
But that's…

225
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,579
Get that off me!

226
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,750
Hey, look at her face.

227
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,128
Give me your phone.
This has to be recorded.

228
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,589
Damn it.

229
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,427
-Are you recording it?
-Yes.

230
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,230
Did you record it
with Alan's phone on purpose?

231
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,816
You told me not to leave anything
on my phone,

232
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,526
and you always nag me about that.

233
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,572
You shouldn't have started it
from the beginning.

234
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,035
Are you happy now? I told you everything.

235
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,370
Now you take care of it.

236
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,840
So Alan disappeared with the video.

237
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,052
I'll find Alan first.

238
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,804
Tell him to look for him.

239
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,434
Who are you referring to?

240
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,020
That military guy who dealt
with "Imperial Military Service".

241
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:43,979
He's good.

242
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,359
Why?

243
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,986
No?

244
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,116
A military prosecutor
is still a prosecutor.

245
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,620
It won't be good if Doh Bae-man
is deeply involved with

246
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,829
your private life.

247
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,831
So do it.

248
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,129
I have something I want him
to do for me soon.

249
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,547
About my private life.

250
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,302
Sixty-seven.

251
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,221
Lift your arms.

252
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,265
Put your arms down.

253
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,018
It's 107. Your build is so…

254
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,066
And 105.

255
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,028
It will be the first work of art
after a long time.

256
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,864
When are you going to wear it?

257
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,533
I have a feeling

258
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,662
that I'm going to wear it soon,
so I'm preparing for it beforehand.

259
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,332
-I'd like your autograph--
-Hey! Oh, gosh.

260
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,209
An autograph is…

261
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,462
Why did you suddenly ask a customer
for an autograph?

263
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,464
But he's very famous.

264
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,841
Yes, Lawyer Yong.

265
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,592
Come to my office now.

266
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,469
Yes, I will.

267
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,390
CEO, LAWYER YONG MOON-GOO

268
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,602
I got here as soon as I could.
Did something urgent come up?

269
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,104
Have you heard of Alan?

270
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,815
An idol singer.

271
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,986
Alan.

272
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,363
Well, I have heard of his name.

273
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,823
He went missing.

274
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,576
Actually, we can't conclude it
as a missing case yet,

275
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,078
so let's just say he's out of reach.

276
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,833
There's a secret hangout where
he plays card games with his friends.

277
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,419
-Search that place first.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,716
Aren't you curious
why I'm telling you to find him?

279
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,551
You mean why you asked me to help you

280
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,721
instead of going to the police station
when someone's missing?

281
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,389
Yes.

282
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,642
A serviceperson only follows orders.
They do not ask back.

283
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,436
More than that…

284
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,438
No.

285
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,732
I'm not curious at all.

286
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,408
I'm dying from curiosity now, Sang-ki.

287
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,826
What is it?

288
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,746
I know you can't stand being curious,
even for one minute.

289
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,916
Dig into this idol singer named Alan.

290
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,459
Alan?

291
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,461
The one that's really popular these days?

292
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,589
Dig into his private life
and acquaintances, especially women.

293
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,175
Dig out everything
up to the past one month.

294
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,384
Yes, sir.

295
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,305
By the way,
why does your voice sound so excited?

296
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,848
That guy Alan

297
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,434
seems to be someone acquainted
with CEO Noh Tae-nam.

298
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,895
Lawyer Yong Moon-goo is hiding it,

299
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,647
but I just have a hunch about it.

300
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,649
I'll start digging into him now.

301
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,942
Salute.

302
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,984
Okay.

303
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,487
That's a total salute.

304
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,535
There was a report of a fire at night,
and it was a mess.

305
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,705
The residents evacuated
and the fire trucks came.

306
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,082
It was complete chaos.

307
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,333
Report of a fire?

308
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,711
Well, I don't know
if it was a prank or a mistake,

309
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,632
but when night-shift staff came back
after taking care of that accident--

310
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,801
All of the CCTV footage
were deleted, right?

311
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,470
Yes. Except for one spot.

312
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,930
Which spot is it?

313
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,851
It's Camera 8,
toward the corridor of the 20th floor.

314
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,395
Can I see that footage?

315
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,314
Oh, that's going to be difficult.

316
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,860
A K-Pop idol lives there so we can't do it
without a special reason.

317
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,076
You can write down the reason.

318
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,623
Blood.

319
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,884
So it's you.

320
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,844
Red hair.

321
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,819
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

322
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,073
It's a gift for my boss at work.

323
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,240
What would be good?

324
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,493
-Your boss at work?
-Yes.

325
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,121
Is he someone who's going
to be your boyfriend in the future?

326
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,665
What you said is very unpleasant.

327
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,542
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,630
I'll recommend something useful
and well-designed.

329
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,672
Okay.

330
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,265
This would be good.

331
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,398
Wait, you want me to take it?

332
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,403
This isn't a gift. It's a bribe.

333
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,032
Why would I bribe a boss
who's going to leave soon?

334
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,827
This is a thank you gift
for saving me during the interrogation.

335
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,870
I cannot stand any kind of debt.

336
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,749
Of course, you must show
your feelings through material things.

337
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,627
But hey, this isn't very…

338
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,339
I don't know what kind of style you like,
so I just picked what I like.

339
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,427
You got the style I like correct, yes.

340
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,930
I'm on my way to the shooting drill now.

341
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,932
Hey, wait, Prosecutor Cha.

342
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,101
Take your watch with you, okay?

343
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,148
Okay, she gave you a watch.

344
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,150
An expensive watch, actually.

345
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,237
This is way more than a gift
from a subordinate to a boss.

346
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,490
This is something for a future husband.
Not even a boyfriend.

347
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,076
Wait. Husband? Now what could it be?

348
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,036
Okay, let's think about it.

349
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,708
Right? You're thinking
what I'm thinking, right?

350
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,169
It tickles. It's starting
to tickle right here.

351
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,920
What is this? The beginning of love?

352
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,924
It's not the beginning of love.
It's just itching because of bad hygiene.

353
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,802
-All of a sudden?
-Hey.

354
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,387
You go wash too, okay?

355
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,014
Don't touch this.

356
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,850
Hey, Prosecutor Cha!

357
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,393
He's getting cranky.

358
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,937
That is the case. That is.

359
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,815
Cha Woo-in!

360
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,818
Where are you going?

361
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,320
You said you're going to
the shooting range.

362
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,863
I'm going to fill my quota too.

363
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,448
Yes, sir.

364
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,660
I want to give you a gift
that corresponds to that watch too.

365
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,162
What do you need?

366
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,373
If it becomes give and take,
then the gift will lose its value.

367
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,834
And I don't need anything either.

368
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,711
Really?

369
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,339
Good grief.

370
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,342
I can't see you anymore
when you get discharged.

371
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,929
I'd appreciate it if you just
wear it 24 hours and treasure it,

372
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,430
like it's a part of your body.

373
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,777
MILITARY CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

374
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,422
You know…

375
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,552
I usually don't go to places
just because I was told to come.

376
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,139
As you can see,
I can't get out of here, so…

377
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,059
Do you even know what my job is?

378
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,728
I heard that you make those
who can't understand words

379
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,731
beg us to talk things out with them.

380
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,904
You must be getting information
quite well here too.

381
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,615
But why is a man like you in here then?

382
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,830
You know who this bastard is, right?

383
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,546
Of course, I do.

384
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,800
There's a phrase, "Bulgudaecheon."

385
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,803
I don't know what that means--

386
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,139
"Bul" means "impossible"
and "cheon" means "sky."

387
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,392
It means we're such bad mortal enemies
that we can't even stand living

388
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,601
under the same sky.

389
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,437
That makes you perfect for this job.

390
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,982
Take this chance to end
the ill-fated connection between you two.

391
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,572
An ill-fated connection counts
only when it's mutual.

392
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,990
For me, I was only attacked unilaterally.

393
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,659
So it would make me resentful
if it's cleared out like that.

394
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,998
By the way, I find
this entire conversation quite unpleasant.

395
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,753
Why are you getting all edgy?
What are you about to say?

396
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,962
Kill

397
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,881
Doh Bae-man.

398
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,527
Good grief.

399
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,197
If I had a few more months
until my discharge,

400
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,282
I would have taught you
all of my know-hows.

401
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,201
You're unlucky.

402
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,953
I know. It's sad.

403
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,002
Are your reactions always so dry?

404
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,879
What?

405
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,798
To any words you hear?

406
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,221
Okay. Well, we're not going
to be in a war,

407
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
so let's approach it as a sport.

408
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,895
Posture is fundamental
for all sports, okay?

409
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,896
One.

410
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,067
Relax your upper body, and widen your feet
a bit more than your shoulder width.

411
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,906
Bend your elbows and knees
to form an isosceles triangle.

412
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,827
That's the way
to minimize the shaking of the muzzle

413
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,162
and absorb the recoil from the shot.

414
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,789
That's right.

415
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,835
And the second thing
is the most important.

416
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,297
Imagine someone and make them stand there.

417
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,801
Someone you want to shoot right now.

418
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,688
Now shoot.

419
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,963
Wait.

420
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,817
Kill

421
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,943
Doh Bae-man.

422
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,657
People will hear you.

423
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,825
Don't be scared.

424
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,162
This isn't like some private jail.

425
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,043
Even so,

426
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,378
how am I supposed to kill a prosecutor?

427
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,506
Just take care of this matter.

428
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,800
If you do, you can form
a connection with me.

429
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,635
Well?

430
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,513
Where do you want me to take you to, Boss?

431
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,478
Tell all of our brothers
in the group chat to gather up.

432
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,855
All of them?

433
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,652
Yes. Okay, sir.

434
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,619
I was able to confirm that Alan
was at the hangout with his friends.

435
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,206
All of his friends who played cards
with him are out of reach too.

436
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,584
I checked all of the CCTVs,
but everything was deleted,

437
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,838
so I got this from the security room's
server and a separate camera.

438
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,430
She was the only visitor at that time.
Do you know who she is?

439
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,308
-Is this all?
-There's one more.

440
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,604
I took Alan's belongings
I collected from the scene

441
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,189
and did a DNA comparison.

442
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,362
And the result?

443
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,281
It was a bloodstain from Alan.

444
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,121
It seems to get bigger and bigger
for simply going off the grid.

445
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,207
Don't jump to conclusions.

446
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,294
Okay.

447
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,214
Just find Alan.

448
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,215
Yes, sir.

449
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,760
Well, if I collect more clues,
then the puzzle will be solved.

450
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,854
Hey.

451
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,690
-I found the location, sir.
-Which place is it?

452
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,735
Have you heard of a club called Cartel?

453
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,986
Cartel?

454
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,535
Alan was there with a woman two days ago.

455
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,205
Hey, wipe this spot right.

456
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,791
And lift the chairs to wipe under them.

457
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,254
I have some questions.

458
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,131
What is it?

459
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,800
Does Alan, the singer,
come to this club regularly?

460
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,843
Why do you ask that?

461
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:13,848
I want to find out who the woman that came
with Alan two days ago is.

462
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,059
Leave, please.

463
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,644
-Wait.
-What?

464
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,438
Aren't you the military prosecutor

465
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,357
who investigated
the "Imperial Military Service"?

466
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,568
-You recognize me?
-Of course.

467
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,904
Salute!

468
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,614
At ease.

469
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,616
Captain Doh Bae-man.

470
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,744
I served as an operation soldier
at the headquarters of 4th Division

471
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,913
and got discharged one month ago.

472
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,665
-Really?
-Yes.

473
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,001
Go away. He's a prosecutor.

474
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,507
By the way, what do you need to find out?

475
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,886
The woman who came with Alan.

476
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,971
And…

477
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,308
Did she come with him on that day too?

478
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,733
Just as I expected,
it was related to Noh Tae-nam.

479
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,362
I just need to find Alan now.

480
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,198
But where the heck is he?

481
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,320
You must suffer

482
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,239
as much as you have done.

483
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,644
Did you guys repent?

484
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,898
What?

485
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,068
What are you saying?

486
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,821
What is this place?

487
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,115
What do you think this place is?

488
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,453
This is a place you'd never go to.

489
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,621
The military.

490
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,456
What? The military?

491
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,291
What does that mean?

492
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,045
How much does this shoulder cost?

493
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,091
You had surgery for multidirectional
instability of your shoulder bone,

494
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,343
in other words, shoulder dislocation,
at a clinic in Gangnam.

495
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,719
Go! Go away!

496
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,597
Help!

497
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,016
-Help!
-How many times do you want to be beaten?

498
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,978
As much as the cost of your surgery?

499
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:10,316
Or as much as the money you'll make
during your 18 months of exemption?

500
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,692
Jeez. Hey!

501
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,991
Help!

502
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,577
What the heck?

503
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,288
-Until I come back,
-Get away! Don't come closer!

504
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,623
get some more sleep.

505
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,464
-Do a good job, will you?
-Yes, sir.

506
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,260
-Salute.
-Hey.

507
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,928
What?

508
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,224
Cha Woo-in, you…

509
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,434
Your eyebrows…

510
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,271
Is that makeup?

511
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,022
A semi-permanent tattoo?

512
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,567
Or a permanent tattoo?

513
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,195
These are my natural eyebrows.

514
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,658
Those are your natural eyebrows?
Then you pass.

515
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,538
But your hair…

516
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,541
is very delinquent.

517
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,626
If you're talking about my hairstyle,

518
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,712
it does not get in the way
with wearing my military cap,

519
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,380
so I do not think it's delinquent.

520
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,425
Captain Doh. What's Article 24

521
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,219
of Unit Management Rules established
by the Ministry of National Defense?

522
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,013
"One must not do anything
to harm military discipline,

523
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,140
such as wearing wigs or dying hair."

524
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,851
"One with short hair must not have
the hair in the back touch the collar,

525
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,479
and one with long hair must tie it or
pull it up with a hairpin or a hairnet."

526
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,772
That's what the rules say.

527
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,691
You know it well.

528
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,569
You know it so well, but look at this!

529
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,946
It's about to touch your collar.
About to touch it!

530
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,909
Are you trying to violate the rules
when you're a military prosecutor?

531
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,785
Until 1988, there was a rule

532
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,372
that servicewomen
were not allowed to give birth.

533
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,667
The military rules that are outdated
must be changed.

534
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,794
What?

535
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,798
I'm sorry. I will make her correct it.

536
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,675
I did not do anything wrong.

537
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,511
Want me to give you some advice?

538
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,305
The military

539
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,474
loves smart servicepeople,

540
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,519
but it hates smart and just servicepeople.

541
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,189
And do you know what the worst
type of a serviceperson is?

542
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,652
A smart and just servicewoman.

543
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,570
That's you.

544
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,197
Cha Woo-in.

545
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,700
Seriously.

546
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,713
How dare she talk back to her direct boss?

547
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,048
Back talking.

548
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,717
I hate that despicable
Cha Woo-in, seriously!

549
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,720
Good grief.

550
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,389
Here.

551
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,934
I'm sorry.

552
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,061
I will turn her into a true serviceperson

553
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,064
even if I have to postpone
my discharge, okay?

554
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,442
You can't do woodcarving
on a rotten piece of wood.

555
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:04,031
And a rotten piece of wood
must be discarded, okay?

556
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,201
If Cha Woo-in keeps behaving like that,

557
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,038
I'll either transfer her
or take disciplinary action.

558
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,583
Or make her get a dishonorable discharge.
I swear I'll do that. Okay?

559
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,132
That's nice.

560
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,343
Who's going to do this
when you get discharged?

561
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,724
My mom has a terrible temper, okay?

562
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,101
And a servicewoman is also…

563
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,230
They're scary. I hate it.

564
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,025
You should not speak of your thoughts
like that these days.

565
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,987
What you said to Captain Cha earlier
was quite dangerous too.

566
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,575
I don't know if this is a sign
that my military life will be ruined.

567
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,911
The new division commander
is a female general too.

568
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,747
Who is it?

569
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,206
General Noh Hwa-young.

570
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,545
She got rid of all men
in that war of stars

571
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,631
and got that position. That alone means

572
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,593
she's no ordinary woman.

573
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,932
You hate it too, right?

574
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,351
Oh, no.

575
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,019
Well…

576
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,980
you'll be discharged soon,
so you have nothing to worry about.

577
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,986
That's it! That's nice.

578
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,785
I'd appreciate it if you just
wear it 24 hours and treasure it

579
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,412
like it's a part of your body.

580
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,890
If I collect all clues about Cha Woo-in

581
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,143
then the puzzle about her
will also be solved.

582
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,896
LAWYER YONG MOON-GOO

583
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,276
Hello?

584
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,488
Two women were linked
in the process of finding Alan.

585
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,534
One is that mysterious woman
in the red wig I told you about.

586
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,203
The other is Han Se-na.

587
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,747
She reported to the police that

588
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,500
Alan and one other individual
committed a heinous crime against her

589
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,668
at a club named Cartel three days ago.

590
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,920
She made a police report?

591
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,131
Did you know about her already?

592
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,258
Yes.

593
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,678
Then who is this one other individual?

594
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,222
You don't need to know that.

595
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,852
I know that it's Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

596
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,523
You asked a question
which you already know the answer to?

597
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,527
Since I know already,
wouldn't telling me the details

598
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,488
be helpful to you too?

599
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,656
It seems pretty urgent.

600
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,784
Han Se-na dropped the charges.

601
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,287
She's now hospitalized
at a hospital in Gyeonggi-do.

602
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,915
I think I'll find Alan soon too.

603
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,295
In order to do so,
I might need some sort of reward.

604
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,841
What do you want?

605
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,511
I want to meet Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

606
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,685
I'll make an appointment
with him tomorrow.

607
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,314
But remember, it's just for formalities.

608
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,658
You getting involved with the connection
between them doesn't seem good.

609
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,161
Wouldn't it be better to become
a professional serviceperson forever?

610
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,497
Thanks to Lawyer Yong Moon-goo,

611
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,499
I spent those damn five years
quite nicely.

612
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,002
And I'll spend the rest
of my life even better,

613
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,504
so just watch, Sang-ki.

614
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,881
No, are you sure this is going to be okay?

615
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,342
I have to follow you out too.

616
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,761
You know my hunch, right?

617
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:41,600
I throw myself into this fated wave called
Noh Tae-nam that's rushing toward me!

618
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,479
The other guys all drowned and died,
but I will not drown.

619
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,110
I swear I will ride that fated wave
and surf through it.

620
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,736
He's watching. Please stop.

621
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,536
I'll be waiting in the car.

622
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,537
Okay.

623
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,050
Your suit and all those…

624
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,345
You're really dressed up
to see Mr. Noh today.

625
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,264
Especially that watch.

626
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,350
This watch?

627
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,019
I got it as a gift.

628
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,646
Is it from a woman?

629
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,316
I'm busy as hell. I have no time to date.

630
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,068
Let's go.

631
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,793
Wait.

632
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,671
Well done.

633
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,301
I'm Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

634
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,304
It's an honor to be here, sir.

635
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
You have a unique name.

636
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,436
Let's see…

637
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,438
It sounds similar to something.

638
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,483
Doh Bae-man.

639
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,986
Doberman.

640
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,072
My boy Bolt is a Doberman too.

641
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,323
Isn't that right, Bolt?

642
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,618
It's been my nickname
since my childhood. Doberman.

643
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,080
You must have been made fun
of a lot before

644
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,665
for having a name
that sounds like a dog breed.

645
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,000
I was never made fun of.

646
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,712
I threw all jerks who had potential to
do so out the classroom window beforehand.

647
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,382
Students and teachers. No exceptions.

648
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,224
Let's get to the point.
I'm busy, you know.

649
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,475
Yes, sir.

650
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,443
So your job is

651
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,072
to throw those jerks who try not to do
their military service in prison, right?

652
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,574
If he's a serviceperson,
then I take care of him.

653
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,536
Is there anyone you wish
to report around you?

654
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,955
-I can immediately--
-Make me exempt.

655
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,918
-What?
-You know,

656
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,712
I really don't want to do
military service.

657
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,770
You truly are amazing.

658
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,525
You ask a military prosecutor
to help you evade your military service.

659
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,110
Sir.

660
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,654
If that's the case, I can look into it.

661
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,448
You stay out of this, Lawyer Yong.

662
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,992
Then let me say it like this.

663
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,202
How capable are you, Military Prosecutor--

664
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,121
So you want to test me, right?

665
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,373
Don't cut in when I'm talking.

666
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,753
If you don't like the word "test",
then think of it as an opportunity.

667
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,048
I'm giving you an opportunity to see

668
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,675
if you can be on my side forever.

669
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,470
An opportunity…

670
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,158
I do not judge opportunities.

671
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,036
The opportunity will judge me.

672
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,253
Bae-man, you shouldn't
answer carelessly here.

673
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,923
And I will get that opportunity for sure.

674
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,842
Wow, I didn't expect
to get an answer so quickly.

675
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,386
I've never seen someone
who surprises me at first.

676
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,846
You're a true serviceperson.

677
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,515
Military Prosecutor Doberman.

678
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,446
Hey, why did you say yes
so easily like that?

679
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,407
And you're a military prosecutor too.
Do you have any ways?

680
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,035
I…

681
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,539
don't have any ways.

682
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,374
And you said yes?

683
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,833
It won't be easy.

684
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,462
But I have never taken the path
that was already made by someone.

685
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,173
The path always formed after I walked.

686
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,593
And I'll make a path this time too.

687
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,345
What?

688
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,555
Don't tell me

689
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:34,017
you're worried that I might find the path.

690
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,109
I must get going now.

691
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,584
-Let's go.
-You've done so much.

692
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,267
You should have
consulted me first about this.

693
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,104
Are you dying to mess
with my temper these days?

694
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,815
The military service
isn't an easy matter to deal with!

695
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,442
You want me to go to the military

696
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,653
and live with those lowly bastards
from unclear backgrounds?

697
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,071
You want me to do that?

698
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,866
You're telling me to die!

699
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,791
I'll tell you just this one thing.

700
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,669
If your mother finds out,

701
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,088
she will not just sit and watch.

702
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,694
Here's the interim monthly report
of Law and One.

703
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,405
Currently, Law and One
is working on 23 trials,

704
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,533
and 17 of which are civil trials
and 5 of them are criminal trials…

705
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,037
Don't tell me that you're worried

706
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,747
that I might find the path.

707
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,420
Ungrateful bastard.

708
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,055
Yes.

709
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,142
Alright, today's the inauguration
of our new division commander.

710
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:43,647
All of you must dress properly
and attend it on time.

711
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,315
Dismissed!

712
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,483
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

713
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,318
And you…

714
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,571
Nevermind.

715
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,323
Salute.

716
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,203
I'm at the hospital.

717
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,665
By the way, how did you find out
that Se-na is here?

718
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,000
Doh Bae-man found out.

719
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,087
That military prosecutor is really good.

720
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,799
In times like this, if she reports you,
things will get really bad.

721
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,885
Remember what I said,
and never yell at her.

722
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,346
Sure.

723
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,190
HAN SE-NA

724
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,485
Se-na.

725
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,280
Is this where you've been?

726
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,703
I've been looking for you.

727
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,749
Take it.

728
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,293
Hurry.

729
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,214
You…

730
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,341
I heard you went to a police station.

731
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,261
If you're a human being,

732
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,431
you shouldn't try
to cut someone else's leg

733
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,850
just because that person
stepped on your foot.

734
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,812
Isn't that right?

735
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,105
Please…

736
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,483
Please don't do this.

737
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,530
Alan went missing.

738
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,284
But what I'm looking for isn't Alan.

739
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,288
I'm looking for that video.

740
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,752
Did you scheme this up with Alan?
So you can screw me over?

741
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,839
By the way, what are you holding so tight?

742
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,384
-What is it? Open your hand!
-Go away! I'm going to scream!

743
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,303
Where did you hide the video at!

744
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,517
I said, where is it?

745
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,565
Division Commander is waiting.

746
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,776
Why would my mother be here…

747
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,904
Yong Moon-goo…

748
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,240
I'll take you to the car.

749
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,689
-Get in.
-Mother, I can explain everything.

750
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,691
I heard about it from Lawyer Yong.

751
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,151
Let's talk on our way.

752
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,037
We'll arrive at 14:41
at the division headquarters.

753
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,288
We're now taking off.

754
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,466
You know that Staff Judge Advocate
is watching you, right?

755
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,386
Once he starts to hate you,
your military life is ruined.

756
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,931
I will remember it.

757
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,319
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yes, I am okay.

758
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,904
What the heck…

759
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,456
That bastard…

760
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,461
Do you know him?

761
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,713
His name is Seol-ak.

762
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,633
His father stole supplies from the base

763
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,303
and made the soldiers work
at a brick factory and took their pay.

764
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,222
So I sent him to prison.

765
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,684
His head got bigger.

766
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:35,355
It's dangerous, so stay in the car, okay?

767
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,606
Yes, sir.

768
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,275
Let's warm up a bit.

769
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,866
I've missed you, Military Doh.

770
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,830
Are you getting laser skin treatments?

771
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,416
You're a military guy,
but your skin is totally glowing.

772
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,711
Are you giving your father
lots of private food?

773
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,755
Hey, if you want to do that,
you should be successful.

774
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,466
Wow, you flowery bastard.

775
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,594
He did that for 20 years
as a First Sergeant,

776
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,263
so he'll have to be in there
as much as he got.

777
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,808
Well, sure. I was about to kill you

778
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,185
and go visit my father.

779
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,565
Good. The best thing you can do
as his son is to visit him often.

780
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,316
No.

781
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,486
Wouldn't it be better
to reunite with him in prison?

782
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:49,512
Wow, you dress so fashionably,
but your method is old-fashioned.

783
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,558
Hey, in the age
of level four autonomous driving,

784
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,810
you still use lumber?

785
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,230
This is etiquette. The world may change,

786
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,983
but we cannot be replaced.

787
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,276
Right.

788
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,530
Come on, my brothers!

789
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,407
Get rid of

790
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,242
this military bastard now!

791
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,078
Yes, boss!

792
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,374
Come here, you bastard!

793
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,422
-That's it!
-It hurts…

794
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,688
-You come here.
-Come in.

795
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,503
Come one!

796
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,471
This is expensive.

797
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,100
Hey, wait.

798
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,562
Military Doh!

799
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,939
Now, it's time to say goodbye.

800
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,941
What goodbye? Damn it.

801
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,735
You don't even know
how to spell that in English, damn it.

802
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,570
What time is it now?

803
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,995
Cha Woo-in.

804
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,122
Don't come out. It's done.

805
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,749
Get in. It's done.

806
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,459
Okay? It's almost done.

807
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,214
What is she doing?

808
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,094
What is it, military lady?

809
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,138
Are you going to whip us?

810
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,808
We have an inauguration
for our division commander in 20 minutes.

811
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,478
And I despise being late.

812
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,440
-Her and her bluffing.
-Really?

813
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,109
-Then I'll be whipped.
-Sure.

814
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,654
Whip me!

815
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,621
Hey, what are you doing?

816
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,498
A whipping from a girl
can't be that painful.

817
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,083
-Don't make a fuss.
-Whip me.

818
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,555
Look at you, you bratty girl.

819
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,848
Get her!

820
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,210
Cha Woo-in.

821
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,754
My doubt was right.

822
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,082
Where did you learn that?

823
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,835
Do you think a serviceperson
beating up gangsters is that weird?

824
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,591
You do the driving.

825
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,968
I need to rest. It's my first time
working out in a long time.

826
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,845
Yes, sir.

827
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,879
Cha Woo-in.

828
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,716
Who the heck are you?

829
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:00,967
We're taking off.

830
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,950
I'll be after Cha Woo-in's true identity.

831
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:29,495
I was convinced that
he is someone I need for my plan.

832
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,331
You dared to ask a military prosecutor
to help you evade your military service?

833
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,833
I really don't want to do
military service…

834
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,378
The military is where even
the smallest mistake is reprimanded.

835
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,463
What are you saying…

836
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,964
I really like the way you work.

837
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,008
You're different from Lawyer Yong,
who's concerned about my mom.

838
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,010
There are cops everywhere.

839
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,803
I must give a warning.

840
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,473
-Stop the car! You bastard!
-Damn it.

841
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,476
Do you have a guilty conscience?
Do you, or do you not?

842
01:02:55,104 --> 01:03:00,109
