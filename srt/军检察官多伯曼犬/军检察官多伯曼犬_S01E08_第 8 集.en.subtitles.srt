00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,828
PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS,
17 DAYS OF FIERCE COMPETITION HAVE BEGUN

5
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,124
3 YEARS AGO

6
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,351
Captain Doh Bae-man.

7
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,937
Captain Cha Woo-in. Please come in.

8
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,238
SPECIAL DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

9
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,823
Salute to the Corps Commander.

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,574
Salute.

11
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,743
At ease.

12
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,497
It's Brigadier General Hong Moo-seob.

13
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,623
He was the military prosecutor

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,709
who was in charge
of your parents' accident 20 years ago,

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,920
and he played a big role
in covering it up.

16
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,759
Who told you that you can be seated?

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,346
What kind of an attitude is this?
You're here to be punished!

18
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,518
We will receive it standing.

19
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,230
First, I will identify
those who are to be punished.

20
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,065
Your official rank and name!

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,068
Captain Doh Bae-man,
military law officer, the fourth division.

22
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,196
Captain Cha Woo-in,
military law officer, the fourth division.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,739
Captain Doh Bae-man.

24
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,366
Captain Cha Woo-in.

25
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,535
The disciplinary committee

26
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,580
for those who are subject to punishment
for their charges will now commence.

27
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,456
Put it on the screen.

28
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,545
You bastard!

29
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,839
Just how much more
are you going to humiliate me?

30
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,174
Do you think you'll be able
to get away with this?

31
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,943
-That really is a prosthetic leg.
-What is going on?

32
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,405
-That really is a prosthetic leg.
-It is a real prosthetic leg.

33
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,326
Hey, you bastard!

34
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,162
Is this what you wanted to find out?

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,305
General Noh is here!

36
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,917
Salute.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,168
Salute!

38
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,932
I will ask the subjects of punishment
about this situation.

39
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,811
Why did you break Battalion Commander
Won Ki-choon's prosthetic leg?

40
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,064
While we were investigating
Corporal Kim Han-yong's shooting,

41
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,109
we began to have questions
about Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon.

42
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,069
What were your questions?

43
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,988
We determined that Battalion Commander Won

44
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,949
was deceiving the entire military
and the people of Korea.

45
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,200
"Deceiving?"

46
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,496
Did you suspect that the mine explosion
at the DMZ was fabricated?

47
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,789
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,250
What are the grounds for that?

49
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,460
What you're claiming means

50
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,463
you determined that
the Battalion Commander tricked everyone,

51
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,090
so you broke his prosthetic leg.

52
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,800
Did you see that his leg was fine?

53
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,177
No, sir.

54
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:06,806
No, sir.

55
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,851
Then was there
another witness or informant?

56
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,311
No, sir.

57
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,021
Are you kidding me?

58
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,023
The whole country is furious,

59
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,984
saying that the military prosecution
insulted the national hero!

60
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,528
Why did you do such a ridiculous thing

61
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,740
when you don't even have
any evidence or a witness?

62
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,575
There was a video I acquired.

63
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,578
A video?

64
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,832
It was a false report
with unclear sources, Corps Commander.

65
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,003
Military prosecutors investigated
a case based on a false report?

66
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,089
Captain Doh,
are you admitting your mistake?

67
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,388
I should have verified and confirmed
the information properly.

68
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,556
It was my fault.

69
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,226
But I heard that Captain Cha
carried out all of the trials.

70
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,105
Captain Cha carried out
her duties for the trial

71
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,441
after taking my orders
as she is a new military prosecutor.

72
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,194
Since I am her predecessor,

73
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,904
I will take complete responsibility

74
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,947
for this case.

75
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,704
Division Commander Noh,
what do you think as their boss?

76
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,458
The reckless investigation
by those two military prosecutors

77
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,043
who disregarded rank and the law,

78
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,922
deeply humiliated their superior
who was in court as a victim.

79
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,467
The only way to restore the honor
of Battalion Commander Won…

80
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,555
is to strictly punish Captain Cha
and Captain Doh Bae.

81
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,059
We will adjourn for ten minutes

82
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,895
and decide on the punishment
through the committee's votes.

83
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,574
Do you know what's making me
so angry right now?

84
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:53,287
That I was humiliated in court
and I'll be punished soon too?

85
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
No.

86
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,296
It's that I was entangled by you
and lost my prudence.

87
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,716
I find myself so pitiful
that it's driving me crazy!

88
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,345
I never imagined
that the video would be fake.

89
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,180
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,521
Based on the results
of disciplinary evaluation,

91
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,024
we have agreed that
the subjects have reasons to be punished.

92
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,068
Including abuse of authority,

93
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,865
violation of the duty to follow the law,
violation of diligence in duty,

94
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,201
and violation of the duty
to maintain dignity.

95
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,120
Therefore, this disciplinary committee
has decided to punish them

96
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,747
based on the criteria
for disciplinary actions

97
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:41,043
according to Article 57 of
the Military Personnel Management Act and

98
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,839
Article 2 of the Decree on Disciplinary
Action Against Military Servicepeople.

99
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,050
Captain Doh, suspension for three months.

100
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,052
Captain Cha, probation for ten days.

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,721
As mentioned.

102
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:15,119
Suspension for three months is
the longest suspension anyone can get.

103
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,748
Military Prosecutor Cha got probation too.

104
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,126
She must wait on base until it's lifted.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,837
She cannot take one step
out of the guardhouse.

106
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,841
What? How can a military prosecutor go to
the court if she cannot leave the base?

107
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,593
What about the investigation?

108
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,179
Isn't it obvious?

109
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,390
They're telling them
to take their hands off the case.

110
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,352
Are you worried
about Cha Woo-in right now?

111
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,688
That was the best for her
because Doh Bae-man took all of the blame!

112
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,357
I'm sorry, sir.

113
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,318
By the way,

114
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,154
if Military Prosecutor Doh is suspended

115
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,115
and Military Prosecutor Cha
is under probation,

116
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,160
then who's going to take care
of the trials that have piled up

117
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,538
in our office of justice?

118
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,081
Isn't it obvious?

119
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,376
I'll take care of all of them.

120
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,544
Really? What?

121
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,131
You're going to do it yourself?

122
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:14,011
Yes, I must discipline the office
of justice by taking this chance.

123
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,224
What are the cases Cha Woo-in
has been working on?

124
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,769
The Kim Han-yong shooting
and Noh Tae-nam's desertion.

125
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,145
Both are on the same day.

126
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,022
Okay, that's good.

127
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,984
Put the related materials in my office.

128
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
What?

129
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,027
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,908
I'm telling you one more time.

131
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,952
If you ever mention a "mine"
or even an "m"

132
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,663
in this office of justice,

133
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,958
then I'm going to smash you.

134
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,459
Get it?

135
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,588
I'm going to smash you.

136
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,551
Man, I'm sick of this.

137
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,470
-That's an "m".
-Are you kidding me?

138
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,638
Staff Judge Advocate.

139
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,402
It's powerful evidence to smash his play
about being the hero of mines.

140
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,863
That completely fine leg of his.

141
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,281
The reckless investigation
by those two military prosecutors

142
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,658
who disregarded the rank and the law,

143
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,287
deeply humiliated their superior
who was in court as a victim.

144
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,291
Ever since you joined, there hasn't been
a single peaceful day for us!

145
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,461
Take your hands off all investigations
until Prosecutor Doh returns!

146
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,462
Get it?

147
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,050
It's that I was entangled by you
and lost my prudence.

148
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,719
I find myself so pitiful
that it's driving me crazy!

149
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,748
Due to the colossal incident
during the military trial,

150
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,376
the army summoned a disciplinary committee

151
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,171
and announced that they strictly punished
the military prosecutors who caused it.

152
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,925
Both the ruling party
and the opposing party are competing

153
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:21,180
to scout Battalion Commander Won,
who is about to be honorably discharged

154
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,433
and they're sending him
love calls for their competition.

155
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,561
Not only politics,
but everyone else is also watching

156
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,063
what the hero will do,

157
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,440
wondering which party he is going to join.

158
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,954
I heard the news.
You're suspended for three months, right?

159
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,373
I'm sure you're not here
to comfort me at this hour.

160
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,833
Why are you here?

161
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,836
If you were working for me,
you wouldn't have been punished.

162
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,671
Because I must have done
something beforehand.

163
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,675
Are you here to tell me to have regrets?

164
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,096
About you breaking
Lieutenant Colonel Won's prosthetic leg…

165
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,809
The Doh Bae-man I know wouldn't do that
without concrete physical evidence.

166
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,936
What was the reason?

167
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,565
You're spying on me pretty directly.

168
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,650
Did Division Commander Noh send you?

169
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,070
I didn't hear anything
from General Noh about this.

170
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,824
So you're going to get something from me
which was not even mentioned by her?

171
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,077
You're so twisted.

172
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,706
Well, I'm sure you don't feel good
because of your punishment.

173
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,168
It's too bad for you
but thanks to you being punished,

174
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,003
the trial on Mr. Noh's desertion
got easier.

175
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,883
Because the person in charge switched
to Seo Joo-hyuk from Cha Woo-in.

176
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,304
Even if you helped with it,
it wouldn't have been better than this.

177
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,728
The phrase saying,
"You can never smash a rock with an egg".

178
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,856
The more I think about it,
the truer it is.

179
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,940
Don't you think?

180
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,462
MILITARY PROSECUTOR CAPTAIN DOH BAE-MAN

181
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,137
He canceled his discharge
and came back recently,

182
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,805
but what is this mess?

183
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,226
Why do things keep going
wrong at our office of justice?

184
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,438
Serve the Staff Judge Advocate
well while I'm gone,

185
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,398
and don't fight, okay?

186
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,776
Prosecutor Doh cannot come on the base

187
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,570
and Prosecutor Cha cannot leave the base…

188
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,992
Bye.

189
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,129
What is this? Romeo and Juliet?

190
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,466
It looks like someone's determined
to separate them.

191
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,842
Yes, really.

192
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,514
We actually gave Won Ki-choon
a vote of sympathy too.

193
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,308
Once he gets discharged,
he'll become an assemblyman.

194
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,811
Plus, we cannot finish off Noh Tae-nam

195
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,272
with our own hands either.

196
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,234
Why did you say
you'll take complete responsibility?

197
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,444
I'm the one who made the mistake.

198
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,284
I know, right?

199
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,745
So this is how it feels like
to be punished.

200
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,290
It feels like crap.

201
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,795
Why did I take all the blame?

202
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,882
We can't do anything
if both of us get tied up.

203
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,092
What?

204
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,971
We must do something while you're in here,
and while I'm outside.

205
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,766
We just failed. We didn't give up.

206
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,736
I do not want to give up
on the mine case either.

207
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,655
Plus, I made a promise to you too.

208
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,158
You said you'll end it in 90 days,
didn't you?

209
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,117
I did.

210
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,161
I cannot take three months off.

211
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,538
I must wrap up the mine case.

212
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,208
Both of us are excluded from duty.

213
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,336
We cannot do anything officially.

214
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,671
Affairs of the world
and case investigations

215
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,299
aren't always done officially.

216
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,718
And I don't take
the path someone tells me to take.

217
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,595
Don't you know how I am?

218
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,766
Call me.

219
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,907
Now, I will do my work as a civilian,

220
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,242
not as a prosecutor or a serviceperson.

221
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:56,956
Being unable to investigate officially
means you must never stand out.

222
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,540
Of course, I must not.

223
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,002
I must look like a plain
and quiet civilian.

224
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,338
And that's why I'm here first.

225
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,468
But won't this fabric stand out too much,
Military Prosecutor?

226
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,348
This suit makes me look great.

227
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,433
I don't look like
a military prosecutor at all.

228
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,395
-It's perfect.
-Oh, my…

229
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,646
Nice job.

230
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,275
Let's go back to the start
and get Kim Han-yong's testimony properly.

231
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,989
When today's trial is over,
I'll send Kim Han-yong through Sang-ki.

232
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,664
Sir, I think you should take off
to the court now.

233
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,041
I washed and ironed it too.

234
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,043
How many years has it been this time?

235
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,796
Old soldiers never die.

236
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,966
They just fade away, and then return.

237
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,050
Old soldiers.

238
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,136
Just hearing that lights a fire
in my heart.

239
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,929
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

240
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,521
From now on,
I'll tell you the clues unofficially.

241
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,983
And I'll take those and work outside.

242
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,781
Yes, General. I'm taking off.

243
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,034
I'll see you in military court.

244
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,415
CEO Yong Moon-goo of IM Defense Industry--

245
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,625
Go away. I'll call security.

246
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,462
CEO Noh Tae-nam's stowaway plan.

247
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,507
I was the one who worked on it.

248
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,219
I have something to tell you,
so make time for me, sir.

249
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,096
Hey!

250
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,101
What the heck?

251
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,729
-Did I just get ignored?
-You got ignored.

252
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,564
What?

253
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,866
When you were a prosecutor or a lawyer,

254
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,994
you just needed to walk up
and down the stairs of the court,

255
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,747
but you're now the owner of a big company,

256
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,000
so you shouldn't have
to get your hands dirty.

257
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,544
Even if it's something
that'll be difficult,

258
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,839
it will be done in a flash
if I work on it.

259
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,010
I only work with the top one percent.

260
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,679
You helped Mr. Noh with his stowaway plan?

261
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,223
It was more than helping.

262
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,892
I did something fiery
with that bastard Military Doh too.

263
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,312
You're also acquainted with Doh Bae-man…

264
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,440
Perfect timing.

265
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,529
I will do everything I can,

266
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,241
so your fair hands will never get dirty

267
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,535
not even with a speck of dust.

268
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,969
Are we going to go get that Doberman now?

269
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,596
Whenever I think of how
I was dishonored on that day,

270
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,431
I get so furious I can't sleep.

271
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:06,228
Wow, it's true when they say
even a piece of crap can be of use.

272
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,396
What does that mean?

273
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,815
Thanks to that bastard Military Doh,

274
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,485
I'm now on the same team as Mr. Yong!

275
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,904
We've become successful!

276
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,614
Are we going to go get him or not?

277
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,034
You bastard, can't you see
what's going on right now?

278
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,370
Hey, North Korean military guy.

279
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:29,585
If you want to work in South Korea,
you must learn to be patient.

280
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,006
No pain, no gain. Okay?

281
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,469
-Get-together!
-Get-together!

282
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,143
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon,
I apologize as the highest superior

283
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,438
in the office of justice,
for the damage you suffered

284
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,650
from the scandalous incident
here last week.

285
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,282
Military Prosecutor. Please only carry out
matters related to the trial.

286
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,118
Yes, I will do so, Your Honor.

287
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,375
Defendant Kim Han-yong, did you repent?

288
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,670
Did you repent or not?

289
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,216
Did you repent?

290
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,801
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

291
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,304
I'm deeply repenting.

292
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,264
Look at this, Your Honor.

293
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,641
Look at this, Your Honor!

294
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,685
He said he's deeply repenting.

295
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,270
Even when the verdict
is just around the corner,

296
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,731
Kim Han-yong, the defendant,
is still being impudent and shameless!

297
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,858
The defendant did run away,

298
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,778
but he was away from the base
for a very short period of time…

299
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,864
The fact that Kim Han-yong fired
blank ammunition is not important at all!

300
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,493
When someone's privacy was revealed once…

301
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,413
This case is undoubtedly a rebellion
against a superior!

302
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,209
Therefore, his behavior was impulsive…

303
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,419
It's clearly a crime of mutiny!

304
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,631
Therefore, I ask you
to be generous in the verdict.

305
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,426
He must get due punishment!

306
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,719
Your Honor!

307
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,179
Defendant Kim Han-yong.

308
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,514
Defendant Noh Tae-nam.

309
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,723
The court sentences him
to five years in prison.

310
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,558
The court sentences him
to one month in prison.

311
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,395
The court suspends
the sentencing for the defendant.

312
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,700
It's a relief
that the sentencing is light.

313
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,785
Suspension of sentencing?

314
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,080
So this military goes round and round

315
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,416
and everything goes according
to my mother's will.

316
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,419
I think I'm getting used
to this place now.

317
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,347
Mother.

318
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,855
You should be glad that

319
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,232
you're paying for the humiliation I got
because of you with this.

320
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,324
You will be assigned to a base tomorrow.

321
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
You'll be assigned
to the front line of the division.

322
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,747
-What?
-You must show people that

323
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,083
you are serving more diligently
and sincerely than anyone else.

324
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,502
How can I go to the front line?

325
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,880
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

326
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,299
If you cause more trouble,

327
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,636
I will cut ties with you, with no regrets.

328
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,645
If there's anyone who disobeys me,

329
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,857
I will cut them out,
regardless of who that is.

330
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,362
Whether it be my son, my subordinate,
or whomever else.

331
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,168
But would it be really okay
to send him to the front line?

332
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,461
It's my decision.

333
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,296
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,049
I will take care of him more
after his assignment.

335
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,428
Is there anything I must know

336
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,307
about Battalion Commander Won
by any chance?

337
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,811
Why are you asking that question?

338
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,146
I'm sure Doh Bae-man had a reason

339
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,607
for breaking Lieutenant Colonel Won's
prosthetic leg.

340
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,487
I'm telling you, you shouldn't be

341
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,449
too interested in my division
and my subordinate.

342
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,543
MINE EXPLOSION AT THE DMZ

343
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,920
REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY

344
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,755
CAPTAIN OH JUNG-HO,
MILITARY LAW OFFICER, IV CORPS

345
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,852
Long time no see, Law Officer Oh.

346
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,146
Sir, it's been so long!

347
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,314
I should have called you first.

348
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,858
I want to check something.

349
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,111
It must be urgent. Tell me anything.

350
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,948
You were the one
who did the initial investigation

351
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,783
on the mine explosion
of Battalion Commander Won, right?

352
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,287
Yes, our corps started it
by forming a co-investigation team.

353
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,205
Was there anything notable?

354
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,540
Not really…

355
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,793
But I knew that Kim Han-yong
would cause trouble someday.

356
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,340
Are you saying that he showed signs
before he shot the Battalion Commander?

357
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
Jeez. Don't even ask.

358
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
Oh, no, what should I do?

359
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,188
Why? What is it?

360
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,899
I forgot the prison transfer
from and the trial processing form.

361
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,901
Subsection Chief Ahn!

362
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,819
This is not
your first time working, is it?

363
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,198
How could you forget those?

364
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,075
I'm sorry. I'll stop by at the office
of justice quickly.

365
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,828
Turn the car now. What are you doing?

366
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,166
It looks like
you have to come with us too.

367
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,771
Wait here quietly.

368
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,411
Why was the other
military prosecutor in court?

369
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,456
You talked like you were
going to understand me last time.

370
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,793
I got punished.

371
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,964
Today's the last chance.

372
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,382
The verdict is already out.

373
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,801
What's the use now?

374
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,220
The truth is still hidden.

375
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,848
And you fired a gun because of that.

376
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,938
You stole the gun,

377
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,108
chose the bookstore
which was crowded with reporters,

378
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,988
but you thought hard until the end
whether to fire live or blank ammunition.

379
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,242
And your brother
was the only consideration for that.

380
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,743
You didn't consider yourself.

381
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,164
You thought hard
about whether to get revenge

382
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,792
with one bullet and end it,
or reveal the unfair truth

383
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,460
about your brother until the end.

384
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,713
What do you know about me,
Military Prosecutor?

385
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,798
I know very well.

386
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,800
I, too, once held…

387
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,469
a gun like you did.

388
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,765
I, too, had someone I wanted to kill

389
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,517
with one bullet.

390
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,976
Someone I killed in my head
a million times already.

391
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,688
But when I actually got a chance,

392
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,940
I couldn't fire the gun.

393
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,488
Because my hatred was too big
to end it like that.

394
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,325
It felt like the weight of a bullet
which is less than two grams

395
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,412
would make
that person's sins just disappear.

396
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,791
I'm sure you felt so too.

397
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,043
That's why you loaded

398
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,670
the gun with blank ammunition,
not with live ammunition.

399
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,005
You could have killed him,

400
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,551
but the weight of your hatred cannot even
compare to that of a single bullet.

401
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,556
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,892
I wasn't going to say that to you, but--

403
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,769
It was…

404
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,856
It was my brother's CT scan image.

405
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,983
CT scan image?

406
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,487
This is the CT scan image
of Company Commander Kim.

407
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,614
Do you see these small things
on this side?

408
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,116
These are the fragments of the mine.

409
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,078
One, two, three, four, five, six.

410
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,914
These are now stuck in his skull.

411
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,000
It's a miracle that he's still alive
with these stuck in his head.

412
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,004
My brother was in a car accident
when he was young and hurt his head badly.

413
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,259
That was when I learned that his brain is
naturally shaped differently.

414
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,178
I saw it when I was young,
but I remember it clearly.

415
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,849
But the CT scan image
the medical officer showed me--

416
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,642
You mean it was not
your brother's CT scan image?

417
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,396
No. That was the beginning of my doubts,

418
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,606
and the critical thing was…

419
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,316
What did the letter say?

420
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,418
It said that Battalion Commander Won
didn't save my brother…

421
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,129
but that he actually shot my brother.

422
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,423
Won Ki-choon…

423
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,218
shot him?

424
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,139
THE BATTALION COMMANDER DIDN'T SAVE THE
COMPANY COMMANDER, HE ACTUALLY SHOT HIM

425
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,982
That's it.

426
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,984
I heard Woo-in got
Kim Han-yong's testimony.

427
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,029
Kim Han-yong showed that letter
and his brother's CT scan image

428
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,242
to the co-investigation headquarters
at the corps to ask for a re-investigation

429
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,701
but he was ignored every time.

430
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,706
That's why he couldn't easily to us either
because we're military prosecutors too.

431
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,711
Well, I understand him because
I don't trust the prosecutors either.

432
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,466
You were also a corrupt prosecutor

433
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,593
before you returned
so I'm sure you can relate too.

434
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,181
The only prosecutor I trust is

435
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,766
Cha Woo-in. So…

436
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,061
But the only evidence
that proves that letter is a fact

437
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,855
is Kim Han-yong's testimony.

438
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,026
Did you lose your hunch
after just one day of your suspension?

439
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,114
That letter and the CT scan image
are sending the same sign.

440
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,703
If the medical officer
switched the CT scan image,

441
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,373
there's a high chance that a bullet,
not those mine fragments,

442
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,792
are stuck in his skull right now.

443
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,920
You talk too much.

444
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,470
THE BATTALION COMMANDER DIDN'T SAVE THE
COMPANY COMMANDER, HE ACTUALLY SHOT HIM

445
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,890
ARMED FORCES CAPITAL HOSPITAL

446
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,393
I've arrived at the military hospital.

447
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,604
I looked into Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan,

448
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,606
and he has a connection to Won Ki-choon.

449
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,441
Really?

450
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:45,486
The doctor who was in charge
of Won Ki-choon was Medical Officer Jo.

451
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,030
I knew it.

452
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,035
If we just catch that medical officer,
we might be able to solve it more quickly.

453
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,287
Salute.

454
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,588
But you don't have
the right to arrest anyone.

455
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,924
How are you going
to secure Medical Officer Jo?

456
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,093
I must do it gently. Like a gentleman.

457
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,388
Without standing out,
so no one can see it,

458
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,098
and quietly.

459
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,369
Are you saying that he showed signs
before he shot the Battalion Commander?

460
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,537
Don't even ask.

461
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,456
He said that the CT scan image
of his brother got switched,

462
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,668
and bugged us like crazy, begging for us
to investigate that medical officer.

463
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,127
So Kim Han-yong

464
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,005
suspected the medical officer, right?

465
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:55,223
I'm the family of the serviceperson
who got treated by him.

466
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,724
Where's this medical officer now?

467
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,810
That's Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan.

468
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,689
He's on a long vacation, starting today.
He just packed his things and left.

469
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,649
-He just left?
-Yes.

470
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,911
Hey!

471
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,503
52 J 3467

472
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,800
SEOL-AK

473
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,431
Yes, sir.

474
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,350
There's someone you must find. 3467.

475
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,561
Did you say, 3467?

476
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,605
That's a license plate number.
Get to work!

477
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,315
Your request has been submitted.

478
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
-Ji-ri.
-Yes, boss.

479
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,486
-Tell everyone to find 3467.
-Okay.

480
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,112
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

481
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,492
Excuse me.

482
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,747
Excuse me?

483
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,292
What's the unit number
for Medical Officer Jo's office?

484
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,463
I want to meet
Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan.

485
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,636
So many people are looking for him today.

486
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,721
Really?

487
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,473
Who was it?

488
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,266
I don't know.

489
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,354
He just said he's a family
of the patient treated by him.

490
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,274
His office is at the very end
of the corridor.

491
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,985
Thank you.

492
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,362
See you again.

493
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,825
He's handsome.

494
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,676
-What's going on?
-You must evacuate! Now!

495
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,637
Hurry! The nurses, hurry!

496
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,682
-This way, please!
-Hurry!

497
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,394
This way.

498
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,313
Hurry and run!

499
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,861
I have bad news and worse news.
Which one do you want to hear first?

500
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,737
Is that a siren I'm hearing?

501
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,449
I think you said
you'll persuade him quietly.

502
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,537
The bad news must be
that you lost the medical officer.

503
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,122
What's the worse news?

504
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,792
There's someone else
who's looking for that medical officer.

505
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,965
So there's someone else who's trying
to dig up the truth of the mine case?

506
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,012
We don't know if they're trying
to dig it up or cover it up.

507
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,889
One thing's for sure.

508
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,984
A very annoying fly
is buzzing around us now.

509
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,284
It's huge.

510
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,920
What the heck?

511
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,630
Why is Noh Tae-nam's dog here?

512
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,592
Woo-in brought him after she arrested him
at the airport last time.

513
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,302
I'm fostering him now.

514
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,929
Woo-in cannot leave the base now.

515
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,889
It's troublesome.

516
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,603
You're going through a lot too.

517
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,981
This is Medical Officer Jo's.

518
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,025
Check it and see
if you can find anything useful.

519
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,570
You brought this entire thing?

520
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,323
Without permission? Jeez.

521
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,033
How are you going
to deal with the aftermath?

522
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,869
I just brought the search
and seizure forward.

523
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,956
Because I'm going to get an arrest warrant
for Won Ki-choon soon.

524
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,792
And this is a video of Won Ki-choon
when he was hospitalized.

525
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,211
Run a program through it
and check its authenticity.

526
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,008
I thought you'd just stay quiet
after you got punished.

527
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,261
Just check those and call me.

528
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,179
Wait.

529
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,140
Take care of him for a while.

530
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,185
I'm really allergic to dogs,
so I can't take care of him anymore.

531
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,605
What? Hey, I can't keep him with me!

532
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,111
He likes you.

533
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,863
A serviceperson who got kicked out
of the base and a dog who lost his owner.

534
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,157
You're both very pitiful.
Very similar. Right.

535
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,118
You two look alike.

536
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,453
You two look great together.
Even more than me.

537
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,080
You can do it, Doh Bae-man.

538
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,291
-Hey!
-Cheer up!

539
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,500
Hey, wait.

540
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,711
Kang Ha-joon!

541
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,754
We don't look alike…

542
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,717
What am I supposed to do with him?

543
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,718
Stay.

544
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,303
Stay.

545
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,222
The military prosecutors
who stirred up controversy

546
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,516
by causing an incident
at the military court regarding

547
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,311
Battalion Commander Won
was sent to a disciplinary committee

548
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,354
and received serious punishment.

549
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,398
Ministry of National Defense
mentioned abuse of authority…

550
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,443
What's this dog?

551
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,527
Auntie.

552
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,071
You're home.

553
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,242
Hey, you're even bringing
a dog into the house?

554
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,829
All right. I heard he's thirsty.

555
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,915
-Hold him.
-Hey!

556
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,334
Hey! Seriously…

557
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,419
Wait.

558
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,171
He looks familiar.

559
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,255
This Doberman.

560
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,674
Where did I see him?

561
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,051
Come here.

562
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,637
Come here, drink some water.
Come and drink water.

563
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,810
You never showed yourself when I was busy.

564
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,856
Hey, this place isn't just for you
to come when you're being punished!

565
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,025
I…

566
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,195
I had to wander around all day long today

567
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,697
to investigate the case
of the hero of mines…

568
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,576
I'm asking you as a detective,
so answer honestly.

569
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,162
If you lie, I'm going to cuff you.

570
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,414
I'm not kidding right now.

571
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,458
It hurts! Auntie! What's wrong?

572
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,418
You were at Club Cartel, weren't you?

573
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,712
I saw that dog there.

574
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,672
He's Noh Tae-nam's dog, isn't he?

575
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,593
That rat who ran away while
he was drinking with Noh Tae-nam…

576
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:49,887
Is it you, Bae-man?

577
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,057
Auntie.

578
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,685
That was in the past.

579
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,729
In the past?

580
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,444
So it was you.

581
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,613
About that case…

582
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,784
I was going to confess to you.

583
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,744
Before that,

584
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,663
there's a bigger story.

585
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,832
What? There's a bigger story? What is it?

586
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,836
It's about Mom and Dad.

587
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,968
-Hey, what did you say?
-I don't know where to start…

588
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,719
Auntie.

589
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,806
-Listen to me.
-Hey, get out.

590
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,308
Get out of this house, now!

591
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,853
You're even using them as excuses?

592
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,439
-That's not why. Listen to me.
-Get out!

593
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,483
-Get out! I can't stand the sight of you!
-You're not even going to listen?

594
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,110
Hey, take this dog with you!

595
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,194
Get out!

596
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,655
Stop yelling.

597
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,408
-You're scaring the dog.
-Get out!

598
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,492
Get out!

599
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,620
I'm leaving.
Jeez. I was so doggone scared.

600
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,038
Let's go.

601
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,332
-Let's go.
-Don't ever come again!

602
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,501
Bye.

603
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,759
MINE EXPLOSION AT THE DMZ

604
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,930
It said that Battalion Commander Won
didn't save my brother…

605
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,808
but that he actually shot my brother.

606
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:29,278
I sent you the information
on the members of the platoon

607
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,071
who participated
in search and patrol that day.

608
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,577
OFFICER PERSONNEL RECORD

609
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,995
SOLDIER PERSONNEL RECORD

610
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,288
SOLDIER PERSONNEL RECORD

611
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,962
Yes, Prosecutor Doh.

612
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,381
Mr. Kang is looking
for the medical officer.

613
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,883
The clue will be out soon.

614
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:54,428
I'm now checking the suspects who might
have sent the letter to Kim Han-yong.

615
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,600
Noh Tae-nam's verdict
for his desertion is out.

616
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,644
Kim Han-yong's verdict too.

617
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,020
I know.

618
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,856
Noh Tae-nam is going
to begin his military life

619
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,566
after receiving a small punishment.

620
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,695
Because not everything goes
according to plans.

621
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,613
No.

622
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,032
Everything's going according to my plan.

623
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,160
-What?
-You'll see. Just wait.

624
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,498
I sent a natural enemy to Noh Tae-nam,

625
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,084
so his military life will be fun.

626
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

627
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,385
You're that famous Noh Tae-nam, right?

628
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,224
We went to the same military prison,
and we're in the same base.

629
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,934
This is a connection too.

630
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:42,935
Let's get along.

631
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,316
Looks like you don't want to get along?

632
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,862
You must show people
that you are serving more diligently

633
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,073
and sincerely than anyone else.

634
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,951
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

635
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,204
Nice to meet you.

636
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:03,956
AHN SOO-HO

637
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,124
Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

638
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,167
Yes, Tae-nam.

639
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,877
Just relax, okay?

640
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:55,382
Okay, the platoon members will be back
after guard duty, so wait.

641
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,967
Yes, sir.

642
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,470
Hey.

643
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,013
Why aren't you answering me?

644
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,183
You're a new soldier,
and you're damn dazed!

645
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,768
Yes, sir.

646
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,519
Do it right.

647
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,701
Is this a front-line base?

648
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,745
To be exact, it's a GOP.

649
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,872
This platoon guards the cease fire-line
24 hours a day.

650
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,708
It's different from regular bases.

651
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,293
How is it different?

652
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,796
Below FEBA, there's no PX,

653
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,298
and there's no leave,
spending nights out, or weekends either.

654
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,759
Then what does this place have?

655
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,678
Live ammunition and grenades.

656
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,597
Grenades?

657
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,265
What is it?

658
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,184
Are you scared?

659
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,439
You need to calm your temper here.

660
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,192
Everyone here has live ammunition on them,

661
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,945
so when something goes wrong, they just
fire their guns and throw the grenades.

662
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,033
By the way,

663
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,703
why did you go to military prison,
Sergeant Ahn?

664
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,330
Me?

665
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,544
Are you curious?

666
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,174
I'll tell you in time.

667
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,014
-We have new soldiers!
-They're here.

668
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,433
Wow, isn't he a famous guy?

669
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,476
-He looks so…
-Look at his eyes.

670
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,811
They're vicious.

671
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,187
Are you Noh Tae-nam?

672
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,445
Wow, this is awesome!

673
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,368
You must have done everything
to get money to play games here.

674
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,538
Like, switching the CT scan images.

675
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,748
Damn it.

676
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,751
Military Doh!

677
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,755
You must be struggling
after you got punished.

678
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,966
You're here to rip off
someone winning money.

679
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,968
What is it? Why are you doing this to me?

680
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,554
-Are you guys on the same team?
-No.

681
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,474
Why would you be interested in him?

682
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,394
"Hachungbulga Yieoeobing."

683
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,854
Do you even know what that means?

684
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:18,150
"A bug that only lives during summer
cannot speak or explain about winter?"

685
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,361
-Correct?
-Wow, you're intelligent, Military Doh.

686
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,658
So it means someone ordered you
to catch the medical officer,

687
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,037
and you're just a bug
who does what you're told to do,

688
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,997
without thinking. Isn't that right?

689
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,209
-A bug?
-Yes.

690
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,172
Hey, Doh Bae-man.

691
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,716
The lives of other people are all history.

692
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,637
I live my life using my own brain too!

693
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,514
Come with me.

694
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,598
Kill him!

695
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,401
Comrade Military Doh.

696
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,241
Today, I can finally finish
what I couldn't finish last time.

697
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,705
I'm sick of this.

698
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,500
You bastard!

699
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,557
You're actually cute.

700
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,186
Excuse me.

701
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,855
Was this the guy who was looking
for Medical Officer Jo?

702
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,733
You came last time…

703
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,026
By the way, are you okay?

704
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,612
-Was he the one?
-No.

705
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,031
-You have to get treated now…
-No.

706
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,492
Are you sure you didn't get it mixed up?
I'm sure it's him.

707
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,120
I can't get that man mixed up
with a gangster?

708
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,539
He was a very gentle
and sophisticated gentleman.

709
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,833
Then…

710
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:00,836
was it him?

711
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,964
Yes. It was him.

712
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,134
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

713
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,011
Okay, thank you.

714
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,560
Yong Moon-goo was the one
who took and hid Medical Officer Jo?

715
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,353
-Then did Noh Hwa-young--
-No.

716
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:22,399
Yong Moon-goo knew nothing
about the Won Ki-choon case.

717
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,402
About you breaking
Lieutenant Colonel Won's prosthetic leg…

718
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,905
The Doh Bae-man I know wouldn't do that
without concrete physical evidence.

719
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,907
What was the reason?

720
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,868
If Noh Hwa-young ordered him to do that,

721
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,495
he wouldn't have needed
to do it himself, like I have.

722
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,207
Yong Moon-goo is doing things on his own
without Noh Hwa-young's orders?

723
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,420
It means he is also curious
about the truth of the hero of mines case.

724
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,299
By the way, what should we do,
since we lost the medical officer?

725
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,302
I will give you a more certain card.

726
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,679
Did you find the suspect
for the informant letter?

727
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,681
I'll send you his address.

728
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,516
Yes, sir.

729
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,427
We totally preheated him
before you came here,

730
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,638
so he'll tell you everything
you want to know.

731
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,056
You're not bad.

732
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,309
From now on, work like you're my shadow.

733
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,521
Like you're not there,
though you're there.

734
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,939
Like I'm not there.

735
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,650
Wow, I love that.

736
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,153
That also sounds like you're going
to take care of everything.

737
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,535
I'm sure you switched
the Company Commander's CT scan images

738
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,204
because there's something
that must not be revealed to the world.

739
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,748
Because the thing that's stuck
in the Company Commander's head

740
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,625
is a bullet, not mine fragments.

741
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,377
Yes.

742
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,421
That's true.

743
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,256
Did Won Ki-choon order you to do it?

744
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,925
Yes.

745
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,594
Wasn't it someone above him?

746
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,430
No.

747
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,099
I got the order
from the Search Battalion Commander.

748
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,435
Are you sure there isn't anyone else
besides Won Ki-choon?

749
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:22,978
Yes.

750
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:29,359
Now then, let's get to the actual point.

751
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,739
-What?
-Tell me about Won Ki-choon's leg.

752
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:59,055
TODAY'S LATE-NIGHT SNACK

753
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,141
It's cold.

754
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,062
I'm hungry.

755
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,649
You're Sergeant Koo Hyun-seok

756
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,651
of the Search Battalion
of the fourth division, right?

757
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,154
It's cold. Did you get a lot of calls?

758
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,031
Who are you?

759
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,534
You left the letter in the Search
Company Commander's hospital room, right?

760
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,623
-Who are you?
-Me?

761
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,711
I'm the military prosecutor
who was in charge of Kim Han-yong's case.

762
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,005
Did you leave the letter there?

763
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,299
I didn't.

764
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,176
I see…

765
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,139
Don't most people ask what letter
it was first at times like this?

766
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,641
If you really didn't, I mean.

767
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,769
What you said means you know
what letter it is. Don't you think so?

768
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,147
Don't accuse me. I have nothing to do
with that letter or whatever.

769
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:53,235
The day you left the letter
happened to be the day of your discharge.

770
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,155
That's an incredible coincidence,
don't you think?

771
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,448
The handwriting is identical too.

772
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,284
What is it?

773
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,120
You couldn't muster up courage
while you were wearing a military uniform?

774
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,997
Or should I say…

775
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,042
Were you trying to reduce
some of that measly guilt?

776
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:13,171
So did your guilt get reduced?

777
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,590
Shut up!

778
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,842
I got discharged!

779
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,053
You have no right to do this to me.

780
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,723
I will never get involved
with that disgusting military anymore!

781
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,601
The letter you wrote
triggered Kim Han-yong.

782
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,984
Kim Han-yong read your letter,
shot Won Ki-choon,

783
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,152
and got sentenced to five years in prison.

784
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,738
Five years?

785
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,866
Hey, you shouldn't have left
the letter there at least.

786
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,952
How are you going to reduce
your guilt for Kim Han-yong now?

787
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,456
But you said the verdict is out.
Isn't it all over, then?

788
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,374
No.

789
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,920
Everything will start again.

790
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,548
I heard you were the most loyal
to the Company Commander.

791
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,136
Even though the military is disgusting,
you couldn't turn a blind eye.

792
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,434
You're the only one
who can help the Company Commander now.

793
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,145
Tell me the truth you know.

794
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,194
That day was really foggy,

795
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,655
so it was very difficult to
secure the front.

796
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,365
Halt!

797
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,533
A five-minute break!

798
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,994
-A five-minute break!
-A five-minute break!

799
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,165
During our patrol,
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon

800
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,460
was away for an urgent matter,

801
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,296
and a water deer appeared.

802
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,883
What?

803
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,052
Isn't that a water deer?

804
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,387
It looks like a water deer.

805
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,513
What?

806
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,516
Isn't that the direction
Battalion Commander Won went?

807
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,352
Yes, I think it is.

808
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,519
That's a minefield.

809
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,522
If the water deer steps on a mine,
it will be a disaster.

810
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,777
Hey, you guys wait here.
And be on watch properly.

811
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,654
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

812
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,240
I'm coming with you, Company Commander.

813
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:07,827
Stay here.

814
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,800
Who's there?

815
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,636
Is that you, Company Commander?

816
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,938
I said, who's there?

817
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,023
Say your official rank and name,
or I'll fire!

818
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,165
Battalion Commander!

819
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,084
I said, who's there?

820
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,156
Company Commander!

821
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,882
If you begin re-investigating,

822
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,469
then I will testify everything
in the court.

823
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,640
I'll see you at the court.

824
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,811
According to Sergeant Koo's testimony,

825
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,065
Won Ki-choon shot
the Company Commander by accident,

826
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:04,527
and in order to cover it up,
he was turned into the hero of mines.

827
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,697
So Division Commander Noh
got involved with this.

828
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,325
Then she should have
just punished Won Ki-choon.

829
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,785
Why did she go that far?

830
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,038
When a gunfire accident occurs at the DMZ
and results in a casualty,

831
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,915
it wouldn't just end with Won Ki-choon.

832
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,959
This case occurred as soon
as she became the Division Commander,

833
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,586
which she has always dreamed of.

834
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,464
Plus, Noh Tae-nam ran away,
and made it a parade of incidents.

835
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,301
So she fabricated the case and turned
Won Ki-choon into the hero of mines?

836
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,012
Wait.

837
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,931
Then what about this matter?

838
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,775
I checked its authenticity, but there's
no trace of correction or alteration.

839
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:46,319
Even if the NFS analyzes it,
the result will be the same.

840
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,904
Sergeant Koo's testimony matches it too.

841
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,825
He said that Won Ki-choon
didn't hurt his leg that day.

842
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,952
Then why did he lose his leg?

843
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,745
It looks like…

844
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,541
his leg was amputated before the trial.

845
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,753
That's the only answer to that.

846
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,088
What?

847
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,715
His leg was amputated?

848
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,384
Maybe…

849
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,931
we're dealing with a monster
that's even worse than our imagination.

850
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,671
Mr. Noh got placed
in his base without trouble.

851
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,798
You must stay alert at all times.

852
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,258
Whether it's Tae-nam or IM,

853
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,679
your job is to prevent accidents
before they occur.

854
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:05,064
There's something I found out
about Lieutenant Colonel Won's mine case.

855
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,193
I'm sure I told you not to be

856
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,446
too interested
in my division and my subordinate.

857
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,699
Didn't you take my warning seriously?

858
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:20,288
It's to prevent an accident
before it occurs, just like you said.

859
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,833
As the CEO of IM,
and as your legal representative.

860
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,256
Okay. What did you find out?

861
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,304
The true main character
of the story of the hero of mines was you,

862
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,431
not Won Ki-choon.

863
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,019
The shooting accident in the minefield.

864
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,938
If that was revealed to the world,

865
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,148
you would have gone through
the humiliation of resigning

866
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,776
right after your inauguration
as the Division Commander.

867
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,405
Plus, Mr. Noh's trial was going on too.

868
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,033
So you're saying
I made Won Ki-choon a hero?

869
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,829
You have a wild imagination, Lawyer Yong.

870
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,332
I'm already convinced by that.

871
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,379
There's something else
I'm really curious about.

872
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,257
It's about Won Ki-choon's leg.

873
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,358
Please save me, Division Commander!

874
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,944
Just give me orders.

875
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,613
I'll… I'll do everything.

876
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:36,990
Yes.

877
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,118
You must do everything.

878
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,246
Adjutant Yang!

879
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,464
Division Commander!

880
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,133
What are you doing?

881
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,471
Lieutenant Colonel Won Ki-choon.

882
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,931
Yes, Division Commander.

883
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,393
You can become a serviceperson
who shot your subordinate,

884
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:09,188
or a hero who will be praised forever
by all servicepeople.

885
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,899
I will do as you command,
Division Commander!

886
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,541
Be a real hero,

887
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,793
for me.

888
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,535
You lost one leg,

889
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,537
but you earned the world.

890
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,501
You don't need to play a hero anymore.

891
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,586
Because you've become a real hero now.

892
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,548
If you get an honorable discharge,

893
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,093
so many places will be desperate
to make you an assemblyman.

894
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,764
Minister Lee Jae-sik and I

895
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,308
will guide you through
that path you cannot walk.

896
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,783
It's been cut off.

897
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,583
I cut it off.

898
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,319
This surgery is about taking out
what's stuck in his brain,

899
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:02,779
so we have to think of
the worst-case scenario too.

900
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,655
The search battalion member
who was at the scene

901
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,199
will have a press conference
for his conscience.

902
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,241
What?

903
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,370
We must find evidence
and damage Noh Hwa-young.

904
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,122
Today's press conference
has been canceled!

905
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,499
-It's been canceled!
-No, it hasn't!

906
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,834
Doh Bae-man, that lunatic!

907
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:17,835
That's enough.

908
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,506
Once you cross the line,
your fate will change.

909
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,592
This case isn't just a simple
made-up story of the hero of mines.

910
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,761
It's a trailer for a colossal gate.

911
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:35,186
