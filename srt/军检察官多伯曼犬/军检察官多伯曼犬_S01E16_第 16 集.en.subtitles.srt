1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,067
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,193
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,278
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,780
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,181
Life is full of cruel ironies.

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,062
Life has good luck within bad luck,

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,649
failure that looks like success,

9
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,361
darkness that scatters like the light,

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,616
and evil that masks itself
to look like good.

11
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,494
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

12
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,015
The shape of life is determined

13
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,975
in those ironies,

14
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,231
and you get to learn who you are.

15
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,950
Prosecutor Cha.

16
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:57,992
Are you okay?

17
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,753
You woke up after three days.

18
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,547
Three days?

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,090
The bullet pierced your shoulder.

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,343
If it hit you a bit higher,
it would've been a disaster.

21
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,387
Thank goodness.

22
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,723
By the way, why are you…

23
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,061
Noh Tae-nam detonated a grenade.

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,354
A grenade?

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,857
Are you okay?

26
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,983
I was lucky.

27
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,610
But Noh Tae-nam…

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,618
has shards stuck in his body,

29
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,662
and he's still unconscious.

30
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,916
The doctor says
he has a very low chance of making it.

31
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,414
I'm sure Adjutant Yang

32
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,542
was ordered by Noh Hwa-young to kill you.

33
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,593
Who was it?

34
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,970
Who did this to you?

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,640
I'm okay. Don't worry.

36
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,974
Adjutant Yang did this.

37
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,517
Noh Hwa-young's adjutant?

38
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,311
Did Noh Hwa-young instigate this?

39
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,482
We should put out
an APB on Adjutant Yang first…

40
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,858
No.

41
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,277
When I leave the hospital,

42
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,528
I will find Adjutant Yang

43
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,739
-and persuade her, too.
-Woo-in.

44
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,993
Adjutant Yang may remain silent forever
and take all the blame.

45
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,705
Prosecutor Cha, you take
on Adjutant Yang until the end.

46
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,165
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,586
Prosecutor Doh, did you tell Woo-in?

48
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,589
Tell me what?

49
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,677
The X-files of the Patriotic Society…

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,053
We got them.

51
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,776
What happened to Cha Woo-in?

52
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,611
Where is Adjutant Yang Jong-sook?

53
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,072
Why are you asking me that?

54
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,162
Did you make that face 20 years ago, too?

55
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,165
When you killed my parents

56
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,376
and got away?

57
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,466
-Watch what you say, Doh Bae-man.
-You…

58
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,468
What?

59
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,512
You will never be able to get out

60
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,556
of the hell you created yourself.

61
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,868
Boss.

62
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,078
We're doomed.

63
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,121
WANTED SUSPECTS

64
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,414
What the heck is this?

65
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,417
I thought he was a nobleman,

66
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,879
but he turned out to be a nobody.

67
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,930
All three of us are wanted.

68
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,557
Wanted?

69
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,893
WANTED SUSPECTS

70
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,603
My company…

71
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,688
Seolak Cheonji!

72
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,982
It has been completely smashed!

73
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,404
Prosecutor Cha!

74
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,073
Staff Judge Advocate.

75
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,325
Subsection Chiefs.

76
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,662
The Staff Judge Advocate prepared this.

77
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,081
And I paid for it.

78
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,541
We were just so shocked.

79
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,211
I didn't know you'd come.

80
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,213
Thank you for coming.

81
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,801
I heard you got shot. Right?

82
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,219
Who shot you?

83
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,553
Who was it?

84
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,263
I heard you saw the culprit's face!

85
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,057
So why aren't you telling us?

86
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,437
You can trust me. Now tell me who it is.

87
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,781
I will tell you as I prepare for
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young's trial.

88
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,496
It has something to do
with the Division Commander?

89
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,836
Come.

90
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,225
Hurry!

91
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,650
What the heck?

92
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,195
Didn't Noh Tae-nam survive
the mass shooting?

93
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,864
That's what I heard, too.

94
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,075
We snuck in here,
so we can't just ask a nurse.

95
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,787
Hey, wake up, kid.

96
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,122
You know it, right?

97
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,416
-Where are the X-files?
-You idiot.

98
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,877
He's obviously in a coma!
He won't wake up like that!

99
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,462
But we have to find the files!

100
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,506
And I lost my stock!
I can't be sane right now!

101
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,957
Are you leaving the hospital already?

102
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,252
The doctor says
I need to stay here longer,

103
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,879
but I've got no time.

104
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,550
And the 90 days I promised you
are really coming to an end.

105
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,011
I'll join you soon, too.

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,308
Yong Moon-goo came here last night.

107
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,394
Did you see Yong Moon-goo and lose him?

108
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,355
I didn't lose him. I let him go.

109
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,360
I have plans, so Military Prosecutor Cha,

110
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,820
please just focus on recovering.

111
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,449
That's the right attitude for reporting.

112
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,163
The X-files of the Patriotic Society
your father left

113
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,251
went around and around
and came back to you.

114
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,546
He'd lived his life
more fiercely than I knew.

115
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,591
How did he investigate
and find out all those?

116
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,512
Perhaps the revenge my father wants

117
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:19,392
is me completing
what he wasn't able to complete.

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,314
I need someone to verify
the details in these files.

119
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,650
Who can verify the corruption

120
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,403
between the Patriotic Society
and the defense companies.

121
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,614
The one whom we chose to use as bait.

122
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,534
Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang-in.

123
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:49,005
Doh Bae-man,
where and how did you get this?

124
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,674
Isn't it amazing?

125
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,802
The corruption
of the rotten defense industry

126
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,639
that conspired with the Patriotic Society
is all neatly organized.

127
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,891
I don't know anything about it!

128
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,644
Your reaction is proof
that you know very well about it.

129
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,691
I won't admit it!
I won't suffer in the Minister's place!

130
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,069
Most guilty people yell like you.

131
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,572
And they bark when they're scared.

132
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,533
What? Doh Bae-man, you bastard!

133
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,754
Can't you

134
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:34,258
just let me go on condition
that I take my uniform off?

135
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,013
You must be punished
for what you did in your uniform.

136
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,517
I only followed orders!

137
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,560
You know that!

138
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,812
You can't help it
if you're a serviceperson!

139
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,153
Then I can promise you this one thing.

140
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,864
What is it?

141
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,119
I will make sure
that you won't be punished

142
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,579
for what you didn't do.

143
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,707
It was all ordered
by Minister Lee Jae-sik, anyway.

144
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,708
Of course!

145
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,920
I have no power
to make decisions on my own!

146
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,422
The Minister made all of the decisions!

147
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,175
That expression you just made is great.

148
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,553
Please do that during the trial
for Minister Lee Jae-sik, too.

149
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,972
That expression is great.

150
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,941
Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang-in
is going to testify.

151
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,152
Wow, this…

152
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,280
became like five times bigger
than its initial size.

153
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,492
That's why I called it a gate.

154
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,165
I'm not going to destroy

155
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,419
Minister Lee with just
the corruption of the defense industry.

156
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,922
You provide the investigation information
and help me with the trial.

157
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,215
Prosecutor Doh.

158
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:00,302
I did hear that you're like a Doberman,
and you sure do your job like that.

159
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,932
Is the preparation for Division Commander
Noh Hwa-young's trial going well?

160
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,142
Of course.

161
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,644
I'm making Yong Moon-goo move.

162
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,689
But he doesn't know
that he's being forced to move.

163
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,243
Are you keeping Medical Officer
Jo Soo-chan safe?

164
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,329
Yes. But why?

165
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,001
That medical officer
is the only card we have now.

166
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,628
I'll use him to negotiate with Noh.

167
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,676
Noh Hwa-young's trial will begin soon.

168
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,221
The only charge Doh
can apply to her in court

169
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,599
is failure to frustrate
the crimes of subordinates.

170
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,935
He can't even scratch her
with just that charge.

171
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,565
I'm sure he will collect
all possible charges and integrate them.

172
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,490
Where is the medical officer?

173
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,950
We put him in a pawn shop.

174
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,952
A pawn shop?

175
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,748
You know that pawn shops deal
with all kinds of things.

176
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,127
That pawn shop deals with people too.

177
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,217
I see.

178
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,427
We'll take off as soon as the sun rises.

179
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,770
You left the hospital already?
But your wound hasn't even healed yet.

180
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,272
Lying in bed doesn't suit me.

181
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,565
You're just so…

182
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,734
Right.

183
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,986
Yong Moon-goo began to move.

184
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,447
Now I just need to sit and watch.

185
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,074
I'll look forward to it.

186
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,812
You did many things
with this thing on your head, Cha Woo-in.

187
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,277
You're just like your father.

188
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:26,407
Both he and you threatened me terribly
solely based on your belief.

189
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,701
If my father considered you
someone special,

190
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,372
I'm sure he tried
to stop you from going berserk.

191
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,293
Are you still concerned about that?

192
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,420
You're very naive.

193
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,924
Your father and I didn't have
any type of relationship.

194
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,678
This time, you survived
because you were lucky,

195
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,723
but you may end up like your father soon.

196
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,895
Because I get rid of everything
that gets in my way.

197
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,279
You use your subordinate's loyalty to you.

198
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,656
How long will you be able to do that?

199
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,657
My subordinate?

200
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,368
That idiot
who couldn't even get rid of you?

201
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,788
She's just my tool.

202
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,582
Though she's useless now.

203
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:21,378
Now I can put bullets
into your head myself.

204
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,631
Come anytime.

205
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,924
I'll be waiting.

206
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:30,095
If you knew my father well,
then you should know how I am too.

207
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,682
Your end…

208
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,143
is coming soon.

209
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,062
Noh Hwa-young.

210
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,879
Those pawn shop bastards.

211
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,133
They should keep the item
in its initial condition.

212
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,343
This is totally damaged!

213
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:10,970
Bring him.

214
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,864
So this jerk will be

215
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,994
the item for you to start
the second round of your life, right?

216
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,788
I want to barge
into the Division Commander's office

217
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,958
and make a deal with Noh Hwa-young,
and it’s hard to wait.

218
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,255
By the way, since you've been staying,
eating, and sleeping with us,

219
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,298
we must've rubbed off on you.

220
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,968
Your style is becoming similar to ours.

221
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,969
Let's go.

222
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,895
Doh Bae-man.

223
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,857
Wow, this tracking device is great.

224
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,026
I think it's ready
to be released as a product.

225
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,572
Will you be okay all by yourself?
They seem to be outnumbering you.

226
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,657
Outnumbering…

227
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,077
There are only two of them
I need to fight.

228
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,038
Hey, Yong Moon-goo can't fight.

229
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,711
Hey, Kang Ha-joon, did you…

230
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,006
put a tracking device on my car, too?

231
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,716
Where are you?

232
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,510
You know what?

233
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,096
Tricking a trickster

234
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,890
is twice as joyful.

235
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,768
And when I asked if you'd be okay,

236
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,020
I was asking if you'd be okay
without Woo-in.

237
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,024
But I don't think it'll be helpful
to have you here,

238
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,150
Kang Ha-joon.

239
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,157
It's a bias if you think
I can't fight, Doh Bae-man.

240
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,956
Gosh.

241
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,263
My foot!

242
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,322
Gosh, it hurts.

243
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,326
Go.

244
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,582
Where do you think you're going?

245
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,089
Hey.

246
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,215
Doh Bae-man.

247
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,434
Hey!

248
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,403
The end.

249
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,078
You should be good!

250
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,496
Shut up!

251
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,206
Detective?

252
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,708
What?

253
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,919
May I say my last farewell

254
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,671
to the wanted suspect?

255
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,175
Be quick.

256
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,266
The last farewell?

257
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,977
I've always been consistent.

258
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,770
You're the one who betrayed me.

259
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,064
The X-files of the Patriotic Society…

260
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,734
You're still looking for it, right?

261
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,070
That thing

262
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,198
is in my hands.

263
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,283
What?

264
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,412
But you said it doesn’t exist.
You said it doesn't exist!

265
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,747
Soon everyone

266
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,791
will download the X-files
of the Patriotic Society.

267
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,045
And they'll get to read
all of the details in it.

268
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,465
You'll be bored in prison,

269
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,759
so read it in there.

270
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,012
Doh Bae-man, this won't be the end of me!

271
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,474
I will be back, okay?

272
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,976
I'll be back, you bastard!

273
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,562
He's just so…

274
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,237
We secured Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan

275
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,323
to prove the charges of murder
of Battalion Commander Won.

276
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,784
Please follow
the emergency arrest procedures,

277
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,868
Division Commander.

278
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,330
I can’t wait to see how many of my charges

279
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,667
will be revealed
in the military court of my division.

280
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,711
I'll see you in court.

281
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,422
-Take her away.
-Yes, ma'am.

282
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,228
How much do you know?

283
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,603
That feels good.

284
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,023
It's nice and cool.

285
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,774
It feels nice.

286
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,112
It feels nice.

287
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,036
What? Auntie.

288
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,872
You're getting prettier
these days, you know.

289
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,248
Is it the power of love?

290
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,750
The power of love

291
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,001
and tools?

292
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,421
When my eyes are swollen, I put this on

293
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,089
and it gets better.

294
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,134
I can't live without this anymore.

295
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,804
Yong Moon-goo's trial is today.
I'm going to impress him!

296
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,267
I can't wait to see

297
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,854
Yong Moon-goo and Lee Jae-sik
get what they deserve today.

298
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,495
Bae-man. The trial for Yong Moon-goo
and Lee Jae-sik began.

299
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,497
I'll put it on live for you.

300
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,750
BAE-MAN

301
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,834
Your Honor.

302
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,170
I'd like to summon a witness.

303
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,715
It's Commander Heo Kang-in
who was a member of the Patriotic Society.

304
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,302
He will testify about the defendant's
charges on the corruption.

305
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,096
What? Heo Kang-in?

306
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,015
Why is he coming here as a witness
for the prosecution?

307
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,477
Apparently,
he volunteered to save his own skin.

308
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,937
Volunteered?

309
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,733
You couldn't even control
your subordinate.

310
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,197
That jerk!

311
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,698
Hey, you!

312
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,950
Hey, you bastard!

313
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,076
Hey, you!

314
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,285
You jerk!

315
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,247
How dare you backstab me, you jerk!

316
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,957
Let me go!

317
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,627
I have to survive, you know!

318
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,921
Mr. Lee Jae-sik, let me go!

319
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,258
What did you say? You bastard!

320
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,598
No wonder they're called military jerks…

321
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,268
I'm sick of servicepeople now.

322
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,728
I hate them.

323
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,480
Wait!

324
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,196
Now, Noh Hwa-young is the only one left.

325
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,283
Tomorrow,

326
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,953
Noh Hwa-young
will finally sit in this seat.

327
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,082
You kept your promise.

328
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,418
It took exactly three months.

329
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,086
All of those crimes

330
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,630
Noh Hwa-young committed

331
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,966
since the cases of my parents
and your father…

332
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,345
I will make sure she gets punished
for all of those.

333
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm sure Noh Hwa-young
will be frantic for the last time, too.

334
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,394
She will do everything
to keep her place she reached

335
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,645
by becoming a monster.

336
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,569
Actually…

337
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,615
there's a different reason
why I called you here.

338
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,950
What reason?

339
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,370
If we bring charges against Noh Hwa-young

340
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,332
after her trial is over,

341
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,376
there is something I must do after that.

342
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,837
If we bring charges against Noh Hwa-young,

343
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,505
then our job is over.

344
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,384
I've decided to do this
since I became a military prosecutor.

345
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,640
So you must understand too.

346
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,277
Case numbers 2001 GO 25,

347
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,196
2015 GO 97,

348
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,114
2022 GO 13,

349
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,367
2022 GO 26,

350
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,577
and 2022 GO 30.

351
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,621
We will integrate these five cases

352
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,289
for this trial.

353
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,834
The prosecution, please begin.

354
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,336
Yes, Your Honor.

355
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,298
Noh Hwa-young, the defendant,

356
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,593
ordered the 1st Battalion Commander
to cover up the mass shooting

357
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,804
that occurred in the GOP,

358
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,723
forced the victim soldiers
to commit perjury,

359
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,643
and interfered with figuring out
the true nature of the case

360
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,270
and revealing the truth.

361
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,480
Listen carefully.

362
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,358
There were no signs. Understand?

363
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,194
You must say this one thing
to the military prosecutors.

364
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,363
Tell them that there wasn't any abuse.

365
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,574
That's the way for me
to keep this position.

366
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,620
All of the criticism must go
to Private First Class Pyeon.

367
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,123
Furthermore, the defendant

368
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,083
ordered Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon,

369
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,461
the perpetrator of the friendly fire case
at the DMZ,

370
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,465
to fabricate the case
and deceived the whole nation.

371
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,928
And after that, in order to conceal
the truth of the fabricated case,

372
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,726
she harmed
the Search Battalion Commander's body,

373
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,354
murdered him,

374
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,358
and fabricated it as suicide.

375
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,321
In addition, she was a part
of an inside private group,

376
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,490
which is strictly forbidden
in the military, and shared bribery.

377
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:01,369
And she ran IM Defense
with shares under borrowed names

378
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,789
and embezzled most of the profits
she gained from it

379
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,459
for her own private interest.

380
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,295
And lastly,

381
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,881
she murdered
a military investigator couple

382
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,883
by purposely crashing into their car

383
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,470
to cover up the truth behind the explosion
of defective grenades 20 years ago,

384
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,683
and instigated the murder
of President Cha Ho-chul

385
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,519
of IM Defense Industry six years ago.

386
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,650
Therefore, I, the military prosecutor,
wish to prosecute Noh Hwa-young

387
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,694
for the charges of murder, bodily harm,

388
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,947
embezzlement and breach of duty,

389
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,785
violation of the Act on the Aggravated
Punishment of Specific Crimes,

390
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,119
and offering bribes.

391
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,497
I'd like to prosecute her

392
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,457
for a total of seven charges.

393
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,214
The military trial of Noh Hwa-young,

394
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,841
the first female Division Commander

395
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,886
and the one considered to be
the breaker of the glass ceiling,

396
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,388
is now taking place.

397
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,765
And with the suspicion
of her running and managing

398
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,559
IM Defense Industry
with shares under borrowed names,

399
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:11,773
it's been informed that five cases
will be integrated for this trial.

400
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,488
I'd like to turn myself in.

401
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,492
I shot Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

402
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,585
Private Noh Tae-nam, who was a witness for
the trial of the mass shooting in the GOP,

403
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,964
testified that the defendant forced him
to commit perjury.

404
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,719
Mother, you forced me to commit perjury
so you can keep that uniform on.

405
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,764
Do you admit your charges
about the mass shooting?

406
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,349
That is not true.

407
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,227
Then why did Private Noh Tae-nam say that?

408
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,772
My son is not in a normal state.

409
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,524
After the mass shooting,

410
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:58,027
he's been suffering from severe
post-traumatic stress disorder.

411
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,572
Are you denying what he said?

412
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:08,455
I tried very hard to lead my son
to the right path all the time.

413
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,208
I persuaded my son who was avoiding
the military and had him enlist.

414
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:18,006
And I put him in the front-line base
so he wouldn't get any special treatment.

415
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,091
Perhaps it was a privilege to send my son

416
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,552
to the difficult
and dangerous front lines.

417
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,681
Despite my efforts, Private Noh Tae-nam

418
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,600
lied during a public trial

419
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,144
because he was being
rebellious towards me.

420
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,607
I am the top commander of the 4th Division

421
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,318
before I am the mother
of Private Noh Tae-nam.

422
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,988
I am falsely accused
of covering up the case

423
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,157
as the commander,

424
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,369
and the charge of failure
to frustrate crimes of subordinates

425
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,497
is a humiliation crueler
than murder to me.

426
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,750
Then why did Private Noh Tae-nam

427
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,169
call you to the storage of the base

428
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,129
and attempt suicide?

429
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,923
He called me

430
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,176
and said he regretted what he did.

431
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,970
He regretted what he did?

432
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,768
He said he did

433
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:15,355
something that cannot be undone
out of hatred for me,

434
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,690
and he apologized sincerely.

435
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,276
I am sorry for being born…

436
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,613
as your son.

437
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,616
And to show his sincerity,

438
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,828
he pulled the safety pin
out of the grenade.

439
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,544
It just breaks my heart that my son

440
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,588
isn't regaining consciousness.

441
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:49,138
What did you feel after seeing
Private Noh Tae-nam's actions?

442
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:57,313
What did you feel when you saw your son
pulling the safety pin out of the grenade?

443
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,699
Do you have to keep your position
even by abandoning your son?

444
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,869
Haven't you thought about why your own son

445
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,913
attempted suicide
in front of you, his mother?

446
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,666
I will be

447
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,836
your safety pin.

448
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,091
A child is

449
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:29,304
just another stranger
who came out of your body.

450
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,142
You can't figure out
everything in a stranger's mind.

451
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,311
Just for once,

452
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,272
answer me as a mother.

453
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,817
Prosecution.

454
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,904
Please only ask questions
that are related to the trial.

455
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,950
Private Noh Tae-man
repented his sins to you…

456
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,037
Doesn't that sound awfully familiar?

457
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,456
You said the same thing

458
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,750
about the case
of Won Ki-choon's death, too.

459
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,835
He confessed his crimes.

460
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,588
I told the Staff Judge Advocate,
so check with him.

461
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,548
Do you always

462
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,176
avoid your crimes like this?

463
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,636
Your Honor.

464
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,972
The prosecution is accusing the defendant
with groundless wild guesses.

465
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,223
Sustained.

466
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,977
The prosecution, please be careful
of what you say.

467
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,316
I will wrap up the examination
on the charge of

468
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,360
failure to frustrate
crimes of subordinates.

469
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,281
Next, we will move on to the charges
of bodily harm and murder

470
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,035
of Search Battalion Commander
Won Ki-choon.

471
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,135
Yes, Subsection Chief.

472
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,763
What?

473
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,015
I'll be right there.

474
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,854
Adjutant Yang is now
at the office of justice.

475
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,197
Adjutant Yang.

476
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,282
You take all the blame.

477
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,744
Do you want me to take all the blame?

478
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,954
Yes.

479
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,332
I never ordered you anything.

480
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,754
Say that it was all your independent doing
due to your wrongful loyalty to me.

481
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,047
Division Commander.

482
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,759
You must be responsible for failing
to finish your duty as a serviceperson.

483
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,969
Don't you think?

484
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,346
More than anything,

485
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,684
this is the last chance for you

486
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,185
to repay me.

487
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,938
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,566
I will do as you ordered.

489
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,837
As you can see,

490
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,088
I am fine.

491
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,844
I'm sure you didn't want
to kill me for real,

492
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,139
but I'm sure you couldn't
disobey your superior, either.

493
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,978
Did you get instigated
by Division Commander Noh Hwa-young?

494
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,109
No.

495
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,696
It has nothing to do
with the Division Commander.

496
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,739
I did it by myself.

497
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,241
-Adjutant Yang Jong-sook.
-That's the truth.

498
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,119
I got nothing more to say.

499
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,711
Adjutant Yang is selected
as the witness for tomorrow's trial.

500
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,547
They don't have any reason to reject her.

501
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,383
Because they're sure
that she's a witness for Noh Hwa-young.

502
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,135
I will not

503
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,805
let things go the way Noh Hwa-young wants.

504
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,643
Please work on tomorrow's trial alone.

505
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,562
I will persuade Adjutant Yang
and take her to court.

506
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,275
I'll take her to court no matter what.

507
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:17,115
But don't be so lonely
even if you attend the trial alone.

508
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,243
Make sure to bring her, Cha Woo-in.

509
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,620
We will now look into the charges

510
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,831
of bodily harm and murder of Won Ki-choon.

511
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,792
The prosecution, please begin.

512
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,098
The prosecution?

513
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,319
I confessed already.

514
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,865
No one ordered me to do so.

515
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,619
Your record shows
that you have amazing shooting skills,

516
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,788
so why did you fail to kill me?

517
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,708
And you reported it too, didn't you?

518
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,502
We checked your voice left
at the report center.

519
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,840
Your hesitant face
when you aimed your gun at me.

520
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,135
The frightened voice from making a report.

521
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,971
You didn't have any intention to kill me.

522
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,060
Listen carefully, Adjutant Yang Jong-sook.

523
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,521
With the help of the Division Commander,

524
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,899
you revealed your trauma
from the past to the world

525
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,526
and made the Corps Commander get punished.

526
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,280
And you thanked me.

527
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,701
You didn't have any reason
or motive to shoot me.

528
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,914
Let me bring a charge
against Division Commander Noh Hwa-young,

529
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,792
the real culprit who fired the gun
by hiding behind you.

530
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,146
My subordinate?

531
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,482
That idiot
who couldn't even get rid of you?

532
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,859
She's just my tool.

533
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,111
Though she's useless now.

534
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,658
Now I can put bullets
into your head myself.

535
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,747
Even if you take the blame
for what he did,

536
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,082
other servicepeople

537
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,542
will hold guns upon
the Division Commander's orders.

538
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,713
That tragedy of being used,
being thrown out, and being replaced

539
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,839
will continue endlessly

540
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,093
as long as Noh Hwa-young
is wearing a military uniform.

541
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,017
Please help us break that cycle
so other servicepeople

542
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,062
wouldn't be sacrificed

543
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,773
for unfair orders.

544
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,568
I beg you.

545
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,114
This is a recording of a conversation

546
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,991
between Won Ki-choon and Noh Hwa-young.

547
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,538
There was a witness
among our Search Battalion members.

548
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,832
He said he'll call all of the reporters

549
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,667
and expose everything.

550
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,169
If that gets revealed, I'm dead.

551
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,671
Let's talk later.

552
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,965
Division Commander!

553
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,135
It also looks like Doh Bae-man figured out

554
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,970
you cut my leg off.

555
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,305
Objection!

556
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,598
It's a one-sided claim
from the dead victim.

557
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:34,395
In the recording, the defendant
didn't agree or say yes to anything.

558
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,980
Sustained.

559
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,692
I'd like to summon a witness who can
prove the credibility of this recording.

560
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,903
The prosecution's witness,
please come forward.

561
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:55,583
WITNESS

562
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,504
Is that recording we just heard true?

563
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,968
It's true.

564
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,428
And how do you know?

565
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,598
I was at the scene where
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon's leg

566
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,807
was being cut off.

567
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:17,355
I was called in to suture the leg
after it was cut off.

568
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:23,235
At first, the Division Commander
ordered Adjutant Yang Jong-sook to do it.

569
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,322
But when Adjutant Yang hesitated,

570
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,408
the Division Commander…

571
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,953
cut off the leg of

572
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,415
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon.

573
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,632
I rest my case
with the examination of the witness.

574
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,512
Defense Attorney,
please conduct a cross examination.

575
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,348
Your Honor.

576
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:56,102
May I say something
about Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan?

577
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,478
Go ahead.

578
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,108
Captain Jo Soo-chan.

579
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,195
When you were working
at the military hospital,

580
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,781
you went AWOL
for more than a month, correct?

581
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,366
That was--

582
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,409
And

583
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,413
you received warnings from the superiors
due to your gambling charges.

584
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,708
Who would ever trust such a serviceperson
who lacks military spirit?

585
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,668
Your Honor.

586
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,421
The defendant is accusing the witness
with claims

587
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,423
that have nothing to do with this case.

588
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,049
Sustained.

589
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,717
Defendant, please be cautious.

590
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,264
Defense. Do you have
more cross examinations to do?

591
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,810
I don't.

592
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,646
We will now move on
to the examination of the next witness.

593
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:44,900
The prosecution,
is Adjutant Yang Jong-sook present?

594
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,906
If she's not present…

595
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,420
You're here, Cha Woo-in.

596
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,154
Your Honor.

597
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,450
She's First Lieutenant Yang Jong-sook,
Division Commander Noh's adjutant.

598
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,079
She's a crucial witness who will prove
many of the defendant's crimes.

599
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,462
Noh Hwa-young said that

600
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,423
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon
made a confession.

601
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,342
Is it true?

602
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,304
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon
never made a confession.

603
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,432
How can you be so sure?

604
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,062
He actually threatened
the Division Commander.

605
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,397
You, Noh Hwa-young,

606
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,900
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob,
and Lee Jae-sik too…

607
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,027
I have a bomb that will blow all of you.

608
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,531
Now, your fates

609
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,032
are up to me.

610
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,911
How did the defendant act
after she was threatened?

611
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,336
She made a decision that's so like her.

612
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,756
She…

613
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,342
pulled the trigger of the gun herself.

614
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,566
Are you saying that she killed
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon?

615
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,693
Yes.

616
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,779
On that day, the defendant fabricated

617
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,990
the record of entry
and exit for her alibi,

618
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,742
and the witness worked on the fabrication.

619
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,454
I'd like to submit the evidence.

620
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,048
And,

621
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,301
there's one more.

622
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,388
Witness.

623
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,973
Are you sure

624
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,725
you can say it?

625
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,607
Yes.

626
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,818
The Division Commander…

627
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,449
also ordered me to kill you,
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

628
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,085
That'll be all.

629
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,268
Now, last but not least, the card to
completely destroy Noh Hwa-young is here.

630
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,198
Are you that happy about it?

631
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,199
Yes.

632
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:24,578
You got sentenced to 15 years,
with more trials to come,

633
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,998
and you look great in that.

634
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,878
What did I do so wrong to you?

635
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,799
I have nothing to do with your parents'
murder. It was all Noh's doing.

636
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,137
What about President Cha Ho-chul's death?

637
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,892
As the prosecutor in charge,
you fabricated the case,

638
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,061
framed him for false charges,

639
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,230
and planned
Won Ki-choon's press conference

640
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,899
and his testimony in court.

641
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,152
That was all.
I didn't do anything more than that.

642
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,320
Okay.

643
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,323
I heard you're preparing for an appeal.

644
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,076
This time, I will make

645
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,538
an offer you can't refuse.

646
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,719
I'd like to summon a witness
for the charge of instigation of murder

647
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,930
of President Cha Ho-chul six years ago.

648
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,599
It's former CEO Yong Moon-goo
of IM Defense Industry.

649
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,489
Objection!

650
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,950
The witness is currently serving time

651
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,202
and had a big fight with the defendant.

652
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,830
He has a high chance
of committing perjury out of spite.

653
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,875
The witness volunteered to attend
to correct his wrongdoings

654
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,877
from his days as a prosecutor.

655
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,630
Please take the witness' brave choice
into consideration, Your Honor.

656
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,133
I will summon the witness.

657
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,509
Please be seated.

658
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,356
Were you the prosecutor
in charge of the case

659
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,401
in which President Cha Ho-chul
of IM Defense was involved in?

660
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,652
Yes.

661
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,990
Was Noh Hwa-young, the defendant,
involved in the case?

662
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,993
Yes, she was definitely involved
in the case.

663
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,497
Definitely.

664
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,957
Please tell us the details
of that situation.

665
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,836
I was ordered by Noh Hwa-young.

666
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,715
She ordered me to frame
President Cha Ho-chul for corruption

667
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,342
and to fabricate the case.

668
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,551
So,

669
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,886
did you cooperate?

670
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,180
Yes.

671
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,975
I drank from the poisoned chalice
for a guaranteed future.

672
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,228
Your Honor.

673
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,231
I hereby submit the evidence
related to that testimony.

674
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,157
Witness.

675
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,577
Do you have evidence related
to the instigation of murder?

676
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,829
The conversation
between me and the defendant

677
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,499
are on the phone I used at that time.

678
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,460
I will submit it
right after the trial is over.

679
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,672
So are you saying
you only fabricated the case,

680
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,840
and you are not involved in the murder?

681
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,801
That's right.

682
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,928
I found out after President Cha died.

683
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,306
I, Noh Hwa-young,

684
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,601
have not lived my life
for myself, even for a moment.

685
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,727
I served

686
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,355
only the nation and the people.

687
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,234
The peace and goodwill
of this nation you're enjoying…

688
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,944
Who do you think gave you those?

689
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,155
Do you know what it's like
to live as a serviceperson

690
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,285
in a country where the war
can break out anytime, even tomorrow?

691
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,122
In order to protect
the military discipline,

692
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,791
I treated ranks and orders
like they were my life,

693
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,669
and I tried my best
to train strong servicepeople.

694
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,339
But is this what I get

695
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,966
for all of that?

696
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,052
That evil witch did all of these!

697
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,555
Noh Hwa-young is truly an evil witch!

698
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,889
You ordered me to do it!

699
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:17,686
My life is ruined because of you!
You're the worst flaw in my life!

700
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:21,815
-What? You served the country?
-That's enough! Order!

701
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,234
Hey, Noh Hwa-young!

702
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,156
The prosecution,
please request the sentencing.

703
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,242
The defendant has been committing

704
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,578
all kinds of horrible crimes

705
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,289
for the past 20 years
using her status as a serviceperson,

706
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,499
and she's been concealing her crimes

707
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,794
in meticulous and sly ways above rank.

708
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,005
The defendant was

709
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,008
an extremely proud serviceperson,

710
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,970
but she made herself collapse
due to her unconditional greed for power.

711
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,224
In the end, the military does not change
because servicepeople like her

712
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,101
are in the military.

713
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,312
The ranks

714
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,064
and the orders

715
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,526
must exist only for this nation,

716
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,531
and they must never be used for
the personal purposes of an individual.

717
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,078
Therefore, I,
the military prosecutor, request

718
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,748
the death sentence for the defendant.

719
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,266
Doctor, Mr. Noh Tae-nam just woke up.

720
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:55,492
The court finds all charges brought up
by the prosecution guilty.

721
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,454
Therefore, the court
sentences the verdict.

722
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,289
The verdict.

723
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,627
The court sentences
the defendant to death.

724
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,597
Don't touch me.

725
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,975
I'll walk on my own.

726
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,657
I'll quit being a military prosecutor.

727
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,826
What?

728
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,789
I will reveal everything I did
as the red-haired girl.

729
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,041
Do you have to do that?

730
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,335
-You only did that to criminals--
-Yes.

731
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,378
I have to do that.

732
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,466
I decided to do it from the start.
I'm prepared for this.

733
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,426
I do not qualify

734
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,846
to wear the prosecutor's robe anymore.

735
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:41,807
Prosecutor Cha.

736
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,267
Prosecutor Doh.

737
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,612
-They're here!
-They're coming!

738
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,162
As of today, I, Cha Woo-in,

739
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,290
wish to resign from being
a military prosecutor of the 4th Division.

740
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,087
I've been wearing a red wig

741
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,925
and punishing criminals
who could not be punished by the law.

742
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,145
ONE YEAR LATER

743
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,316
My gosh!

744
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,360
This is killing me!

745
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,989
Soo-kyung, just get a cesarean section,
as the doctor said!

746
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,991
This is breaking my heart!

747
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,369
I'm over 40, but I can still do it.

748
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,581
I will give birth to my baby on my own!

749
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,837
Prosecutor Doh!

750
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,923
Is the office of justice
of the 4th Division doing well without me?

751
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,550
Wait!

752
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,969
Bae-man!

753
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,930
Auntie! Auntie, cheer up!

754
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,104
Thank you.

755
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,333
What the…

756
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,713
What's the point of locking them up
when they get released so fast?

757
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,716
They reduced my sentencing
for being a model prisoner.

758
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,638
Why is this country
so generous to economic criminals?

759
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,639
I know, right?

760
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,268
I didn't have bad intentions,
so it was taken into consideration.

761
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,229
"Love the sinner, but hate the sin."

762
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,690
That applies to this situation.

763
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,443
I paid for all of my crimes.

764
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,904
You should have told me.
I could have bought tofu.

765
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:02,822
No…

766
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,951
How about we go
and have tofu soup with soju?

767
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,370
That's too bad.

768
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,165
I don't like tofu.

769
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,085
Where are you going?

770
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,589
I'm going back to the U.S. soon.

771
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,217
I'm going to start over from the bottom,

772
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,844
because I finished giving IM
back to Woo-in.

773
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,390
Bye.

774
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,603
Woo-in is coming to Korea tomorrow.

775
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,068
Have a safe trip back.

776
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,168
The inmate refused to see you.

777
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,673
Then…

778
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,759
can you please deliver this to her?

779
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,186
Mother. How are you doing?

780
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,355
I'm doing fine.

781
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,942
Bolt who you've never hugged

782
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,903
and who was my only family…

783
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,406
I sent him
to Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

784
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:31,911
I cried a lot after I sent him,
but I feel like I've matured a lot.

785
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:38,126
I hope
that you are doing well in there, too.

786
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,671
I don't know when it will be…

787
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,799
but I want to see you someday.

788
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,843
Mom.

789
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,369
Where is it?

790
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,418
Woo-in.

791
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,379
You…

792
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,257
You came just in time.

793
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,762
I'm glad
that I get to see you before I go.

794
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,686
You went through a lot.

795
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,274
No.

796
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,986
I hope you don't have to
get any more revenge now.

797
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,198
And run IM well.

798
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,242
I mean it.

799
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,871
I bought lots of IM's stocks.
You have to do a good job.

800
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,540
I'll be watching you.

801
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,877
You haven't changed at all
since I met you for the first time.

802
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,797
Except for one thing.

803
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,351
Now it's finally back to its true owner.

804
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,823
You really are a great friend to me.

805
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,662
I got to go.

806
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,706
Okay.

807
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,708
Contact me often.

808
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,001
Okay.

809
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,820
Noh Tae-nam gave
all of his shares to Woo-in.

810
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,469
Bolt!

811
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,017
Thank you, Noh Tae-nam.

812
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,395
I know it wasn't easy for you
to decide to send Bolt to me.

813
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,022
My boy Bolt

814
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,483
is the most loyal
and the bravest boy ever,

815
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,485
so being a military dog suits him better.

816
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,445
So,

817
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,697
please take care of him.

818
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,366
Well, sure.

819
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,580
I heard you gave all of your shares
of IM to Cha Woo-in.

820
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,211
Well, my mom gave me those, anyway.

821
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:13,132
My mom lost everything,
so it would be wrong for me to keep those.

822
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,261
Is she still refusing to see you?

823
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,764
Yes.

824
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,351
Well, I'm sure she'll see me someday.

825
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:28,189
PRESIDENT CHA WOO-IN

826
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,478
Dad?

827
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,482
My daughter.

828
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,319
It's been hard for you, right?

829
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,990
Dad.

830
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,617
You went through a lot.

831
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,037
And,

832
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,832
thank you, my daughter.

833
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,879
If you sit in that chair,

834
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,091
things are going to get harder.

835
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,178
Can you do it?

836
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,263
Yes.

837
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,391
I will do it.

838
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,227
Please watch me.

839
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,742
President Cha, you have a guest.

840
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,786
What? A guest?

841
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,372
But I'm quite busy today.

842
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,457
Who is it?

843
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,210
She's from the office of justice
of the 4th Division.

844
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,213
Shall I politely tell her to leave?

845
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:19,092
No. Please cancel all of my
other schedules for today.

846
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,094
Yes, ma'am. I'll bring her in.

847
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,933
Prosecutor Cha!

848
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,938
I mean… President Cha.

849
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,107
Subsection Chief Ahn!

850
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,526
How have you been?

851
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,237
Come on! You didn't even call us
all this time?

852
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,532
And how can you look so dashing like this?

853
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,244
How's Subsection Chief Yoon?

854
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,162
He's still the same.

855
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:53,209
By the way, aren't you curious
about Prosecutor Doh?

856
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,967
Are you Prosecutor Doh Bae-man
who rejected the special promotion?

857
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,635
Captain Doh Bae-man.

858
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,845
Yes, ma'am.

859
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,264
What's the reason?

860
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,726
All servicepeople want
to be in a high rank.

861
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,938
I think military prosecutors
are the protectors of justice

862
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,524
in the military
who can refuse ranks and orders.

863
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:20,695
I wish to do a better job in carrying out
the duties the people gave me.

864
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:26,117
And I still have
a lot of things left to do

865
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,535
as a military prosecutor.

866
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,247
You really are brave
like a Doberman, just as I heard.

867
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,168
I will do my best
to command the 4th Division, too.

868
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,753
Yes, ma'am!

869
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,379
Salute!

870
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,017
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

871
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,228
-Goodbye.
-Okay, bye.

872
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,377
Cha Woo-in.

873
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,545
It's me.

874
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,966
Wow, you still look good in your uniform.

875
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,554
What the heck?

876
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,139
You said you were busy.

877
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:34,811
You've become a totally different
person now, Prosecutor Cha.

878
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,687
I'm not a prosecutor anymore.

879
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,189
I'm a civilian.

880
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,858
Which means I'm not your subordinate.

881
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,237
That's right.

882
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,655
You aren't.

883
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,991
