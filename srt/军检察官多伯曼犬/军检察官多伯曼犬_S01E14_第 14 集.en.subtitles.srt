1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,067
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,193
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,278
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,822
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,451
THE TRIAL FOR THE MASS SHOOTING
AT A GOP IN THE 4TH DIVISION

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,332
Was there any form of cruelty
that took place in the GOP platoon

8
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,835
before the mass shooting occurred?

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,013
There wasn't…

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,391
any cruelty.

11
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,317
A FEW DAYS AGO

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
Report everything truthfully,
without a single lie.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,534
Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho
submitted a few Letters of the Heart.

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,453
Then why did this happen?

15
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,163
You see…

16
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,706
Answer me!

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,292
Why didn't you take any action?

18
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,752
We did take action, ma'am.

19
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,920
How?

20
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,839
We made those involved run a few laps
in the training ground--

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,092
Stand up straight.

22
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,719
Yes, Division Commander.

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,096
Listen carefully.

24
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,266
There were no signs. Understand?

25
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,060
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,771
Did you understand what I said?

27
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,147
There were no signs

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,691
from Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho.

29
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,237
Yes.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,780
Salute.

31
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,680
The X-files of the Patriotic Society…

32
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,768
If you didn't know, and if Division
Commander Noh doesn't have it too…

33
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,355
Noh Tae-nam?

34
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,776
He was IM's owner
after Cha Ho-chul died, so…

35
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,487
No way.

36
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,532
That kid can't possibly know
about what she doesn't.

37
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,534
Still, we need to check.

38
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:41,870
But…

39
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,957
Do Doh Bae-man and Cha Woo-in
know about the X-files, too?

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,834
I never told them myself.

41
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,669
I don't think they do.

42
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,800
Why are you telling me something
that you didn't even tell them?

43
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,763
CEO Cha Ho-chul
didn't want me to tell her.

44
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,390
He asked me many times.

45
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,684
He said the X-files
contain tons of corruption

46
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,270
between the military
and the defense industry companies,

47
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,063
and the battle will be against

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,358
the entire rotten
defense industry of this country.

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,071
He was saying those enemies
are too powerful for Woo-in.

50
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,496
Hey.

51
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,342
A mass shooting occurred
in the front lines.

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,719
A mass shooting?

53
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,804
At a GOP in the 4th Division,
where Noh Tae-nam is.

54
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,141
Did Noh Tae-nam…

55
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,477
hold the gun…

56
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,687
or get shot?

57
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,483
It should be neither.

58
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,402
He should neither kill…

59
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,655
nor be killed.

60
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,791
It looks like Private First Class Pyeon
did the shooting due to cruelty.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,585
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

62
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,546
He's remaining silent
about his motive behind the crime, too.

63
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,423
He wasn't remaining silent.

64
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,177
Why do you think that the motive
for crime doesn't matter?

65
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,512
Because…

66
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,516
everything's just an excuse.

67
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,060
He said it's an excuse, right?

68
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,520
An excuse…

69
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,484
It's either you die
from putting up with the cruelty

70
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,405
or finally snap and kill everyone.

71
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,075
We can't jump to conclusions
about the cruelty,

72
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,910
but it's also our job to

73
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,080
accurately figure out the truth
before it's taken to court.

74
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,875
We'll find out when we meet
the surviving soldiers.

75
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,091
President Noh.

76
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,012
I was so relieved to hear
that you're at a hospital.

77
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,975
You have no idea

78
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,020
how anxious I was, because I was worried

79
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,189
that you might have been the shooter.

80
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,650
I just asked you

81
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,527
if you did the mass shooting.

82
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,446
Did this happen because of you?

83
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,328
-Make way!
-He's an emergency patient!

84
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,245
Move!

85
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,215
Mom, help me, please!

86
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,928
President Noh, what's wrong? Are you okay?

87
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,221
What? Are you okay…

88
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,313
Noh Tae-nam.

89
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,450
You were harassed by Sergeant Ma, too.

90
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,660
Let's go find him together.

91
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,578
Why?

92
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,748
Don't you want to kill Sergeant Ma?

93
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,751
Then you're no different from him.

94
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,294
You're no different from him!

95
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,425
I couldn't help it, either.

96
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,469
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

97
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,805
Sang-ho, please don't kill me!

98
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,556
Please don't kill me!

99
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,936
Help!

100
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,937
Help!

101
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,234
Are you okay?

102
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,204
I think he's showing symptoms of PTSD.

103
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,333
He's turned into a totally
different person after the shooting.

104
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,753
I'll interrogate Noh Tae-nam.

105
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,089
And I'll interrogate
the surviving soldiers.

106
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,424
And Yong Moon-goo, too.

107
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,804
I'm sure he's not here
because he's worried about Noh Tae-nam.

108
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,848
Go on.

109
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,904
I'm sure you're not here
as Noh Tae-nam's attorney.

110
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,949
Why are you here?

111
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,619
You don't move unless
there is something to gain.

112
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,915
I guess you found nothing and is leaving.

113
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,754
Well, to be frank,
you two failed to gain anything.

114
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,382
I'm talking about CEO Kang Ha-joon.

115
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,929
He brought an amazing gift as a reward
for saving his company.

116
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,182
You mean the material on Won Ki-choon?

117
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,351
Come on, do you think
I'd be satisfied by just that?

118
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,647
It's information that would shock you
and Prosecutor Cha.

119
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,774
I was really shocked, too.

120
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,236
I'm curious about it, too.

121
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,739
That's enough provoking.

122
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,366
I can hear the sound
of your brain scheming.

123
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,078
It's so interesting.

124
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,372
You two and Kang Ha-joon.

125
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,918
This reality, in which yesterday's friends
are today's foes.

126
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,838
The battlefield isn't a separate place.

127
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,424
Life itself is a war.

128
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,427
Don't you think?

129
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,289
KANG HA-JOON

130
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,499
Hey.

131
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,961
Does Mr. Noh know about
the X-files of the Patriotic Society?

132
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
I didn't even get to ask him.

133
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,090
Noh Tae-nam is in bad condition.

134
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,634
I'm sure he is,
because he survived a mass shooting.

135
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,304
I'll check with him again after the trial
is over and he gets better.

136
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,432
Are we going to stop looking
for the X-files until then?

137
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,934
Of course not.

138
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,980
Go to the military prison.

139
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,314
Yes, CEO.

140
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,128
Private Noh Tae-nam.

141
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,796
How do you feel?

142
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,048
Did you calm down a bit?

143
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,345
I have a few questions for you
regarding this case.

144
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,851
You confronted the military manpower
who went to the scene,

145
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,644
with a gun in your hand.

146
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,565
Are you asking me if I shot them, too?

147
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,317
We're not.

148
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,694
You're a victim, too.

149
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,240
A victim?

150
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,159
Yes.

151
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,703
We already confirmed
that you have no charges

152
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,080
through the initial investigation report.

153
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,584
Pyeon Sang-ho also testified that
he committed the crime all by himself.

154
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,505
But why

155
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,592
were you holding a gun?

156
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,681
Private First Class Pyeon gave it to me.

157
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,437
You were harassed by Sergeant Ma, too.

158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,064
Let's go find him together.

159
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,150
If he gave you a gun
instead of shooting you,

160
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,736
that means he harbors
no hostility toward you?

161
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,990
I don't want to know why.
And I don't know why he did that, either.

162
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,869
Were you close
to Private First Class Pyeon?

163
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,372
The record shows
that he's your direct superior.

164
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,498
No.

165
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,124
I wasn't close to him.

166
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,959
I wasn't close to anyone…

167
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,087
there.

168
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:13,964
I see.

169
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,061
Now, here's the most important question.

170
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,734
Was there any form of cruelty
in the GOP platoon?

171
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,907
From now on, all of us should get
our story straight, just as I told you.

172
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,326
If any of you get it wrong,

173
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,413
we'll all go to the military prison.

174
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,416
We can never get out
of this sick military.

175
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,375
Get it?

176
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,421
Those military prosecutor bastards
can never find the evidence, anyway,

177
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,132
unless we confess.

178
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,441
There wasn't…

179
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,611
any cruelty.

180
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,698
There wasn't?

181
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,077
Are you sure?

182
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,413
Yes.

183
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:28,998
Cruelty?

184
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,000
That never happened.

185
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,419
We were all nice
to Private First Class Pyeon.

186
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,421
What about all of you?

187
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,091
Sergeant Ma is right.
We were all nice to him.

188
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,845
Pyeon said the military life was hard,
but we were all nice to him.

189
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,014
Yes, we took good care of him.

190
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,232
How's Noh Tae-nam?

191
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,234
He has calmed down a bit.

192
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,238
Noh Tae-nam testified
that there wasn't any cruelty.

193
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,824
The surviving soldiers
all said the same thing.

194
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,410
All of them did?

195
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,495
Yes.

196
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,456
But there are no details
in their testimonies.

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,459
Are you doubting them?

198
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,170
For this case,
I will not jump to conclusions

199
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,671
for any of the parties.

200
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,716
What did Yong Moon-goo say?

201
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,803
He looked like he caught
a really delicious prey.

202
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,805
A prey?

203
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,682
But we don't need to worry.

204
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,895
I'm the expert on Yong Moon-goo,
who knows him better than he does.

205
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:44,949
Nohkachu.

206
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,493
Did you answer properly?

207
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,912
Answer me!

208
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,384
Tae-nam.

209
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,095
It's all my fault.

210
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,973
I shouldn't have sent you to the military.

211
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,859
You want to be discharged, don't you?

213
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,362
-What?
-I'll have you discharged

214
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,865
and make you IM's CEO again.

215
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,245
But you must say this one thing
to the military prosecutors.

216
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,915
Tell them that there wasn't any cruelty.

217
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,087
That's the way for me
to keep this position.

218
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:46,176
All of the criticism must go
to Private First Class Pyeon.

219
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,512
He killed innocent platoon members.

220
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,392
So, Tae-nam, you should help me.

221
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,813
If you want to go back to the old days.

222
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,775
Back to the days
before you wore a military uniform.

223
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,238
You bastard, answer me!

224
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,284
That crazy bastard, seriously…

225
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,580
Did you answer properly
to the military prosecutor? You bastard!

226
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,083
Hey, answer me! Okay?

227
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,710
You crazy bastard!

228
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,630
Look at you.

229
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,175
Did you lose your mind
because you're outside of the platoon?

230
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,678
Don't touch me, you bastard!

231
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,348
I'm going to get out
of this sick military.

232
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,603
-You bastard! Are you crazy?
-Seriously…

233
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,521
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

234
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,899
Nothing…

235
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,692
nothing happened.

236
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,987
Yes, nothing happened,
just like you all wanted.

237
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,544
Did you meet Hong Moo-seob?

238
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,589
Yes.

239
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,258
Does he know about
the X-files of the Patriotic Society?

240
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,733
Yong Moon-goo…

241
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,946
that sly serpent showed his face
without any shame.

242
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,531
Well?

243
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,449
Are you interested?

244
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,452
But Yong Moon-goo
has nothing to gain from you

245
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,788
since you got kicked out
of the Patriotic Society.

246
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,915
There is one.

247
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
The X-files of the Patriotic Society.

248
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,546
Yong Moon-goo is looking for the X-files?

249
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,258
Yes. He was here to get information.

250
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,514
This is getting more interesting.

251
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,767
Doh Bae-man,
you're looking for the X-files

252
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,352
to destroy the Patriotic Society,

253
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,357
and Yong Moon-goo is looking for it
to take over the Patriotic Society.

254
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,862
Yes, well, no one knows
if that really exists,

255
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,113
but…

256
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,211
That's not possible.

257
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,298
Files like that never disappear
or get covered up.

258
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:34,178
Because the desires of the person
who has it never let that happen.

259
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,018
So, it's just that we don't know
where the X-files are, right?

260
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,395
That's right.

261
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,984
By the way, I think Noh Tae-nam
is showing signs of PTSD.

262
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,820
Well, I guess so.
He just needs to be treated.

263
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,490
You're really indifferent.

264
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,201
Am I?

265
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,828
Do you know…

266
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,164
what that means?

267
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,458
-What that means?
-Yes.

268
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,339
Discharge due to illness,
because of post-traumatic stress disorder?

269
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,133
It means the business
between Minister Lee Jae-sik,

270
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,387
you, and my Kang's Solution
must speed up now.

271
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,141
So you don't get your
current position taken away.

272
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,476
Damn it.

273
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,355
What's their conversation about…

274
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,108
Boss.

275
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,610
What the heck are we even doing?

276
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,572
We're not the 5-minute
battle station, or anything.

277
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,118
Shut up!
And we're not the 5-minute battle station!

278
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,120
Then why are we even here?

279
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,455
You had your place taken away
by that girly jerk,

280
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,792
and you're sitting in a corner with me.

281
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,669
You picky bastard.

282
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,130
I've told you this a hundred times, Ji-ri.

283
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,215
The more CEO Yong's business grows,

284
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,884
the more enemies he makes,
twofold and threefold.

285
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,346
So we never know when
some jerk holding a knife will stab him.

286
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,306
So, in five minutes…

287
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,394
I mean, 10 minutes, we--

288
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,147
That means we are the 5-minute
battle station, boss.

289
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,109
You bastard, are you talking back to me
just because your head's grown a bit?

290
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,112
Ever since we met that jerk,
we only delivered money,

291
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,655
cleaned up after servicepeople,

292
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,324
and got shot by BBs, which are for kids.

293
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,746
Do you know how insulting that is?
Didn't we only deal with the top 1%?

294
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,207
-What the…
-Shut up.

295
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,085
I'm trying my best to put up with it, too.

296
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,422
Don't awaken this other
brutal identity of mine

297
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,507
that's crouching inside me, get it?

298
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,302
Boss, you must wake up now!

299
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,887
You should wake up!

300
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,057
You used to be a damn scary man.

301
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,751
Hi.

302
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,379
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure.

303
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,008
I'm a regular here.

304
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,677
What brings you here alone, sir?

305
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,512
Ms. Doh.

306
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,440
This is the first time
such a big incident occurred

307
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,443
since I've taken charge
of the office of justice.

308
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,403
I can't sleep these days,

309
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,864
and this incident
is the only thing I'm thinking of.

310
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:47,246
It breaks my heart
to think of the dead soldiers.

311
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,874
Staff Judge Advocate.

312
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,252
You must judge

313
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:59,049
this case as a prosecutor,
unconditionally.

314
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,552
If you get concerned by the superiors
again, I won't forgive you, okay?

315
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,012
Ms. Doh!

316
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:09,351
How can you say such a thing?
I'm a military prosecutor, too!

317
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,770
I was once a prosecutor like Cha Woo-in!

318
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,232
Yikes! You scared me.
You were like Prosecutor Cha?

319
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,901
I simply can't believe it.

320
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,614
The military made me this way!
The ranks and the orders did!

321
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,450
I still haven't gotten married…

322
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,497
to devote my soul
to the military of this country!

323
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,253
You aren't married either…

324
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,840
As the Staff Judge Advocate,
I ordered them

325
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,926
to investigate this case properly!

326
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,636
I ordered Doh and Cha

327
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,848
to do a proper job! Okay?

328
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,516
Do a proper job!

329
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,191
Staff Judge Advocate,
I now see that you're quite manly.

330
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,821
Are you attracted to me?

331
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,949
Yes, I am.

332
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,453
Have a glass.

333
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,248
Have a glass.

334
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,254
This is great!

335
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,009
Staff Judge Advocate,
why don't we start a fling…

336
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,219
let's skip that. It's bothersome.

337
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,346
-Let's date.
-What?

338
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,059
I have to date you to see
if you're great or not.

339
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,477
You want to date me?

340
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,020
Why?

341
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,397
You don't want to?

342
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,441
Then, never mind. Cancel.

343
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,526
Ma'am, how much is it?

344
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,529
Doh Bae-man's aunt.

345
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,660
You have to give me some time
to think about it, too.

346
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,041
Let's go for round three.

347
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,128
It's not too late to think
after we start dating.

348
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,381
I don't date just anybody.

349
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,926
I'll make sure you won't regret it.

350
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,970
-Ma'am, put it on my tab.
-Okay.

351
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,515
DIVISION COMMANDER
MAJOR GENERAL NOH HWA-YOUNG

352
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,237
Noh Hwa-young.

353
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,781
You clearly said it yourself

354
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,951
that you'll be responsible
if that damn son of yours

355
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,077
causes more trouble!

356
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,495
Minister.

357
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,540
Did you not hear about the case properly?

358
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,500
-What?
-When it comes to this case,

359
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,837
my son is a victim
who could have been killed.

360
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,880
Whatever he was,
he's still involved in it!

361
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,757
I know how your son is!

362
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm sure he made the shooter
hold the gun for him!

363
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,012
You need to watch your language, Minister.

364
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,098
What did you say?

365
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,686
Explain what you just said
and take responsibility for what happened!

366
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,021
You told the Minister you'd resign!

367
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,858
You talk too much for someone resigning!

368
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,819
Are you going to let
the Vice Corps Commander hear

369
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,155
what I'm going to say now?

370
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,531
Shall I just say it?

371
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,995
I'm being considerate to you,
so please choose.

372
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,874
Noh Hwa-young, you're just so…

373
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,211
Go wait outside, Vice Corps Commander.

374
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,172
-Minister…
-Get out!

375
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,020
Noh Hwa-young…

376
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,023
I swear I'll finish you with my own hands.

377
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,155
Why are these doors so thick?

378
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,450
I can't hear anything.

379
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,039
You get dismissed from your position
and go to the rear.

380
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,249
I'll call you when it quiets down.

381
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,338
This is the most considerate thing
I can do for you.

382
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,632
I cannot resign as

383
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,926
the Division Commander
for something like this.

384
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,344
What?

385
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,471
"For something like this"?

386
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,849
Thirteen soldiers of your division
lost their lives, you jerk!

387
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,352
If there's someone
who should take responsibility

388
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,354
for this case and resign,

389
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,149
it's not me. It's you.

390
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,944
What… what did you say?

391
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,528
Do you think you got up

392
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,448
to your current position all by yourself?

393
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,533
I put you in your position!

394
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,785
I, Noh Hwa-young, did!

395
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,994
What?

396
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,248
You've gone totally mad
because of your son!

397
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,001
You've finally shown
your filthy true colors to me!

398
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,254
I'll hear no more.

399
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,421
You!

400
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,298
You'll be dishonorably discharged soon!

401
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,094
That's an order, Noh Hwa-young!

402
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,145
I carried out your order perfectly.

403
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,649
I told you to find ways to make
that investigator couple understand!

404
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,901
I didn't tell you to kill them, you jerk!

405
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,488
Cutting off any potential problems
at the root is the way I found.

406
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,533
That's the only way
to prevent further trouble.

407
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,910
Are you nuts? You idiot!

408
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,829
Colonel, you must now…

409
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,082
Be on my side

410
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,961
until the end,
as long as I remain in the military.

411
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,006
That was what I said.

412
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,173
You…

413
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,759
How dare you…

414
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,178
How could you!

415
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,932
I've been wiretapping you for a long time.

416
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,312
Which means this recording
is just the tip of the iceberg.

417
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,397
Hey!

418
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,610
Are you even aware
that this can destroy you too?

419
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,112
There's no battle you can win

420
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,239
without getting your hands
covered in blood.

421
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,285
All wars require blood to win.

422
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,581
I was always ready
to have a puddle of blood

423
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,750
under my feet

424
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,669
in order for me to get up to

425
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,838
a higher place.

426
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,718
Because this is the world of men

427
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,179
who are scared
to have their hands covered in blood.

428
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,850
So…

429
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,270
if you want to stay
in that position longer,

430
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,856
take care of this case immediately.

431
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,361
From this moment on,
I give you orders, Minister.

432
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,579
Salute!

433
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,663
Go on.

434
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,504
What happened, Minister?

435
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,220
CHIEF MILITARY PROSECUTOR SEO JOO-HYUK

436
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,598
Prosecutor Doh, come to my office.

437
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,476
How's the investigation
on the mass shooting going?

438
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,812
Pyeon Sang-ho admitted
to all of his crimes,

439
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,146
and based on the survivors,

440
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,774
we figured out how it was carried out.

441
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,943
There should be the cause of the accident?

442
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,986
We're looking
into the possibility of abuse.

443
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,116
I read the testimonies
of the surviving soldiers.

444
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,035
But you must look into it
a bit further than this!

445
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,287
You're the military prosecutors
of Seo Joo-hyuk!

446
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,919
No parent would want to

447
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,964
send their kids to the military
when things like this happen!

448
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,590
Back in my day,

449
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,093
when a mass shooting like this occurred,

450
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,387
they tried to cover up the case

451
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,181
and made people even angrier!

452
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,893
We, the military prosecutors,
must keep calm

453
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,897
and figure out the truth more accurately
for cases like this!

454
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,526
That was what we did back in my day!
So you guys should do the same!

455
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,612
-Get it?
-Yes, Staff Judge Advocate.

456
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,947
Yes, sir.

457
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,366
Soon-to-be Lieutenant Colonel.

458
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,784
Salute!

459
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,287
Salute!

460
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,874
-You can go now.
-Yes, sir.

461
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,877
Let's go get some latte, Cha.

462
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,879
Do it accurately! Accurately!

463
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,255
Yes, sir!

464
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,679
It must have been your first time going
to a scene of a mass shooting.

465
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,014
What was it like?

466
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,393
I saw how a war truly is with my own eyes.

467
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,937
It was simply horrendous.

468
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,192
Private First Class Pyeon
isn't telling his motive at all,

469
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,486
so it'll be hard
for our two military prosecutors

470
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,904
to request the sentencing.

471
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,158
Prosecutor Doh will find out
if there was cruelty or not.

472
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,037
You know, like how the doctors
can diagnose immediately

473
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,122
by looking at an X-ray photo.

474
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,625
It's the same for experienced
military prosecutors.

475
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,543
What's Prosecutor Doh's specialty?

476
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,378
-His hunch.
-His hunch…

477
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,756
It was incredible in the past, too.

478
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,468
The juniors called him Fortune Teller Doh.

479
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,931
He's now a five-year-old
walking body of big data.

480
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,560
By the way, I've always been curious.

481
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,814
What's your connection to Prosecutor Doh?

482
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,025
I even heard you call him
by his name from time to time.

483
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,569
Why are you trying to find out about that?

484
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,037
Stop.

485
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,425
Are you MC Sang-ki?

486
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,479
Why are you taking him away?

487
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,773
He's not the culprit.

488
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,316
That's what my hunch says.

489
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,527
Come with me.

490
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,891
I knew it.

491
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:37,437
So Prosecutor Doh led you
to the path of a military investigator.

492
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,482
Yes, I tried to go to law school
to become a military prosecutor like him,

493
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,984
but I was not competent enough.

494
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,237
And I got crazy nosebleeds
to become a military investigator.

495
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,282
Though that nosebleed
made me who I am now.

496
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,451
What? Your nose is bleeding now.

497
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,746
-What? My nose is bleeding? Now?
-Yes.

498
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,539
-Lift your head.
-That can't be.

499
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,585
This nosebleed brings back memories.
I guess I am overworked these days.

500
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,045
Yes, you worked too much.

501
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,505
-Do you have a tissue?
-Yes, I'll get you some.

502
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,092
Is it because I winked?
I feel embarrassed.

503
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,802
THE MND - KANG'S SOLUTION
AND IM DEFENSE INDUSTRY

504
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,762
SIGNS AN MOU FOR THE NEW WEAPONS PROJECT

505
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,153
YONG MOON-GOO

506
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,740
LEE JAE-SIK

507
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,754
Now, the contract has been signed.

508
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,634
You will never regret trusting me.

509
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,260
Thank you, Minister.

510
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,014
I heard the project introducing
new weapons is a national secret.

511
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,850
I will learn a lot from CEO Yong.

512
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,227
That's the reason

513
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,063
it's hard to cut off corruption
in the defense industry.

514
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,857
It's easy to keep it confidential,
and there's no aftermath.

515
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,111
By the way,

516
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,448
is there a reason
why you rushed this contract?

517
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,618
I must get rid of Noh Hwa-young…

518
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,249
by using this contract for new weapons.

519
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,586
What?

520
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,131
What's this about, all of a sudden…

521
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:33,344
CEO Yong, I will help you
with everything I can so you can take IM

522
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,180
from Noh Hwa-young completely.

523
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,308
Thank you so much.

524
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,103
I will serve you with my utmost loyalty.

525
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,024
If there has to be someone above me,
it only has to be you, Minister.

526
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,029
Next is about
the Ministry of National Defense.

527
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,407
The MND signed an MOU
for a new weapon project

528
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,745
with the consortium
of Kang's Solution and IM Defense.

529
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,789
Through this MOU,
Kang's Solution and IM Defense

530
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,625
will receive orders
for main projects that will be financed

531
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,627
with 10% of the national defense budget

532
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,755
to start working
on the new weapons project.

533
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,089
Until now…

534
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,640
NOH HWA-YOUNG

535
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,108
So you're calling after watching the news.

536
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,861
Why should I hear about that
through the news?

537
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:35,907
I was actually going to
visit you and explain it to you soon.

538
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,077
You will have to give me a clear
and plausible explanation.

539
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,164
Don't worry, General.
You're going to understand it right away.

540
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,715
Personnel at the MND said this MOU will…

541
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,844
Yong moon-goo, CEO Kang,
and Lee Jae-sik signed that.

542
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,056
It's a clear sign of internal conflict
in the Patriotic Society.

543
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,226
Hong Moo-seob got kicked out,
so the servicepeople

544
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,562
of the Patriotic Society will choose
either Lee Jae-sik or Noh Hwa-young

545
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,481
and start a war of loyalty.

546
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,734
It's important to identify friends
or foes in a war.

547
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,113
And there is someone
who's now in a difficult situation.

548
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,532
Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang-in.

549
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,243
Want me to tell you why I am above you?

550
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,828
It's simple.

551
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,580
It's because I'm a stronger
serviceperson than you.

552
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,627
A symbol of incompetent servicepeople
with male chauvinism.

553
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,672
He put on his uniform
with the strong belief

554
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,674
that he will never take orders from women,

555
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,593
but now, he's being trampled
by a woman's military boots.

556
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,429
What happened, Minister?

557
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,892
He's been holding onto the line
called Hong Moo-seob to survive until now,

558
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,019
but with that line gone now,

559
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,772
his entire military career is at risk.

560
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,817
He's being looked down on
by Noh Hwa-young,

561
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,862
and he's still not acknowledged
by Lee Jae-sik.

562
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,491
I'm going to use Heo Kang-in as the bait.

563
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,244
The bait?

564
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,455
He's not a game?

565
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,374
Heo Kang-in is a bait.

566
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,459
A bait to catch a big fish.

567
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,712
Yes, that sounds all right.

568
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,840
Since Yong Moon-goo
is after the X-files right now,

569
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,676
we need something big, too.

570
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,346
Let's finish Private First
Class Pyeon's trial first,

571
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,100
and catch a big fish with the bait.

572
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,617
Military Prosecutor.

573
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,539
Can I see my son one more time, please?

574
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,543
I have to give these to him, but I can't.

575
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,631
I've been waiting for you two to come.

576
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,758
Please, I beg you.

577
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,761
My son has bad eyesight.

578
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,805
I beg you.

579
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,809
I understand how you feel,

580
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,937
but it's a bit tricky to

581
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,772
meet the defendant's mother repeatedly

582
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,774
right before the trial.

583
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,151
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,002
You do the second interrogation
on Private First Class Pyeon.

585
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,879
I have to go to
the Division Commander's office to report.

586
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,422
Yes, sir.

587
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,715
By the way…

588
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:45,846
You let him meet his mother last time,
but why did you refuse this time?

589
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,352
-That's…
-His mother did nothing wrong.

590
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,646
I know how you feel,

591
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,232
but let's stop being emotional.

592
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,654
Yes, sir.

593
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,010
I'll give these to him.

594
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,220
Really?

595
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,057
Thank you.

596
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,227
I can't thank you enough.

597
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:35,980
Thank you.

598
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,963
I just got the report
from the Staff Judge Advocate

599
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,382
about all of the surviving soldiers

600
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,635
giving the same testimony,
stating there was no abuse.

601
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,220
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,056
What did Private Noh Tae-nam say?

603
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,932
He testified that there was no cruelty.

604
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,894
I see.

605
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,063
Is the suspect giving the same testimony?

606
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,607
Prosecutor Cha is
doing an additional interrogation.

607
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:22,985
Additional?

608
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,947
Is it because you think
there was cruelty or other reasons?

609
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:31,243
It's the office of justice's plan
to investigate more meticulously.

610
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:32,912
Really?

611
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,466
-Doh Bae-man.
-Captain Doh Bae-man.

612
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,010
Do you think you'll be able
to argue with me,

613
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,472
asking me if I see this case
as a mother or a division commander?

614
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,185
As for this case, I'm a mother
of a soldier who's a victim.

615
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,440
My son survived but he's in deep shock.

616
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,945
Don't dig into the pain
of the surviving soldiers anymore.

617
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,280
You need to keep that in mind.

618
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,416
Have a seat.

619
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,303
Your mother told me to give them to you.

620
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,180
Now…

621
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,226
you won't be able to see your mother
until the trial begins.

622
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,771
Is it okay for me to take these?

623
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,690
Put them on.

624
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,901
Your mother tried very hard
to give them to you.

625
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,497
How can I even dare to wear these?

626
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,339
Those glasses…

627
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,175
when were they broken?

628
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,345
That's not a difficult question.

629
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,931
Why can't you answer it?

630
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,560
It looks like someone
broke them on purpose.

631
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:21,937
Or…

632
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,191
did it get broken
and you had to tape them back?

633
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,943
Yes.

634
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,863
They were broken…

635
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,074
but Tae-nam fixed them for me.

636
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,327
Noh Tae-nam did?

637
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,204
Were you close
to Private First Class Pyeon?

638
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,415
The record shows
that he's your direct superior.

639
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,625
No.

640
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,460
I wasn't close to him.

641
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,962
I wasn't close to anyone…

642
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,173
there.

643
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,425
Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho.

644
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,054
You spared Noh Tae-nam
on purpose, didn't you?

645
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,350
Because Noh Tae-nam didn't harass you.

646
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,684
Aren't I right?

647
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,857
-Prosecutor Doh.
-Yes.

648
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,860
The interrogation is still going on,
so I wanted to see it here.

649
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,244
That Cha Woo-in…

650
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,248
Private First Class Pyeon finally spoke.

651
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:23,832
Did he?

652
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,756
The surviving soldiers stated
that there wasn't any cruelty at all.

653
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,092
They said everyone was nice to you.

654
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,511
You said that…

655
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,473
the motive for crime doesn't matter
at the last interrogation, right?

656
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,184
And that everything you say
will be nothing but an excuse.

657
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,155
Your mother…

658
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,826
will not think of your words as an excuse.

659
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,371
If you don't say anything,

660
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,914
then your mother…

661
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,708
has to live as a mother of…

662
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,419
a brutal killer for the rest of her life.

663
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,692
There was

664
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,735
cruelty.

665
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,912
At first, Sergeant Ma
and only a few of them did it,

666
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,959
but the more I put up with it,
the more soldiers joined to harass me,

667
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,837
and even those who didn't harass me

668
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,050
laughed at me and ignored me
when they saw me.

669
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,556
The GOP Commander and the Vice
GOP Commander were the same, too.

670
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,392
They were all devils.

671
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,728
It was like hell every day,

672
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,147
and I was so scared that

673
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,233
another day was coming.

674
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,418
We got his testimony
thanks to those glasses.

675
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,047
The abuse in the platoon
was indeed the cause.

676
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,049
Once Pyeon's trial is over,

677
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,885
we should start investigating
the acts of abuse.

678
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,513
I'm sure they acted as a group
to cover it up.

679
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,807
Everyone involved must be punished.

680
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,433
The problem is…

681
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,103
the survivors all have the same story.

682
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,314
It means it'll be hard
to get their testimonies.

683
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,651
Still, there's a chance

684
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,736
one of those witnesses
may change his mind.

685
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,863
One of the witnesses?

686
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,242
The Ministry of National Defense
is going to hold a joint funeral

687
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,453
for the 13 soldiers of
the 4th Infantry Division who were killed

688
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,872
in the mass shooting at its GOP.

689
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,168
Whatever accidents occur in here,

690
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,509
they will suspect you first.

691
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,469
Because you are…

692
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,097
Noh Tae-nam, a troublemaker soldier.

693
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,900
That doggone bastard.

694
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,738
Tae-nam, why did you curse like that?

695
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,783
I'm pissed off,
so don't make things worse.

696
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,077
Hey, even if we're angry,

697
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,496
let's never compare them to dogs.

698
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,418
Sergeant Ahn and Sergeant Ma
are just pieces of garbage.

699
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,463
That's what I think.

700
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,174
I think dogs are way better than humans.

701
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,468
Dogs are not greedy and they're nice.

702
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,928
But humans are greedy and selfish.

703
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,224
They're all mean as hell,
like the superiors here.

704
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,311
To a human, a dog is just
a part of his or her life,

705
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,480
but to a dog, a human is everything.

706
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,316
You're right.

707
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,527
Bolt is my family. My only family.

708
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,947
We the dog lovers must never

709
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,408
use the word "doggone"
when we curse, okay?

710
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,745
Yes, sir.

711
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,539
Never.

712
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,336
Let's go.

713
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,088
Hurry.

714
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,428
The Army is going to hold
a casualty judging committee

715
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,973
to give the victims
posthumous honors and promotions…

716
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,644
Hey, that means they're going
to give us compensation, right?

717
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,313
-Wow, really?
-See? They are.

718
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,023
We're on!

719
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,608
You look more handsome on TV!

720
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,236
-But I'm a patient.
-My leg.

721
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,781
Won't they give us a million won?

722
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,699
The government won't give us just that.

723
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,326
I'm guessing 20 million, at least.

724
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,954
Yes, we worked hard for this country.

725
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,873
-I think I'm still in pain.
-Stop making a fuss. Take that.

726
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,083
It really hurts.

727
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,882
Even if we put Noh Tae-nam
in the witness' seat,

728
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,259
nothing's going to change.

729
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,802
I know.

730
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,807
For this trial,
the verdict isn't the important part.

731
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:38,230
Have you worked on
a hard case like this before?

732
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,149
This is my first time, too.

733
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,032
The soldiers are the victims.
We must never forget that.

734
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,118
Yes, sir.

735
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,914
This is a case where the victims become
the perpetrators and the other way around.

736
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:03,046
No one can be victorious in this trial,
so it seems even more difficult.

737
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,844
Today, the trial
for the mass shooting at a GOP

738
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,263
is going to be held at the military court.

739
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,890
It's been told
that he was indicted for murder

740
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,684
and other charges as well,

741
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,520
therefore everyone's curious
about what the verdict will be

742
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,230
for Private First Class Pyeon.

743
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,610
Was there any cruelty in the GOP platoon?

744
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,030
How were things between the soldiers?

745
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,699
How are your injuries?

746
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,075
Please say something!

747
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,204
Military Prosecution,
please testify everything.

748
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,998
THE TRIAL FOR THE MASS SHOOTING
AT A GOP IN THE 4TH DIVISION

749
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,803
The incident started when the defendant,
who was on guard duty,

750
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,180
started to assault the superior
who was with him.

751
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,140
You bastard!

752
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,940
After that,

753
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,734
he took a grenade and a gun,
went to the barracks,

754
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,114
and threw the grenade
at the soldiers who were in the lounge.

755
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,117
He's good at being electrocuted.
He's good at that, at least.

756
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:03,041
After that, he wandered around
in the corridor and shot the soldiers,

757
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,845
and killed the soldiers
who were sleeping in the barrack.

758
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,763
You guys are no different!

759
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,396
And finally, he shot
Sergeant Ma Beom-rak once,

760
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,731
who was in the restroom,

761
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:30,360
was surrounded by MP forces, and was
arrested while assaulting Sergeant Ma.

762
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,863
Drop your gun!

763
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,912
A total of 13 people died,

764
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,623
and many of the injured
platoon members are being treated.

765
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,293
Therefore, the prosecution
indicted the defendant

766
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,254
for seven charges
written on the indictment,

767
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,966
including a murder of a superior,
according to the Military Criminal Act.

768
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,970
The defendant's party.
Do you admit all of your indictments?

769
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,473
He admits to all of his indictments.

770
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,560
But he claims that his motive
was cruelty in the military.

771
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,647
Military Prosecution,
were you aware of this?

772
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,357
Yes.

773
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,944
We secured the defendant's
testimony during the investigation.

774
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:18,200
But all of the surviving soldiers
are denying any cruelty.

775
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,870
But I agree that the facts
on the motive and reasons

776
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,789
for his crime need to be confirmed.

777
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,084
Therefore, I summon
the surviving soldiers as witnesses.

778
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,716
The surviving soldiers,
please sit in the witness seats.

779
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,301
An oath.

780
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,513
I solemnly swear
that I will tell the whole truth,

781
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,056
and nothing but the truth,

782
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,434
and if I tell a lie,
I will accept punishment for perjury.

783
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,617
Was there any form of cruelty

784
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,037
that took place in the GOP platoon
before the mass shooting occurred?

785
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,174
There wasn't…

786
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,467
any abuse.

787
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,180
That makes no sense.

788
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,057
There wasn't any abuse.

789
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,892
There was none.

790
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,269
No, absolutely not.

791
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,229
He was guarding the battlefront with me,

792
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,273
and he suddenly murmured
like some crazy guy,

793
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,275
saying that he should go kill Sergeant Ma,

794
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,277
then knocked me out
and deserted from duty.

795
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,320
Pyeon committed

796
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,448
the mass shooting
because he went totally mad.

797
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,701
When a soldier of concern
like Pyeon comes,

798
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,578
the superiors have a really tough time.

799
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,081
Since he came to the GOP,
he couldn't adapt, he was left out,

800
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,708
and he suffered from insomnia,

801
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,793
so I let him sleep next to me,
gave him advice,

802
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,420
and took good care of him.

803
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:57,132
But it seems like he felt
that was harassment.

804
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,093
I only cared for
Private First Class Pyeon.

805
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,429
You have no idea

806
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,682
how nice our platoon members
were to Private First Class Pyeon.

807
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,310
But he shot those who were nice to him…

808
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,186
He did that to those innocent…

809
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,479
There wasn't abuse.

810
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,522
Absolutely not.

811
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,773
There wasn't.

812
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,775
There wasn't any abuse.

813
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,069
That's the way for me
to keep this position.

814
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,449
All of the criticism must go
to Private First Class Pyeon.

815
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,045
When I become a sergeant,
I will get rid of all of these,

816
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,589
so wait until then.

817
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,967
It's okay even if you say the same thing.

818
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,720
I'm okay, Tae-nam.

819
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,598
No, you're not okay.

820
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,352
If you were going to put up with it,

821
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,229
you should've done it until the end…

822
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,026
That Private First Class Pyeon
isn't a serviceperson!

823
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,321
No, he's not even human!

824
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,828
There was abuse.

825
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,210
Witness.

826
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,128
What did you just say?

827
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,715
Private Noh Tae-nam.

828
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,801
You abused him, you bastard!

829
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,098
This is wrong!

830
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,183
This really is wrong!

831
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,309
Don't you think?

832
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,895
You guys didn't come
to the military to do this.

833
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,566
You…

834
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,947
Sang-ho, you should be
punished for shooting people,

835
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,701
and all of you, who made him shoot people,

836
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,120
should get punished, too.

837
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,667
Why am I saying this?

838
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,127
Right.

839
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,505
I know I don't have any right
to say this, but…

840
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,757
this is wrong.

841
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,136
This is just so wrong!

842
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,263
Witness, watch your language.

843
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,558
Mother.

844
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,144
No, Division Commander Noh Hwa-young.

845
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:18,523
Mother, you forced me to commit perjury
so you can keep that uniform on.

846
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,276
Witness, please be seated!

847
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,361
Is this the military you want to make?

848
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,697
Answer me!

849
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,200
Is this the military you want to make?

850
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,785
Military police!

851
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,038
Get the witness
out of the court, right now!

852
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,873
Answer me!

853
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,708
Please answer me!

854
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,210
Please! Please answer me!

855
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,434
Defendant.

856
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,313
Do you have any final words
you want to say?

857
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,943
It's all my fault.

858
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:09,115
It's my fault for not being able
to put up with it a bit more.

859
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,706
It's my fault for not being able
to put up with it until the end.

860
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,131
I'm sorry.

861
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,344
I'm really sorry.

862
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,238
One soldier suffered from endless cruelty.

863
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,118
And because of that, a horrendous tragedy
that cannot be undone has occurred.

864
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:58,164
Most cases of violence within a group
are covered up with silence.

865
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,626
And those curtains of silence
are usually opened

866
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,504
after a tragic incident.

867
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,842
Before the curtains opened,
the victim turned into the perpetrator,

868
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,721
and after the curtains opened,
the perpetrator turned into the victim.

869
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,020
As a military prosecutor
in charge of this case,

870
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,024
I really wanted to avoid
this most painful moment.

871
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,611
But now,

872
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:34,617
I will do my duty as a military prosecutor
who must judge justice for the people.

873
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,747
Murder cannot be justified for any reason.

874
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,919
Therefore, I request you

875
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,840
to sentence Private First Class
Pyeon Sang-ho, the defendant,

876
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,051
the maximum sentence, which is death.

877
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,982
Based on the overall situation,

878
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,612
it is inevitable to sentence the defendant
to the maximum sentence.

879
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,697
I hereby sentence the verdict.

880
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,574
The verdict.

881
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,994
The court sentences
the defendant to death.

882
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:22,999
Sang-ho!

883
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,837
Sang-ho!

884
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,174
Sang-ho!

885
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,051
No! Sang-ho! My son!

886
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,664
I delivered the new glasses you gave me

887
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,000
to Private First Class Pyeon.

888
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,419
I didn't want him to have blurry vision…

889
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,631
during his long trip.

890
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,634
So I wanted to give them to him.

891
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,724
Military Prosecutor.

892
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:27,897
Thank you for granting my last wish.

893
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,055
You do the briefing.

894
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,558
You want me to do it?

895
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,811
I dealt with this trial

896
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,397
coldly throughout,

897
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,149
but you…

898
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,444
Pyeon Sang-ho and Noh Tae-nam.

899
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,156
You didn't give up
on the perpetrator and the victim.

900
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,326
You do it.

901
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,913
Yes, sir.

902
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,880
Please say something.

903
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,131
Please say something.

904
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:39,636
The investigation will begin for all
soldiers who were involved in the cruelty

905
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,472
and all of those who participated

906
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,058
in reducing and covering up this case.

907
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,560
And we will also thoroughly investigate

908
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,188
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young's
alleged attempt

909
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:54,525
to force someone into committing perjury,
which was mentioned during the trial.

910
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,671
Starting with investigating
Division Commander Noh,

911
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:18,049
we will begin investigations
on the colossal military corruption gate

912
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,759
suspected for a long time.

913
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,720
Get started.

914
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,082
We will now begin a search and seizure

915
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,459
for failing to frustrate
crimes of subordinates.

916
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,796
Do as you wish,
Doh Bae-man and Cha Woo-in.

917
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,759
But you'll have to deal
with the aftermath.

918
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,553
No, you'll have to

919
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,888
deal with the aftermath,
Division Commander.

920
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:53,561
