1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,151
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,360
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,570
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,612
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,905
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,003
Bae-man.

7
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,129
How does it feel

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,256
to be beaten up by a worm?

9
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,220
Isn't it refreshing?

10
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,941
This isn't enough to relieve my anger

11
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,235
compared to what you did!

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,655
It's not enough, you bastard!

13
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,034
Thank you, Yong Moon-goo.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
What?

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,165
It looks like I'm the one whose
eardrums got damaged,

16
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,917
but you're the one who's gone deaf?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,169
I said, thank you.

18
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,842
For what?

19
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,093
Why?

20
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,098
Why would you thank me?
You arrogant bastard.

21
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,477
Thank you for putting me in the military.

22
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,273
If you didn't make that offer

23
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,528
I couldn't refuse five years ago,

24
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,031
you wouldn't have been in that mess.

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,535
If you didn't get coaxed by Cha Woo-in,

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,829
if you weren't blinded by vengeance,

27
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,789
you would still be living a good life,

28
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,458
receiving wine boxes.

29
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,418
Isn't life interesting?

30
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,337
It's completely unpredictable.

31
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,884
We caught Kang Ha-joon.

32
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,514
I told him to be careful.

33
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,865
Now then, let's get to the point.

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,743
A FEW DAYS PRIOR

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,877
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,962
We will start questioning you
for the charge

37
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,922
of failure to frustrate
crimes of subordinates.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,968
Before that, did you find anything
from searching and seizing my office

39
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,344
as you please?

40
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,263
We didn't do it as we please.

41
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,473
We followed legal procedures.

42
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,350
Legal procedures?

43
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,269
Then did the 1st Battalion Commander,

44
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,439
whom you've summoned, mention my name?

45
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,568
I'm asking you if he testified that
I ordered him to cover up the abuse.

46
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,279
The Division Commander
doesn't know about it.

47
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,116
I never reported the abuse in the 14th GOP

48
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,452
to the Division Commander.

49
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,246
Then did you receive orders to cover it up

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,707
after the mass shooting occurred?

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,459
I did not receive any orders.

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,004
He said that he got
a few letters about the abuse,

53
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,592
but he disregarded them.

54
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,677
I'm sure he did.

55
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,429
Because that's true.

56
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,724
You questioned First Lieutenant
Yang Jong-sook, too, right?

57
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,643
What did my adjutant say?

58
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,354
Someone witnessed Division Commander Noh

59
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,106
meeting Noh Tae-nam
when she arrived at the GOP

60
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,568
right after the mass shooting occurred.

61
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,739
And also, someone witnessed
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young

62
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,866
meeting Private Noh Tae-nam

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,494
before he was hospitalized
at the military hospital.

64
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,248
Did Division Commander Noh Hwa-young
order Private Noh Tae-nam

65
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,917
to commit perjury in those encounters?

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,169
That never happened.

67
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,217
If you hide the truth,
you will be punished, too.

68
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,098
My answer remains the same.

69
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,061
The Division Commander
never ordered such a thing.

70
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,774
Adjutant Yang said the same thing
the 1st Battalion Commander said.

71
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,609
Then all that's left for you

72
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,154
is Private Noh Tae-nam's
testimony in court.

73
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,699
We're going to officially question him

74
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,659
after we're done investigating you.

75
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,997
How can you believe his testimony?

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,499
Private Noh Tae-nam isn't
in a normal state right now

77
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,334
due to the shock from the accident.

78
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,962
Are you trying to accuse your son

79
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,214
of being mentally unwell
so you can get away?

80
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,882
But it's true.

81
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:09,642
I told you. I'm a mother
of a victim in this case.

82
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,688
You're not thinking
of how heartbroken I am.

83
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,281
Before I was hospitalized,
the Division Commander

84
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,869
ordered me to commit perjury
about the abuse.

85
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,829
But the Division Commander is trying

86
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,498
to make your testimony invalid.

87
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,833
What?

88
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,376
How is that possible?

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,836
I clearly said it in court.

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,089
In order to get away
from her charge of ordering perjury,

91
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,841
she will use

92
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,593
the PTSD you're suffering right now.

93
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,179
But I was totally fine
when I testified in court.

94
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,098
I don't know how you're
going to accept what I say,

95
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,518
but the Division Commander will
try to have you discharged due to illness.

96
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,897
Are you saying…

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,276
that my mother is going to use my illness?

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,203
That's something we have
to deal with in court, so--

99
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,204
I'm sure--

100
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,956
I'm sure she isn't.

101
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,088
Let's stop the questioning.

102
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,714
WRITTEN STATEMENT

103
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,673
Sign it.

104
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,642
Bolt is staying with me.

105
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,310
He's gotten really close to me.

106
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,978
You'll be jealous if you see him.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,764
Noh Hwa-young

108
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,519
can cut her son off easily
if she can get away with her crime.

109
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,730
Noh Hwa-young won't even budge

110
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,692
with something like failure
to frustrate crimes of subordinates.

111
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,528
She even forgot that she's a mother.

112
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,324
And the 1st Battalion Commander
is willing to take all the blame, too.

113
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,828
It's the process of taking
all the blame by resigning.

114
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,290
The 1st Battalion Commander is a member
of the Patriotic Society, too.

115
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,750
Even if he gets discharged dishonorably,

116
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,253
Hwa-young must've promised
to hire him at IM.

117
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,921
Speaking of which,

118
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,215
let's go after

119
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,509
different games for this hunt.

120
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,887
Different games?

121
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,475
Let's add bigger charges to Hwa-young and
make her stand trial in military court.

122
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,811
and let's make Moon-goo
and Jae-sik stand trial

123
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,771
in civilian court for corruption.

124
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,940
You mean Won Ki-choon's death

125
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,151
by Hwa-young's bigger charge?

126
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,279
We lacked evidence at that time,

127
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,115
but you got a connection during that time.

128
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,701
Adjutant Yang Jong-sook.

129
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,498
I'll dig into this new weapon project

130
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,541
Yong Moon-goo is working on.

131
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,627
You go persuade Adjutant Yang.

132
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,923
I'm sure she knows something
about Won Ki-choon's death.

133
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,467
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,077
MILITARY PROSECUTOR CHA WOO-IN

135
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,334
MILITARY PROSECUTOR CHA WOO-IN

136
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,771
What do you need at this hour?

137
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,023
Weren't you done questioning me?

138
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,819
Your strong loyalty to Division
Commander Noh Hwa-young,

139
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,531
Is it because you work as a serviceperson
and you must obey superiors?

140
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,075
Why do you ask that?

141
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,869
During the trial of Corps
Commander Hong Moo-seob,

142
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,705
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young

143
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:45,042
suggested that I have you testify,
saying that you're a crucial witness

144
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,003
who can help us win the trial.

145
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,506
And, with your testimony,

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,759
the Division Commander got rid
of the Corps Commander.

147
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,723
You're the closest person
to Division Commander Noh Hwa-young

148
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,601
but haven't you thought that you know

149
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,352
the least about her?

150
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,857
Haven't you?

151
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,323
The Division Commander
kept her promise to me.

152
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,700
I do not doubt my superior.

153
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,411
I must get going now.

154
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,464
Thank you for what you did
during the trial

155
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,758
for Corps Commander Hong,
Military Prosecutor.

156
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,782
Is this the compensation
for the Kang's Solution case?

157
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,243
Come on, don’t call it
compensation between us.

158
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,538
Let's call it a symbol of friendship
for our partnership.

159
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,167
I saw the news on IM Defense Industry

160
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,670
signing a contract with the MND.

161
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,004
What?

162
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,174
I can't stop smiling

163
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,260
because of that these days.

164
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,764
You should've given me a tip beforehand.
So I could buy some of your stocks.

165
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,518
There were a lot of variables,
so I kept it confidential this time.

166
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:31,524
By the way, there was
one more party for that contract.

167
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,942
Kang's Solution.

168
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,948
CEO Kang Ha-joon,
whom you asked me to destroy

169
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,866
through search and seizure.

170
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,833
You two even took
a picture together, smiling.

171
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,002
That's how things went, Prosecutor Kang.

172
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,881
This time, I won’t ask anything

173
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,801
and let it slide, Senior.

174
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,720
Thanks.

175
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,895
I'm leaving.

176
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,022
Bye.

177
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,993
Prosecutor Kang Yeon-hee?

178
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,412
Who are you?

179
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,706
You got an expensive wine.

180
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,500
What? Who are you?

181
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,169
I'm Doh Bae-man.

182
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,005
I'm a military prose--
I mean, a star military prosecutor.

183
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,007
A military prosecutor?

184
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,469
How dare a military prosecutor…

185
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:46,140
There are many great senior prosecutors
where you're working,

186
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:50,436
but you only learned bad things from
a piece of garbage called Yong Moon-goo.

187
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,941
You messed up Kang's Solution
who didn't do anything wrong.

188
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,029
That's called
a planned investigation, right?

189
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,363
Get lost,

190
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,990
before I call someone!

191
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,241
So that's why

192
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,536
I'm going to request
a planned investigation, too.

193
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,996
What?

194
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,331
Choose one of these two.

195
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,501
One. You catch a big fish
with the information I give you

196
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,461
and become a star prosecutor.

197
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,339
Two. Let that information go to
a different prosecutor

198
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,466
and explain everything about

199
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,093
all of your past corruptions.

200
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,933
This also includes what you did

201
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,601
to Kang's Solution.

202
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,688
Number 1? Or Number 2?

203
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,859
What do you think?

204
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,738
The feast is ready, so you
just need to eat it, right?

205
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,782
What's the source for this information?

206
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,160
Yes, I knew you'd ask that.

207
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,704
It's clearly from inside the company.

208
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,167
Right. That's something that can
only be provided by a whistle-blower.

209
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,627
Who is it?

210
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,589
You'd never imagine

211
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,299
who the whistle-blower is.

212
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,056
You traded the stocks for IM
by using half of the budget

213
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,642
for the new weapon project
through a dual contract,

214
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,769
and you gave Lee Jae-sik
some political funds.

215
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,231
Military funds are truly the way
to win a war.

216
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,943
I love how you can communicate
so well with me.

217
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,696
An entrepreneur indeed is born, not made.

218
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,866
Kang's Solution

219
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,994
will have to take care
of this project well,

220
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,037
so nothing goes wrong.

221
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,290
I trust you completely

222
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,001
thanks to that gift you gave me.

223
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,671
Are you talking about the SSD hard drive?

224
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,591
The heart must be shown
through tangible objects.

225
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,515
Long time no see, Executive Director.

226
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,937
I didn't expect to see you here, Mr. Kang.

227
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,401
Well, I guess you two do know each other.

228
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,447
The temporary shareholders'
meeting has been scheduled.

229
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,532
Thanks to the new weapon project,

230
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,911
things might go as you planned.

231
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,912
It should.

232
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,290
This is the biggest achievement
since the company was established.

233
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,752
I wonder what it's for.

234
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,046
For me to become the president.

235
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,672
For you to become the president?

236
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,134
You're openly declaring war against
Noh Hwa-young.

237
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,761
A war?

238
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,222
I won already. It can't be called a war.

239
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,562
Once I get elected president
at the shareholders' meeting,

240
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,857
then IM

241
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,152
will be completely mine.

242
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,279
Congratulations, CEO Yong.

243
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,410
CEO Kang Ha-joon of Kang's
Solution is the whistle-blower?

244
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,453
Maybe?

245
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,832
But CEO Kang is working on this
new weapon project.

246
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,376
Everyone has to

247
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,004
wear a mask at least once in their lives.

248
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,255
Bang!

249
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,524
It was me,

250
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,900
Kang Ha-joon.

251
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,696
Now, are you really going to do it?

252
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,822
I should.

253
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,033
This will be the biggest case
in my career as a prosecutor.

254
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,703
By the way,

255
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,331
even if it's taken into consideration,

256
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,375
you can't avoid being punished.

257
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,336
Yes, I started this well aware of that.

258
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,507
I'll see you later.

259
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,092
Both of you.

260
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,565
You're alive.

261
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,819
The shareholders' meeting for IM
has been set.

262
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,989
Right, I got the text, too.

263
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,699
To you? Why?

264
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,869
I'm one of the shareholders there.
I have one whole stock.

265
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,123
So you bought it beforehand
to watch something fun?

266
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,211
I told Yong about the X-files
of the Patriotic Society as you said,

267
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,172
and he started finding those files, and--

268
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,049
-He came to the military hospital.
-Yes.

269
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,718
I'm sure he came to see
if Noh Tae-nam has it.

270
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,511
Bye.

271
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,892
You be careful, okay?

272
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,228
I won't forgive you
if something happens because of you.

273
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,731
I know what to do.

274
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,858
Are you worried about me, or not?

275
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,652
Gosh, I'm so concerned.
We don't suit each other.

276
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,529
All right. Bye.

277
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,042
NOH HWA-YOUNG

278
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,129
A temporary shareholders' meeting?

279
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,840
Are you trying to become the president?

280
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,258
Yes.

281
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,052
Come here right now

282
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,597
and explain everything,
including the new weapon project MOU

283
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,182
with Minister Lee Jae-sik.

284
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,351
I have no intention of explaining.

285
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,770
Explanations are for subordinates.

286
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,979
What did you say?

287
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,358
I'll notify you when I get there.

288
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,874
Do you think the shareholders'
meeting will go as planned tomorrow?

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,503
What are you trying to do
by becoming the president?

290
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,673
You're still an empty shell
even if you do.

291
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:57,010
This is all to show you,
General Noh Hwa-young.

292
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,099
-What?
-I'm going to show you

293
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,268
that the major shareholders
chose me, not you.

294
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,319
This is the record of illegal stocks
under borrowed names, which seem

295
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,488
to be 65 executives and employees of IM.

296
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,743
Executive Director Choi
played a great role.

297
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,081
Because he's been on my side
for a long time.

298
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,628
The National Tax Service
will begin the investigation soon.

299
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:36,008
You'll have to remove the stocks
under borrowed names soon.

300
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,092
Yong Moon-goo.

301
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,802
So,

302
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,514
choose either the military or the company.

303
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,857
From now on, you won't be able

304
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,234
to rule IM under a borrowed name anymore.

305
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,445
And IM will be filled only with my shares

306
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,072
and my people.

307
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,076
I will prove all of that during
the shareholders' meeting.

308
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,211
That I'm the true owner of IM now.

309
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,781
Are you done setting things up
for IM's shareholder meeting tomorrow?

310
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,407
Of course.

311
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,495
Tomorrow will be the best and the worst
day of Yong Moon-goo's life.

312
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,541
It's a shame that I won't get
to see his expression when he loses IM

313
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,210
when he had it at his fingertips.

314
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,296
But you'll get to see
Noh Hwa-young's expression.

315
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,342
I'm sure that'll be quite a sight, too.
What about Adjutant Yang?

316
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,261
Do you think she'll be persuaded?

317
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,221
It seems like she thinks of Noh Hwa-young

318
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,056
as more than just a superior.

319
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,059
It won't be easy, but I must do it.

320
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,869
-What is that smell?
-Oh, my gosh.

321
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,913
Gosh, what is that smell?

322
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,292
What is that smell?

323
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,043
It's disgusting.

324
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,009
The CEO is here.

325
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,318
2022 THE 1ST TEMPORARY
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

326
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,612
Now, IM Defense Industry's
temporary shareholders' meeting

327
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,197
for the first quarter will begin.

328
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,574
Today's item is about

329
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,161
electing me, the CEO, as the president.

330
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,206
Wait.

331
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:20,714
As a shareholder, I have a question
for CEO Yong.

332
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,384
Although I only have one stock.

333
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,349
Even if you only have one,
you're a precious shareholder of IM.

334
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,019
Yes, let me hear your question.

335
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:39,274
That new weapon project
you signed with the MND.

336
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,652
You brought a big feast
for all of us at IM.

337
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,905
And I praise you for that.

338
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,157
Praise?

339
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,619
Yes, thank you, sir.

340
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,912
But,

341
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,667
there's a rumor saying that
the MOU is a national-level fraud.

342
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,336
Is that true?

343
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,841
That's a groundless false rumor.

344
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,346
But I heard there's a dual contract, too.

345
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,056
I told you just now

346
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,182
that it's not true.

347
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,940
If it turns out to be a fraud,
the company will be doomed,

348
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,733
my stock will also be doomed,

349
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,527
and I will end up killing myself.

350
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,820
That's be all.

351
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,534
If it turns out to be a fraud,
the company will be doomed,

352
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,786
my stock will also be doomed,

353
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,330
and I will end up jumping
into the Han River!

354
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,540
Do your delivery right!

355
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,292
I'm going to drag you
to Han River for real!

356
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,545
I don't want to jump into the Han River!

357
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,963
It's cold!

358
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,506
Who the heck is that bum?

359
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,550
Get him out of here!

360
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,634
What the heck?

361
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,886
How dare you come here?

362
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,390
Now, my dearest shareholders.
I'm sorry for the commotion.

363
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,017
Since you don't have any
objections to the item,

364
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,519
the votes will now begin.

365
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,478
Wait!

366
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,189
I object!

367
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,732
You bastard!

368
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,777
I'm going to fly.

369
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,613
Why bother having this meeting

370
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,158
if you're going to look down
on shareholders?

371
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,202
President, my foot.

372
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,248
Everyone, just vote for the item
of kicking him out!

373
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,625
You idiots!

374
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,173
Let go! Don't touch me!

375
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,425
I'm angry! It cannot be undone!

376
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,889
Now, the vote will now begin.
Cast your precious vote.

377
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,473
LIST OF IM DEFENSE INDUSTRY'S
MILITARY SUPPLY LOBBIES

You have one stock?

379
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,352
I'll give you the bus fare, so get lost!

380
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:43,273
Do you think this is a corner store?
How dare you try to play tricks?

381
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,691
Don't--

382
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,320
Don't touch me! Or you're dead!

THE RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION
IN YONG MOON-GOO'S OFFICE

386
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,825
What's that?

387
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,494
You traded the stocks for IM
by using half of the budget

388
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,414
for the new weapon project
through a dual contract,

389
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,209
and you gave Lee Jae-sik
some political funds.

390
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,296
Military funds are truly the way
to win a war.

391
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,850
The players are entering.

392
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,313
It's true!

393
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,522
Everyone!

394
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,816
My fellow shareholders! Throw them out!

395
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,527
Your stocks are now about
to hit the lowest price!

396
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:34,074
Soon, your stocks will
turn into ashes and disappear!

397
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,075
Throw them out!

398
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,327
How dare you spread false information?

399
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,620
Don't.

400
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,875
You should sell it, too,
when I give you a chance.

401
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,335
You look exceptionally anxious.

402
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,587
Are you a shareholder, too?

403
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,256
Wait.

404
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,716
I put everything I got into it.

405

CONCLUDED

407
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,732
Mr. Yong Moon-goo?

408
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,985
You're under arrest for violating

409
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,738
the Act on the Aggravated
Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes.

410
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,824
Take him away.

411
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,420
What do you think you're doing?

412
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,547
-You'll find out once you get there.
-You…

413
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,966
Let go!

414
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,676
Hey, Prosecutor Kang!

415
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,891
Have you heard of an offer
you can't refuse?

416
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,893
It’s a famous line from The Godfather.

417
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,521
I said that

418
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,773
to Prosecutor Kang Yeon-hee.

419
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,485
Doh Bae-man, you bastard!

420
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,363
I sold it just before I got in here.

421
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,325
I sold it on time
before it dropped, right?

422
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,951
SOLD

423
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,203
Doh Bae-man, you bastard!

424
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,539
Let go! Hey, Doh Bae-man!

425
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,376
The biggest corruption
in the defense industry has exploded.

426
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,003
They were trying to embezzle

427
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,882
the national defense budget by
transforming the old weapons into new ones

428
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,010
with a dual contract
through MND's main project for this year.

429
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,971
Prosecutor Kang Yeon-hee,
who's in charge of the investigation,

430
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,806
arrested Minister Lee Jae-sik,

431
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,266
Commander Heo Kang-in,

432
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,352
-Let go, you jerk!
-and CEO Yong Moon-goo

433
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,978
to work on the investigation.

434
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,230
She'll also conduct search and seizures

435
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,234
on IM Defense Industry
and Kang's Solution.

436
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,736
A CORRUPTION SCANDAL
IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY

ABOUT THE NEW WEAPON PROJECT BY MND
MINISTER LEE JAE-SIK ARRESTED

438
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,764
What brings you to my office
all of a sudden?

439
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,809
The prosecution requested
cooperation in the investigation

440
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,812
of Vice Corps Commander Heo Kang-in.

441
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,022
Therefore, I am here to report.

442
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,819
And I have a personal report to make, too.

443
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,946
A personal report?

444
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,078
Division Commander, are you

445
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,581
laughing or

446
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,042
crying right now?

447
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,502
What?

448
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,046
Yong Moon-goo's fall is good news,

449
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,549
and the company's fall is
bad news, isn't it?

450
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,928
Get out, Cha Woo-in.

451
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,973
I'd like to say one more thing
before I leave.

452
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,143
I will make you stand trial
as a military prosecutor,

453
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,062
and all of those evil things you did
to get to where you're at

454
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,022
will make you fall.

455
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,321
You became a military prosecutor
to avenge your father

456
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,824
and you're trying to destroy me,

457
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,289
but the dead are not
interested in revenge.

458
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,876
Because revenge is only for the living.

459
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,467
Of course, not everything I do

460
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,052
in the process will be just.

461
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,181
But the result will be just

462
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,434
because I'll make you pay for your crimes.

463
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,691
-It will only ruin your life.
-I don't know.

464
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,903
My life will be complete
when I achieve justice.

465
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,990
And I think that day
is going to come soon.

466
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,191
You've gone through a lot.
I'm glad you got released right away.

467
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,776
What about Minister Lee Jae-sik?

468
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,028
He was trying to shred
the related documents

469
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,488
just before the arrest, and--

470
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,073
He tried to destroy evidence?

471
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,201
And he tried to run away,
so he got detained.

472
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,788
And Heo Kang-in got transferred
to the military prosecution.

473
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,874
Gosh. Those idiots.

474
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,085
Well, then what about Kang Ha-joon?

475
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,421
It looks like he's being investigated
without confinement, like you.

476
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,674
Mr. Yong.

477
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,759
I have a report.

478
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,802
What is it?

479
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,680
The temporary shareholders' meeting
that fell through today

480
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,515
is going to take place again

481
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,269
in three days, with a different item.

482
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,229
The item will be changed?

483
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,230
Yes.

484
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,316
It's about

485
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,359
dismissing the CEO.

486
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,161
They're going to kick me out
of this office?

487
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,537
I'm sorry.

488
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,482
What's going on, Mr. Yong?

489
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,777
Just who leaked the information?

490
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,695
Was it you? Did you?

491
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,323
I don't even have a single stock.
I can't do anything.

492
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:34,619
Then how on earth did
Doh Bae-man know about it?

493
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,828
I know, right?

494
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,666
How could he come just in time
when the prosecutors barged in?

495
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,001
Do prosecutors have group chat rooms, too?

496
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,381
Kang Ha-joon.

497
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,841
But he's doomed, too, just like you!

498
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,302
Why would that sly weasel do that--

499
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,473
Right.

500
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,643
Perhaps you're right.

501
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,856
I must hear from them and see
if it's true or not.

502
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,150
Go get them now.

503
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,861
Get both Doh Bae-man and Kang Ha-joon.

504
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,448
If those two plotted this together,

505
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,327
then I'm going to kill them both.

506
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,090
I'm here, ma'am.

507
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,680
Adjutant Yang Jong-sook.

508
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,390
Yes, Division Commander.

509
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,477
Last time

510
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,147
I kept my promise, didn't I?

511
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,567
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,694
This time,

513
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,238
you must do something for me.

514
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,706
Kill

515
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,332
Cha Woo-in.

516
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,938
The Division Commander is waiting
at the residence.

517
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,371
Sit.

518
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,511
You committed

519
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,139
a sin to me that can never be made up.

520
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,434
But,

521
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,812
even so,

522
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,107
I will keep all of the promises
I made to you.

523
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,361
One.

524
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,115
You will be discharged
due to illness soon.

525
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,867
It means your military life is over.

526
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,577
Two.

527
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,080
After your discharge you will stay low

528
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,832
for some time,

529
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,917
and be in charge of IM again.

530
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,755
I'm giving you back everything you enjoyed

531
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,549
before your military service.

532
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,848
You will have to be the CEO of IM

533
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,310
and pay for the wrongdoings
you did to me this time

534
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,062
for the rest of your life.

535
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,857
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,318
"Yes, ma'am?"

537
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,445
Not "Thank you, ma'am"?

538
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,285
I'm giving you everything you wanted.

539
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,078
So why don't you look happy?

540
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,333
I'm happy.

541
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,003
I am happy, Mother.

542
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,188
In order to get away
from her charge of ordering perjury,

543
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,814
she will use

544
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,151
the PTSD you're suffering right now.

545
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,904
To you, Mother,

546
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,990
I'm not a son. I'm just…

547
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,869
a tool for you to use.

548
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,063
Ta-da!

549
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,606
Salute!

550
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,900
Congratulations on your promotion.

551
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,152
Auntie.

552
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,904
Why do you look so pretty?

553
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,948
Did you get dolled up
because I was coming--

554
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,701
Why didn't you call me first?
You usually call me before you come.

555
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,994
Why would I call you?

556
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,037
It's a surprise.

557
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,665
Did you cook all this for me?

558
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,918
Wow, a home-cooked meal.
It's been so long.

559
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,879
Help yourself.

560
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,297
-Okay.
-Help yourself.

561
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,595
JOO-HYUK

562
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,554
NO

563
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,016
Is someone coming?

564
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,319
Bonjour, Ms. Doh.

565
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,782
Prosecutor Doh.

566
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,493
Staff Judge Advocate.

567
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,498
I'm just to say thank you because
the joint investigation was a success.

568
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,500
Detective Doh, you did a great job.

569
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,085
-Good job.
-Yes, good job.

570
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,628
-Goodbye.
-Stop right there.

571
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,842
Staff Judge Advocate, please come in.

572
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,594
And the investigation ended
a long time ago, right?

573
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,016
You two,

574
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,226
when did you share the passcode
to this house?

575
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,938
Oh, my. It's been a while
since we shared the passcode.

576
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,858
-Come in.
-Oh, my!

577
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,235
Bae-man was going to find out
someday, anyway,

578
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,112
so let's reveal it today.

579
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,531
Here…

580
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,286
This is embarrassing.

581
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,788
Come on, why are you embarrassed?
I am not.

582
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,458
We didn't commit a crime or anything!

583
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,170
As a police officer
and a serviceperson of this country…

584
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:03,758
Well, it is a bit late, but in order
to contribute to the birth rate of Korea…

585
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,052
The birth rate?

586
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,179
Oh, my!

587
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,724
We're being patriotic as public officials.

588
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,726
Patriotic.

589
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,478
Patriotic?

590
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,520
Patriotic.

591
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,649
Patriotic.

592
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,404
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

593
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,656
I almost made a big mistake.

594
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,367
No, go ahead and eat.

595
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,576
I must get going.

596
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,204
-Salute… No, that's not it.
-Salute…

597
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,497
Uncle.

598
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,539
Good luck!

599
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,167
-Patriotic.
-My nephew, good luck!

600
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,794
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

601
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,754
-Eat before you go.
-No. You two have fun.

602
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,422
-Bae-man.
-Have a great time.

603
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,673
Thank you for this. Wait.

604
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,342
Bae-man!

605
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,426
That's not what it is!

606
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,803
Bae-man!

607
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,475
The birth rate?

608
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,268
Three?

609
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,728
Or four?

610
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,399
I am simply destined
to be with servicepeople.

611
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,318
My father,

612
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,861
your father, and you.

613
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,406
And Staff Judge Advocate Seo, too.

614
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,282
Good luck, Auntie.

615
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,746
I've been seeing Staff Judge Advocate Seo
for a very long time,

616
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,457
and he's a very soft-hearted and kind man.

617
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,835
And he likes "old-fashioned" coffee.

618
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,801
Staff Judge Advocate
is my auntie's dream guy.

619
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,761
I seriously have no hunch.

620
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,804
What about you?

621
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,805
Me?

622
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,432
What about me?

623
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,850
You and Prosecutor Cha.

624
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,021
What are you talking about?
Prosecutor Cha and I are not…

625
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,442
I am hoping
for you and her to be a couple.

626
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,361
Go on in. Staff Judge
Advocate Seo must be waiting.

627
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,696
Go on.

628
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,115
Don't laugh.

629
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,533
Bye.

630
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,994
-Auntie.
-What?

631
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,079
You look pretty today.

632
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,373
-Bye.
-Hurry.

633
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,958
Run.

634
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,175
CHA WOO-IN

635
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,428
Cha Woo-in…

636
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,902
DOH BAE-MAN

637
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,155
Is this the right angle?

638
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,281
Okay.

639
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,452
Hello, Prosecutor Doh.

640
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,079
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.

641
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,081
What are you doing? The weather is nice.

642
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,541
Are you still working?

643
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,087
I was looking for more possible clues
of the Won Ki-choon case.

644
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,130
I see.

645
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,090
Yong Moon-goo

646
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,718
isn't confined, so he's free now,

647
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,095
but he'll be arrested soon
with additional charges.

648
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,680
Yes, sir.

649
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,682
He saw you at the shareholders' meeting,

650
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,060
so he must be furious now.

651
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,354
Be careful.

652
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,605
What?

653
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,815
Are you worried about me?

654
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,196
The night view I see behind you is pretty.

655
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,324
Why don't you show me the street?
It's been a long time.

656
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,784
Shall I?

657
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,077
Here.

658
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,455
Where is that?

659
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,042
It's near my aunt's house.
Prosecutor Cha, I have big news.

660
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,170
I'll tell you at work tomorrow.
This is super crazy.

661
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,261
Prosecutor Doh!

662
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,607
Is he dead?

663
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,821
Hey.

664
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,407
Put him in the car.

665
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,003
46 NEO 9905

666
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,972
We caught Kang Ha-joon.

667
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,518
I told him to be careful.

668
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,817
Are you okay?

669
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,694
It hurts like hell.

670
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,743
Now then, let's get to the point.

671
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,419
About you two plotting to screw me over…

672
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,171
Let's save that for later.

673
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,007
Just tell me about
the X-files of the Patriotic Society.

674
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,887
You're the one who told me about them,
so you go first.

675
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,639
Where are the X-files?

676
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,896
Yes, Doh Bae-man.

677
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,733
You have it, don't you?

678
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,902
So you can have revenge on Noh Hwa-young.

679
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,656
You found it, didn't you?

680
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,948
Actually, that's--

681
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,200
Yes.

682
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,493
Spill it.

683
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,535
Spill it, now!

684
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,787
Where is it?

685
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,750
That…

686
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,836
was a lie.

687
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,966
I spilled a lie.

688
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,678
What?

689
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,098
I was just trying to check
how far you've driven apart

690
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,683
from Noh Hwa-young.

691
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,398
I'm very sorry.

692
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,090
Who the heck are you?

693
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,013
No one's in it.

694
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,645
Military Woman?

695
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,314
I don't know why you guys
are here together,

696
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,983
but let's get out of here first.

697
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,694
But both of you

698
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,987
should brace yourselves.

699
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,873
-What are you doing? You bastards!
-What are you doing? You bastards!

700
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,380
Watch. Okay?

701
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,609
Cha Woo-in!

702
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,660
I've been waiting for this day,
Yong Moon-goo.

703
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,587
Stop!

704
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,424
Let Mr. Yong go!

705
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,843
If you don't, I'll kill this weasel!

706
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,470
Now!

707
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,935
Hurry and get in!

708
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,521
-Go!
-Yes, sir.

709
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,667
Bae-man!

710
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,085
Doh Bae-man!

711
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,920
-What took you so long?
-Which did this?

712
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,838
Who dared to mess with my boy Bae-man?

713
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,719
-Are you okay?
-That hurts.

714
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,731
Come here.

715
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,443
Ow! That hurts!

716
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,028
Stop whining!

717
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,864
So…

718
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,534
Kang, you tricked me,

719
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,579
and Prosecutor Doh, you tricked me, too.

720
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,913
I…

721
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,833
You go ahead first, Prosecutor Doh.

722
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,793
Starting with "when."

723
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,129
Well…

724
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,505
that…

725
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,132
that was…

726
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,093
the night when I comforted you.

727
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,265
Based on my hunch,
no matter how much I thought about it,

728
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,642
CEO Kang wasn't someone to betray you.

729
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,936
So I looked into it.

730
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,488
Kang Ha-joon.

731
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,496
It's not true, is it?

732
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,710
If you don't tell me about this,
then you're really tricking us.

733
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,510
Let's go somewhere else.

734
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,060
Why did you do that?

735
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,270
Were you jealous?

736
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,271
Come on.

737
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,398
Let me hear the reason, at least.

738
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,317
You can't beat me yet.

739
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,112
"Trick your friend first in order
to trick your foe."

740
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,365
Don't you know about this simple tactic?

741
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,532
What?

742
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,620
I don't want to trick Cha Woo-in.

743
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,537
No.

744
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,831
Don't tell Woo-in.

745
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,500
Woo-in will stop me if you do.

746
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,169
Then everything I've been preparing
will go to waste.

747
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,212
What did you prepare?

748
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,131
While Woo-in has been preparing
her revenge for six years,

749
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,176
I've been preparing for something else.

750
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,552
Something else what?

751
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,806
A way to give IM Defense Industry
back to Woo-in.

752
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,811
If you tell that to Woo-in now,
all of my efforts will be for nothing.

753
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,815
So you want me
to pretend not to know your spying?

754
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,150
Until the end.

755
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,860
Please.

756
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,241
That's true friendship.

757
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,743
It is friendship, right?

758
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,495
As just a friend?

759
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,831
You won't tell her, right?

760
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,419
Okay, since things turned out this way,
let's do strategic cooperation.

761
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,170
Strategic.

762
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,714
You know it, too, right?

763
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,923
That we're not friends.

764
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,802
I do know. Yes.

765
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,845
I know very well.

766
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,056
We really don't get along.

767
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,060
What was the thing
you showed him with your phone?

768
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,521
So many companies suggested
M&A to Kang's Solution

769
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,898
after it was destroyed.

770
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,277
But he joined forces
with none other than Yong Moon-goo.

771
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,904
So you fooled me perfectly.

772
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,740
He did.

773
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,869
Woo-in, I can explain. I--

774
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,749
That must hurt.

775
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,792
So why did you betray her?

776
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,835
You're just so--

777
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,132
That hurts.

778
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,429
Go on in.

779
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,972
I want to be alone.

780
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,283
Woo-in.

781
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:23,205
I went into IM
and prepared a bunch of things

782
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,624
so you can go back to IM.

783
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:32,297
Mr. Choi has the list of Noh Hwa-young's
accounts and stocks under borrowed names.

784
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,467
And because of Yong, Mr. Choi is
also in a risky situation, so--

785
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,384
Kang Ha-joon.

786
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,389
I'm relieved that you're safe.

787
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,560
And…

788
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,567
I'm sorry.

789
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:54,903
What?

790
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,990
For not trusting you.

791
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,077
Prosecutor Doh

792
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,663
trusted you and doubted your betrayal,

793
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,165
but I couldn't do that.

794
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,905
Gosh, what are we going to do now?

795
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,661
We have to find the X-files
of the Patriotic Society.

796
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,538
We just need that.

797
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,540
But Military Doh said…

798
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,377
that it was all a lie.

799
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,296
You want me to believe that?

800
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,048
Do you think I'll fall for it twice?

801
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,634
Why are you so obsessed with it?

802
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,680
The weaknesses of the Patriotic Society
and the defense industry companies.

803
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,057
With that thing in my hand,

804
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,645
I can make a return.

805
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,500
Hey, Bolt.

806
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,336
I missed you so much.

807
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,882
Here.

808
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,760
It's your favorite.

809
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,098
You missed it, right?

810
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,600
Help yourself, Bolt.

811
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,144
Noh Tae-nam.

812
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,984
How are your PTSD symptoms?

813
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,322
I'm fine.

814
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,074
I'm totally fine now.

815
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,496
Like you military prosecutors said,

816
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,415
my mother tried to get me
discharged due to illness.

817
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,792
Isn't it ironic?

818
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,837
My mother, who tried so hard
to put me in the military,

819
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,965
is not trying so hard
to pull me out of there.

820
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,313
I wrote letters

821
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,483
to Se-na and to you military prosecutors.

822
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,445
Did you write a Letter
of the Heart to Se-na?

823
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,531
I don't think she'll read it.

824
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,199
And why did you write to us?

825
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,000
My boy Bolt looks like you,

826
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,376
Prosecutor Doh.

827
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,637
Thank you

828
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,431
for taking care of Bolt.

829
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,083
And,

830
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,252
please continue to

831
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,378
take care of Bolt.

832
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,357
MOTHER

833
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,864
Mother, it's me.

834
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,617
Where are you? Go to the residence, now!

835
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,452
No, I'll send you the address.

836
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,953
Please come to that place.

837
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,664
It's a place you know too.

838
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,269
I'll drive you.

839
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,938
No, I'll go there alone.

840
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,583
HAN SE-NA

841
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,128
TO. THE MILITARY PROSECUTORS

842
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,592
It's a USB.

843
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,015
ADJUTANT YANG JONG-SOOK

844
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,977
Yes, Adjutant Yang.

845
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,063
I will cooperate with you,
Military Prosecutor.

846
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,066
You made a wise decision.

847
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,734
Can you come alone?

848
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,404
Yes, I'll be there soon.

849
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,117
It looks like Adjutant Yang
made up her mind.

850
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,870
Go on. I'll check this USB
and read the letters.

851
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,079
Yes, sir.

852
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,803
FORGET-ME-NOT COFFEE SHOP

853
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,436
Noh Tae-nam!

854
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,321
0573, 0573…

855
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,743
DOH BAE-MAN

856
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,745
Yes, Prosecutor Doh.

857
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,456
Noh Tae-nam's letter is a will.

858
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,000
Noh Tae-nam is going to kill himself now.

859
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:24,918
What?

860
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,086
We must stop him.

861
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,381
I located the taxi he took,
and I'm on my way.

862
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:34,177
Yes, I'll join you
right after I meet Adjutant Yang.

863
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,345
Okay.

864
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,770
Thanks to you two,
Military Prosecutors Doh and Cha,

865
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,147
I was able to testify.

866
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,192
I was able to break away
from my fear of my mother

867
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,194
and her confinement of me.

868
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,571
In order to thank you and repent my sins,

869
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:58,868
I enclosed a secret
I've been keeping to myself.

870
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:05,792
The USB enclosed in the letter has
the X-files of the Patriotic Society

871
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,963
left by President Cha Ho-chul,
the former owner of IM Defense Industry.

872
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,509
One month after I became
the next President,

873
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:18,346
I found it in the chair
President Cha Ho-chul used.

874
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,059
The USB contains the materials
President Cha had been collecting

875
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:27,146
for a long time to destroy
the Patriotic Society and my mother.

876
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:32,026
I've been hiding these X-files
of the Patriotic Society

877
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,321
for a long time
to protect my mother and IM.

878
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,793
But,

879
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,420
now I realized

880
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,464
these files must be revealed to the world
to stop my mother.

881
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:57,760
So…

882
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,016
I decided to give it to you.

883
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,503
What do you think you're doing?

884
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,532
The call cannot be connected.

885
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:07,914
Prosecutor Cha?

886
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,126
Adjutant Yang.

887
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,220
Tae-nam, you…

888
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,347
What are you trying to do?

889
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,101
Don't come closer, Mother.

890
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,941
Tae-nam.

891
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,651
Put that thing down.

892
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,157
Never forget what happened today.

893
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,287
Always keep in mind

894
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,164
that I am your safety pin.

895
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,960
You said

896
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,462
right before

897
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,091
that you'd be my safety pin.

898
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,509
Put that down, now!

899
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,678
As long as you're wearing
that military uniform

900
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,014
you will never stop, right?

901
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,690
So, this time…

902
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,320
I will be

903
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,158
your safety pin.

904
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,054
Noh Tae-nam!

905
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,313
Don't move.

906
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,532
Mom.

907
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,331
I…

908
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,001
I am sorry for being born…

909
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,602
as your son.

910
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,327
Tae-nam, no!

911
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:05,294
