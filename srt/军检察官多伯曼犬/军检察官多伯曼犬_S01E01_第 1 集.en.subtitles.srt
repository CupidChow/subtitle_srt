00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,319
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,487
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,418
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

5
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,588
-Cheers!
-Happy birthday to you

6
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,341
-Congrats on getting a job.
-Thanks. It's so lovely.

7
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,969
-Help yourself.
-Happy birthday, dear Seo-ah

8
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,097
Happy birthday to you

9
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,767
Seo-ah, blow out the candles.

10
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,355
Seo-ah, here's your gift.

11
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,110
Damn it!

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,154
Someone once told me

13
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,034
that if I see the world upside down,
then I'll be able to see new things.

14
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,087
That the sky becomes a lake,

15
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,257
and a mountain becomes
a reflection on a lake.

16
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,652
Is this how my damn messed-up life

17
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,738
is going to end?

18
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,208
I must turn everything
upside down and see it again.

19
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,962
That's the way to see the truth.

20
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,590
Where should I get started with my story?

21
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,717
Yes, I should start with that moment.

22
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,847
The first upside-down world I ever saw.

23
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,225
When he threw his classmates
out the window,

24
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:27,021
we just let it go because you visited them
and compensated them,

25
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,025
but this time, a student
and a teacher are unconscious.

26
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:31,985
DOH BAE-MAN

27
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,571
Yes, anyway, we're…

28
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,323
Hey! You bastard! Where are you going?

29
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,243
I was also expelled
from the third school I transferred to.

30
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,328
Well, the reason was always the same.

31
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,665
Violation of school rules
and maladjustment.

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,167
They said I interfered
with the academic environment.

33
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,964
The point is, there aren't
any more schools that'll accept me.

34
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,177
Doh Bae-man.

35
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,599
Hey, you brat!

36
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,976
You brat!

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,565
I know you're getting expelled on purpose.

38
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,027
It's because you don't have to serve
in the military if you don't graduate.

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,112
Then why don't you just ask me to remove
your name from the family registry?

40
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,156
That will exempt you from
military service.

41
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,285
But Auntie, you're the only family I have.

42
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,455
So what are you going to do?

43
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,124
Do you have any plans?

44
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,419
The only way for someone like me,

45
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,924
who's born poor, to get to the top
of the social class pyramid is…

46
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,091
LECTURE ON CIVIL ACT

47
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,178
…the Bar Exam.

48
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,140
CERTIFICATE OF PASSING

49
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,808
DOH BAE-MAN

50
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,728
MR. DOH BAE-MAN, A MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATE
PASSED THE BAR EXAM

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,400
SPECIALTY REGISTRATION
DOH BAE-MAN

52
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,528
-Mr. Doh Bae-man.
-Yes.

53
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,200
You're the first applicant in our law firm
who only completed middle school.

54
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,869
Then you can't even serve
in the military, right?

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,748
To do away with academic records,
experience, gender, and age.

56
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,417
That's why I applied to Law and One.

57
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm curious about something.

58
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,672
The news interviewed you

59
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,758
because you only finished middle school
but passed the Bar Exam.

60
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,929
I mean, we were amazed
because someone who only finished

61
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,890
middle school passed the Bar Exam.

62
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,059
What can they do
when they only finished middle school?

63
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,853
In Korea, even convenience store
part-timers have to graduate from college.

64
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,857
Mr. Doh, can you trust a lawyer who only
finished middle school to take your case?

65
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,486
That was when I realized that
only finishing middle school

66
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,155
is a wall even passing
the Bar Exam can't overcome.

67
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,870
I heard that the interviewers
interview female employees for fun

68
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,832
just so they can see their faces after
seeing their pictures on their resumes.

69
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,167
And that just happened to me.

70
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,587
You called someone
who only finished middle school for fun.

71
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,885
My goodness!

72
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,596
So did you enjoy seeing the face of me
who only finished middle school?

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,765
And I, too, will remember

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,145
all of your faces, okay?

75
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,157
LAW FIRM HYEONYULCHON

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,492
The day I was rejected
by the tenth law firm,

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,163
he, who was going to
change my life, had appeared.

78
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,165
We received a tip-off that he was asked

79
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,209
to take the case by the victim
and accepted lavish entertainment.

80
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,669
The investigation began,

81
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,880
and many suspicions
were proven to be true.

82
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,757
MY AUNTIE

83
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,058
Hi, my beloved Auntie.

84
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,686
Your voice was loud, so it must
mean you got rejected again.

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,689
They begged me to work for them,

86
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,691
but the conditions just weren't right.

87
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,527
If I could work anywhere,
I would be working already.

88
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,904
Go home early.

89
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,198
Let's have doenjangjjigae
and soju for dinner.

90
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,742
Salute! Detective Doh Soo-kyung!

91
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,464
STIR-FRIED KIMCHI

92
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,217
How can you eat ramyeon without kimchi?

93
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,473
You sound like you know who I am.

94
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,559
You're Yong Moon-goo,
the CEO of Law and One.

95
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes.

96
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,980
I've been looking into you,
Mr. Doh Bae-man.

97
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,650
What? But isn't the interview over?

98
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,984
Name, Doh Bae-man.

99
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,488
Both of your parents were in the military.
They both died in a car accident.

100
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,198
You were registered
under your aunt when you were ten.

101
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,535
You went to interviews at ten places
up to today, but you were rejected.

102
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,829
Your debts snowballed
from preparing for the Bar Exam,

103
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,498
so your credit is going to be ruined soon.

104
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,336
You're a total stalker.

105
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,964
What do you want?

106
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,591
You passed the interview with me.
Here, drink it.

107
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,100
Have you heard of an offer
you can't refuse?

108
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,270
It’s a famous line from The Godfather.

109
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,980
And I'm going to make one of those.

110
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,612
It cost about 1.5 billion won
to make this office.

111
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,074
Many things can be solved with money.

112
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,370
And I'm way more interested in
what cannot be done with the money.

113
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,666
Get to the point, please.

114
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,004
Now.

115
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,050
Go serve in the military.

116
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,475
A military prosecutor. What do you think?

117
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,525
It was fun listening to you
bragging about your wealth.

118
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,653
I only finished middle school,
so I'm exempt from military service.

119
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,657
Hope you work a little and make a lot.

120
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,702
You saw the news of a military
prosecutor being arrested, right?

121
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,370
Do you know

122
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,458
how much money he pulled
by working with me?

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,005
The 10-percent commission
of the pulled money.

124
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,757
And five times more than the incomes

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,552
of the lawyers
who looked down on you at the interviews.

126
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,349
Wouldn't that be enough
to change your life completely?

127
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,061
I guess so.

128
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,231
With that much money,
it can change completely.

129
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:51,322
People say those who study law
are smart, but lack empathy,

130
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,949
and they're right.

131
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,121
Didn't you feel anything
when you dug into my life?

132
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,796
Salute!

133
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,507
-Mom,
-What?

134
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,175
I want to be in the military too.

135
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,177
Yes, that sounds great.

136
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,639
My son, you will do great in the military.

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,393
CEO

138
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,316
Dad! The truck!

139
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,047
Bae-man.

140
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,884
Bae-man.

141
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,762
-Mom…
-I'm sorry.

142
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,474
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,893
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,149
Mom.

145
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,776
Open your eyes.

146
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,987
Open your eyes!

147
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,239
Mom!

148
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,541
My parents
both died in their military uniforms,

149
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,711
right in front of my eyes.

150
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,924
I'm infuriated
at the mere thought of military.

151
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,470
And you want me to serve
in the military myself?

152
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,348
I'll never go even if you pay me
50 times more, not 5 times more.

153
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,647
You seem very sturdy,

154
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,400
but your heart is
full of scars and wounds.

155
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,322
Do you know
why the military is a gold mine?

156
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,534
Because, to those with power
in the Republic of Korea,

157
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,870
the military is like a time bomb.

158
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,083
When their kids get exempt,
they're in trouble.

159
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,876
But they also have trouble
even if they serve.

160
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,674
My job is to remove those bombs
which are bound to explode.

161
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,218
In other words,

162
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,180
the military is the weak point
of the rich and powerful.

163
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,059
No god in the world gives you money.

164
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,521
So you want me to treat you like god
because you'll give me money?

165
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,608
You have succeeded this much on your own,

166
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,943
but who's got your back?

167
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,280
You've never had a thing called
a background before, right?

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,367
Well?

169
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,702
What if I become your background?

170
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,747
If you serve for five years
and get discharged,

171
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,250
I promise to scout you
as a partner lawyer of Law and One.

172
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,544
Of course,

173
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,673
only when you completed your work
to the level I want.

174
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,425
I'm sure many applicants

175
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,928
would apply to your firm
if that's the condition.

176
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,059
Would it sound too cruel
if I say that what I need

177
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,727
is your scar?

178
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,147
Because that cannot be
purchased with money.

179
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,448
Why are you so late?

180
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,955
Auntie, I got a

181
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,876
job. Shut up. Come on.

182
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,922
Is it true?

183
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,885
Is it true?

184
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,428
Hold on.

185
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,763
Which law firm is it?

186
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,267
Hey, tell me. Which one is it?

187
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,480
The military.

188
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,775
Shut the hell up, seriously.

189
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,536
Mom, Dad, you devoted yourselves
so passionately to the military.

190
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
What's it like there?

191
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,045
5 YEARS LATER

192
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,765
CHA WOO-IN

193
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,266
An oath.

194
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,436
I, Cha Woo-in,

195
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,481
am a new military officer
who just entered the military,

196
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,193
but as the protector of justice
by the Military Act,

197
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,153
I harbor the sense of duty,
and I will do my best to

198
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,447
strictly execute the law to
uphold the military spirit,

199
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,950
and do my best to protect
command authority,

200
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,578
and the benefits and human rights
of our soldiers.

201
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,333
October 18, 2021, Captain Cha Woo-in.

202
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,586
Salute.

203
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
-Salute.
-Salute.

204
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,778
Thank you.

205
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,613
-Salute.
-Salute.

206
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,994
Military Prosecutor, let's go.

207
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,878
-Salute.
-Salute.

208
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,422
-Salute.
-Salute.

209
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,217
-Salute.
-Salute.

210
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,184
-All right, Barrack 1.
-Salute.

211
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,312
Okay, at ease.

212
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,022
Let me join the arm wrestling too.

213
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,565
Sit down and relax.

214
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,109
Are you Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho?

215
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,360
Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

216
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,112
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,116
How much longer do you have
to wait until you're discharged?

218
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,826
I just got promoted to sergeant.

219
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,162
I see. Is anything troubling you?

220
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,413
No, sir.

221
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,918
Jeez.

222
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,461
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,339
I don't think it's cold.
Do you have rhinitis?

224
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,966
Yes, it's allergic rhinitis.

225
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,677
You do a lot of weed control
because it's the battlefront, right?

226
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,929
Yes, sir.

227
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,891
When you cut weeds, the pollen
goes everywhere. Wow.

228
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,476
Your rhinitis must be giving
you a hard time.

229
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,895
No, sir. I can endure it.

230
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,438
Come on.

231
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,400
What's that wound on your wrist?

232
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,196
I got a mosquito bite
during my nighttime checkpoint duty.

233
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,113
It's nothing.

234
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,534
What do you mean, it's nothing? You jerk.
Don't underestimate those mosquitoes.

235
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,286
You'll get malaria and

236
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,538
get a medical discharge
due to high fever, okay?

237
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,082
Wait.

238
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,668
Would that be better?

239
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,838
It's okay.

240
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,841
I'll tell the platoon leader,
so have it treated outside.

241
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,720
Is that okay?

242
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,931
Of course, it is.

243
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,978
Hey, let's arm wrestle.
The loser has to buy snacks at the PX.

244
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,729
-What?
-Come here, let's arm wrestle.

245
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,649
It's very famous.

246
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,401
-It was a lot of work.
-Salute.

247
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,652
Hey.

248
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,321
What brings you to our platoon,
Military Prosecutor?

249
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
I'm here to see Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

250
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,534
-You mean Sergeant Ahn?
-Yes.

251
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,704
Did you get a grievance, by any chance?
That can't be.

252
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,581
Is Sergeant Ahn doing well
with his military life?

253
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,749
Yes, he does.

254
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,793
He's so nice to lower-ranked guys.

255
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,212
Even the relocated sirs say
they miss Sergeant Ahn,

256
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,714
so they request leave and come visit him.

257
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,092
Wow, he's great for a son of
a bank president.

258
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,513
A bank president, you say?

259
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,181
Didn't you know?

260
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,727
Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho's father
is the president of Gusan Bank.

261
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,355
I had no idea.

262
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,815
He never told us himself.

263
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,316
Oh, my.

264
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,486
So it turned out that I spilled it again.

265
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,281
Platoon Leader, you keep it
to yourself, okay?

266
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,700
Don't make it obvious
by suddenly being nice to him.

267
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,784
Yes, sir.

268
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,411
Let's go.

269
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,373
A bank president's son is working
his butt off at the battlefront?

270
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,500
Wow, that's amazing.

271
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,045
His position is just
an ordinary rifle soldier too.

272
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,589
He could get preferential treatment
if he wanted, but…

273
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,175
Well, the celebrities go to
the battlefront on purpose

274
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,094
for reputation and
laundering their dirty pasts,

275
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,513
but a son of a bank president
doesn't have a reason to do so.

276
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,348
He doesn't, does he?

277
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,351
Maybe he does have a reason.

278
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,486
Salute! Battalion Commander,
this is Captain Doh Bae-man.

279
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,906
There's a soldier
who's suffering from rhinitis.

280
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,036
Yes, I think you must provide
an air purifier ASAP.

281
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,371
Salute.

282
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,849
Salute.

283
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,892
Hey.

284
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,269
Where are the belongings
of the platoon members?

285
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,772
Hey, do you use this barrack alone?

286
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,940
Yes.

287
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,901
I was ordered to use this place alone
until I get discharged.

288
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,820
Wow, lucky you.

289
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,823
Oh, right. How's your rhinitis?

290
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,742
Installing this won't cure it, but--

291
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,452
It did get a lot better.

292
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,912
But…

293
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,039
What is it?

294
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,625
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

295
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,546
After your visit, I've been exempt
from weed control work,

296
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,632
and staying here alone,
with the air purifier on.

297
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,886
Oh, but it's true that I was having
a hard time because of rhinitis.

298
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,848
Thank you for taking action.

299
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,236
Yes, it seems like they don't
manage the water purifiers here.

300
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,823
It's okay. I'll just drink water
from the water purifier.

301
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,200
It's there for you to drink.

302
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,703
Drink up. It doesn't matter
who gives it to you.

303
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,955
Yes, sir.

304
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,669
Come on, I know you like it.
Don't be so concerned.

305
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,550
-Salute.
-Yes.

306
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,427
I'm going to give this

307
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,263
to Sergeant Ahn and leave,
Military Prosecutor.

308
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,556
Okay, at ease.

309
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,312
What is it?

310
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,731
Isn't it your uniform?

311
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,067
And your underwear too.

312
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,777
The washer is broken,

313
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,655
so Platoon Leader said
he'd wash them in the residence.

314
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,991
I told him I'll hand wash them, but--

315
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,369
It's because you're doing great,
Sergeant Ahn.

316
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,163
Don't be too burdened.

317
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,041
Captain, you seem like a very good person.

318
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,710
I promise I'll come visit you
after I get discharged.

319
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,135
According to the tip-off,
the son of the president of Gusan Bank

320
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,596
has been receiving preferential
treatment during his military service.

321
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,350
However, the military prosecution indicted
this soldier and now investigating him.

322
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,727
While everyone's interested in
the recent Imperial Military Service Case

323
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,147
and the military prosecution's
conclusion on this case,

324
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,235
this soldier is denying all of
the controversies surrounding him.

325
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,587
-There are
-There are

326
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,174
-Many great men
-Many great men

327
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,886
-But I am the real man
-But I am the real man

328
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,472
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in?

329
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,141
-Yes.
-Salute.

330
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,144
-Salute.
-I'm Subsection Chief Ahn Yoo-ra.

331
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,648
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

332
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,359
I'll give you a tour of the base.
Shall we?

333
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,236
Yes.

334
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,906
Staff Judge Advocate Seo Joo-hyuk
is out for work now.

335
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,993
Most of time, only one military prosecutor
is assigned for places like this,

336
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,830
but we have an opening for two
since our division has a lot of incidents.

337
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,331
The other one is…

338
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,709
That's him right there.

339
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,294
I don't think anything will go wrong.

340
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,254
This is Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

341
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,714
She's new here today.

342
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,300
-Salute--
-Sorry, I'm busy right now.

343
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,679
Hurry up.

344
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,805
Yes, sir.

345
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,227
You've heard of the Imperial
Military Service Case, right?

346
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,521
That case is attracting
a lot of media attention,

347
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,273
so he's very sensitive right now.

348
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,817
I'll take you to the archive.

349
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,947
Isn't the new military prosecutor
really pretty?

350
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,824
Did you contact all of the reporters?

351
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,409
What? Yes.

352
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,579
I called every single one of them.

353
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,671
Captain.

354
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,633
They say I received preferential treatment
and call it Imperial Military Service.

355
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,054
Since you know best, please clear up
the misunderstanding for me, sir.

356
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,849
This is the place
where you make people understand

357
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,185
and clear up misunderstandings.

358
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,605
The concept of the room isn't
very pleasant, but have a seat.

359
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,274
Yes, Captain.

360
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,277
Call me "Military Prosecutor" here,
not "Captain."

361
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,405
Yes, Military Prosecutor.

362
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,907
Sit.

363
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,123
All right, from now on,
just answer "Yes" or "No"

364
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,834
to my questions, and be honest.

365
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,961
Yes, Military Prosecutor.

366
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,634
Is it true that you used a barrack
for eight people all by yourself?

367
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,179
I didn't request it.
I only followed orders--

368
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,014
Your answer should be "Yes" or "No."

369
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,559
Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

370
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,898
Did you use the barrack all by yourself?

371
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,650
Yes, but--

372
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,194
You used the barrack all by yourself.

373
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,907
And the time when you used
the barrack alone was

374
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,326
right after the air purifier
was installed?

375
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,455
This archive contains materials
on the stay of the indictment,

376
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,374
and these are the materials
on mysterious deaths

377
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,709
of which the truth behind them
have yet to be revealed.

378
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,379
If you need anything,
you can tell me anytime,

379
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,714
or just feel free to come here.

380
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,384
-Do you have any questions?
-I don't.

381
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,139
Then I'll now take you to
the officers' residence.

382
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,142
Not there. Let's go
to the interrogation room first.

383
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,643
Now?

384
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,188
But Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man
must be in interrogation now.

385
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,859
-Why don't you go after he's done?
-I'm not here for a tour.

386
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,819
I'll go to the residence myself.

387
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,738
Let's go to the interrogation room,
where war is taking place.

388
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,783
I also want to see the style
of Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

389
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,623
But about the air purifier, Captain…

390
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,003
I mean, Military Prosecutor,
I thought you did it.

391
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,337
Me?

392
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,756
Why?

393
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,682
There's also a statement about you
drinking foreign bottled water alone.

394
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,976
I didn't ask anyone to buy that for me.

395
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,228
It doesn't matter who bought it.

396
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,814
I'm asking if you received the privilege

397
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,150
of drinking foreign bottled water
in the barrack.

398
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,651
Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

399
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,239
Yes, I did drink it.

400
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,783
There's also a statement that you asked
the platoon leader to do your laundry.

401
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,869
Isn't it your uniform?

402
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,954
And your underwear too.

403
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,539
That just makes no sense.

404
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,542
How can I make Platoon Leader
do my laundry for me?

405
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,086
He was just being considerate.

406
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,880
You saw it too, Military Prosecutor.

407
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,798
Considerate?

408
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,718
I don't know.

409
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,553
What the platoon leader said
is exactly the opposite.

410
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,889
He said he couldn't help it
because he thought

411
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,807
he might have a disadvantage
in his promotion.

412
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,893
That can't be.

413
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,355
He said he felt deeply humiliated
that he had to do errands of laundry

414
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,607
and drinking water
for a lower-ranked soldier,

415
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,484
but he couldn't help it.

416
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,450
And you also got exempt from
weed control and checkpoint duty,

417
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,619
not to mention
unauthorized leaves, illegal visits.

418
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,873
You left just
because you got a mosquito bite

419
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,751
and you returned the next day
without submitting a written diagnosis.

420
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,711
That's practically desertion.

421
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,967
Tell me if there's anything

422
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,552
among these confirmed facts
that you have not committed.

423
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,564
Sign it.

424
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,331
What's wrong?

425
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,918
Do you think it's unfair?

426
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,257
So you should've had good parents.

427
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,638
If you did, then you wouldn't
have been in this mess, right?

428
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,616
As we have strictly investigated
the Imperial Military Service Case

429
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,203
of Gusan Bank president's son,
feeling the national attention

430
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,289
and the seriousness within the military,

431
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,834
all of the charges have been
revealed to be true.

432
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,504
We, the military prosecution,
are going to strictly punish those

433
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,257
who use their military lives,
which are given equally

434
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,844
to all soldiers by the nation,
to their benefit by using

435
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,598
their parents' wealth and power.

436
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:26,227
In addition, we hope that
this becomes the beginning

437
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,980
of the elimination
of preferential treatment in the military.

438
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:33,026
I am Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man
of the military prosecution.

439
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,533
Bank President Ahn Byung-goo,
father of soldier under scrutiny,

440
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,203
resigned from his position
with a public apology,

441
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,080
saying that he feels responsible.

442
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,540
Joo Il-seok, TBC News.

443
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,004
Lawyer Yong, I got a repayment notice
from Gusan Bank.

444
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,342
I don't want to pay off
500 billion won. What should I do?

445
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,470
The profits I can make by using that money
is simply colossal.

446
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,849
This is the easiest era to make money
since Dangun founded Gojoseon.

447
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,353
Did the bank president we saw
last year decide on the repayment?

448
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,940
Then we must get rid of
the bank president.

449
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
What's his name?

450
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,903
Bank President Ahn Byung-goo.

451
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,874
Good job, Lawyer Yong Moon-goo.

452
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,464
-Military Prosecutor Doh.
-Staff Judge Advocate is waiting,

453
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,715
so let's talk on our way.

454
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,386
I enjoyed the briefing.
I wish to learn a lot too.

455
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,972
And you successfully peeped
into the interrogation room.

456
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,100
I'm sorry. But you can't see outside
from inside there, can you?

457
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,813
Since it's your first day,
let me give you a piece of advice.

458
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,525
In here, you have to have eyes on the back
of your head in order to survive.

459
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,446
I'm lucky to get started under someone
competent like you, Military Prosecutor.

460
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,698
Oh, no.

461
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,033
You're only half lucky.

462
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,369
I'll be discharged soon.

463
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,913
I see. That's sad.

464
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,001
I like your passion. You peeped
into the interrogation room

465
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,211
as soon as you came and stuff,

466
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,214
but don't cause any trouble
until I get discharged safely.

467
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,300
Yes, sir.

468
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,679
You did a good job with the investigation,
and an even better job with the briefing.

469
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,723
Thank you.

470
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,476
Cha Woo-in.

471
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,604
Whenever new military
prosecutors like you come,

472
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,190
I always ask this question.

473
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,194
Are you a prosecutor, or a serviceperson?

474
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,031
I'm only wearing the uniform
of a military prosecutor.

475
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,574
I am a serviceperson.

476
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,658
Salute.

477
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,587
I couldn't figure out the point
of the question.

478
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,214
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,258
I'm asking you which comes first.
Rank? Or the law?

480
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,304
What would you prioritize
when the order and the law collide?

481
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,014
How come you can't understand that?

482
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,811
I'm a prosecutor
who attends military trials.

483
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,480
What? A prosecutor?

484
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,941
You're not a prosecutor.

485
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,317
You're a serviceperson!

486
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,319
I do not think so.

487
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,572
Hey, you're wearing a military uniform.

488
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,282
Do you think you're a military
prosecutor without that uniform?

489
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,327
You can wield a sword in military trials

490
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,454
because that uniform gives you power.

491
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,291
But still, I am a prosecutor.

492
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,294
If I'm a serviceperson
who obeys the commands of superiors,

493
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,006
I can't bring the criminals who are
in higher ranks than me to justice.

494
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,759
So, I cannot be a serviceperson in court.

495
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,846
What?

496
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,724
Who do you think you are
to bring anyone to justice?

497
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,061
I just told you. Criminals.

498
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,818
Get out.

499
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,571
Get out, now!

500
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,910
Hey.

501
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,122
Wake up.

502
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,707
This is the army.

503
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,794
How could a newbie attack
the highest person on the first day?

504
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,588
I never attacked him.

505
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,214
I only answered his question.

506
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,757
Look at you.

507
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,135
You're not concerned about me, either.

508
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,179
Your military life
will become totally messed up.

509
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,391
Officers or soldiers,
the army is still the army.

510
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,435
And the army is at the peak
of social life.

511
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
I don't need advice.

512
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,439
Aren't you going to be discharged soon?

513
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,071
So you don't even want to deal with me
since I'm about to get discharged soon?

514
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,073
Don't make assumptions.

515
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,995
I must give you a hard time
until I get discharged.

516
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,371
Follow me.

517
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,590
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in. Salute.

518
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,009
Anything you ask me for,
I will do my best to--

519
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,845
Hey, remember that soldier
whose interrogation got postponed?

520
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,599
Hand him over to
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in here.

521
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,976
What? You mean the interrogation
on that guy?

522
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,812
But she just got here.
Isn't it too soon to start working?

523
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,147
We're done for today.

524
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,607
There's no "done for today"
for prosecutors.

525
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,902
Isn't that right, Prosecutor Cha?

526
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,490
Yes, a military prosecutor must
prioritize the case over being off duty.

527
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,450
That's right.

528
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,829
But I'm a serviceperson, so my day
is over, and I'm off duty now.

529
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,667
Prosecutor Cha, figure out the case today

530
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,044
and interrogate him tomorrow.

531
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,629
Yes, sir.

532
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,093
We should have some wine together.

533
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,224
Clean this place up, will you?

534
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,350
What's with the wink?

535
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,063
Wow, this guy is really rough.

536
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,856
You must be careful
when you interrogate him.

537
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,943
-I look forward to working with you.
-Sure.

538
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,240
You didn't do anything wrong
to Military Prosecutor Doh, right?

539
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,992
I don't know.

540
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,577
If there's a reason,
I'm sure I'll find out eventually.

541
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,511
Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man is here.

542
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,638
Welcome.

543
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,269
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

544
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,150
Was this a good finale
for the five years you promised?

545
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,861
The platoon leader there
played a big role.

546
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,029
What did you give him?

547
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,781
You mean the laundry errand?

548
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,742
I didn't give him anything.

549
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,161
I could get in trouble for that.

550
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,581
I just spilled the beans to him

551
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,125
about that guy's father
being a bank president.

552
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,919
So they just did everything
else on their own?

553
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,214
They exempted him from duty,
and sent him on leave.

554
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,217
Privileges disguised as
consideration showered on him.

555
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,345
Good grief.
Typical corrupt military jerks.

556
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,819
When should I start working
at Law and One?

557
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,783
Don't you think your five years
would be a waste?

558
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,160
You became a star military prosecutor
this time.

559
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,546
Do you remember
what you said to me five years ago?

560
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,301
You told me to get rid of
hatred or admiration for the military.

561
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,304
Yes. So, which one is it?

562
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,431
It's neither of them.

563
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,811
I just like this fishy smell
from this place.

564
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,981
When you actually have it,
money isn't a big deal.

565
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,442
How about having endless power

566
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,528
in there instead?

567
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,197
Endless--

568
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
CEO NOH TAE-NAM

569
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,871
Yes, sir.

570
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,791
You took care of it for me,
so we should see each other.

571
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,292
I'll go to your office now.

572
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,794
Not to the company.

573
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,338
Come to Cartel.
Because this calls for a celebration.

574
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,422
Yes, sir.

575
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,016
I wonder who that person is, making
the great Lawyer Yong nervous and polite.

576
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,519
Please introduce me to them too.

577
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,729
It's not time yet.

578
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,777
Yes, well, I get it.

579
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,656
Then please chew well
when eating the feast I prepared

580
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,283
so you don't get indigestion.

581
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,328
Right.

582
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,624
You can't be late even by one day
from the promised five years.

583
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,960
Bye, then.

584
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,554
NOH TAE-NAM

585
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,056
What the heck?

586
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,350
He's younger than me, but he's a CEO?

587
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,936
"He's a well-known dog lover,

588
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,481
and a vet and a cook
are always at his house…" Good grief.

589
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,110
Now I'm envious of a dog.

590
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,528
What are you reading?

591
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,241
I finally found out
who's got Yong Moon-goo's back.

592
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,577
Really? Who is it?

593
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,372
IM Defense Industry's CEO, Noh Tae-nam.

594
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,724
Jeez, what the heck?

595
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,060
Hey, who let a damn dog free?

596
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,478
Put it on a leash now!

597
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,438
Before I kill that thing! Damn it.

598
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,649
Let's go.

599
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,034
Hey.

600
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,828
If someone tells you

601
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,874
to put your child on a leash
just because someone pissed you off,

602
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,043
will you say, "I'm so sorry"

603
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,337
and put your child on a leash?

604
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,466
What are you saying, you bastard? Damn it.

605
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,219
Answer me.

606
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,390
Is that your dog?

607
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,270
Hey, you crazy bastard.

608
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,232
You can't let a dog off its leash
in a club! Damn it.

609
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,290
Let me ask you again.

610
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,793
If some bastard asks you
to kill your own child

611
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,379
just because he pissed him off,

612
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,673
will you kill your child?

613
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,262
You see, it was just because a dog
was walking around in a club--

614
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,889
Answer me!
Are you going to kill your own child?

615
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,727
I'm sorry.

616
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,563
No.

617
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,898
You're not supposed to
beg for my forgiveness.

618
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,775
You hurt the feelings of my boy Bolt.

619
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,610
Bolt.

620
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,787
Apologize to him.

621
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,877
What?

622
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,671
Now.

623
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,425
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,557
If you're going to apologize,

625
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,935
look him in the eye and do it right.

626
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,355
Do it until my boy Bolt accepts it.

627
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,740
Get this bastard out of here.

628
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,456
On a dog collar and a leash.

629
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,922
I'll take care of things here
before I go in.

630
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,966
Sure, go ahead.

631
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,076
That bank president's son must be
feeling so wronged right now.

632
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,496
He's innocent, but you guys
sent him to military prison.

633
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,665
He admitted that he did everything

634
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,625
so no damage will be done to his father.

635
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,378
Come on, doesn't that military prosecutor
feel guilty?

636
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,005
Even if you ordered him to do it,

637
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,466
he's more like a serviceperson
than a prosecutor.

638
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,968
A serviceperson, who does
everything he's ordered to.

639
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,638
It depends on the ways I use him.

640
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,765
Come on, that's just what you think.

641
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,102
You don't know what's on his mind.

642
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,689
I don't know that,
but one thing is for sure.

643
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,942
He's only loyal to money.

644
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,617
Lawyer Yong, you still have
a lot to learn.

645
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,705
You're being a geezer
and only training him on the outside.

646
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:03,085
No human being in the world
is loyal to money.

647
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,087
You must make human beings

648
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,507
loyal to other human beings.

649
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,603
What the heck? There's a guest?

650
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,854
Lawyer Yong?

651
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,064
-Hi.
-Hi.

652
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,316
Have a seat.

653
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,400
Hi.

654
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,906
Lawyer Yong, I think you can leave now.

655
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,783
We're going to drink and have fun,

656
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,994
and it's not fun
when a geezer is here with us.

657
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,705
I was about to leave
as my report was done anyway.

658
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,084
I really want to meet
that military prosecutor.

659
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,963
-I will make an appointment for you.
-No, not like that.

660
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,798
Just me and him.

661
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,260
I want to see him alone.

662
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,057
Sure.

663
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,250
Hey, over here.

664
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,587
Why did you want to see me?

665
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,714
Do you have more statements left to make?

666
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,472
Why should I be here
for crimes I didn't commit?

667
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,269
Jeez, you called me
at this late hour just to ask that?

668
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,230
-You're done, right?
-No.

669
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,606
How could a military prosecutor
fabricate evidence

670
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,192
and turn an innocent person
into a criminal?

671
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,529
How can you call yourself
a military prosecutor?

672
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,537
-Do you think that's unfair?
-Yes.

673
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,707
It's so unfair I'm about to go crazy.

674
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,585
Did you forget already?

675
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,878
You don't deserve to do that.

676
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,549
Then I'm sure you now know

677
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,261
that how unfair it was for that guy
who got beaten to death by you.

678
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,020
Hey, Jung-min, you record it.

679
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,064
Hey, make sure you do it well.

680
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,778
Hey.

681
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,947
Do you think it's unfair?

682
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,285
So you should've had good parents.

683
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,873
If you have, then you wouldn't
have been in this mess, right?

684
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,542
Look at this bastard.

685
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,712
You bastard.

686
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,217
Did you think changing your name and
working hard during your military service

687
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,220
would launder your past?

688
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,266
This world isn't
rainbows and butterflies, buddy.

689
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,727
What does that have to do with this?

690
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,025
Now your true colors are finally revealed.

691
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,945
It must've been hard
to hide who you truly are so far.

692
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,824
You ruined my life overnight like this,

693
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,662
and you want to act like
a hero of justice now?

694
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,163
Justice?

695
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,918
That doesn't really suit me.

696
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,796
But thanks to that,
my guilt has been reduced.

697
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,839
You bastard!

698
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,886
I have a feeling that this won't be
the end of our connection.

699
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,263
See you again.

700
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,503
Alan, I'm leaving now.

701
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,507
Just make yourself at home.

702
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,384
He's a really nice guy.

703
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,177
I'm just here to drink coffee.

704
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,638
I didn't know it was this kind
of a place. I'm sorry.

705
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,141
Hey, what's wrong?

706
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,435
Other people are lining up
because they are dying to come in here.

707
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,228
I should get going.

708
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,690
If you don't like it,

709
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,526
should I order coffee for you?

710
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,155
We made sure
everything was set up perfectly,

711
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,158
so you should drink something
at least for us.

712
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,409
Right.

713
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,369
Think of me too.

714
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,539
Just have one glass, Se-na.
Just one glass.

715
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,915
Hey, bring a cup of coffee.

716
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,186
Do you want to pet my boy Bolt?

717
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,937
Bolt, go to her.

718
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,168
By the way, how do you know him?

719
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,464
I've been Alan's fan
since he was an idol trainee.

720
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,718
But he sent a DM to me first,
so I was totally happy.

721
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,596
Why did you tell him that?
It's embarrassing.

722
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,139
Here, drink it.

723
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,620
Come on.

724
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,207
Salute.

725
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,544
Let's see.

726
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,091
-And wake up.
-Yes, ma'am.

727
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,134
Thank you, ma'am.

728
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,679
Wait.

729
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,349
Are you okay? It's all right.

730
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,476
It's okay.

731
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,523
By the way, how could you still try to
discipline someone when you're an officer?

732
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,484
That soldier is not in a condition
to be interrogated.

733
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,278
Didn't you do it?

734
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,781
Hey, didn't you discipline her
when she first got her?

735
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,033
He made me go to the scene
and smell the corpse,

736
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,704
and made me search the mountain
for three days straight to find hair.

737
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,456
Wow! Subsection Chief Ahn,
I didn't do that.

738
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,791
You did that.

739
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,627
Even now, when I recall that smell…

740
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,257
-Prosecutor.
-Don't tell me you're vomiting.

741
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,677
I made you do those things because
they were necessary for investigations,

742
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,305
and thanks to me doing that,

743
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,683
you've become the best investigator now.

744
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,478
-Salute.
-Yes, let's smile, cheer up, and do this.

745
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,191
I wonder if Prosecutor Cha is doing
a good job with the interrogation--

746
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,653
Hey!

747
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,742
He got agitated during the interrogation.

748
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,287
Get away! I said, get away!

749
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,206
Don't come closer.

750
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,208
-I will take care of it.
-Get away!

751
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,710
Don't move!

752
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,961
Don't come any closer!

753
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,716
Don't come any closer! Damn it!

754
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,428
Drop that!

755
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,848
Don't come any closer! Damn it!

756
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,039
It's my fault.

757
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,124
I will take any kind of punishment.

758
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,920
But you were calm in that situation.

759
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,630
Not bad.

760
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,925
By the way, about earlier…

761
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,596
What?

762
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,516
Never mind.

763
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,202
I'm off for the day.

764
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,083
I should get going too.

765
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,668
Okay, bye.

766
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,467
Military Prosecutor.

767
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,180
What's wrong with you?
You've been staring at me.

768
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,266
By any chance,

769
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,895
-don't tell me you're…
-Hey, by the way,

770
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,522
wasn't Cha Woo-in a bit weird earlier?

771
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,900
"Weird."

772
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,945
Well, that's how it gets started
most of the time.

773
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,491
From what I see, she is weird.

774
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,409
No.

775
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,411
I can't think of the exact word.

776
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,456
She is weird, but isn’t weird.

777
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,374
What is this?

778
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,377
Gosh, what is it?

779
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,962
That's love.

780
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,842
Finally, a flower is blooming
from your heart,

781
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,761
which is as hard as a rock.

782
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,348
Time to work.

783
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,476
Wow, a flower is blooming.

784
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,150
How about a drink with me?

785
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,072
I'm sorry. I have something
important to do today.

786
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,659
I guess you were quite shocked earlier.

787
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,954
It's because Military Prosecutor Doh
made you interrogate.

788
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,331
So I wanted to buy you a drink.

789
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,500
It's sad for me too.

790
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,378
I wanted to badmouth
Military Prosecutor Doh too.

791
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,882
"WI?"

792
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,218
It must be your initials.

793
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,263
Yes, it's my initials.

794
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,139
It's pretty. It looks great on you.

795
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,893
I must get going now.

796
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,353
Get some good rest.

797
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,807
Something feels uncanny.

798
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,143
She's suspicious.

799
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,146
Bring Cha Woo-in's
personal information files.

800
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,856
I knew it!

801
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,274
That's what it is.

802
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,110
This curiosity toward someone.

803
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,737
This desire that makes you want

804
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,073
to dig into her personal information
as much as possible.

805
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,658
Go bring them now.

806
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,953
But you must distinguish
unrequited love from stalking.

807
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,081
Those two are very different
in nature, so…

808
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,542
Keep going.

809
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,127
I'm on my way.

810
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,754
-Keep going.
-No, your muscle…

811
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,756
Why is it only growing?

812
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,133
That punk. I've been pampering him, and…

813
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,986
The first stroke is…

814
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,783
What happened to your face?

815
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,034
Just play cards.

816
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,954
No way, you bastard.

817
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,957
Has the new Cartel porn been released?

818
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,375
What new porn? Damn it.

819
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,627
It did, right? You jerk! It did!

820
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,088
Hey, it's been so long
since a new one got released.

821
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,508
Hey, upload it
on the group chat right away.

822
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,926
If not, we'll kick you out.

823
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,262
Jeez, that's not what it is!
Shut up and have fun.

824
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,806
Damn it.

825
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,059
You're hiding it.
That means it's a hardcore one.

826
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,895
-Upload it now.
-Jeez.

827
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,942
What the heck?

828
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,951
I told you not to bring
any girls to this place!

829
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,954
-A girl?
-A girl?

830
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,581
-Who called her?
-None of us did.

831
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,252
Wow, damn it, she's hot.

832
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,296
Jeez, seriously.

833
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,388
Who are you?

834
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,225
Hi. Mr. Noh Tae-nam sent me.

835
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,062
How are you acquainted with Tae-nam?
He never said that.

836
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,899
Mr. Noh paid me a lot of basic fees,
and a lot of tips too.

837
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,736
Really?

838
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,905
Well, come in for now.

839
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,749
Hello.

840
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,714
Tae-nam has some serious mood swings.

841
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,551
It looks like he overreacted today
because of his mood, but…

842
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,098
He shouldn't be telling people
about this place, seriously.

843
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,808
Wow.

844
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,145
You came here on your own, okay?

845
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,481
If you change your words later,
you're dead.

846
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,400
I did come here on my own.

847
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,612
Why are you suddenly talking down?

848
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,701
Are you always impatient?

849
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,036
Yes.

850
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,623
Let's get to the point.

851
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,836
Eight weeks for a full recovery.

852
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,130
What? Who?

853
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,173
Se-na.

854
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,802
What you and Noh Tae-nam
did to Se-na in Cartel.

855
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,887
Eight weeks for a full recovery from
assault and rape.

856
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,640
And psychiatric treatment
will take longer.

857
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,849
Maybe for the rest of her life.

858
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,562
Who are you?

859
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,442
You drugged a girl,
recorded footage of her with a phone,

860
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,820
and shared the footage in a group chat.

861
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,156
Give me the phone you used,
or I'll kill you.

862
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,659
You lowlife maggots.

863
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,600
How brave of you

864
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,019
to come here alone.

865
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,313
Of course.

866
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,400
I knew you wouldn't listen
if I just talked this out.

867
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,485
Well, I'm not here to
just talk this out either.

868
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,071
I see.

869
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,075
She graduated high school in California,

870
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,454
and went to law school
at Stanford University, but quit.

871
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,165
There was no record of her
for the next three years,

872
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,792
and she passed the Korean Bar Exam.

873
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,381
What a lucky wench.

874
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,091
And you're an unlucky bastard.

875
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,969
The soundproofing is so good that
nobody can hear your wailing from outside.

876
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,890
Multi-use apartment complexes
don't have noise issues.

877
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,391
You crazy wench!

878
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,614
But she didn't join any Korean law firms

879
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,366
or attend any trials after that.

880
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,478
Hey!

881
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,290
But she's not really meant
to be a serviceperson either.

882
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,751
She barely made it through
the physical fitness test.

883
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,129
She's totally bad with anything
that requires physical strength.

884
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,258
She doesn't even have
a Taekwondo certification.

885
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,856
Guard below your chin.

886
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,484
Gather your arms.

887
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,443
Pull your chin.

888
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,113
Right, you bastard!

889
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,657
I dropped my guard, and…

890
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,605
Get up.

891
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,568
Stop whining and get up,
or I'll beat you up even more.

892
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,743
Give me your phone.

893
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,496
Tae-nam is involved in it too,
so he won't just sit still.

894
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,169
Can you deal with Noh Tae-nam?

895
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:39,135
That's exactly what I want.

896
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,993
Cha Woo-in…

897
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,371
Why did she become
a military prosecutor out of all things?

898
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,875
Didn't you hear anything else
besides what's written on here?

899
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,002
You know I'm the source of
information in the military, right?

900
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,505
I called everyone, but no one knows.

901
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,258
She never had any interactions
with her law officer colleagues.

902
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,552
Really?

903
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,764
Wait. This isn't unrequited love

904
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,974
or stalking, actually. Then what is it?

905
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,103
What's bothering you so much? Good grief.

906
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,984
Jeez, what are you doing?

907
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,320
Why are you getting weirder?

908
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,782
Cha Woo-in wasn't afraid.

909
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,913
That's the starting point
of all of my questions.

910
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,624
She pretended to be afraid.

911
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,889
I'm done.

912
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,558
Come take care of things here.

913
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,994
If I can turn back time,

914
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,080
if I can do that…

915
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,710
If I can go back to that day…

916
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,509
CEO CHA HO-CHUL

917
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,393
-Dad.
-Yes?

918
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:56,272
Why is our company named IM?

919
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,486
I named it after you, my daughter.

920
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,113
But my name is Woo-in.

921
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,907
What?

922
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,620
Woo-in, what are your initials in English?

923
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,623
W and I.

924
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,376
That's right. Now, let's see.

925
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,711
Here.

926
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,881
Woo-in, your initials

927
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,760
are W and…

928
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,931
I.

929
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,225
-Is that right?
-Yes.

930
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,935
Turn it upside down.

931
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,441
The world where justice and truth
are all turned upside down.

932
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:45,363
You can see it correctly
only when you see it upside down.

933
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,158
I lost my father,

934
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,829
and lost everything too.

935
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,428
Why do you find Military Prosecutor
Cha Woo-in so suspicious?

936
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,764
-Alan has disappeared.
-Tell him to look for him.

937
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,724
That military guy who dealt
with "Imperial Military Service."

938
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:18,688
I throw myself into this fated wave called
Noh Tae-nam that's rushing toward me!

939
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,023
If you want to make them
pay for what they did…

940
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,108
But it's your decision.

941
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,527
Something happened
at Cartel that day, right?

942
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,113
Kill Doh Bae-man.

943
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,740
The path always formed after I walked.

944
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,076
And I'll make a path this time too.

945
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:41,377
