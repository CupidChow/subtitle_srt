1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,067
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,193
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,278
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,202
ONE YEAR AGO

7
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,207
The military prosecution
knows better than anyone else

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,294
that illegally collected evidence
has no legal validity.

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,045
You see…

10
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,592
It is true that Staff Sergeant Oh
acquired the recording illegally,

11
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,595
but it was a defensive action
to prove his superior's power trip.

12
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,346
But it's still illegal.

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,348
But you are defending

14
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,227
the victim who broke the law?
You're a prosecutor.

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,021
What did you just say?

16
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,940
Are you insulting
the military prosecution?

17
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,568
I ask that his defense record be deleted!

18
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,361
Prosecutor, please calm down.

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,656
I acknowledge
that illegally collected evidence

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,326
has no legal validity as evidence.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,456
Military Prosecutor,
you may begin cross-examination.

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,879
Colonel Lee Do-hyung,
now sitting in the defendant's seat.

23
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,048
I know it's very uncomfortable,

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,258
but Staff Sergeant Oh, the victim,

25
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,928
does have a recording,
which he recorded illegally.

26
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,222
Around 6:00 on September 26.

27
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,807
Do you not remember at all?

28
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,476
I don't.

29
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,645
I see.

30
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,028
Those two have perfect teamwork.

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,992
The only evidence that can prove
the power trip is the recording,

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,621
but the military prosecutor is
emphasizing that it's illegal.

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,707
Doh Bae-man is trying to lose this trial

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,209
on purpose.

35
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,713
To Doh Bae-man,
the military court is a place

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,508
where rank is above the law,
and money is above rank.

37
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,302
Even if that money-crazy jerk

38
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,431
finds out the truth
about his parents' deaths 20 years ago…

39
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,976
will he choose revenge over money?

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,106
Doh Bae-man is in Yong Moon-goo's gang
without knowing anything.

41
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,359
I want to at least
pull him out of that gang.

42
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,487
Hey. You're being overly sympathetic.

43
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,906
Maybe so.

44
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,951
Woo-in.

45
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,579
A person's past is his or her future.

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:47,000
What Doh Bae-man is doing now
will backfire in the future.

47
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,169
Which means, you'll be in trouble, too.

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,380
What will you do then?

49
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,519
The former CEOs Cha Ho-chul
and Noh Tae-nam

50
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,689
all ruined the reputation of IM
to the lowest.

51
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,191
I'm going to change

52
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,527
the shadows of the past.

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,615
Well, then.

54
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,916
Yong Moon-goo…

55
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,877
knows all about it.

56
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,591
He knows
that I'm CEO Cha Ho-chul's daughter.

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,510
Are you sure?

58
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,263
I expected that he'd figure out someday,

59
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,974
but it's sooner than I expected.

60
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,980
If Yong Moon-goo knows,
it means Noh Hwa-young knows, too.

61
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,067
They'll soon find out about me, too.

62
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,445
We're running out of time.

63
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,123
The Division Commander's alibi

64
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,500
has been confirmed.

65
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,503
During the estimated time
of Won Ki-choon's death,

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,798
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young
did not leave the military residence.

67
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,299
Okay, good work.

68
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,679
Won Ki-choon's fingerprints
found on the revolver.

69
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
Damage by gunfire from a close distance.

70
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,433
Gunpowder left on his hand
and Noh Hwa-young's alibi.

71
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,895
It's clearly a suicide,
according to the documents, I mean.

72
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,400
Noh Hwa-young got away
using the same method 20 years ago.

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,820
The only one related
to the hero of mines case left now

74
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,321
is Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan.

75
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,287
I'm sure Yong Moon-goo hid him somewhere.

76
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,414
Seeing how he went
after the medical officer

77
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,124
without telling Noh Hwa-young,

78
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,793
it must be for insurance,
like Won Ki-choon.

79
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,169
You're right.

80
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,423
Let's go to this place first.

81
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,675
Yes, sir. We're taking off now.

82
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,018
The successor of Kim Se-joon,

83
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,395
the Chief of Staff of the Army,
whose term ends next month,

84
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,647
has been internally decided
to be Hong Moo-seob,

85
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,899
the Corps Commander
of the IV Corps of the Army.

86
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,444
According to the Ministry
of National Defense, they nominated him

87
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,612
because he has the ability
to lead operations,

88
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,532
has military expertise,
leads innovation in national defense

89
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,076
and the conversion
of wartime operational control,

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,912
and has high competency
and a noble personality.

91
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,167
You will be next in the line.

92
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,461
Then you'll be the first female

93
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,213
Chief of Staff of the Army
in the military's history.

94
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,051
Do you think Corps Commander Hong
will let that happen?

95
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,844
What?

96
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,929
They say not even a blade of grass is left

97
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,599
on the path Hong Moo-seob
has walked through.

98
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,477
Because he tramples on them
before they even sprout.

99
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,773
About Doh Bae-man and Cha Woo-in…

100
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,818
I'm sure you can do something about them,
like transfer them,

101
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,612
so why are you letting them be?

102
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,282
I told you not to be interested
in the matters of my division.

103
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,621
Because I have to be ready at all times.

104
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,585
Those who bear a grudge against me
or harbor hostility toward me,

105
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,379
must be all locked up
under my surveillance.

106
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,925
It can become more troublesome
if they leave the Division.

107
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,303
But these days,

108
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,724
your interest in my matters

109
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,434
seems a bit different from before.

110
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,355
Of course not.

111
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,109
If anything's lacking,
I will take a closer look.

112
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,824
It's a relief that the case
of Won Ki-choon has been wrapped up.

113
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,537
He's been my subordinate for a long time.

114
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,289
I feel bad.

115
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,087
I'm sure you were planning
to go beyond the leg

116
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,257
the moment you cut off Won Ki-choon's leg.

117
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,261
I will take care
of Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan.

118
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,556
We can't let him say anything stupid
about Won Ki-choon's leg.

119
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,182
Well, then.

120
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,124
How are you going to pay
for failing to do your job?

121
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,631
I, Seol-ak…

122
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,218
Let go!

123
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,847
I will pay for it
by doing what I deserve to get…

124
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,142
right in front of you.

125
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,200
We failed because we couldn't stop
the press conference,

126
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,743
please give us one more chance.

127
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,078
I will take care
of the medical officer for sure.

128
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,663
I'll get rid of him!

129
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,664
Let him be.

130
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,709
Are you okay with not killing him?

131
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,879
Or are you planning
to keep him until he's aged well,

132
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,631
and take him out to use him…

133
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,849
Don't you dare to try to read my mind.

134
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,851
Oh, no.

135
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,062
I seriously crossed the line, again.

136
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,815
I will make sure to keep him

137
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,944
locked up.

138
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,632
God, it'll take forever
to open all these cars.

139
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,802
The license plate number is 0673.

140
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,762
0673.

141
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,974
-You go this way, and I go this way.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,517
0673.

143
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,737
0673.

144
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,626
Did you find it?

145
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,170
It's on this side, either.

146
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,426
I guess my hunch isn't good enough now.

147
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,764
-What?
-Where are you going?

148
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,890
Prosecutor Cha!

149
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,563
0673.

150
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,524
067…

151
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,736
CALL THIS NUMBER WHEN WE'RE NOT HERE
LONG-TERM PARKING LOT MAINTENANCE

152
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,260
So this is Won Ki-choon's
secret hidden vault.

153
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,803
That's a lot of things.

154
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,347
Let's get started.

155
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:49,523
I think this is enough to lift my father's
charges on leaking military secrets.

156
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,568
See? I told you Won Ki-choon
would have insurance, right?

157
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,781
This is the document he prepared
in case his perjury was revealed.

158
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,909
That's my hunch.
This is how good I am, you know.

159
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,495
You have a lot to learn.

160
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,622
Yes, sure.

161
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,916
-This is amazing.
-Sure.

162
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,922
Hi.

163
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,384
Is this all? What about everything else?

164
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,638
We only brought
what we should check immediately.

165
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,225
Kang, hurry and restore this.

166
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,773
WON KI-CHOON

167
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,816
Wow, this is…

168
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,236
This looks like an army notebook
handwritten by Won Ki-choon.

169
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,410
He had some different sides to him.

170
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,539
He left a detailed record,
which is like a diary.

171
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,712
I think we should meet Chief Yeom
and check with him.

172
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,339
That's good.

173
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,759
Sir?

174
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,636
Yes, what is it?

175
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,105
Woo-in, I need to go now.

176
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,482
Okay. Is it urgent?

177
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,151
No, it's not a big deal.

178
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,069
I'll restore this quickly.

179
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,737
You need to hurry.

180
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,738
Bye.

181
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,783
Give that to me.

182
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,076
It's okay.

183
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,121
It's a relief…

184
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,708
that we found something
to clear CEO Cha's name.

185
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,130
We just pulled out one of the arrows
that pierced my father's back.

186
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,133
We didn't begin a battle
against Noh Hwa-young yet.

187
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,596
By the way, CEO Kang
is so busy with his work,

188
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,556
but he comes whenever you call him.

189
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,142
How can he be so devoted to you?

190
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,895
He's not even family. He's your friend…

191
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,397
He is your friend, right?

192
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,653
I told you my father helped CEO Kang a lot
when he was having a hard time.

193
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,156
Do you really think that's all?

194
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,077
CEO Kang is a very important helper
in our plan.

195
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,246
Please do not doubt him ever again.

196
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,874
No, it's not that, I mean…

197
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,002
She has no hunch at all.

198
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,505
Wait for me.

199
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,509
The stock prices suddenly dropped?
What's going on?

200
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,969
The Financial Director said
it started to drop today,

201
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,721
and even a VI has been activated.

202
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,722
What?

203
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,724
It looks like a false rumor that we leaked

204
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,810
industrial technology for military
mobility is spreading right now.

205
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,355
Leak technology? That's just absurd…

206
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,108
Then there's another rumor
about the FSS looking into it,

207
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,860
and it added fuel to it.

208
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,447
What should we do?

209
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,202
Issue a retraction and find out
who spread the false information

210
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,037
and take action, now!

211
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,121
Yes, sir.

212
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,217
Doh Bae-man only pursued money
while working for me,

213
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,011
but he totally changed
after he met Cha Woo-in.

214
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,347
I'm sure they're intertwined
through something.

215
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,890
Doh Bae-man said

216
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,478
that the only thing I did wrong is
doing what you told me to do.

217
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,698
Find out about Doh Bae-man.
Every single thing about him.

218
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,705
-Salute!
-Yes, salute.

219
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,338
Yes, Prosecutor Cha. I just arrived.

220
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,465
Please come to the office of justice.

221
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,383
Okay.

222
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,099
It looks like the computer is down again.
All of the materials are gone.

223
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:56,020
Did you delete them again like last time?
How many times have you done this?

224
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,856
Okay. Move.

225
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,568
Now, look.

226
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,195
A double click, and three-second typing.

227
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,032
Wow, that's awesome.

228
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,158
You truly are amazing.

229
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,869
You irreplaceable computer illiterate.

230
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,955
Hey, the age of metaverse is coming, okay?

231
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,876
-Salute.
-Salute.

232
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,878
How can we help you?

233
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,089
I have an appointment with
prosecutors Cha Woo-in and Doh Bae-man.

234
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,382
You're here.

235
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,595
He's Chief Yeom Sang-jin
of the office of justice, 58th Division.

236
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,890
What are you doing?

237
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,642
-Salute to him.
-Salute.

238
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,644
What? Sergeant First Class Ahn Yoo-ra?

239
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,438
You've been working here?

240
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,398
Do you know Subsection Chief Ahn?

241
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,027
Of course. She was in the hacking unit
at the Cyber Command.

242
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,030
What? The hacking unit?

243
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,699
That's not true at all.

244
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,662
She's the top computer illiterate
who can't even use a restoration program.

245
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,497
That can't be.

246
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,332
Her family runs an electronics shop,

247
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,668
so she learned to hack
before she learned--

248
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,044
-Chief Yeom.
-Yes?

249
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,088
Hold still. Wait a second.

250
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,802
Subsection Chief Ahn,
did you say your family lives in Yongsan?

251
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,178
No.

252
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:15,224
If you're known to be good at something
in the military, from that moment…

253
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,893
You have to do all the work
related to that.

254
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,354
Just like me. Serves you right.

255
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,775
I guess I leaked a secret that's too big.

256
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,110
Yes.

257
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,570
So, I'm going out for work now.

258
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,697
Salute.

259
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,949
Don't go. Let's have a talk, okay?

260
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,368
Come on. Hey, Ahn!

261
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,579
How could you!

262
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,290
What the heck? Why are you being so noisy?

263
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,750
Salute.

264
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,670
What?

265
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,754
Ahn!

266
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,476
This is the army notebook
Won Ki-choon wrote himself.

267
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
How did you find this?

268
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,522
We found it
in Won Ki-choon's secret vault.

269
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,859
I didn't know this existed.

270
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,280
It's extremely detailed.

271
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,491
He started recording things
exactly 20 years ago.

272
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,870
That's the year
your parents had that accident.

273
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,538
Yes.

274
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,417
Since then, Won Ki-choon has recorded
Noh Hwa-young's daily tasks,

275
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,628
and she met Corps Commander
Hong Moo-seob quite often.

276
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,048
Noh was a supply transportation officer,

277
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,758
and Hong was a staff judge advocate,

278
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,719
so they had no connection
in terms of work.

279
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,556
At that time, she wasn't a member
of the Patriotic Society, either.

280
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,476
So Won Ki-choon found that weird too

281
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,436
and recorded it.

282
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,106
He looked like the most loyal henchman
on the outside,

283
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,358
but he recorded everything
about his superior.

284
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,029
So our next game is…

285
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,116
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob.

286
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,786
He's currently a three-star general,

287
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,039
and the chairman of the disciplinary
committee who punished us.

288
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,542
Graduated from the Military Academy,
passed the bar exam during his service,

289
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,377
and transferred to the law department,

290
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,839
and he was in many key positions
of military justice

291
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,636
before he transferred back to the infantry
and became a corps commander.

292
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,889
He's the most elite serviceperson
in the history of military.

293
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,100
PATRIOTIC SOCIETY
HONG MOO-SEOB

294
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,646
Staff Judge Advocate
is going to the office of justice.

295
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,815
Staff Judge Advocate is coming. Hide it.

296
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,026
Salute!

297
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,781
What? Who are you…

298
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,782
Salute.

299
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,286
I'm Chief Yeom Sang-jin
from the office of justice, 58th Division.

300
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,873
What? 58th Division?

301
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,002
What brings someone from the office
of justice of a different division here?

302
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,588
You see…

303
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,591
We asked Chief Yeom to come
so we can get his advice.

304
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,801
Advice?

305
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,304
But he's an investigator,
not military prosecutor.

306
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,016
And from I heard from outside,

307
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,521
you were talking
about Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob.

308
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,815
No?

309
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,899
I'm sure.

310
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,026
I heard with my own ears.

311
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,612
You were talking
about Corps Commander Hong.

312
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,614
I watched the news today,

313
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,410
and I saw that he was selected
to be the next Chief of Staff,

314
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,996
so I thought
about visiting his house beforehand.

315
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,165
But I don't know what he likes…

316
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,042
I don't know. What does he like?

317
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,210
That's right.

318
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,920
I served him a long time ago.

319
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,383
You're going to meet him in person?

320
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,761
Did he say that he'll meet you?

321
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,183
He lifted our punishment,

322
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,977
so I want to go thank him,
and this and that…

323
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,145
Right?

324
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,985
Wow, Prosecutor Doh,
you're way better at this than I am.

325
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,988
Go put in a good word for me, okay?

326
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:07,331
And Captain Cha Woo-in, never go with him!

327
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,707
Never!

328
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,459
Of course not.

329
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,044
I can't take her there.

330
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,754
It'll be a disaster.

331
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,797
Right. It'll be a disaster.

332
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,259
All right, then, keep doing
what you were doing.

333
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,969
-Salute!
-Yes.

334
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,763
-Please come often.
-Thank you.

335
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,390
-Salute.
-Bye.

336
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,240
If Hong Moo-seob has something
to do with your parents' accident,

337
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,033
then maybe

338
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,744
that incident has something to do with it.

339
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,089
Come in, you bastard!

340
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,299
Stand straight!

341
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,593
Stand straight, you bastard!

342
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,512
You bastard!

343
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,973
Lack of evidence!

344
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,557
Clear from suspicions!

345
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,811
Non-indictment! You bastard!

346
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,356
Hey!

347
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,986
How dare you disobey
a military prosecutor? You bastard!

348
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,446
You damn worm!

349
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,156
You bastard!

350
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,737
Buy an ointment on your way back.

351
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,073
And buy some food for your son.

352
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,415
MILITARY INVESTIGATOR ID
DOH SUNG-HWAN

353
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,881
If anyone disobeyed him,
he became someone completely different,

354
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,591
like he had split personalities.

355
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,343
Like it was hard to tell
which was the real Hong Moo-seob.

356
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,847
Do you know which case Hong Moo-seob
was trying to cover up at that time?

357
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,309
The office of justice was working
on so many cases,

358
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,935
so I'm not sure, either.

359
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,104
If you had suspicions
or if there was a clue,

360
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,439
you would've known already.

361
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,815
I would have.

362
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,028
If you read this notebook,

363
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,614
maybe you'll find something
we couldn't find.

364
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,657
I'll read it meticulously,

365
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,036
meet those who were related
to that case, and find out.

366
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,538
-Thank you, Chief Yeom.
-Sure.

367
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,541
Prosecutor Doh,
you should go meet Hong Moo-seob.

368
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,880
I must find out
what happened to my father.

369
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,801
In order to do so,
I must find out about Hong Moo-seob's

370
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,469
two faces.

371
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,970
It won't be easy.

372
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,723
He's way too perfect, so…

373
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,936
Perfect…

374
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,980
My experiences over
the past five years taught me

375
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,733
that someone who's "perfect"
is actually stinky and rotten

376
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,653
under the mask he or she is wearing.

377
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,739
-Salute!
-Hi.

378
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,408
Here. You've confirmed my identity, right?

379
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,660
PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID
DOH BAE-MAN

380
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,580
You are not allowed to bring your phone
into the residence.

381
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,251
So? You're asking a military prosecutor
to give you his phone?

382
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:43,046
All things related to the Corps Commander
are military secrets.

383
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,007
We ask for your cooperation,
Captain Doh Bae-man.

384
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,009
Wow, military secrets…

385
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,804
This place is scary.

386
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,472
Okay, well…

387
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,354
We will perform a security screening.

388
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,486
RESTRICTED AREA

389
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,654
You may enter now.

390
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,583
Thank you for lifting my punishment,
Corps Commander.

391
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,715
Did you make an appointment
just to say that?

392
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,302
Gosh, I wouldn't have another chance
to talk to you like this.

393
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,638
You were just working hard
as a military prosecutor.

394
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,932
Keep up the good work.

395
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,726
Yes, sir.

396
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,148
I heard that you used to
be a military prosecutor, too.

397
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,109
That was 20 years ago, I think.

398
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,823
You've always remained consistent,
so I didn't realize how long it has been.

399
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,912
It's not much, but…

400
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,878
I will serve you with loyalty,
Corps Commander.

401
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,761
He's just like you from
20 years ago, my brother.

402
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,306
You are dignified,
and you're loyal to your superior.

403
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,933
You're flattering me.

404
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,064
Wow.

405
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,568
Just wine.

406
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,215
Hong Moo-seob manages himself
and those around him strictly,

407
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,841
but there's something strange.

408
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,970
That his residence soldier changes often.

409
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,596
Residence soldier?

410
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,350
I can smell it already.

411
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,936
The foul stench of power tripping.

412
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,774
He must have been working
at the resident for a long time.

413
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,151
How long has it been?

414
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,154
Staff Sergeant Shin Min-chul.

415
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,657
I've been serving
the Corps Commander for six months.

416
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,368
He's very nice,
and he's a good worker, too.

417
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,705
My son is in the battlefront
and he's having a hard time, too,

418
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,125
so I want to look after him
with a heart of a mother.

419
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,295
His nephew is serving in the front lines?

420
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,592
You worked on a lot of cases
Noh might feel uncomfortable with.

421
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,928
How are you getting along with her?

422
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,930
Well, as a serviceperson,

423
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,308
I am always loyal
to the Division Commander.

424
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,643
But at the same time,

425
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,604
I work with faith
as a military prosecutor, so…

426
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,816
Are you saying that you volunteered

427
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,027
to play the villain
for the Division Commander?

428
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,239
I'm embarrassed to say it myself,
Corps Commander.

429
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,283
Have some tea.

430
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,451
Thank you.

431
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,717
Was Shin Min-chul
at Hong Moo-seob's residence?

432
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,844
Do you know him?

433
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:24,142
They said they treat him like family,
but they overreacted, so I'm convinced.

434
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,977
He didn't look happy, either.

435
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,271
I must meet him separately
outside the residence.

436
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,691
I'll meet Staff Sergeant Shin.

437
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,777
No, no, I must meet him myself.

438
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,738
He's been enduring all the power tripping.

439
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,742
This requires persuasion skills.
I must meet him.

440
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,413
I'm sure he won't cooperate with you.

441
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,374
What does that mean?

442
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,000
I must make him cooperate.

443
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,462
I made that conscription doctor testify
a few months ago, okay?

444
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,089
And we won the trial.

445
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,299
That's why it won't work out.

446
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,343
Because of that method of yours.

447
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,931
What's wrong with you?

448
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,851
It seems like you're swallowing
the words you want to say.

449
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,478
What is it that you want to say?

450
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,732
Don’t worry.

451
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,610
I worked on a lot
of power tripping case trials too.

452
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,363
Have you ever defended a victim
of power tripping before?

453
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,615
What?

454
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:24,661
I'm asking you if there was a time
you worked on a trial not based on rank.

455
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,955
Why are you bringing out
my past all of a sudden?

456
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,624
The Won Ki-choon case was half successful.

457
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,753
I will make Hong Moo-seob
stand trial this time,

458
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,089
for my father.

459
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,687
SANITARY PADS

460
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,241
-Do you have pomegranates?
-Pomegranates?

461
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,869
We don't anything like that here.

462
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,704
Buy them online.

463
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,248
I must see them
and buy ones that are perfect.

464
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,170
You must be a newlywed.
Is your wife pregnant and craving them?

465
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,589
I must buy them…

466
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,092
Why do you need pomegranates? I'm sure
they're not available around here.

467
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,598
What brings you here?

468
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,558
I'm here to buy these.

469
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,476
Want one?

470
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,269
If you have no business with me.

471
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,522
If you have time,
want to have tea with me?

472
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,441
I have this cafe I go to often.

473
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,151
I must go back immediately.

474
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,988
You can ride my car and look
for supermarkets with pomegranates too.

475
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,615
Ones that are perfect.

476
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,163
I'll ask Madam Hong.

477
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,831
Okay.

478
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,797
Ssanghwa tea is the signature menu here.

479
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,802
Do you shop for groceries, too?

480
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,305
What do you want?

481
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,098
Did the Corps Commander's
younger sister give you

482
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,892
the task to buy perfect pomegranates?

483
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,895
I must leave now.

484
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,981
-Don't go.
-What do you think you're doing?

485
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,820
Wow, it's a smartwatch.

486
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,197
You must be getting special privileges.

487
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,615
Let me go, please.

488
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,243
I'm investigating Corps Commander
Hong's power tripping.

489
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,496
Answer my questions.

490
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,666
You're working like a servant
at the residence, right?

491
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,172
Not being able to answer
is an answer, too.

492
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,465
You're admitting it.

493
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,933
They called you all the time
and made you run errands,

494
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,271
and you were abused
physically and mentally.

495
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,070
Did you become a career soldier

496
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,365
to be a housekeeper
for the Corps Commander?

497
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,503
Then I'd like to ask you one thing, too.

498
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,338
Yes.

499
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,799
Wise decision.

500
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,301
Ask me anything.

501
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,013
I swear I'll make that Corps Commander
who harassed you totally fall, okay?

502
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,431
Tell me everything.

503
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,974
Don't you…

504
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,061
remember me?

505
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:39,856
You?

506
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,406
Have we met before?

507
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,951
I knew it. You don't remember me.

508
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,497
The weight of memories
is different for everyone.

509
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,962
Now, I will answer your question,
Captain Doh.

510
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,131
I…

511
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,467
have never,

512
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,218
I mean never,

513
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,972
have suffered any power tripping
at the Corps Commander's residence.

514
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,741
I'm sorry I can't help you,

515
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,868
Captain Doh Bae-man.

516
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,789
Staff Sergeant Shin!

517
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,928
What…

518
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,973
He didn't suffer any power tripping?

519
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,059
And what does he mean that he knows me?

520
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,896
I'm sure he said that
because he's afraid of Hong Moo-seob--

521
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,564
It's not because of Hong Moo-seob.

522
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,233
Then?

523
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,069
It's because of you.

524
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,153
It's because of…

525
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,030
Because of me?

526
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,409
Is that why you told me not to meet him?

527
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,622
Prosecutor Cha. Why did you say that?
Do you know something about it?

528
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,586
Do you remember a trial
you worked on a year ago?

529
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,215
A trial from a year ago…

530
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,092
How can I remember every single trial?

531
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,679
The trial you lost on purpose
by scheming with Yong Moon-goo

532
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,305
was a trial on power tripping.

533
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,811
The court now sentences the verdict
for Colonel Lee Do-hyung, the defendant.

534
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,941
The military prosecution failed to prove
Colonel Lee's charges of power tripping,

535
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,110
in other words, authority abuse,

536
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,571
to his subordinate through the trial,

537
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,199
and all of the evidence is
based solely on the victim's statement,

538
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,452
therefore, the verdict
is sentenced as follows.

539
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,619
The defendant is

540
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,704
found not guilty.

541
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,148
If a military prosecutor does not have
a will to prove guilt,

542
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,859
the judge can never sentence
a guilty verdict.

543
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,278
Right. That will.

544
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,032
When you think about it,
the court is a stage for prosecutors.

545
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,160
The prosecutors
are the main characters, right?

546
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,912
And the rest are extras.

547
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,497
You're flattering me on purpose.

548
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,249
Still, I'm only doing this today.

549
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,504
Next time, I'll do it in my way
without losing. Please keep that in mind.

550
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,840
I'll pay you more. Stop being
concerned about a drop in your win rate.

551
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,675
Thank you, Lawyer Yong.

552
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,053
You.

553
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,891
You lost the trial on purpose, didn't you?

554
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,851
How can a military prosecutor do that?

555
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,188
Hey, what do you think you're doing
at the military court to a superior?

556
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,984
My colleague suffered so much
because of that bastard!

557
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,529
How could a prosecutor do that?

558
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,281
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

559
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,867
What?

560
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,203
You're sorry?

561
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,040
You people should correct it,

562
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,167
because we can't!

563
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,295
That's what you guys are for!

564
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,299
If even military prosecutors do this,
whom should we trust?

565
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,760
Just whom?

566
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,727
If you're a serviceperson,
keep your boundaries, okay?

567
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,897
Let's go have coffee.

568
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,149
Sure.

569
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,364
I saw that trial.

570
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,284
And I remembered when I saw that picture.

571
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,831
So…

572
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,961
a colleague of the victim of that trial
is Staff Sergeant Shin?

573
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,965
-And you saw that trial too?
-Yes.

574
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:20,011
Staff Sergeant Oh, continuously verbally
abused and assaulted by Colonel Lee,

575
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,680
saw his superior being pardoned
for his crimes,

576
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,516
and left the military forever.

577
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,403
Salute.

578
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,949
But Shin couldn't leave the military
to make a living,

579
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,660
and he was assigned
to the Corps Commander's residence

580
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,079
and ended up like his former colleague.

581
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,541
Goodbye.

582
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,008
Hey!

583
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,972
Why are you so late?

584
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,808
You're late on purpose
because Joon is on leave today, right?

585
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,937
-I was late because of the pomegranates.
-Really?

586
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,607
Let me see how great
those pomegranates you bought are.

587
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,656
Where are the pomegranates?

588
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,491
Where are they?

589
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,912
How dare you lie to me?

590
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,374
You had fun outside
using pomegranates as an excuse?

591
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,209
I'll go back and buy again. I'm sorry.

592
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,586
Joon and his friends will be here soon!

593
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,588
You have to prepare for the meal now!

594
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,924
I'm sorry. I'll get started now.

595
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,558
That's refreshing!

596
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,646
Lee Joon, you're going through a lot
working hard at the front lines.

597
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm hungry.
When are the snacks coming out?

598
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,110
Look, he's starving again.

599
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,904
What the heck is that jerk
Staff Sergeant Shin doing?

600
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,656
Wait for a moment.

601
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,368
What is this?

602
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,370
Nothing's been done.

603
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,708
How are we supposed to eat this?
Seriously…

604
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,503
Nothing's been done. Nothing.

605
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,133
Hey, Staff Sergeant Shin!

606
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,468
What are you doing?

607
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,887
Why didn't you come outside quickly?

608
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,264
I'll prepare it now.

609
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,433
What is this?

610
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,149
That's salty.

611
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:46,157
Are you going to make my friends starve
when they're here because I'm on leave?

612
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,326
Look here.

613
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,829
Are you looking down on me
because you're doing your service easily

614
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,372
at my uncle's house?

615
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,375
MADAM HONG

616
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,128
So noisy!

617
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,840
Hurry up and go!
You know my mom's impatient!

618
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,426
I'll go right after I cool this.

619
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,429
Why aren't you coming when I called you?

620
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,389
Have you lost your mind?

621
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,558
I was about to go, ma'am.

622
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,893
You…

623
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,105
What's wrong with you these days?

624
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,273
You have no discipline!

625
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,402
Right. Staff Sergeant Shin looks like
he's lost discipline, Mom.

626
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,279
Nothing is urgent for him.

627
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,864
I know, right?

628
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:31,452
Since you're on leave,
you should discipline him, Joon.

629
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,788
Should I? Right?

630
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,208
Listen.

631
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,252
Put your head on the ground, stat!

632
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,050
You look like a sergeant doing that.

633
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,929
What are you doing?

634
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,931
I said, stat!

635
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,652
-He's really doing it?
-Wow.

636
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,487
That's crazy. Seriously?

637
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,114
He's really doing it?

638
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,827
Come on, I was kidding.

639
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,871
How come you actually did it
just because I told you to?

640
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,166
My son, you're such a nice boy.

641
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,221
I'm asking you if there was a time
you worked on a trial not based on rank.

642
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,682
You people should correct it!

643
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,935
If even military prosecutors do this,
whom should we trust?

644
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,339
Here you go.

645
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,340
Salute.

646
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,599
MY DEAREST HYE-YOUNG

647
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,103
Hye-young.

648
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,522
Yes, it's me.

649
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,565
You called a bunch of times.

650
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,692
Are you at the hospital?

651
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,445
Okay.

652
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,740
Really?

653
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,202
Our kid cried a lot during the checkup?

654
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,332
I'm on my way to the supermarket.

655
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,043
Yeah, I'll call you again
before I turn my phone in.

656
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,212
Okay.

657
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,225
Wait, Staff Sergeant Shin.

658
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,771
I remember now.

659
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,607
I remember who you are.

660
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,734
You became a star military prosecutor.

661
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,988
The "Imperial Service," the hero of mines…

662
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,282
You even wear a mask of justice.

663
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,825
I laughed so much on my own.

664
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,868
That trial from a year ago…

665
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,497
I'm at a complete loss for words.

666
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,999
You're doing this to me now

667
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,501
as a dual play to get
the Corps Commander pardoned

668
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,212
from his crimes,
like you did to my colleague, right?

669
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,091
I won't fall for that.

670
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,844
No, that's not what it is at all.

671
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,763
You're neither a military prosecutor…

672
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,433
nor a human being.

673
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,025
My colleague…

674
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,403
strongly believed
that you would reveal the truth.

675
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,656
But he was strictly betrayed by you.

676
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,783
Yes.

677
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,078
I heard he left the military forever.

678
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,998
He died.

679
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,918
That poor guy…

680
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,964
You killed him!

681
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,384
Do you know why the military
does not change?

682
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,637
It's because of
military prosecutors like you.

683
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,432
I'd rather put up
with that power tripping.

684
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,769
I will not be tricked
by a piece of garbage like you.

685
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,354
I'm really sorry.

686
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,482
I hope that you'll become…

687
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,234
a victim, at least once.

688
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,614
Don't ever come see me again.

689
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,256
Now.

690
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,175
Bend your knees a bit,

691
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,761
straighten your back,
and focus on your shoulder line.

692
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,179
-This line?
-Yes, sir.

693
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,764
Just hit it lightly.

694
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:46,975
Nice shot!

695
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:48,852
Wow, that's great.

696
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,396
I'll try again.

697
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,087
Did you become deaf?

698
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,590
I told you to come within ten seconds
when the watch vibrates!

699
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,843
I was going to finish this and go.
I'm sorry--

700
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,927
Hey!

701
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,390
Why are you even wearing that smartwatch?

702
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,809
How dare you make me carry this to you?

703
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,104
Wash them by rubbing them with your hands

704
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,273
and rinse them ten times at least, okay?

705
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,190
Yes, ma'am.

706
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,570
And wash these with your hands

707
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,821
in a sink.

708
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,366
You mean those?

709
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,493
Are you saying
that I should wash them, then?

710
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,745
No, ma'am.

711
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,840
Nice shot, Moo-seob!

712
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,769
Isn't Prosecutor Doh here yet?

713
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,938
I think it's an unexcused absence.

714
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,232
What if something happened?

715
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,819
I've never seen Prosecutor Doh
being absent.

716
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,572
I'm worried, too.
What in the world is going on?

717
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,991
You don't know too, ma'am?

718
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,243
No.

719
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,129
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

720
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,408
An unexcused absence,
turning your phone off,

721
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,953
and this is where you've been?

722
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,290
How did you know I was here?

723
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,092
Go. I want to be alone.

724
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,908
I looked into it a bit more just in case,

725
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,539
and Colonel Lee,
who was pardoned because of me,

726
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,087
continued making more victims after that.

727
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,009
And Staff Sergeant Shin's colleague died.

728
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,142
I thought I was competent
as a military prosecutor,

729
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,188
but I was just money-crazy garbage

730
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,858
until I met you.

731
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,036
Cha Woo-in.

732
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,876
If you've been watching me
from a year ago,

733
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,423
why didn't you tell me sooner?

734
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,366
I wanted to.

735
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,994
It was hard for me to watch you

736
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,330
from a distance.

737
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,417
But I had to become

738
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,461
a military prosecutor first,

739
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,797
so I waited.

740
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,261
You came here on the day you learned about

741
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,056
who Noh Hwa-young truly is, too.

742
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,953
Like how you made
a big life decision on that day,

743
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,582
you should make
another big decision today.

744
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,841
I'm sure your parents

745
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:16,221
were in that accident
while fighting against injustice.

746
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,059
Please reveal everything
Staff Sergeant Shin is suffering

747
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,310
because of Hong Moo-seob.

748
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,772
And beg for forgiveness sincerely.

749
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,401
The evil deeds you did
as a military prosecutor…

750
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,237
the past won't disappear,

751
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,322
but the past

752
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,826
can also be the answer
to change the future.

753
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,834
Do you…

754
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,968
think you can forgive me if you were him?

755
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,021
Tell me,

756
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,941
Cha Woo-in. You tell me first.

757
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,660
I'm sure

758
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,496
you can do it, Prosecutor Doh.

759
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,583
Because you're the one I chose.

760
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,388
Please come to work on time tomorrow.

761
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,668
Everyone, to Minister Lee!

762
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,545
-Salute!
-Salute!

763
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,177
Minister.

764
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,095
Thank you for appointing me.

765
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,766
Chief Kim, the current Chief of Staff,
pisses me off way too much,

766
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,226
so I hurried.

767
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,519
I'll be loyal to you.

768
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,689
You still have to be evaluated
at the cabinet meeting,

769
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,652
so be careful and make sure
they don't find any faults.

770
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,445
Of course.

771
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,238
You know how Corps Commander Hong is!

772
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:06,201
He's such a genuine serviceperson
of Korea, that we even say that

773
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,953
his blood must be green.

774
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,956
He can pass
the cabinet meeting like nothing!

775
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,041
Of course.

776
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,962
Of course he can.
He's none other than Hong Moo-seob.

777
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:17,879
That's right.

778
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,802
Division Commander,
aren't you going to say anything?

779
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,554
You haven't looked
very happy since earlier.

780
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,516
Congratulations, Corps Commander.

781
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,520
Ki-choon's seat is so empty.

782
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,147
A vacancy of a person
cannot be filled anything else.

783
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:41,236
It feels like I lost an arm,
so you must feel worse, Hwa-young.

784
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,290
CEO Yong.

785
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,042
Have a seat.

786
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,298
Ki-choon's seat

787
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,634
has been filled immediately, Minister!

788
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:06,928
That's enough!

789
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,849
Now, let's eat.

790
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,116
Make sure to prepare the correct number
of boxes by rank.

791
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,701
No mistakes allowed.

792
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,663
Now, put them in correctly,
according to the number of stars.

793
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,708
Once we make a mistake,
we'll be dead. Dead.

794
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,960
But this one has no stars.

795
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,713
Minister Lee Jae-sik.

796
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,882
In case of Minister Lee Jae-sik…

797
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,926
count him as someone with five stars.

798
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,762
Wow, five stars?

799
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,730
By the way, how much does one box contain?

800
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,815
Why? Are you curious?

801
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,818
Well, I am curious, too.

802
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:08,114
One box should contain
at least $100,000, right?

803
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,576
Shall I just take it all and disappear?

804
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,165
That's right. I, Seol-ak, have scale.

805
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,835
Even when I do bad things,
I must not cross the line

806
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,961
so it doesn't go wrong.

807
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,966
What will those military people
in high places use this money for?

808
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,551
To protect the country?

809
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,929
They protect the country
with the taxes I pay.

810
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,847
Seolak Cheonji pays a lot of taxes.

811
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,141
I'm a diligent taxpayer.

812
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,184
Okay.

813
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,399
Do you know
what they'll use this money for?

814
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,567
Yes.

815
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,370
Those old military jerks

816
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,665
use this money to maintain their power.

817
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,546
Power is like a drug.

818
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,382
A drug that's even more
addictive than money.

819
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,926
Money and the world's attention

820
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,888
are what the corrupt servicepeople
thirst for most.

821
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,648
Since we're all here,

822
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,694
the defense industry project
Ki-choon tried to work on…

823
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,157
I think we have to start that
over from zero.

824
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,701
So I'm worried…

825
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,121
Have a safe trip back, Minister!

826
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,998
Goodbye, Minister.

827
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,625
-See you again.
-Yes, right.

828
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,628
-See you again, CEO Yong.
-Yes, sir.

829
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,425
-Salute.
-Salute.

830
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,223
Division Commander.

831
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,351
How about having tea with me?

832
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,520
You mean now?

833
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,398
Sure.

834
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,649
It's just you two, right?

835
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,443
I'll see you next time.

836
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:09,861
Sure.

837
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,822
You have a safe trip back, too.

838
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,869
Salute.

839
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,682
Thank you, Adjutant Yang.

840
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,310
You're always quiet

841
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,563
and hardworking. I like that.

842
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,703
Thanks to Ki-choon
taking all the blame and dying,

843
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,456
neither of us got in trouble right?

844
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,043
He lacked military spirit,

845
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,338
but he did something big in the end.

846
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,174
We should hope
that he rests in peace, at least.

847
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,677
That's not a very pleasant thing to hear.

848
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,012
Is that so?

849
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,689
Isn't it because
you're the one who took care of him?

850
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:36,406
That jerk repented and pulled
the trigger into his throat himself?

851
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:44,205
Are you trying to say that I was the one
who pulled that trigger?

852
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,749
It's not impossible for Noh Hwa-young.

853
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,334
Plus, this is not the first time.

854
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,171
Twenty years ago,

855
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:57,135
I only covered the case
by the order of Minister Lee Jae-sik,

856
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,886
but soon after,

857
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,931
an investigator couple
who worked for me died.

858
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:07,186
That jerk's name
was Doh Sung-hwan, I think.

859
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,316
You killed that couple
and saved his son yourself.

860
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,984
You remember that, right?

861
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,614
Noh Hwa-young is the master
of covering things up.

862
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,122
But weren't you the one…

863
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:31,794
who tied that up with a ribbon
and wrapped it up yourself?

864
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,758
-What?
-You're a respected superior.

865
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,761
You'll be even more respected
once you become the Chief of Staff.

866
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,304
So,

867
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,681
just keep doing what you've been doing

868
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,476
and do not reveal your true colors.

869
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,273
There's one thing I learned from you.

870
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,486
That it's better to be feared
by my subordinates

871
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,988
than to be respected,

872
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,198
like you.

873
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,660
You made everyone fear you.

874
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,787
That's why I hate you.

875
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,875
When I become the Chief of Staff,
you'll have to choose, too.

876
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,503
Whether to be my friend or to be my foe.

877
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,798
Of course, your choice
won't be the end of it.

878
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,675
Because I'll be the one to accept you

879
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,845
or reject you.

880
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,236
That jerk's name was…

881
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,406
Doh Sung-hwan, I think.

882
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,577
You killed that couple
and saved his son yourself.

883
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,995
You remember that, right?

884
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,001
What's the real reason for your return?

885
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,422
I realized

886
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,800
that the military
is the only place I should be.

887
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,939
Here's the personal record of Doh Bae-man.

888
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,691
OFFICER PERSONNEL RECORD
DOH BAE-MAN

889
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,234
I don't need it.

890
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:23,614
Because I now know
who Doh Bae-man really is.

891
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,977
You must guard your back, not your front.

892
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,187
Pardon?

893
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,564
Watch the picket commander on patrol.

894
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,735
I'll get some sleep
until the next team comes.

895
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:04,197
If I get caught sleeping here,
I'll go to the military prison.

896
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,323
This is the front line.

897
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,575
Yes, okay, sure.

898
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,621
Hey, you need to fix that way of speech.

899
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,165
The guys here are desperate
to punish you for that.

900
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,083
Yes, sir.

901
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,243
Is this your first time
touching a grenade?

902
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,662
You must have been trained
to throw it at boot camp.

903
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,541
I said I didn't want to throw it,
and I was exempt.

904
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,710
Then it's your first time
touching it, right?

905
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,088
Everyone does that at first, like you.

906
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:03,965
No.

907
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,760
I'm sure that no one
has touched the grenade…

908
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,971
more than I did.

909
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,378
What's

910
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,339
wrong with this place?

911
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,801
Am I the only one who feels this way?

912
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,931
Did people say
the military is like prison?

913
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:36,766
No.

914
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,352
This is a living hell.

915
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:59,413
Sir, you have a guest in your office now.

916
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,874
At this hour? Who is it?

917
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:34,073
I didn't expect to reveal
your true identity yourself.

918
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,324
I'm surprised.

919
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,205
Did you show up
because your father's company

920
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,999
is going to disappear?

921
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,252
I wasn't planning on hiding it
until the end, anyway.

922
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,892
I was going to show myself
at the time I set.

923
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,083
Please reveal everything
Staff Sergeant Shin is suffering

924
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,334
because of Hong Moo-seob.

925
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,254
And beg for forgiveness sincerely.

926
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,508
The evil deeds you did
as a military prosecutor…

927
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,178
the past won't disappear,

928
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,679
but the past

929
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:42,308
can also be the answer
to change the future.

930
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,335
The one with the least military spirit
was the son of servicepeople.

931
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,967
Doh Bae-man.

932
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,681
You were that boy, weren't you?

933
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,643
The boy I saved.

934
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,650
Give me a chance to fix the wrongdoings
I have done, Staff Sergeant Shin.

935
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:15,818
I'm a sinner, too.

936
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,237
How dare you tarnish my reputation?

937
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,030
How about we form
a special investigation team

938
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,450
with the military prosecutors
of our division and work on it?

939
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,662
Is it because your mom is
the Division Commander? Right?

940
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,664
I will do it more viciously
than anyone else.

941
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,791
Even more viciously than revenge.

942
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,418
I will show it to my victims.

943
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,088
It was an excellent decision for me
to choose you.

944
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,758
I wonder how I'll feel
if I crush you in this court.

945
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:49,268
