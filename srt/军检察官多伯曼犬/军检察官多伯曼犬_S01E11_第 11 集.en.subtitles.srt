1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,234
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,485
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,611
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,779
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,947
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,618
20 YEARS AGO

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,049
How dare you disobey me, you jerk?

8
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,178
I did not disobey you.

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,722
I carried out your order perfectly.

10
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,017
I told you to find ways to make
that investigator couple understand!

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,144
I didn't tell you to kill them, you jerk!

12
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,565
Cutting off any potential problems
at the root is the way I found.

13
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,859
That's the only way
to prevent further trouble.

14
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,819
Are you nuts? You idiot!

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,073
Colonel, you must now

16
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,866
be on my side

17
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,578
until the end,
as long as I remain in the military.

18
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,381
Lee Jae-sik,

19
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,427
I know you'll cut me off
at the root for this one day.

20
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,305
But I'll never let you have your way.

21
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,557
I will become a monster,

22
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,394
step on the men, and go to the very top.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,902
PRESENT

24
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,871
The one with the least military spirit
was the son of servicepeople.

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,504
Doh Bae-man.

26
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,341
You were that boy, weren't you?

27
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,928
The boy I saved.

28
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,109
Noh Hwa-young.

29
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,113
-You…
-You killed my parents.

30
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,991
That was an accident.

31
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,576
It was tragic and heartbreaking,

32
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,162
but it was a car accident
that happened by coincidence.

33
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,206
I had absolutely no reason
to kill your parents.

34
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,500
No. There's evidence.

35
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,420
There's evidence?

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
The evidence…

37
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,508
is you, Noh Hwa-young.

38
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,766
I now clearly remember
how you checked if my parents

39
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,768
were dead or alive
with this hand of yours.

40
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,693
I've been waiting for this moment.

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,491
Mutiny will be punished immediately.

42
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,415
Yes, that's right, Division Commander.

43
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,002
Does that mean you knew already?

44
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,130
Why didn't you show it until now?

45
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,132
A long time has passed since then.

46
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,054
I lost my memories for a long time
after the accident.

47
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,724
Thank you so much

48
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,393
for saving me then, Division Commander.

49
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,410
You're fearless and reckless,

50
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,162
just like your father.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,916
My father's IM will never disappear.

52
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,838
Yong Moon-goo.

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,385
You came into this office
after changing your face three times.

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,222
As a prosecutor who framed my father,

55
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,267
as a lawyer who was like
Noh Tae-nam's servant,

56
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,935
and now,

57
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,604
as a puppet CEO, who's nothing
but Noh Hwa-young's shell.

58
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,233
You've always been wearing masks.

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,444
Masks…

60
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,114
Speaking of which,

61
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,494
let's talk about the mask you're wearing,
Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

62
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,546
I know it'll be hard
to take it off yourself,

63
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,882
so I'll take your mask off for you.

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,304
It'll be published tomorrow morning,

65
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,723
but it would be better
to know beforehand, right?

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,058
Because you took time to come here.

67
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,189
"It's been revealed a current military
prosecutor is practicing vigilantism."

68
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,234
"A military prosecutor,
who must protect the law,

69
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,030
committed illegal kidnapping,
lockups, and assault,

70
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,532
resulting in a social uproar,

71
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,577
and serious punishment is expected."

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,805
-Sir?
-Yes.

73
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:01,986
Mr. Yong?

74
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,161
I came straight from the airport.

75
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,456
My business trip went on
longer than expected,

76
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,541
so I missed your inauguration. I'm sorry.

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,460
I skipped the inauguration.

78
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,505
You've been working so hard
from the outside.

79
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,298
The company was a mess,

80
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,551
but it's now back to normal,
thanks to you.

81
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,722
You've been here while the CEO has been

82
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,102
changed three times.
You're the one who's truly stable in IM.

83
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,853
Isn't that right?

84
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,064
You're flattering me.

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,860
Are you going to get started

86
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,612
with your plan now?

87
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,448
Get started?

88
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,243
I already got started six years ago,

89
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,122
when I came into this office
with General Noh Hwa-young

90
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,289
for the first time.

91
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:05,007
Because the claws that have been hidden
for a long time are always stronger.

92
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,306
Did you sober up?

93
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,016
Yes.

94
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,606
I was pretty drunk, wasn't I?

95
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,906
I found this at my residence.

96
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,784
I've been looking for this. Was it there?

97
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,662
It must be something precious.

98
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,458
My father gave it to me when I was six.

99
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,835
It symbolizes IM.

100
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,591
It's no ordinary necklace, then.

101
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,052
Did you go somewhere?

102
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,601
I went to my father's company
for the first time in six years.

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,068
Thank you.

104
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,059
CEO YONG MOON-GOO

105
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,620
Dad, you're the best!

106
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,999
Yes. Now, if you do this…

107
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,085
It's Woo-in, right?

108
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,642
Then, did you tell Yong Moon-goo

109
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,310
who you are?

110
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,396
He already knew everything,

111
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,730
just as I expected.

112
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,024
I knew it.

113
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,109
And

114
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,780
he threatened to reveal what I did
as the red-haired alter ego to the world.

115
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,240
What?

116
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,993
So I returned the favor.

117
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,787
If you're going to point a gun at me,

118
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,163
I have no choice.

119
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,624
I should shoot you, too.

120
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,422
Everything you had done
until you entered this office.

121
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,925
You provoked Se-na
into releasing Noh Tae-nam's video,

122
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,388
waited until IM was shaken
by Noh Tae-nam's owner risk,

123
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,183
and used strategic force to make
the stock prices drop even more.

124
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,520
And you made Noh Tae-nam
run away to the military,

125
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,983
and took over this position as the CEO.

126
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,240
You're overspeculating,
Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

127
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,619
Am I?

128
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,455
I've been collecting quite the evidence.

129
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,832
But you know,

130
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,085
I'm not planning on
releasing this to the media.

131
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,964
Because I only need
to send it to one person.

132
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,888
To Noh Hwa-young.

133
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,104
Do you think General Noh will believe you?

134
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,481
It doesn't matter.

135
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,733
All I need to do is to let her know.

136
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,779
Then Noh Hwa-young will look into it,
and once she finds out the truth,

137
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,239
you'll be doomed.

138
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,659
Well?

139
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,285
Are you confident about this?

140
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,379
So you're here to silence me.

141
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,381
Right.

142
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,343
You really are Cha Ho-chul's daughter.

143
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,846
You went there to threaten Yong Moon-goo?

144
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,474
A military prosecutor
must not threaten anyone,

145
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,476
though they may have a weapon.

146
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,229
Let's say it's a risky truce for strategy.

147
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,565
Wow, this is some crazy coincidence.

148
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,569
Before you came, Noh Hwa-young also came
to the office to see me.

149
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,489
That means

150
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,158
Noh Hwa-young knows all about us, too.

151
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,288
I wanted to shut
Noh Hwa-young's hypocritical mouth

152
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,040
talking about my parents,

153
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,336
but I wanted to tell you something first.

154
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,843
You told me
to get Staff Sergeant Shin to forgive me.

155
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,472
I will do it more viciously
than anyone else.

156
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,100
Even more viciously than revenge.

157
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,727
I will show it to my victims.

158
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,898
Until I erase everything I've done

159
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,110
over the past five years.

160
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,452
I didn't know you'd make such a decision.

161
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,206
Now I'm certain
that it was an excellent decision for me

162
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,916
to choose you.

163
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
Do you think I'll do a good job?

164
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
CHIEF YEOM SANG-JIN

165
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,098
PROSECUTOR CHA, I FOUND SOMETHING

166
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,855
A GRENADE EXPLOSION AT A BOOT CAMP

167
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,442
Twenty years ago, there was
a grenade drill at a boot camp

168
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,694
where there was
a casualty from an accident.

169
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,656
Your father judged
that it wasn't the trainee's fault.

170
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,242
This cannot be the trainee's fault.

171
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,495
When a grenade explodes,

172
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,580
about 1,000 pieces of metal shards fly.

173
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,833
And about 300 pieces were found
on the deceased assistant instructor.

174
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,129
If it was a simple mistake by the trainee,
then the angle makes no sense.

175
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,507
Plus, I secured a testimony.

176
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,217
-Testimony?
-Yes.

177
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,304
The witness saw the grenade exploding
before the trainee threw it.

178
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,224
It means there was
a serious defect in the grenade.

179
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,144
But Defense Agency's quality report
says that there were no defects.

180
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,104
I investigated that report, too.

181
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,316
No test took place at that test date.

182
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,985
That report is a fabricated document.

183
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,155
You disobeyed my investigation rules

184
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,407
and went around
to investigate on your own?

185
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,080
I will accept punishment for that.

186
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,124
But if we don't reveal the problem
with the defective grenades,

187
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,710
innocent soldiers will keep dying!

188
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,753
Give me the document.

189
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,714
We must investigate the one
that produced defective grenades!

190
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,925
Give me the document, you bastard!

191
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:08,847
How dare you disobey your superior's
investigation order? You bastard!

192
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,307
You bastard.

193
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,436
Do you think ripping up the document…

194
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,983
will make the truth disappear?

195
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109
The truth?

196
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,777
Hey!

197
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,864
Stop acting up!

198
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,991
This is the last warning!

199
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,245
I didn't know about the defective
grenade accident at that time.

200
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,248
I found out
after I met the retired military police

201
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,042
whom Won Ki-choon wrote about
in his army notebook.

202
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm sure your father
took care of it himself

203
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,467
because he thought
it'd be dangerous to drag me in.

204
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,891
What was the conclusion of the case?

205
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,477
Just as Hong Moo-seob fabricated it.

206
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,397
As a trainee's mistake.

207
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,192
And the defense industry company
that produced defective grenades

208
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,319
wasn't investigated.

209
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,323
But your father didn't stop.

210
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,285
The grenade accidents kept happening,
and more soldiers died.

211
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,621
So your father planned
to expose the grenade issue

212
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,414
externally, outside of the military.

213
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,668
And the person who was going to help him
was CEO Cha Ho-chul,

214
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,088
Prosecutor Cha's father.

215
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,717
That's why there was a picture
he took with my father.

216
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,555
And that's why CEO Cha called
right before the accident.

217
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,265
Yes.

218
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,936
Then, what about Noh Hwa-young?

219
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,524
There was a reason Noh Hwa-young

220
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,235
and Hong Moo-seob met a lot,
just as it was recorded

221
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,195
in Won's notebook.

222
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:51,408
There's one more person who was
involved with the defective grenades.

223
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,243
That's…

224
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,205
Colonel Lee Jae-sik.

225
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,831
At that time, Lee Jae-sik was

226
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,543
a military supply staff who dealt
with defense industry companies.

227
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,922
In short, Lee Jae-sik
must've ordered Hong Moo-seob

228
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,633
to cover up the defective grenade issue.

229
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,971
And ordered Noh Hwa-young to take care

230
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,139
of Prosecutor Doh's parents.

231
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,391
HONG MOO-SEOB

232
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,519
LEE JAE-SIK

233
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,856
I knew it.

234
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,858
The food chain of the military

235
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,695
keeps going up
and ends with Lee Jae-sik on top.

236
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,956
Is Hwa-young going to be late?

237
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,457
Please have a seat first, sir.

238
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,500
Okay.

239
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,173
-Here.
-Okay.

240
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,511
Looks like Hwa-young isn't coming, right?

241
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,057
I didn't tell you she was coming,

242
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,434
but you still came.

243
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,104
You've become even more confident
after becoming the CEO.

244
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,773
You even ditch your superior now.

245
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,109
Is it because you're not a serviceperson?

246
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,196
I heard that the Ministry
of National Defense is trying

247
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,449
to select a company
to introduce new weapons.

248
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,577
The late Won Ki-choon
was going to build the bridge in between.

249
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,704
They say there are no drinks
without reason.

250
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,332
For the sake of my political life,

251
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,210
I'm planning on not giving
all orders to IM for a while.

252
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,132
But you and IM are inseparable.

253
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,967
And I'm sure you already know.

254
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,389
So I secretly came up with a plan.

255
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,228
Division Commander Noh Hwa-young
doesn't know about this project.

256
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,940
But I'm sure it was Hwa-young

257
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,734
who put you in that position.

258
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,029
How can I trust you if you do this?

259
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,908
How much do you trust
Division Commander Noh?

260
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,457
From now on,
I'll support your political war

261
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,459
with everything I have.

262
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,711
I'm not a serviceperson,

263
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,755
but I know whom I should be loyal to.

264
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,715
That's how I made it this far.

265
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,392
Now I see
why Hwa-young kept you by her side.

266
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:32,027
You might do better in politics than me.

267
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,333
Sergeant Shin Joo-yong!
I will be loyal to you!

268
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,047
You went through a lot
during your year and a half of service.

269
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,300
The military teaches you about war,

270
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,219
but the society you're returning to

271
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,513
is where actual war takes place.

272
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,975
I hope you never lose
in that war for protecting

273
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,102
your precious families.

274
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,478
Dismissed.

275
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,564
Salute to the Division Commander!

276
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,982
-Salute!
-Salute!

277
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,985
At ease!

278
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,403
Right face!

279
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,704
How's Tae-nam doing?

280
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,164
I'll go check right now.

281
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,456
No need to do that.

282
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,834
Because no news is good news.

283
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,385
Hey, take them.

284
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,306
-This is mine!
-Wow, awesome!

285
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,351
-Sergeant Ma is here!
-Hey!

286
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,769
-Sergeant Ma is here.
-Move.

287
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,938
Wow.

288
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,149
Hey, what's this?

289
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,278
These are just free gifts.

290
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,118
-Wow.
-Wow.

291
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,955
I'm scared it might get scratched
if I wear it here.

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,459
Hey, it won't get scratched.
You don't have to be so cautious.

293
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,627
Really?

294
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,178
Pika, pika.

295
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,056
Don't you know what "Pika, pika" is?

296
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,350
I don't.

297
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,018
Gosh, you little bastard.

298
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,811
Hey, focus!

299
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,193
-What is it?
-What is this?

300
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,449
You're a Pikachu!

301
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,909
Pika, pika!

302
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,078
-Didn't he wet his pants?
-Maybe.

303
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,330
Noh Tae-nam, from now on, you're Nohkachu.

304
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,790
-Nohkachu.
-Nohkachu.

305
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,167
Say it! Do a report repeat as Nohkachu!

306
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,669
Do it while flapping, stat!

307
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,296
-Stat!
-Stat!

308
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,506
You should do it.

309
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,759
So you're going to disobey me?
Sure, he doesn't want to do it, so…

310
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,345
-Pyeon.
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

311
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,346
What are you doing?

312
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,390
He refused.
As his superior, demonstrate it.

313
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,185
Private First Class Pyeonkachu!
I will prepare my Thunderbolt!

314
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,106
Pi… ka… chu!

315
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,399
Reflect!

316
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,447
You should shake harder, you bastard!

317
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,991
Harder!

318
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,745
Stop it, please.

319
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,871
You bastard!

320
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,793
Is it because your mom
is the Division Commander?

321
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,877
What does…

322
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,839
What does my mother have to do with this?

323
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,216
I know, right?
What does she have to do with this?

324
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,843
I can totally see it.

325
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,054
Why did the Division Commander
put her son here?

326
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,224
So you won't cause any trouble
and cause damage to her.

327
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,810
Which means you must obey
all of my orders.

328
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,651
-Pyeon.
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

329
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,611
Can't you discipline the newbie right?

330
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,989
-Put on a helmet.
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

331
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,907
I will put on my bulletproof helmet!

332
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,367
I told you, didn't I?

333
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,787
The predecessor is responsible
for the new soldier's faults.

334
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,127
-Is your head
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

335
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,670
-just
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

336
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,005
-walnut or something?
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

337
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,424
-Want me to crack
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

338
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,301
-open your head?
-Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

339
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:28,346
Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!

340
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,183
Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho!
Private First Class…

341
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,559
-Want me to crack you open?
-Wait.

342
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,061
Let go!

343
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,396
I have something more to give you.

344
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,190
-What is it?
-Follow me.

345
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,942
-It better be something good.
-Come outside.

346
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,990
Go back to what you were doing.

347
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,610
I'm sorry. Because of me…

348
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,986
Well done.

349
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,159
If you cave in once,
you have to keep doing it, like me.

350
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,120
You did a great job.

351
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,331
Is your head okay?

352
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,626
They don't hit me
because they want to hit me,

353
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,586
but because they can hit me.

354
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
Dumplings, your favorite.

355
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,596
Hardtacks.

356
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,223
Eat them quickly. Hurry up.

357
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll kill you if you don't finish it!

358
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,685
You eat so well!

359
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,872
Are you sleepy?

360
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,541
Are you going to sleep when I'm on duty?

361
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,001
I'm sleepy, too.

362
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,671
Wait here.

363
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,840
I'll be back when the duty is over.

364
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,928
Doesn't this one look more delicious?

365
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,638
This one. You can eat this one.

366
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,182
It's like Buy One, Get One Free.

367
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,017
That was close.

368
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,394
If the back of your head
touches the pillow,

369
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,188
you won't be able to sleep tonight.

370
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,030
You can't move until you win.

371
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,658
Start!

372
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,713
Hey, look at your face!
Aren't you having fun?

373
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,881
Have fun!

374
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,716
It's a game!

375
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,262
I miss my mom.

376
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,644
I miss my mom's cooking.

377
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,084
Hang in there a bit.

378
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,044
Sergeant Ma will be discharged soon.

379
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,172
Once I become a sergeant,
I'll fix everything.

380
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,843
I have a favor.

381
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,388
Can I make a call, please?

382
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,932
Hey, you should've told me.

383
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,520
Here.

384
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,107
Thank you, Sergeant Ahn.

385
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,954
Make Noh Tae-nam your dog.

386
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,584
Mr.. Yong, it's me.

387
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,379
-Mr. Noh?
-I can't talk for long.

388
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,968
Send me a parcel.

389
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,053
Fill it with all kinds
of expensive things.

390
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,722
What?

391
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,974
My mother blocked
all of my sources of money.

392
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,559
Credit cards and everything.

393
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,353
I see. I'll take care of it right away.

394
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,230
Is there anything else you need?

395
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,525
Are you well and healthy?

396
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,863
About my mom, no…

397
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,699
By any chance, did my mother…

398
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,534
What about General Noh?

399
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,163
Why can't you understand me?

400
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:07,000
Why isn't my mother coming here?

401
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,502
If she visits there, that base will be

402
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,588
in extreme emergency mode
from a week before.

403
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,799
Not only that base, but also
the company and the battalion.

404
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,969
Gosh, forget it. Just send me
the parcel as soon as possible.

405
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,141
That's so mean.

406
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,564
Everyone, gather around.

407
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,863
From now on, we will investigate

408
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,075
the power trip case
of Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob.

409
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,369
Corps Commander Hong?

410
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,496
Yes, he has three stars…

411
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,873
No, he'll have four stars soon.

412
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,209
Gosh. You two…

413
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,837
Just how far are you going to go?

414
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,007
You two are actually really scary.

415
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,596
Look at those smiles.
Thanks to you two prosecutors,

416
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,141
my military life is
just so thrilling and spectacular.

417
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,729
But the Corps Commander's case won't
be assigned to our office of justice.

418
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,772
Right.

419
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,024
It'll be to the office
of justice of the corps.

420
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,777
We experienced it
during the Kim Han-yong case.

421
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,823
Kim Han-yong went to the office
of justice of the corps and got ignored.

422
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,366
Right.

423
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,952
So why don’t we work on some other case?

424
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,371
-Hey, Yoon Sang-ki.
-Damn it.

425
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,331
Don't you know how I am?

426
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,792
I'm a Doberman.

427
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,835
A hound dog.

428
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,547
You know I never take
the easy path, right?

429
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,757
I know.

430
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,593
That's why I'm going
through all this right now.

431
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,598
So, with what and how are you

432
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,892
going to make a path?

433
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,687
Stop whining, will you?

434
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,604
Follow me.

435
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,568
-What was that?
-You're really good.

436
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,819
I'm doomed.

437
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,070
Gosh.

438
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,658
We're making great hits!

439
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,744
Nice!

440
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,122
The questions on the hero of mines

441
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,999
must be answered, too, Your Honor.

442
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,043
-Yes!
-Come on!

443
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,795
Can't you do it right?

444
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,381
I knew Kim Han-yong
would cause trouble someday.

445
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,883
-Hit the ball!
-One more time!

446
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,260
We'll destroy the law officers
of the corps.

447
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,846
We must make sure
the law officers of the corps

448
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,514
can't pardon Corps Commander Hong.

449
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,183
And we must take over

450
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,561
and reveal the corruption
by the law officers of the corps, too.

451
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,687
And

452
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,855
I swear I will

453
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,107
persuade Staff Sergeant Shin.

454
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:45,658
Gosh, I got him good last time,
but he plays golf during duty.

455
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,244
You let him off, so he got worse.

456
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,373
Now he only goes to civilian golf courses
and avoids military ones.

457
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,875
All right,

458
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,754
let's destroy the corrupt
law officers of the corps first.

459
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,813
Ready, Reporter Ahn?

460
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,690
One, two, three.

461
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,092
-Oh, my. Look what you're doing!
-I'm sorry.

462
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,302
Do you know how much this golf club costs?

463
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,805
-I'm sorry!
-Even if you save all of your monthly pay

464
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,432
for a year and a half,
you can't buy this! Gosh!

465
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,727
Then the corps should do something

466
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,188
to raise the soldiers' pay!

467
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,275
Who are you people?

468
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,027
They sacrifice two years

469
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,905
of their best years…

470
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,200
If it's worth less than a single
golf club, it's too cruel, isn't it?

471
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,243
Who are you people?

472
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,370
-Excuse us.
-What the heck? Who are you?

473
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,830
You can't take pictures of us.

474
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,332
You're not a caddie, are you?

475
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,294
You're a serviceperson
currently serving, right?

476
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,173
-It's okay.
-It's just as we expected,

477
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,925
-Reporter Yoon!
-Reporter?

478
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,596
Look here, the law officers of the corps!

479
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,723
-Attention!
-Attention!

480
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,016
Damn!

481
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,311
Don't you have a trial
to attend right now?

482
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:40,023
Wow, you make soldiers
carry your golf clubs

483
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,399
and pick up golf balls!

484
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,651
And you were about to do this

485
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,029
with a golf club!

486
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,615
How could public officers do this?

487
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,491
-The camera!
-Turn off the camera!

488
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,872
Is it true that you all played golf
during duty at a civilian golf course?

489
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,624
You made soldiers be your caddies

490
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,792
and even tried to assault them.
Is it true?

491
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,713
On that day, you were absent from
your trial due to personal reasons.

492
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,715
-What happened?
-That's not true!

493
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,800
-Please say something!
-Turn off the cameras!

494
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,554
It has been revealed that
the law officers of IV Corps

495
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,682
played golf at a civilian golf
course during duty,

496
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,185
and now there's a suspicion
regarding neglect of duty.

497
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,438
Furthermore, they made soldiers
assist them as their caddies,

498
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,065
and got paid illegally…

499
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,905
So this is how great it feels
to catch bad guys.

500
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,782
It's better than taking a good poop.

501
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,325
-Me, too.
-It's refreshing.

502
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:36,037
This must be why the two prosecutors
are working as a pair.

503
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,163
What?

504
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,504
No, come on. No, Sang-ki.

505
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,049
What? What's wrong with you?

506
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,885
Do you like it that much?

507
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,845
You might become a military prosecutor.

508
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,931
Come on, Subsection Chief Ahn.

509
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,975
Didn't you feel anything?

510
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,561
I like it, too, but not as much as you do.

511
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,980
No.

512
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,106
Not that.

513
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,526
Remember how the two prosecutors
were that day?

514
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,821
I'm a Doberman. A hound dog.

515
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,490
Woof, woof! A hound dog.

516
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,368
The gaze of those two at that time.

517
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,828
That was clearly a fling.

518
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,621
Or is it love already?

519
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,628
Speaking of which, that was the first time
I saw Prosecutor Cha smiling like that.

520
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,300
When do you think it started for them?

521
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,595
Don't cry.

522
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,223
Subsection Chief Ahn.

523
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:41,310
One-sided love is complete
only when it's broken.

524
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,353
I, too,

525
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,358
am enduring that pain, okay?

526
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,443
What?

527
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,159
You like Prosecutor Cha?

528
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,745
No, stop.
Let's not talk about that anymore.

529
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,830
Oh, this is painful.

530
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,540
Let's do a high-five one more time.

531
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,958
I don't feel like it.

532
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,793
-No?
-Prosecutor!

533
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,587
So you don't.

534
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,926
It feels quite empty.

535
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,812
SUSPICION OF HABITUAL NEGLECT OF DUTY
BY THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CORPS

536
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,231
What do you think?

537
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,818
I did it for you. I destroyed
the law officers of the corps for you.

538
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,822
If what you went though
is taken to the corps,

539
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,407
they'll get covered up again,

540
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,700
so I'll do it myself.

541
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,536
Get lost, please.

542
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,751
Staff Sergeant Shin!

543
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,504
Staff Sergeant Shin!

544
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:54,092
Give me a chance to fix the wrongdoings
I have done, Staff Sergeant Shin.

545
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,011
I used to only care about money.

546
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,850
And I used my power

547
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,728
to make money.

548
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,481
I'm a sinner, too.

549
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,986
I beg for your forgiveness.

550
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,781
Please forgive me.

551
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,620
I'll make sure what happened to you and
your fellow soldier won't happen again.

552
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,831
Do you think…

553
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,085
my fellow soldier will come back
to life if you do that?

554
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,463
Why did you change, all of a sudden?

555
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,550
Just what ulterior motives do you have?

556
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,469
I will show you.

557
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,388
I swear I will

558
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,432
show you my sincerity.

559
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,525
MADAM HONG

560
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:01,367
What was the delay? I told you to answer
within five seconds when the bell rings!

561
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,578
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll be back soon.

562
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,122
Staff Sergeant Shin!

563
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,504
If you don't trust me, go here instead.

564
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,550
PROTECTORS OF MILITARY HUMAN RIGHTS

565
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,456
I will show you.

566
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,499
I swear I will

567
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,293
show you my sincerity.

568
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,730
INCOMING CALL
GENERAL

569
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,034
YOUR TIME IS LIMITED, SO DON'T WASTE IT

570
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:07,994
LIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE - STEVE JOBS

571
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
TO. SHIN MIN-CHUL, MY FELLOW SOLDIER

572
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,309
Where are you going? You should cook.

573
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,061
Why did you pack up?

574
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,565
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

575
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,567
Hey!

576
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,360
Let me go!

577
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,361
Are you nuts?

578
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,156
If you leave now, it's AWOL!

579
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,160
I'll use my authority
to send you to military prison.

580
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,456
AWOL? Authority?

581
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,459
Who do you think you are?
Civilian Ms. Hong Kyung-ok,

582
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,795
you do not have such authority.

583
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,214
You bastard!

584
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,425
Let go!

585
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,094
Have you finally gone mad?

586
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,599
No.

587
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,144
I can't leave crucial evidence here.

588
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,772
What? What did you say?

589
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,611
I'll be the last soldier to be treated

590
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,404
like a slave by you.

591
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,495
Protectors of Military
Human Rights announced

592
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,207
that they were informed of power tripping
by Corps Commander Hong and his family.

593
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,335
The tip-off is about Staff Sergeant Shin
being treated like a slave

594
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,546
by Corps Commander Hong's family
while working at…

595
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,674
Those in high places
are worse with power trips.

596
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,677
Answer me.

597
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,804
Yes, sir.

598
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,681
They criticized the military

599
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,018
for delaying their announcement
saying they're checking the facts.

600
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,312
Furthermore, aside
from this investigation,

601
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,064
they demanded overall investigation

602
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,775
on the treatment of manpower
in operating the residences.

603
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,695
Moo-seob, I didn't do any more than that!

604
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,698
Since it's a controversy regrading
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob,

605
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,826
who has received respect
for his leadership,

606
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,495
they expressed concern
about this controversy,

607
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,331
saying that the facts
must be investigated thoroughly.

608
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,377
If this controversy is revealed
to be true, he will not be able to…

609
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,840
-He's coming!
-He's coming!

610
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,135
Is the cabinet evaluation for the Chief
of Staff taking place as scheduled?

611
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,304
Which bureau is going to be investigating
the power tripping case?

612
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,516
People say you're responsible
for the golf controversy as well.

613
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,934
Do you feel responsible?

614
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,987
-Minister!
-Minister!

615
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,906
Minister Lee Jae-sik is
totally pissed off.

616
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,576
I'm sure the Patriotic Society
members are gathering up

617
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,994
at Hong Moo-seob's residence.

618
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,415
But I doubt they'll be able
to come up with anything good.

619
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,543
We destroyed
all of the law officers of the corps,

620
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,546
but there's no guarantee
the Hong Moo-seob case will come to us..

621
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,257
What does your hunch say?

622
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,762
I'm using my experience
more than my hunch this time.

623
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,683
You're not getting hunches?
Did you lose your hunches?

624
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,435
Want to go for a walk?

625
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,770
So we can find hunches?

626
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,482
Gosh.

627
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,738
Minister, I'm sorry for troubling you.

628
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,032
How dare you tarnish my reputation?

629
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,159
You, with the highest military spirit?

630
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,661
It looks like they couldn't
find fault with me

631
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,414
with my appointment
as the Chief of Staff coming up.

632
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,126
They even dug up having a staff sergeant
of the residence run few errands.

633
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,628
Of course.

634
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,173
Minister, have some tea
and take your time…

635
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,017
Minister, my nephew is serving
at the battlefront, too.

636
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,936
I think there was a misunderstanding

637
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,230
while we treated
Staff Sergeant Shin like family.

638
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,149
But we didn't do anything wrong.

639
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,403
Speaking of which, Minister,

640
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,239
the military is a mess these days.

641
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,992
The parents call the bases, asking them
not to give their kids hard jobs.

642
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,662
And they say everything's
assault and power tripping.

643
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,789
They think the military is like school.

644
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,332
The world has gone crazy.

645
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,417
Shut up, you bastard!

646
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,254
Hwa-young, what do you think?

647
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,757
I think it largely depends
on the main force of the investigation.

648
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,552
The law office of the corps
lost the public's trust

649
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,096
due to the golf case.

650
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,890
If the corps investigates it itself,

651
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,767
it will backfire.

652
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,230
But we can't leave it to
the military prosecution or the Army HQ.

653
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,524
If it's taken to the military prosecution
or the Army HQ,

654
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,276
then the Chief of Staff of the Army,

655
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,904
who's hostile toward Minister
Lee Jae-sik, will use his influence.

656
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,657
Because he may have to leave
before his term is over.

657
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,785
I'm sure he'll completely
destroy Hong Moo-seob.

658
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,955
Then there's only option available

659
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,498
for Minister Lee Jae-sik.

660
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,750
How about we form
a special investigation team

661
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,919
with the military prosecutors
of our division

662
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:09,837
and work on it?

663
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,548
With your kids?

664
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,216
Doh Bae-man and Cha Woo-in.

665
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,928
Well, they do have good reputation
among the public.

666
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,055
But Division Commander,

667
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,766
can you control those prosecutors?

668
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,643
Do I need to control them?

669
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,940
If a few errands were all,
like the Corps Commander said, then…

670
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,654
I'm asking you one last time.

671
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,824
-Are you sure nothing's wrong?
-I'm sure.

672
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,161
Alright. Do what
Division Commander Noh said.

673
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,956
It's still a trial,
so we need to be ready.

674
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,585
I will have my people
be both the spear and the shield.

675
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,964
If the military prosecutors are
the spears, then who's the shield?

676
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,258
CEO Yong Moon-goo
is the perfect one for the job.

677
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,345
CEO Yong?

678
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,433
That's a clever plan.

679
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,478
He said that he won't
be at the court again,

680
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,064
but he will do it if I tell him to.

681
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,401
Yes, Division Commander.

682
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,904
You can do anything for your superior.

683
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,199
Thank you.

684
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,370
It's all good, but make sure
it does not show.

685
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,878
It's about time.

686
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,506
CHIEF MILITARY PROSECUTOR
SEO JOO-HYUK

687
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,010
You didn't lose your hunch.

688
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,804
We should go back.

689
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,765
What a shame. I was enjoying a walk.

690
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,101
Go ahead and answer it.

691
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,649
Doh Bae-man, return
to the office of justice, now!

692
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,111
This is the biggest emergency ever!

693
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,364
Find Cha Woo-in and bring her!
Return to the office, now!

694
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,991
Yes, sir. Salute!

695
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,746
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

696
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,917
Ministry of National Defense

697
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,420
formed a special investigation team

698
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,464
to strictly investigate controversies

699
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,342
surrounding Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob

700
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,219
so we can lift your suspicions.

701
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:26,473
The special investigation
will be carried out

702
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,852
by Prosecutor Doh Bae-man,
Prosecutor Cha Woo-in,

703
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,522
and Staff Judge Advocate
Seo Joo-hyuk of the 4th Division.

704
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,649
The Minister

705
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,568
mentioned my name.

706
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,116
This calls for a celebration!

707
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,410
It's an honor to my family!

708
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,207
-Salute.
-It's a risk to my family!

709
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,917
It's like a national disaster!

710
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,759
The Minister of National Defense
made a public announcement,

711
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,678
and are you going to reject it?

712
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,056
This is so…

713
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,350
From the Division Commander's son

714
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,187
to Search Battalion Commander
and the Corps Commander.

715
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,899
Can all of this be pure coincidence?

716
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,109
Why does
the Republic of Korea Armed Forces

717
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,112
give such ordeals to me? Why?

718
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,741
What's going to happen
to my future military life?

719
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,538
By the way, why isn't Doh Bae-man coming?

720
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,041
He's getting materials from
the Protectors of Military Human Rights

721
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,669
and going to bring someone valuable
to join our special investigation team.

722
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:42,424
What? He's bringing someone
without my permission?

723
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,801
Who said he could? Who?

724
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,014
-Salute.
-Salute.

725
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,725
Gosh, what took you so long?

726
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,604
I'm Detective Doh Soo-kyung.

727
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,441
We couldn't recognize each other
at the press conference,

728
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,692
so let's make it even.

729
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,361
Okay.

730
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,530
What brings you here,
Doh Bae-man's aunt, no--

731
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,198
Detective Doh.

732
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,449
I'm thinking of making it

733
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,452
a joint investigation of
the military prosecution and the police.

734
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,956
It'll be hard to punish the sister
without cooperation from us the police.

735
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,541
She's a civilian,

736
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,417
so she can get away quite easily.

737
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:22,005
Yes, the military court cannot deal
with civilians that easily.

738
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,843
Bae-man told me
that you're the manliest man of all.

739
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,887
So let's do this job with passion!

740
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,765
Yes, I'm the manliest man of all!

741
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,729
Power tripping shouldn't happen

742
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,523
in this day and age!

743
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,026
Don't you think?

744
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,405
It shouldn't happen.

745
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,285
That hurts.

746
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,078
Yes, right.

747
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,128
There isn't any other place to stay,

748
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,130
so stay here until the trial is over.

749
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,968
Don't worry. I won't be here.

750
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,636
You can stay here.

751
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,680
Then what about you?

752
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,848
What?

753
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,183
Are you worried about me?

754
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,563
I didn't make my decision because of you.

755
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,732
So don't get any wrong ideas.

756
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,527
Sure, well… whatever it is,

757
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,404
thank you for making your decision.

758
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,031
Come in.

759
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,011
What?

760
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,639
What brings you here at this hour?

761
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,016
I told Staff Sergeant Shin
to stay at my residence.

762
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,101
Reporters are coming, too,

763
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,479
and he needs rest
more than anything else, so…

764
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,023
He's been suffering from
power trips all this time.

765
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,233
Then are you going to stay here?

766
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,652
Yes, I should.

767
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,530
I have to work,
but my aunt's house is far away.

768
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,907
And Bolt is here, too.

769
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,533
Do as you wish, then.

770
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,497
What? Were you working here?

771
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,499
Did you eat dinner?

772
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,833
Not yet.

773
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,379
I didn't eat dinner yet, either.

774
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,013
Is he asleep?

775
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,730
Hey.

776
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,565
That's…

777
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,901
What's wrong?

778
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,112
You can't pour it like water--

779
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,697
This wine is super expensive.

780
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,658
I drink it from time to time
when I work here overnight.

781
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,035
Though it's my first time
drinking it with ramen.

782
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,497
But in the military,
you just need to get used to it.

783
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,751
Your wealth cannot be hidden,
no matter what you do.

784
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,753
Go ahead.

785
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,846
I drank a lot of wine with Yong Moon-goo.

786
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,559
That's not all. You can buy a winery
with all of the money you got

787
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,893
in wine boxes.

788
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,229
You and your way of talking.

789
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,740
It's different,
since I'm drinking it at no cost.

790
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,158
My stomach feels comfortable.

791
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,843
You're not eating?

792
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,136
What?

793
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,932
I don't really eat late night snacks.

794
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,642
My uniform doesn't fit right.

795
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,061
Then why did you make two?

796
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,356
Are you really not going to eat?

797
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,733
No.

798
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,826
If you work out as much as you eat,
you won't gain weight.

799
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,842
You eat so well, Cha Woo-in.

800
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,447
Hey, I'm giving the game to you, but you
still have a lot to learn as a prosecutor.

801
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,784
You need to learn a lot from me,
especially in court.

802
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,288
Are you feeling awkward?

803
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,250
Why are you talking about work?

804
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,419
It's just…

805
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,256
You can't win if you
only keep being straightforward.

806
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:18,885
You need to throw breaking balls
when necessary. That's the way to win.

807
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,180
Are you telling me
to catch them off guard?

808
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,809
I'll try and throw that breaking ball

809
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,561
at Hong Moo-seob's trial.

810
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,106
Yes, sure.

811
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,901
KANG HA-JOON

812
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,444
Hey, wait.

813
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,904
Put it on speaker.

814
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,783
KANG HA-JOON

815
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,661
Woo-in, I'm sorry.

816
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:48,248
Something happened at the company
and I couldn't call you.

817
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,543
I actually read the article
and was going to call you.

818
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,502
Is everything okay?

819
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,504
You see, what happened was--

820
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,672
What article?

821
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,466
Is something wrong, Kang?

822
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,343
Are you with Prosecutor Doh now?

823
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,220
Yes, well, I am.

824
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,056
Did you restore Won Ki-choon's
hard drive I gave you?

825
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,810
Well, I think it's going to take a while.

826
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,439
Focus on your company matters.

827
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,567
I'll work on this trial
with Prosecutor Doh alone.

828
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,986
Did you hear her? We're busy. Bye.

829
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,987
KANG HA-JOON

830
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,958
Sir, I have something to tell you.

831
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,546
We're close to finding
those who spread false information.

832
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,014
Is he okay?

833
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,434
I will now begin the briefing

834
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,354
on the power tripping
by the Commander of IV Corps.

835
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,524
This case is regarding
General Hong Moo-seob

836
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,694
and his younger sister
abusing a residence staff sergeant

837
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,988
and using him for personal purposes.

838
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,615
Turn to page two, please.

839
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,706
Take one each and write it honestly.

840
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,586
I DID NOT SUFFER POWER TRIPPING
BY THE CORPS COMMANDER

841
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,630
THE CORPS COMMANDER
TREATED ME LIKE FAMILY

842
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,721
They're all possible victims,

843
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,890
but please check
the list of victims again.

844
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,063
Do your job properly!

845
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,982
You should be worth the money!

846
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,651
CEO Yong, get us a new lawyer!

847
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,652
DOH SOO-KYUNG

848
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,030
Can we check the CCTV, please?

849
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,239
Thank you.

850
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,956
With the victims' statements
as top priority,

851
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,252
we're now strictly investigating
to reveal the truth.

852
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,921
We're also trying to find other victims,

853
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,592
and we're also doing our best
to find evidence of the power tripping.

854
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,012
WON KI-CHOON'S EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE

855
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,013
THE DATA HAS BEEN RESTORED

856
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,188
When you got rid of CEO Cha Ho-chul,

857
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,606
I took the lead

858
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,775
and lied in court.

859
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,402
And it was for you.

860
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,196
That's not all.

861
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,949
That truck accident
you caused 20 years ago.

862
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,370
The accident in which you hit that young
military investigator couple with a car.

863
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,414
Don't act like you don't know!

864
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,583
Because I remember it clearly!

865
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,545
This would be good enough
to make Noh Hwa-young stand trial.

866
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,636
CHA WOO-IN

867
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,312
Mr. Kang, we're in trouble!

868
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,817
CEO Kang Ha-joon?

869
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,902
What is it? What are you doing?

870
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,696
Here's the search and seizure warrant.

871
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,573
We ask for your cooperation.

872
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,534
Get started.

873
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,035
Put everything in the box.

874
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,179
Give me that, please.

875
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,975
Do you want additional charges?

876
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:33,950
Sir.

877
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,162
I don't know if this is
the right time to say this, but…

878
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,164
Those who spread the false information.

879
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,708
It's not certain,

880
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,460
but there is one suspicious place.

881
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,488
I think I know who the culprit is.

882
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,867
Let's talk next time.

883
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,328
Yes, sir.

884
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,752
I didn't do it alone.

885
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,672
I got help
from those who cooperate with me.

886
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,925
Like

887
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,053
how you and Cha Woo-in do it.

888
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,684
It was us who bought all your stocks
which hit rock bottom.

889
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,271
You know what that means, right?

890
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:50,068
You saw what happened to CEO Cha Ho-chul
next to Cha Woo-in.

891
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,326
-Please leave.
-No.

892
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,870
The one who has to leave soon

893
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,288
will be you, Mr. Kang.

894
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,209
Speaking of which,

895
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:13,258
I said this to Doh Bae-man when I met him
for the first time five years ago.

896
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,136
Today, I'll say it to you.

897
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,768
Have you heard
of an offer you can't refuse?

898
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,655
A FEW DAYS LATER

899
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,576
THE 2ND TRIAL OF CORPS COMMANDER
POWER TRIPPING CASE

900
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,668
Prosecutor Doh.

901
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,295
Yes?

902
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,464
I found the witness.

903
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,553
A crucial witness
who can help us win this trial.

904
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,805
What?

905
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,392
Who is that? Why didn't you tell me?

906
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:09,814
I couldn't tell you beforehand
because I thought you'd be against it.

907
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,609
Why would I be against it?

908
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,529
Actually, yesterday…

909
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,911
The judge is making an entrance!

910
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,010
Your Honor.

911
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,054
I'd like to summon a witness.

912
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,722
A witness?

913
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,476
But I heard there's no witness
summoned by the prosecution today.

914
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,772
The witness needed time
to make a decision to be present.

915
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,274
Defense attorney, what do you think?

916
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,234
Of course, I cannot approve it.

917
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,945
I will make it very clear.

918
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,072
We will only approve

919
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,407
witnesses who were agreed upon beforehand.

920
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,869
The defense attorney's being firm,
so we can't help it.

921
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,083
If you stop this witness from testifying,

922
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,460
it will seriously backfire.

923
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,381
You're saying something very dangerous.

924
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,383
So who's the witness?

925
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,804
If you're going to bring someone who
worked at the residence and say obvious--

926
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,623
What the…

927
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,584
Cha Woo-in.

928
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,801
I will become a monster,

929
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,513
step on the men, and go to the very top.

930
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,684
Your Honor.

931
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,604
I'm Major General Noh Hwa-young,
Commander of the 4th Division.

932
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,898
Staff Sergeant Shin, the victim, is

933
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,359
a precious non-commissioned
officer of my division.

934
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,572
Please allow me to help my subordinate.

935
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,153
The military judge said it openly.

936
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,279
Are you going to do things
like you did before?

937
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,822
He told me not to put in effort,
like a year ago.

938
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,365
I'd like to apply
for recusal of the judge.

939
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,534
Are you a serviceperson, or a prosecutor?

940
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,453
Why should I answer you--

941
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,122
There's something I couldn't say
because I was too scared.

942
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,999
We must make them pay for their crimes.

943
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,710
Sergeant Ahn. The son
of Gusan Bank's president.

944
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,171
There's a witness who can help you
win the trial. Are you interested?

945
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,297
If you finished examining the witness--

946
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,465
I am not finished!

947
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,634
The trial's going to have a boring ending.

948
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,928
From now on, you must leave

949
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,471
today's trial completely to me.

950
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,974
