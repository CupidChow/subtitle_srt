1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,109
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,360
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,486
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,738
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,947
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,223
Drop your gun!

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,227
Drop your gun, you bastard!

8
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,481
Mom!

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,233
Do you know, you bastard? Do you?

10
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,076
ONE WEEK AGO

11
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,203
But…

12
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,164
it was a very hard decision to make…

13
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,876
as my father's daughter.

14
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,881
It was hard.

15
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,259
And,

16
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,553
I'm sorry

17
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,097
I couldn't tell you beforehand.

18
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,433
I'm very sorry.

19
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,935
That's enough.

20
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,273
I'm saying, you can stop telling me that.

21
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,827
I don't need any other reasons.

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,538
So,

23
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,165
you can stop telling me,

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,542
Cha Woo-in.

25
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,391
What are you guys doing?

26
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,892
Salute.

27
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,607
We were organizing the trial records.

28
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,109
You give me homework

29
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,529
every time there's a trial, right?

30
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,365
You summoned the Division Commander's
adjutant as a witness, right?

31
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,118
It was to do my best
as a military prosecutor.

32
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,953
As I always tell you.

33
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,581
Why don't you compliment Prosecutor Cha,

34
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,499
since she won another hard trial?

35
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,042
Oh, should I?

36
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,212
Cha Woo-in, you're amazing.
She is amazing.

37
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:56,551
See? Now everyone in the 4th Division
knows of Cha Woo-in, okay?

38
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,931
Detective Doh Soo-kyung will visit
your office to get the trial materials.

39
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,226
What? Doh Bae-man's aunt--
I mean, Detective Doh will?

40
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,687
Gosh, seriously.

41
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,232
I need to do something
to overcome this fear, seriously.

42
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm sick of this…

43
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,862
He talks to himself too loudly.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,743
I knew Noh Hwa-young would
attack Hong Moo-seob someday,

45
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,953
but I didn't expect
for her to do it so soon.

46
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,788
Now, a war will start

47
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,707
inside the Patriotic Society.

48
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,502
And there should be
one more person in there.

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,754
Yong Moon-goo.

50
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,632
He got backstabbed during this trial,

51
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,052
so he'll show his true colors
to Noh Hwa-young soon.

52
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,305
I can't wait to see how Yong Moon-goo
will be to Noh Hwa-young,

53
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,934
since he was waiting for
the Patriotic Society and her to split.

54
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,233
Among the items that were seized,
there's an SSD hard drive.

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,735
That's my answer.

56
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,654
What's in that hard drive?

57
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,616
A critical hit to attack Noh Hwa-young.

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,581
PROSECUTOR KANG YEON-HEE

59
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,916
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

60
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,836
Yes, Mr. Yong.

61
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,048
Hey, thanks for taking care
of the search and seizure

62
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,549
of Kang's Solution quickly.

63
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,761
I'm looking through them carefully,
like you told me to.

64
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,349
There's been an unexpected change.
So you can slow down a bit.

65
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,308
What?

66
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,145
I understand what you mean.

67
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,731
But you know…

68
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,152
There's an item I'd like to check

69
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,239
among the items
seized from Kang's Solution.

70
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,950
Is it possible?

71
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,388
You still wear that watch?

72
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,848
You saved my life.

73
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,392
And I exchanged my life with this.

74
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,798
Hello, sir.

75
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,508
Hey, Noh Hwa-young.

76
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,343
You explain yourself right now!

77
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,764
Why did you go
to the Corps Commander's trial

78
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,432
and mess it up?

79
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,143
If you fail
to make me convinced right here,

80
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,728
then you'll have to pay for it!

81
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,607
You said you'd use both the spears
and the shields, to win for sure!

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,609
Didn't you hear what the Minister said?

83
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,861
Explain yourself right now!

84
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,696
Please calm your anger

85
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,865
and read this first, Minister.

86
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,701
What use does an article like this have?

87
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,245
Read it to the Minister,
Vice Corps Commander.

88
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,415
Gosh, good grief…

89
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,090
"Division Commander
Noh Hwa-young's brave actions

90
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,926
of taking an action herself
for two officers

91
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,386
who suffered unjust damages
are now a hot issue."

92
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,224
"Thanks to that,

93
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,853
the controversy around the responsibility
of the military leaders

94
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,022
has been wiped out."

95
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,234
The next part is important.

96
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,655
"A key personnel in Blue House said

97
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,826
they highly evaluated
Minister Lee Jae-sik's initiative

98
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:55,915
to innovate military culture by even
forming a special investigation team."

99
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,042
This is…

100
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,380
What you were worried about
has flipped completely, Minister.

101
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,258
Minister, didn't you already know

102
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,593
about the Corps Commander's
sadistic personality,

103
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,431
in which he treats his subordinates
like consumables?

104
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,349
You just turned a blind eye.

105
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,520
You, Vice Corps Commander,
were the closest to him.

106
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,188
I'm sure you knew too.

107
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,984
And I'm sure what happened to my adjutant

108
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,154
didn't only happen to my adjutant, either.

109
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:30,950
In order to solve this with the
self-purification in the military,

110
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,704
you just need to put a period
at the end of it, Minister.

111
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,372
A period?

112
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,293
You need to completely exclude

113
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,379
the Corps Commander
from the Patriotic Society.

114
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,303
I will do all of the risky work

115
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,971
of dealing with people.

116
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,390
You just need

117
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,312
to take its fruit, Minister.

118
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,489
Give us some privacy.

119
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,920
I didn't expect the tables
to be turned like this.

120
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,507
Do you think she really
testified for her adjutant?

121
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,927
Or did she do it to get rid
of the Corps Commander?

122
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,555
Personally, I think it's the latter.

123
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,349
One thing's for sure.

124
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,769
She's trying to sit on top of my head

125
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,563
to control and manipulate me.

126
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,440
That's right, yes.

127
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,150
It looks like you raised

128
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,028
a sly thousand-tailed fox, Minister.

129
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:54,075
Why don't you get rid
of the Division Commander, too?

130
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,202
You idiot.

131
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,039
That's why you can never beat her!

132
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,877
Can't you see that she's doing that
because she knows I can't get rid of her?

133
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,171
Gosh, Noh Hwa-young, that wench.

134
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,425
Then what are you going to do,

135
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,760
Minister?

136
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,388
May I ask you a question?

137
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,973
What is it?

138
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,684
I'm curious about how you can

139
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,644
hide your feelings so well

140
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,479
in front of Noh Hwa-young.

141
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,898
When someone who killed
your parents is right there.

142
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,531
I, too, have moments when I want
to strangle her right away.

143
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,951
Like how you wanted

144
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,869
to end everything with a bullet.

145
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,584
My father was recently in my dreams.

146
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,045
I got to see my father

147
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,380
after a really long time.

148
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,718
What did your father say?

149
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,013
He told me to win.

150
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,766
He told me to win justly.

151
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,980
Let's go inside.

152
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,026
Noh Hwa-young said
something strange to me.

153
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,945
What did she say?

154
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,034
She said there's something I don't
know about between her and my father.

155
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,369
But my father and Noh Hwa-young

156
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,413
didn't have any connection.

157
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,582
He had no photo of her too.

158
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,127
Don't mind what she said too much.

159
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,215
Go inside.

160
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm saying there are things
you don't know as well.

161
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,486
Because you were too young at that time.

162
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,738
Perhaps…

163
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,700
our relationship could have been
completely different from now.

164
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,667
HOPING FOR THE PEACE
OF MAJOR NOH HWA-YOUNG. CHA HO-CHUL

165
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,711
Yes, I have arrived.

166
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,172
CEO Cha died at the scene,

167
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,800
and there was another passenger.

168
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,385
Another passenger?

169
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,553
Who was it?

170
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,679
It was his daughter.

171
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,056
She returned from the US three days ago.

172
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,892
Did she die, too?

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,602
She's unconscious.

174
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,773
And based on the scene,
she seems hopeless.

175
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,068
General?

176
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,495
-Wow, thank you.
-Thank you for them.

177
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,457
-Tae-nam, thanks a lot.
-Tae-nam, thank you for this.

178
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,749
Thank you.

179
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,051
Mr. Yong, how did you get in here?
Civilians are not allowed in here.

180
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,804
This is General Noh's division.
Nothing's impossible.

181
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,015
You called me the other day,

182
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,057
so I came.

183
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,477
Then, did my mother send you?

184
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,275
I thought so.
My mother would ever do that.

185
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,446
You're the only
who cares about me, Mr. Yong.

186
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,324
Mr. Noh. Isn't the military life hard?

187
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,911
Since you began your service anyway,

188
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,412
I'll give you a tip.

189
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,624
A tip?

190
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,834
You can't understand
the military, can you?

191
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,421
-How can I possibly understand this place?
-That's why you're finding it hard.

192
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,924
The military isn't a place
where you understand,

193
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,091
but where you give up.

194
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,178
You're giving me that as a tip?

195
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,933
Like you, who was never able
to understand your monstrous mother

196
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,393
and gave up.

197
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,313
Did you just…

198
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,690
You're amazing for not going mad

199
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,984
under your mother,

200
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,529
or here, Tae-nam.

201
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,588
Noh Tae-nam.

202
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,216
Private Noh Tae-nam.

203
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,926
You have a consultation. Come.

204
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,064
Why did you collapse
during your last guard duty?

205
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,528
Your mentor for that duty
was Sergeant Ahn Soo-ho.

206
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,489
Did something happen?

207
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,369
Don't be fussy!

208
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,663
Don't be fussy, you bastard!

209
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,167
Want me to tell you
something really funny?

210
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,844
No matter how much I harass you,
the world won't believe it.

211
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,681
It'll think the opposite.

212
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,075
No, I was just dizzy for a moment.

213
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,871
Are you sure? Is there anything
that can cause trouble later?

214
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,041
Yes.

215
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,376
Then it's okay.

216
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,669
Go on.

217
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,640
Did you answer him as I told you to?

218
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,479
I told him that nothing happened.

219
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,022
Good job.

220
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,193
Wow, you now talk properly, too.

221
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,362
You're now a military guy.

222
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,113
Don't forget what I said.

223
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,491
Whatever accidents occur in here,

224
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,159
they'll suspect you first.

225
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,827
Because you are…

226
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,039
Noh Tae-nam, a troublemaker soldier.

227
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,091
Gosh, that doggone bastard.

228
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,187
Why are you here?

229
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,563
Where's the Minister?

230
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,278
He has an important engagement,
so I came in his place.

231
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,948
What could be more important
than what happened to me?

232
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,325
The Patriotic Society is in crisis!

233
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,829
You're still not realizing
what's going on.

234
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,623
What? You bastard--

235
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:44,086
I really didn't want to say this, but

236
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,465
the Minister got invited
to a luncheon at Blue House

237
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,052
as encouragement for the special
investigation on power tripping.

238
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:52,970
What?

239
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:57,474
So, I'm here to deliver
the Minister's words.

240
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,895
He told me to deliver
this expression to you.

241
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
Gyeoktakyangcheong.

242
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:14,450
"To get rid of murky things
and to accept pure things."

243
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,786
The Minister said this is how he thinks,

244
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,041
and the path the Patriotic Society
must take.

245
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,167
Farewell.

246
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,712
Hey, Heo Kang-in!

247
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,465
How could you look down on me, too?

248
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,345
A serviceperson is loyal to a superior

249
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,931
only when he or she is
more powerful than I am.

250
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,643
To be honest, the Patriotic Society
won't be at risk

251
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,354
simply because of you.

252
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,538
The joint investigation
of the military and the police

253
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,123
suits me perfectly.

254
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,417
Getting a corps commander
to get punished was…

255
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,923
Even drinking soda and burping
wouldn't be more refreshing than this!

256
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,553
Perhaps the blood
of a serviceperson runs in me, too.

257
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,311
By the way, why do you
look like you're in agony?

258
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,438
Do you have a stomachache?

259
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,192
Well, more than a stomachache.

260
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,028
Ma'am, do you know how it feels to wait

261
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,658
for an order from the superiors
after a trial ends? Do you?

262
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,162
-Salute.
-Salute.

263
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,330
You're here.

264
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,500
I brought these in case
you need it to investigate Hong Kyung-ok.

265
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,710
-Awesome.
-Why did you bring them?

266
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,546
Why did you bring them, again?

267
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,965
Cha Woo-in, you always move before I do,

268
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,008
and that's your problem.

269
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,554
You don't know how lucky you are
to have a subordinate like her.

270
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,060
This is Seo Joo-hyuk.

271
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,312
Division Commander!

272
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,939
Salute!

273
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,440
What?

274
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,984
Thank you.

275
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,069
Thank you, Division Commander!

276
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,529
Salute!

277
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,912
Cha Woo-in.

278
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,415
I'll be specially promoted by one rank!

279
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,626
The Division Commander verified it!

280
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,046
Congratulations.

281
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,093
-Let's wrap things up now.
-Yes, sir.

282
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,859
Where have you been at this early hour?

283
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,821
I'll tell you after lunch.

284
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,073
Want to eat out? Cha, what would you like?

285
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,743
I don't know. Let's go outside.

286
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,163
Where are Sang-ki and Ahn?

287
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,132
They're going to eat lunch together?
Just the two of them?

288
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,635
They didn't even bother
to look for us, right?

289
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,845
I'm just too curious.

290
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,306
Then we just have
to check it for ourselves.

291
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,849
Yeah, I think so, too.

292
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,689
It's on me today.

293
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,192
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.

294
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,029
What's wrong?

295
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,656
Is this all?

296
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,408
If it's on you, I would've
ordered a course meal.

297
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,955
-Order a sweet and sour pork for me, too.
-Yes, sir, I will.

298
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,833
Please wait.

299
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,095
This is a reward for finishing
the second hunt.

300
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,848
Help yourself.

301
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,891
Yes.

302
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,977
Thank you for the food, master.

303
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,272
Wait.

304
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,608
Black bean noodles must have
chili pepper flakes on it.

305
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,277
I don't really like the color red.

306
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,446
Help yourself.

307
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,491
Their gazes did change, right?

308
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,245
When co-workers date, everyone knows,
except for themselves.

309
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,166
Those two clearly don't know.

310
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,877
Let's see…

311
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,720
Subsection Chief Ahn, the game is over.

312
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,180
They're sharing black bean
and spicy seafood noodles.

313
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,223
What?

314
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,226
We've been indifferent about them
because we're working too hard.

315
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,894
We were indifferent. Yes.

316
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,273
What shall we eat? Shall we get
black bean and spicy seafood noodles, too?

317
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,357
When I feel gloomy…

318
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,110
Glutinous noodles?

319
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,696
When your heart is on fire?

320
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,781
-Fire-grilled beef.
-Bang!

321
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,075
Banquet feast! That hurts.

322
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,127
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

323
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,047
Lieutenant Colonel Seo Joo-hyuk!

324
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,132
Wow, you're awesome!

325
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,967
I'm proud of you!

326
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,806
I prepared this for you, darling.

327
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,558
Help yourself, okay?

328
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,353
Wow. Darling, congratulations
on your promotion.

329
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,980
Now, a lover's shot.

330
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,695
One for you. No, you go ahead first.

331
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,572
Okay, I will. Thank you.

332
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,242
It's good!

333
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,249
Gosh, seriously.

334
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,251
I don't have anyone to genuinely share

335
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,714
the joy of a promotion with me, right?

336
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:09,763
Who can comfort the loneliness
of a successful man?

337
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,314
Wow, the weather is nice.

338
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,690
Has spring come now?

339
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,817
Salute.

340
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,446
What is it that you were going to tell me?

341
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,367
Things are going the way
we expected them to.

342
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,160
You mean, with the Patriotic Society?

343
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,328
Yes.

344
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,498
Hong Moo-seob called me.

345
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,167
You're amazing, Doh Bae-man.

346
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,753
You had me sentenced to three years

347
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,464
simply for making the boys run
errands and beating them up.

348
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,299
You did that to "me," actually.

349
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,097
I revealed your true colors
and made you take off your uniform,

350
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,099
so it was a big achievement.

351
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,520
And the anonymous letters
from the soldiers who suffered

352
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,730
from power trips are pouring in,

353
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,441
so think of those three years
as an appetizer,

354
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,736
and look forward to the main course.

355
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,365
I found out the reason you did this,

356
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,701
even swearing to be loyal to me.

357
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,245
I knew you were going to find out.

358
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:20,083
You're the son of the investigator
couple who worked for me.

359
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,253
This whole thing was planned
from the start, to target me.

360
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,714
Don't forget Noh Hwa-young,
who placed her spoon on

361
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,091
this feast I prepared.

362
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:29,885
Noh Hwa-young.

363
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,887
And the Patriotic Society, too.

364
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,312
From now on, a military prosecutor
does not use honorifics to a criminal.

365
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,229
Understood?

366
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,150
You were abandoned
by the Patriotic Society, right?

367
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,194
Why do you think so?

368
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,653
You called me,

369
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,156
because you were abandoned by them

370
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,783
and you must be looking
for a way to survive.

371
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,826
Isn't that right?

372
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,620
Corps Commander.

373
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,998
Your real target is Noh Hwa-young, right?

374
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,043
I got caught in the process,

375
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,503
and she's the one who killed your parents.

376
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,009
Then you must also know
that she took over Cha Ho-chul's company.

377
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,928
Then tell me.

378
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:17,307
Why did Noh Hwa-young
even kill Cha Ho-chul?

379
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,227
She could've just taken his company
and kicked him out.

380
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,355
And?

381
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,981
What did Hong Moo-seob say?

382
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,403
Are you saying there's another reason
for killing CEO Cha Ho-chul?

383
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,491
Cha Ho-chul threatened Noh Hwa-young.

384
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,369
That was like
threatening the Patriotic Society.

385
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,788
After your parent's accident 20 years ago,

386
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,667
Cha Ho-chul collected material on
the corruption of the Patriotic Society.

387
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,128
The X-files of the Patriotic Society.
That's what we called it among us.

388
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,047
The X-files of the Patriotic Society…

389
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,260
So, that thing was completed
six years ago,

390
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,178
and he threatened Noh Hwa-young with it?

391
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,846
Yes.

392
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,100
If the X-files were revealed at that time,

393
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,686
I'm sure the Patriotic Society
wouldn't exist now.

394
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,607
Noh Hwa-young quieted everything down.

395
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,859
She took over the company

396
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,237
and got rid of Cha Ho-chul
who was in the way.

397
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,614
Yes, Doh Bae-man.

398
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,241
You're right.

399
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,160
The Patriotic Society abandoned me.

400
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,997
I must see

401
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,835
the Patriotic Society fall from in here.

402
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,089
My father tried to take down
the Patriotic Society?

403
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,968
He said your father made
the X-files of the Patriotic Society

404
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,221
and he threatened Noh Hwa-young
and the Patriotic Society with it.

405
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,684
How much can we trust
what Hong Moo-seob says?

406
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,230
Was there anything among
the articles left by your father…

407
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:51,401
You're asking me if any of them
were related to the X-files, aren't you?

408
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,196
No, there wasn't.

409
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,823
I knew it.

410
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,783
There's no way you would've missed it.

411
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,580
Then there are three possibilities.

412
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,249
Either that file is gone forever,

413
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,709
Noh Hwa-young has it,

414
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,670
or someone else has it.

415
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,049
I'm sure Noh Hwa-young doesn't have it.

416
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,759
If she took it from my father,

417
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,096
she would have reached
a higher place than now using it.

418
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,891
Wait.

419
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,103
I suddenly remembered one person
who may have access

420
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,064
to the X-files of the Patriotic Society.

421
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,318
No way.

422
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,694
Does he really?

423
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,198
I don't think so.

424
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,242
I'm sure Noh Tae-nam doesn't.

425
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,873
What?

426
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,708
What did you just say? Say that again.

427
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,959
-What?
-Why?

428
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,753
I did everything you told me to!

429
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,546
I went into your sleeping bag, too!

430
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,633
But I can't put up with you
insulting my mother! Apologize!

431
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,135
Wow, look at you, you bastard.

432
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,096
You even know how to do comedy sketches?

433
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,060
Hey, you think I'm the only bad guy?

434
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,231
But that's all your fault, okay?
So why did you put up with it?

435
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,317
It's fun because you keep
putting up with it.

436
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,362
See? This is it. This is it, okay?

437
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,864
I can't do this anymore
once I get discharged.

438
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,450
Shall I just re-enlist?

439
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,078
-Go ahead.
-I think you can.

440
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,464
You shouldn't have put up with it.
Why did you do that?

441
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,383
Let's finish what we were talking about.

442
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,594
Pyeon, your mom sells tteokbokki
in front of Sammun Station, right?

443
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,890
Once I get discharged,
I'm going to go smash that place.

444
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,684
I ate there once during my leave,

445
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,981
and it seemed her leg was very unwell.

446
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,733
You damn bastard!

447
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,863
Hey, I was kidding.

448
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,905
You bastard.

449
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,700
You bastard,
can't you even tell it's a joke?

450
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,118
Hey, that's enough.

451
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,663
Hey, anyway, put up with it
for the rest of your service,

452
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,790
for your mother.

453
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,960
-Hey, let's go.
-Let's go.

454
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,497
I can see now.

455
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,166
From now on, don't put up with it.

456
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,226
What?

457
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,188
Are you sure you put it here?

458
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,065
Not in the residence or anywhere else?

459
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,485
Kang must've taken it.

460
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,992
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

461
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,454
The call cannot be connected…

462
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,249
If he was going to take it,
he should've told us.

463
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,835
Why did he take something
important without telling us?

464
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,880
Maybe it's because he couldn't find
anything from the hard drive.

465
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,551
Damn it.

466
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,183
I just got it, Prosecutor Kang.
See you at the Prosecutor's Office soon.

467
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,966
When you got rid of CEO Cha Ho-chul,

468
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,885
I took the lead

469
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,469
and lied in court.

470
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,431
And it was for you.

471
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,099
That's not all.

472
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,186
That truck accident
you caused 20 years ago.

473
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,940
The accident in which you hit that young
military investigator couple with a car.

474
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,408
What is this?

475
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,912
The crime you committed six years ago
when you were a prosecutor.

476
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,414
You mean it's the record of my past?

477
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,044
And Won Ki-choon's secret safe.

478
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,804
Kang, did you take the box
of materials on Won Ki-choon?

479
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,647
These are the charges on CEO Cha Ho-chul
you fabricated and exaggerated.

480
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,607
Won Ki-choon was collecting those.

481
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,151
He must've planned to get away alone
if things went wrong.

482
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:30,031
Mr. Kang. Once you turned your back
on them, you're cold-blooded and ruthless.

483
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,533
You brought an unexpected gift, too.

484
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,705
Now, since I gave you
more than you expected,

485
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,457
now it's my turn to receive

486
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,125
more than I expected.

487
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,461
I have a meeting with Minister
Lee Jae-sik soon.

488
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,421
Join me.

489
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,799
You'll be able to see

490
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,844
what kind of a picture I'm drawing
if you go there.

491
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,647
Vice CEO.

492
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,525
Can you please tell me
what's going on at the company?

493
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,988
Mr. Kang didn't tell you?
We even went through a search and seizure.

494
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,407
Search and seizure?

495
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,910
Yes, but we took care of urgent matters,

496
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,745
thanks to CEO Yong Moon-goo.

497
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,290
Mr. Kang just went to IM Defense Industry

498
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,418
to meet CEO Yong Moon-goo.

499
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,715
Thanks again for a gift
I couldn't even imagine.

500
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,092
You're trustworthy.

501
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,553
Goodbye.

502
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,403
Weren't we

503
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,197
old friends?

504
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,411
We've been helping each other
whenever we were in trouble.

505
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,955
I thought of you as my only family.

506
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,088
You don't need my help anymore.

507
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,507
You have Doh Bae-man.

508
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,094
It's because of Prosecutor Doh?

509
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,640
I've been helping you

510
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,602
repay the help I got from your father.

511
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,937
But now, I'm not someone you need anymore.

512
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,231
And I'm a bit

513
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,484
tired.

514
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,653
If the company was in trouble,
you should've told me.

515
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,739
How could you join forces
with Yong Moon-goo?

516
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,325
I gave the materials to Yong Moon-goo

517
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,577
to save the employees at my company,

518
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,912
who were counting on me.

519
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,415
And…

520
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:46,793
Here.

521
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,295
I'm sure you don't need it,

522
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,964
but I can't keep it anymore.

523
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,217
It's okay.

524
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,010
It'll be alright.

525
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,113
DOH BAE-MAN

526
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,203
Did you meet CEO Kang?

527
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,997
Yes.

528
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,583
Are you still with him?

529
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,792
CEO Kang

530
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,379
joined forces with Yong Moon-goo.

531
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,547
What?

532
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:20,261
He betrayed us-- I mean, he betrayed you?

533
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,055
He said he had to protect his company.

534
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,390
And

535
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,393
it seems like he resented me a bit, too.

536
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,649
I'm sure Yong Moon-goo
approached CEO Kang first,

537
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,651
to drive us apart.

538
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,449
Cha Woo-in.

539
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,659
Are you crying right now?

540
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,578
I'll solve it.

541
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,498
This is between me and CEO Kang.

542
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,502
Just go.

543
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,714
I've got nothing to say to you.
We don't need to see each other again.

544
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,675
How dare you betray Cha Woo-in?

545
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,469
Say no more.
I don't want to hear anything from you.

546
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,597
Say it.

547
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,557
What did Yong Moon-goo offer you?

548
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,353
An offer I can't refuse.

549
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,982
I, too, couldn't refuse it,
like you couldn't refuse it back then.

550
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,569
I think the price is paid, so leave.

551
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,572
Since you're on Yong Moon-goo's side,

552
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,950
you're our enemy now.

553
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,159
And,

554
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,620
don't ever show up in front
of Cha Woo-in again.

555
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,248
If you do, then I might kill you.

556
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,817
But now, I'm not someone you need anymore.

557
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,111
And I'm a bit

558
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,447
tired.

559
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,527
Is he the one?

560
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,445
Yes, sir.

561
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,989
It's an honor to meet you, Minister.

562
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,449
I'm Kang Ha-joon.

563
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,368
I heard you're not even 30 yet.

564
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,038
You're talented in many ways.

565
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,874
I'm trying my best to grow
to become a good entrepreneur,

566
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,502
so please think well of me, Minister.

567
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,504
He's smart,

568
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,506
and he's more than competent.

569
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,715
You can trust him.

570
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,177
There's a saying,

571
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,262
"Youth is just wasted on young people."

572
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,433
Being young is a big risk, too.

573
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,561
Still, you seem like you have guts

574
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,980
and a big mind, too!

575
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,277
I can guarantee it.

576
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,364
From now on, between your orders and IM,

577
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,076
CEO Kang Ha-joon's
Kang's Solution will be there.

578
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,079
I will do my best
so I won't be a nuisance to you two.

579
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,748
By the way, what's your relationship?

580
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,795
Are you two friends?
I've never seen businesses run by friends

581
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,338
having good endings.

582
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:29,927
I will be friends with CEO Yong
as I work on this project.

583
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,188
-Cool and indifferent.
-Cool and indifferent.

584
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,357
-Chic.
-Chic.

585
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,484
-Are we done?
-One more.

586
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,529
-Okay.
-Upload them.

587
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,322
-Hashtag, "Daily."
-Hashtag, "Daily."

588
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,824
-Hashtag, "Popular guy."
-Hashtag, "Popular guy."

589
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,617
-Hashtag, "Seol-ak."
-Hashtag, "Seol-ak."

590
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,369
-Hashtag…
-What?

591
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,956
He's the man who got five boxes, right?

592
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,874
Yes.

593
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,502
Who's that new guy?

594
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,839
Is he my rival?

595
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,633
But he doesn't look hip like us.

596
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,534
Are you okay?

597
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,123
I'm trying

598
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,292
to be okay.

599
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,004
He's your old friend who's helped you

600
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,173
with your most important goal.

601
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,425
So I'm sure it's not easy to accept it.

602
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,678
I'm just going to think

603
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,263
that CEO Kang had no other choice

604
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,850
for his company

605
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,310
and for his employees.

606
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,525
I also wonder how my father
endured all those times,

607
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,445
as an entrepreneur who protected IM

608
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,531
for a long time.

609
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,618
Soon, Yong Moon-goo will obtain

610
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,203
all of our information.

611
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,332
I'm sorry,

612
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,583
Prosecutor Doh.

613
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,922
Now, you and I

614
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,800
just have to get stronger on our own.

615
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,930
Because Yong Moon-goo now has become
an enemy as big as Noh Hwa-young.

616
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,058
Yes.

617
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,078
Hey, Pyeon.

618
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,997
Is that the only glasses frame you have?

619
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,418
You're just so pathetic, you bastard.

620
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,796
Just tell your mother to send you one.

621
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,383
Once I get discharged,
I'm going to go smash that place.

622
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,635
I ate there once during my leave,

623
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,472
and it seemed her leg was very unwell.

624
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,060
Do you have your phone with you?

625
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,980
-What?
-I have to call my mom.

626
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,982
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

627
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,401
I need to check if she's safe.

628
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,904
Sergeant Ma said when he gets discharged,
he'll harm my mom.

629
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,365
He'll harm my mom.

630
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,576
Snap out of it, you bastard!

631
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,371
Hey, are you kidding me?

632
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,873
Sergeant Ma said

633
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,251
he'll harm my mom when he gets discharged!

634
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,961
My mom.

635
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,340
If she hurts her leg again,
then she will never walk again!

636
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,013
Sergeant Ma is asleep right now,
you bastard!

637
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,598
Snap out of it!

638
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,852
Didn't that jerk Sergeant Ma
get discharged?

639
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,438
You bastard! Damn it.

640
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,606
Let go!

641
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,441
Let go!

642
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,485
One, two!

643
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,945
You bastard!

644
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,475
I'll go look for that jerk Sergeant Ma
and come back to finish my duty.

645
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,851
Salute.

646
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,275
The supply car hit me,

647
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,152
and I fell, like this.

648
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,697
So the ambulance worker
took me right away.

649
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,159
Where's that jerk Sergeant Ma?

650
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,704
What did you say?

651
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,956
"That jerk Sergeant Ma"?

652
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,124
Are you serious?

653
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,209
I think I heard that jerk's voice.

654
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,045
You bastard, you must be out of your mind.

655
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,882
Hey. I know he's going to be
discharged soon, but show him respect.

656
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,467
Where's Sergeant Ma?

657
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,053
By the way, shouldn't you
be patrolling the front lines?

658
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,557
Whose rifle is that?

659
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,977
You're right.
Why does that bastard have two rifles?

660
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,534
Wow, you bastard,
you've gone completely nuts.

661
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,329
Wow, what are you doing?

662
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,416
What? Are you going to shoot?

663
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,628
You can't even shoot,
and look how you're showing off.

664
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,714
Hey, go ahead and shoot.

665
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,715
Shoot, I said!

666
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,966
Go ahead and shoot.

667
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,846
Snap out of it, you bastard.

668
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,598
Want me to kill you?

669
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,069
Yes.

670
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,822
That's how you should behave, Pyeon.

671
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,575
Well done, Pyeonkachu.

672
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,869
Now go.

673
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,666
I said, go!

674
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,838
He needs a good beating.

675
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,342
That stupid bastard.

676
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,219
Hey, go back to eating.

677
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,846
That bastard can't do anything

678
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,599
-except for Thunderbolt.
-He's good at that, yes.

679
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,601
-You're right.
-At being electrocuted.

680
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,978
-He's good at that, at least.
-I know, right?

681
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,271
That Super Thunderbolt--

682
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,901
I won't put up with it anymore.

683
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,237
If I put up with it,

684
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,572
Mom will be in danger.

685
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,079
Pyeon Sang-ho!
What are you doing? You bastard!

686
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,547
2022 PATENT ATTORNEY EXAM SCHEDULE

687
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,883
Don't kill me!

688
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,968
What was that?

689
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:26,885
What?

690
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,138
Isn't that the sound of gunfire?
What kind of a crazy bastard--

691
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,432
Hey, go outside and check.

692
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,937
I said, go outside and check,
you bastards!

693
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,273
Hey, Noh Tae-nam,
you go outside, you bastard.

694
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,317
Go now, you bastard! Hurry! You bastard!

695
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,406
-Is that jerk Sergeant Ma here?
-You bastard!

696
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,536
He's not here, either.

697
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,676
He's not here, either.

698
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,187
Go outside and check, you bastards!

699
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,898
You idiots.

700
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,488
Hey, stick close.

701
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,865
Get the helmet!

702
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,450
Stick close.

703
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,212
One.

704
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,840
Two.

705
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,800
Three.

706
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:01,897
Is that jerk Sergeant Ma sleeping here?
I thought he got discharged.

707
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,106
Pyeon.

708
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,900
Have you gone mad?

709
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,653
Lower your gun!

710
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,820
Lower it, you bastard!

711
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,323
Sergeant Ma!

712
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,035
What? He's not here.

713
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,788
Did he really get discharged?

714
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,041
Calm down.

715
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,793
Let's talk this out, Sang-ho.

716
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,919
Pyeon!

717
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,004
I mean, Sang-ho.

718
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,964
Let's talk this out.

719
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:32,094
You don't know how much I wanted to die
every time I was on guard duty with you?

720
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,555
You guys are no different!

721
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,867
Private First Class Pyeon.

722
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,703
Please don't kill me.

723
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,872
Sang-ho, please come to your senses!

724
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:13,719
You're the only one
who treated me like a human being.

725
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,602
You're harassed by Sergeant Ma, too.

726
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,063
Let's go find him together.

727
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,403
Sang-ho.

728
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,946
Sang-ho!

729
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,797
Mother.

730
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,801
Mom…

731
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,179
What is it?

732
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,141
Please… please help me.

733
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,936
What are you talking about?

734
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,858
Mom, help me, please!

735
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,818
Tae-nam!

736
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,110
Tae--

737
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,864
Adjutant Yang!

738
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,117
Division Commander.

739
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,078
Check on the 14th GOP right now.

740
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,791
We actually got a report on hearing
gunfire numerous times from the 14th GOP.

741
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,794
I'll get the car ready now.

742
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,012
Help!

743
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,865
Sergeant Ma, are you here?

744
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,009
Only one cell remains.

745
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,177
Answer me now

746
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,973
OCCUPIED

747
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,116
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry!

748
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,437
Drop your gun!

749
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,273
Drop your gun, you bastard!

750
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,529
Drop it and put your hands up!

751
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,308
Salute.

752
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,559
Report.

753
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,228
It was not done by North Korea.

754
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,773
It seems to be a mass shooting
committed by one of our soldiers.

755
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,108
Mass shooting?

756
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,027
-Any survivors?
-Those on duty at the front lines

757
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,862
during the mass shooting survived,

758
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,323
but the soldiers who were sleeping
in the barracks,

759
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,575
the GOP commander,
and many others have died.

760
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:51,371
Is Private Noh Tae-nam
one of the survivors?

761
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,290
Answer me!

762
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,750
Yes, there is.

763
00:54:56,418 --> 00:55:00,213
But he confronted our military
manpower during the suppression,

764
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,465
so he's now cuffed and locked up.

765
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,010
Private Noh Tae-nam confronted you?

766
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,012
Yes, Division Commander.

767
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,346
Where is he now?

768
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,868
Mother?

769
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,245
Mother!

770
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:37,167
Mom!

771
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,168
Mom!

772
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,836
Could you give us some privacy?

773
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:40,754
Yes, ma'am.

774
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,802
Mom.

775
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,390
Tae-nam, did you do this?

776
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,019
-What?
-I just asked you

777
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,063
if you did the mass shooting.

778
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,106
Did this happen because of you?

779
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,734
Answer me!

780
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,320
I didn't do it.

781
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,738
Are you sure?

782
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,409
I am. It wasn't me.

783
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,119
I didn't do it.

784
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,581
That's a relief.

785
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,612
AHN YOO-RA

786
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,032
What's going on at this hour?

787
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,955
What's going on at this hour?
Is it urgent?

788
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,666
A mass shooting occurred
at the front lines.

789
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,043
I think you should go there now.

790
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:02,961
Where's Cha?

791
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,131
She's waiting outside. Hurry up, please.

792
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:07,757
Okay.

793
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,014
The details on the MND
and the defense industry

794
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,850
will be discussed next time.

795
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,436
And then you will truly realize

796
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,604
what kind of a world you have entered.

797
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,814
Okay.

798
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,529
I remembered after meeting
the members of the Patriotic Society.

799
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,322
Were there any files related to them

800
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,159
when you searched and seized
CEO Cha six years ago?

801
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,368
Files?

802
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,790
So you and Division Commander
Noh Hwa-young

803
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,501
weren't sharing absolutely everything.

804
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,003
Go ahead and tell me.

805
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,089
Mr. Cha collected materials
on their corruption.

806
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,718
It was called the X-files
of the Patriotic Society.

807
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:57,015
The X-files of the Patriotic Society.

808
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,936
A mass shooting occurred
at a GOP of the 4th Division

809
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,980
in Woncheol, Gangwon-do.

810
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,357
It's been told there were
dozens of gunshots heard

811
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:10,862
and it's expected to have a large number
of casualties, shocking everyone.

812
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,782
No details on the situation behind
the case or damages have been revealed,

813
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,828
and the soldier who committed the crime
was arrested at the scene.

814
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,748
According to the initial investigation,

815
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,958
the first sound of explosion

816
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,836
was heard from this lounge.

817
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,598
DO NOT CROSS

818
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:43,520
As for now, it's assumed that Pyeon
Sang-ho committed the crime on his own,

819
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,647
but he's not talking at all,

820
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,690
so he wasn't questioned properly.

821
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,860
PYEON SANG-HO

822
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,121
Where was Private First Class
Pyeon Sang-ho arrested?

823
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,123
It was the restroom. This way, please.

824
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,145
I'm sorry, Pyeon!

825
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,063
I'm sorry, okay?

826
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,274
I'm sorry, Pyeon!

827
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,234
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

828
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,239
Help!

829
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,659
Say that you will never
mention my mom again!

830
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:43,121
Say it!

831
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,831
Say it!

832
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,169
Drop your gun!

833
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,697
Ahn said the interrogation for Pyeon
is now ready.

834
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,158
He didn't say anything
during the interrogation, right?

835
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,618
He didn't.

836
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,890
Your affiliation.
Your official rank and name.

837
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,729
Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho?

838
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,654
Private First Class Pyeon.

839
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,576
You miss your mother, don't you?

840
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,121
It's okay, so answer me.

841
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,459
No. I'm okay.

842
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,380
Get up.

843
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,007
Your mother is outside.

844
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,718
I called her.

845
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,179
Is it true?

846
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,522
Why?

847
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,732
Can't you bring yourself
to actually see her?

848
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,290
Sang-ho.

849
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,043
Mom.

850
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,511
Sang-ho.

851
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,555
Why did you do that?

852
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:10,143
Why did you do that? You're a good boy.
Why did you?

853
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,572
You should've put up with it
for just a bit longer!

854
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,826
You should've put up with it!

855
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,247
Mom!

856
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,957
My son!

857
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,335
My son!

858
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:48,181
I'm Private First Class Pyeon Sang-ho
from the 3rd Platoon, the 1st Battalion,

859
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,932
the 23rd Regiment, the 4th Division.

860
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,934
According to the investigation,

861
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,353
these are the charges
currently applied to you.

862
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,192
Murder of superiors.
Attempted murder of superiors.

863
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,152
Damage and theft of military supplies.

864
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,738
Desertion from duty. Murder

865
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:04,864
and attempted murder.

866
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,163
Any accomplices?

867
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,831
There's none.

868
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:17,376
-I did everything by myself.
-What's the motive for crime?

869
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,839
Your motive for crime?

870
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,096
Why does that matter,

871
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,723
when they're all dead, anyway?

872
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,855
The motive for crime decides
the sentencing.

873
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,359
Whether the crime was planned
or impulsive is important, too.

874
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,986
Why do you think
the motive for crime doesn't matter?

875
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,196
Because…

876
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,866
everything's just an excuse.

877
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,952
Because they're all dead, anyway?

878
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,669
Let's stop here for today's interrogation.

879
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,314
This is the list of the deceased
that just got updated.

880
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,194
The remaining survivors are being treated
and recovering at the military hospital.

881
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,572
And Private Noh Tae-nam is there, too.

882
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,656
Noh Tae-nam is?

883
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,283
Yes.

884
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,327
Let's go.

885
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,833
ARMED FORCES CAPITAL HOSPITAL

886
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,212
You guys all understand
what I said, right?

887
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,673
The military prosecutors
will come to question us.

888
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,258
Gosh, to be blunt,

889
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:50,970
why should we lie for you, Sergeant Ma?

890
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,514
Then are you saying
that this is all my fault?

891
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,141
It is, isn't it?

892
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,685
It's true that you harassed
Pyeon every single day.

893
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:59,437
Don't put all the blame on me!

894
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,354
Didn't you do it?

895
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,274
What about you? And you?

896
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,359
You guys all turned a blind eye, too!

897
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:07,695
Hey.

898
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,114
What did we do wrong?

899
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:13,034
Gosh, we're the victims.
That crazy bastard Pyeon Sang-ho

900
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,119
tried to kill us all!

901
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,663
Hey, Noh Tae-nam.

902
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,582
You're going to cooperate, too, right?

903
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,459
Your mom is the Division Commander.

904
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,794
What will happen to your mom if you don't?

905
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,136
All of you, think wisely.

906
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,889
We didn't do anything.

907
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,391
If not, we'll be blamed
for everything, get it?

908
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,895
Mark my words.

909
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,189
Yes, sir.

910
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,863
Mr. Noh.

911
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:57,203
The X-files of the Patriotic Society.

912
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,790
If you didn't know, and if Division
Commander Noh doesn't have it too…

913
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,210
Noh Tae-nam?

914
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,798
He was IM's owner
after Cha Ho-chul died, so…

915
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,725
Mr. Noh. Please come outside for a moment.

916
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,107
Mr. Noh.

917
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,986
I was so relieved to hear
that you're at a hospital.

918
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,531
You have no idea

919
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,575
how anxious I was, because I was worried

920
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,494
that you might've been the shooter.

921
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,124
-Make way!
-An emergency patient!

922
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,792
-Move!
-Make way!

923
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,884
Mr. Noh, what's wrong?

924
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,095
Are you okay? Are you--

925
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,270
Noh Tae-nam.

926
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,864
Private Noh Tae-nam. Were you
close to Private First Class Pyeon?

927
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:57,823
Why are you here?

928
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,826
Since Yong Moon-goo is after
the X-files right now,

929
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,912
we need something big, too.

930
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:03,871
I think Noh Tae-nam

931
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,415
is showing signs of PTSD.

932
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,501
Discharge due to illness, because
of post-traumatic stress disorder?

933
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:12,671
I must get rid of Noh Hwa-young
by using this contract

934
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,257
-for new weapons.
-Help me.

935
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,093
That's the way for you to go back
to the old days, too.

936
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:20,679
Was there any form of cruelty
that took place in the GOP platoon

937
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,348
before the mass shooting occurred?

938
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:30,064
