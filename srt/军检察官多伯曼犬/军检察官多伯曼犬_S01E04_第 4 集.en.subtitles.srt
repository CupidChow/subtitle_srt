00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,451
Rape is unforgivable!

5
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,327
Korean conglomerates
must learn their lesson!

6
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,621
-Learn their lesson!
-Learn their lesson!

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,208
Noh Tae-nam, the criminal,
must go to prison, not the military!

8
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,127
To prison!

9
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,507
Rape is unforgivable!

10
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,634
Korean conglomerates
must learn their lesson!

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,428
You know, this is too short…

12
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,557
Noh Tae-nam, the criminal,
must go to prison, not the military!

13
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,477
Hey, you need to stop cutting my hair now.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,228
How much more are you going to cut?

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,065
Seriously…

16
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,696
Please don't cut my sideburns.

17
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,617
Mr. Noh of IM Defense Industry,
who is in custody

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,494
for the charge of raping a girl
at a club in Gangnam,

19
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,288
is enlisting in the army
through an army boot camp.

20
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,832
As Mr. Noh has enlisted,
this case had its jurisdiction

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,627
transferred from the civil court
to the military court,

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,046
hence his trial
will officially be a military trial.

23
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,680
Hey, take off now.

24
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,479
A FEW DAYS AGO.

25
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,486
The key is inside.

26
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,745
An arrest warrant for Noh Tae-nam is out.

27
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,998
It's thanks to the video evidence
of Se-na you provided us.

28
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,542
I see.

29
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,502
I'm counting on you, Detective Doh.

30
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,160
What brings you here at this hour?

31
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,328
An arrest warrant for Mr. Noh
has been issued.

32
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,581
What?

33
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,376
The police acquired video evidence.

34
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,818
Let go!

35
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,412
You there, stop.

36
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,165
Come here for a moment.

37
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,085
That bastard!

38
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,101
The car…

39
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,656
-Stop!
-Get that car!

40
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,797
Wow, the cops are chasing him fiercely.

41
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,131
What's going on?

42
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,219
That bastard is being chased by cops
when his discharge is coming up?

43
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,390
Just who did he meet
in Cartel to be in that?

44
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,977
Maybe he did something horrible
with that scary servicewoman.

45
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,895
But he ran away all by himself.

46
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,064
That military woman…

47
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,236
She's a rare type
I have never seen before.

48
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,199
What are you doing? Follow them! Hurry up!

49
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,200
Yes, boss.

50
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,582
Who the heck is that rude bastard?

51
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,587
Military woman!

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,091
Bang.

53
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,136
This is legit!

54
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,804
This is legit!

55
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,112
Damn!

56
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,823
NOW TRACKING DOWN THE TARGET

57
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,417
Damn it.

58
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,135
What the heck?

59
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,426
What?

60
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,220
What the heck?

61
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,180
Oblivion.

62
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,308
A function of the brain
that forgets something.

63
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,356
Some say oblivion is a blessing from god.

64
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,205
No matter what pain you experience,

65
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,749
we can live on, thanks to oblivion.

66
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,003
Without oblivion…

67
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,255
there's no present, either.

68
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,551
Cha Woo-in.

69
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,727
You cannot get discharged,
Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

70
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,315
You must stay here and fight alongside me.

71
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,569
Because that's your fate.

72
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,822
Fate…

73
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,408
I must fight alongside you?

74
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,835
But when the sweet oblivion ends
and realization begins,

75
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,632
when you have to face
the pain that was hidden in oblivion…

76
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,471
that's when hell begins.

77
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,420
Did you now realize
what you have forgotten all this time?

78
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,216
What I have forgotten?

79
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,802
What have I forgotten?

80
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,263
Cha Woo-in.

81
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,099
Why are you doing this to me?

82
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,732
MISSED CALLS:
YOON SANG-KI, MY AUNTIE

83
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,984
You're awake.

84
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,153
You shouldn't get up just yet.

85
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,821
How did I get here?

86
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,906
A woman brought you to the ER.

87
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,368
You just need to be hospitalized
and rest for a few days.

88
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,996
Your health is…
Wait. You shouldn't move.

89
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,539
I've got no time to do that.

90
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,427
Mirror.

91
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,104
I don't want to be here for a long time
so fix it and overturn it no matter what.

92
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,232
Turn things back
to before I got handcuffed.

93
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,903
I'll do something quickly, so you don't
stay in this shabby place for too long.

94
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,281
That military bastard Doh Bae-man
ran away all by himself?

95
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,493
How should I destroy that bastard?

96
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,746
Sir, please calm yourself
and think about it.

97
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,084
This situation is better than Doh Bae-man
getting caught there and spilling about

98
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,044
the conscription project for you.

99
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,921
That's true.

100
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,174
He ran away,
so he can survive all by himself,

101
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,343
so he would've spilled it
if he got caught.

102
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,389
That damn Doh Bae-man did it
because he had plans. Right?

103
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,520
By the way, why are you here alone?

104
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,687
Where's my mother?

105
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,898
She has no plans to visit you.

106
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,775
What?

107
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,820
She said that visiting a sex crime suspect

108
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,240
will only provide ammo to the reporters.

109
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,787
What kind of a mother
leaves her son alone like this?

110
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,708
Mr. Noh Tae-nam.

111
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,085
Let's go.

112
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,797
Hairspray.

113
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,929
Mirror.

114
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,397
CEO Noh Tae-nam of IM Defense Industry
and idol singer Alan

115
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,483
were arrested at a club in Gangnam
and were handed over to the prosecution.

116
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,695
They were arrested for the charge
of raping a female college student,

117
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,781
and based on the victim's
statement, the police…

118
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,368
That's too bright.

119
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,995
Why did you do that to the victim?

120
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,163
Is it true that you drugged her?

121
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,747
Don't you have anything to say
to your mother?

122
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,208
Mr. Noh, don't you think
you shamed your mother,

123
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,086
who is the first female
division commander? Please say a word.

124
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,507
The prosecution investigation
hasn't begun yet.

125
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,718
Please refrain from
asking sensitive questions.

126
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:45,097
On top of this incident, your bad behavior
has been widely known among reporters.

127
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,099
How do you feel? Do you think it's unfair?

128
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,685
What did you say,
you trashy reporter wench?

129
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,312
Hey!

130
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,315
Seriously, hey!

131
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,113
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

132
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,118
Why aren't you answering?

133
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,998
Are you feeling better?

134
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,006
You're one ridiculous bastard.

135
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,634
You almost killed me,
and took me to the hospital.

136
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,969
Are you messing with me?

137
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,723
I was worried, but I'm glad
that your injury wasn't serious.

138
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,351
Glad?

139
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,061
Glad?

140
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,855
Why aren't you wearing that red wig today?

141
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,566
It suits you better than your uniform.

142
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,989
I know you have a lot of questions.

143
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,575
Let's talk when you calm down.

144
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,789
Tell me.

145
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,124
Why did you try to kill me?

146
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,002
I didn't. I was only trying
to help you come to a realization.

147
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,547
Cut the crap and spill it now.

148
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,716
Or I'll throw you into jail
for attempted murder.

149
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,807
I will tell you everything
before you're discharged.

150
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,309
Because I'm waiting too.

151
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,394
What?

152
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,312
You're waiting?

153
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,440
I, too, am waiting for you

154
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,526
to be out of oblivion.

155
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,685
Prosecutor Doh. What in the world…

156
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,315
What if Prosecutor Cha Woo-in
finds out about this?

157
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,566
Cha Woo-in?

158
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
Don't even mention that name
in front of me.

159
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,908
Then I looked into this for nothing.

160
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,702
Looked into what?

161
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,497
You said we have to dig into Kang Ha-joon
to find out more about Prosecutor Cha.

162
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,875
And this will shock you.

163
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,967
Hello?

164
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,178
Mr. Noh will be released tomorrow.

165
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,474
That's good.

166
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,225
You've done so much.

167
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,352
That's why

168
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,520
I need someone to hold
the dog leash tomorrow.

169
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,981
The dog leash?

170
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,193
Doh Bae-man. You need to make up
for running away that day.

171
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,404
I'll see you tomorrow.

172
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,367
Was that Lawyer Yong?

173
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,204
Then Mr. Noh must be desperate to get you.

174
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,206
It's a relief that he's going
to be released, at least.

175
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,667
What are you going to do now?

176
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,127
You have to deal with Mr. Noh
and Prosecutor Cha too.

177
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,046
I have to resolve things one by one.

178
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,424
I should resolve
Mr. Noh's military service issue first…

179
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,347
and deal with Cha Woo-in, too.

180
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,018
Hey.

181
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,398
Hold still, will you?

182
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
Good boy, okay?

183
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,739
You're not supposed to spit
in the water you were drinking.

184
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,993
You stormed out,
saying you won't see me ever again,

185
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,578
but we meet again like this.

186
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,916
Bolt!

187
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,293
Bolt, I've missed you so much!

188
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,547
Bolt, I won't leave you, ever!

189
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,174
Sir.

190
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,802
You went through a lot.

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,891
I'm so ashamed.

192
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,487
How could you think of that
in that situation?

193
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,947
I was so impressed.

194
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,782
What?

195
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,870
You did that because you can't get me
exempt if you get caught there. Right?

196
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,498
Of course. Yes.

197
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,003
Thank you for understanding that.

198
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,671
I swear I will make…

199
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,009
your conscription project a success.

200
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,310
General Noh couldn't come
because of an important schedule.

201
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,065
What can be more important
than her son's release

202
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,816
after an unfair lockup?

203
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,610
She's meeting
her Korea Military Academy alumni.

204
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,781
An alumni homecoming…

205
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,657
Alan is still in custody.

206
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,576
The reason why only you got released

207
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,204
was thanks to General Noh
running all over the place.

208
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,663
She did all of it for her son.

209
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,791
I'm sure she did all of it for herself.

210
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,636
Hey, open the door!

211
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,221
Yes, sir.

212
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,913
Now then, get some good rest today.

213
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,086
I came up with an idea
in there, so listen.

214
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,589
You know, there are countries
like Cuba or Uruguay.

215
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,883
You know, countries without
criminal extradition.

216
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,886
I was thinking of going to countries
like that for a few years.

217
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,640
Your confinement warrant
was dismissed at an examination,

218
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,725
but you're banned
from leaving the country.

219
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,646
Then tell me what the plan is.
I'm about to lose my temper.

220
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,648
According to Article 61
of the Military Service Act

221
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,775
and Article 129 of the Enforcement Decree
of the Military Service Act,

222
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,529
you have an inevitable reason,
so you can postpone your enlistment.

223
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,282
And?

224
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,284
Postpone your enlistment,

225
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,788
go through the course I set
during your trial and get exempt.

226
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,042
Your crime is serious

227
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,212
and there's clear evidence,
so it will be hard to avoid punishment.

228
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,050
Sir.

229
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,511
Do you really hate the military
more than prison?

230
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,015
The lockup you were in for a few days
and prison are very different.

231
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,643
So what are you trying to say?

232
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,895
Do your military service.

233
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,690
Taking refuge in the military
is the best and only way, sir.

234
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,693
What? You call that a plan?

235
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,821
A military trial
is not to be taken lightly.

236
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,745
Even if we take this case
to the military court,

237
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,122
there's no guarantee
that you'll avoid punishment.

238
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,084
See? Military Prosecutor Doh
says it's hard.

239
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,214
Then let me ask one thing.

240
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,592
From the military prosecutor
who prosecutes you,

241
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,719
the military judge
who sentences the verdict,

242
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,013
and the soldiers
who guard the military court.

243
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,475
If the court is only filled with people
who are General Noh's subordinates,

244
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,477
will it still be a difficult trial?

245
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,274
You're a military prosecutor,
so you should know.

246
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,109
-That's…
-Come on.

247
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,987
Hey, Doh Bae-man.
Why are you suddenly speechless?

248
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,742
This matter should be
between me, you, and General Noh.

249
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,161
It's not something Bae-man
should just get involved in.

250
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,039
So you're saying

251
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,751
the military prosecutor,
attorney, and the judge

252
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,171
will all follow my mother's orders, right?

253
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,340
Because in the military,
everyone must obey the higher-ups?

254
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes, sir.

255
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,343
That is the point.

256
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,782
It seems like Mr. Noh
has almost made up his mind to enlist.

257
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,076
Well done, Lawyer Yong.

258
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,829
To Division Commander Noh Hwa-young!

259
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,372
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

260
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,423
Thank you, everyone.

261
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,508
No, we thank you.

262
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,012
You're the first division commander
in our group of entry.

263
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,223
That's Noh Hwa-young. Isn't that right?

264
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:53,478
The commander of the fourth division is
a shortcut to becoming a corps commander.

265
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,438
We all know that.

266
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,649
Of course. That's number one on the list
of the next corps commander.

267
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,610
A corps commander among us!

268
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,030
Stop! Everyone stop!

269
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,156
Everyone stop!

270
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,325
Salute!

271
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,660
Corps Commander, we're at your service!

272
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,996
-Hey, you're overdoing it.
-Hey!

273
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,497
Sit.

274
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,249
He's doing that again.

275
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,209
Seeing you guys after so long
makes liquor taste better.

276
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,172
Kang-in, I'll fill your glass too.

277
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,550
I drank too much already.

278
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,011
Fill the other guys' glasses.

279
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,931
Hey, just sit still and drink calmly.

280
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,974
Hey.

281
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,437
Let's try to keep the pace a bit, okay?

282
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,858
I know the rank is absolute,

283
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,234
but saluting

284
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,320
to an academy colleague,

285
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,239
especially a woman

286
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,534
isn't very pleasant as servicepeople.

287
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,455
Hey, don't you guys think so?

288
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,042
If you don't, never mind.

289
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,130
I need to go pee.

290
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,550
You are a bunch of idiots.

291
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,601
He's continued to fail
at being promoted, and he got grumpy.

292
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,187
Hwa-young, you should understand.

293
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,817
People can endure hunger, but they
can't endure stomachaches of jealousy.

294
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,568
That's right.

295
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,822
What a loser.

296
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,074
-Have a drink.
-Sure.

297
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,702
A wench who can't even control her son's
behavior is a division commander?

298
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,872
That's so absurd.

299
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,876
I'm actually worried that Hwa-young's path
to success might be ruined

300
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,419
because of that son of hers.

301
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,674
She can't even shoot, and she
always rants about military spirit.

302
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,552
She's ridiculous.

303
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,471
Hey, stop saying that, will you?

304
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,473
Don't you know about her shooting skills?

305
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,684
Hey.

306
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,813
How can she be
a serviceperson without this?

307
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,108
That pisses me off so much.

308
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,070
Why is Noh Hwa-young going so fast?

309
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,867
Did she lobby the higher-ups?

310
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,829
Right. That's it.

311
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,916
She got that position
because she's a woman.

312
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,673
You think I became a division commander
because I'm a woman?

313
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,051
How dare you come in here!

314
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,387
This place is only for men!
The manliest of men!

315
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,348
-It's the same for the military too!
-Mark my words.

316
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,227
There's no women or men in the military.
There are only servicepeople.

317
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,355
You pathetic, unworthy "man".

318
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,026
I've been going easy on you
because you're a woman!

319
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,614
Noh Hwa-young, you!

320
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,490
-Hwa-young, stop!
-You stay out of this.

321
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,914
Do you want me to tell you
why I am above you?

322
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,874
It's simple.

323
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,418
It's because I'm a stronger
serviceperson than you.

324
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,845
This is where
your crap-filled head belongs.

325
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,807
If you want to make a living
as a serviceperson, bow your head to me.

326
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,602
Say your official rank and name
to me properly from now on.

327
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,271
And if you dare to run your mouth again,

328
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,816
I'll drill a hole in here.

329
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,075
Hey, are you okay?

KANG HA-JOON'S INTERVIEW VIDEO

331
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,757
When was an important turning point

332
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,094
in your life, if you've had any?

333
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,763
When I was studying abroad in the U.S.,

334
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,599
I wanted to make money
for my business fund quickly,

335
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,559
so I did something bad.

336
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,270
That ended up swallowing me up.

337
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,982
And something happened,
which was like fate,

338
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,567
and that chance totally changed my life.

339
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,863
And is that chance IM Defense Industry,
by any chance?

340
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,784
I heard that Kang's Solution
was able to get started thanks to

341
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,160
IM Defense Industry's investment.

342
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,704
Yes.

343
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,289
Everything I have achieved

344
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,374
is all thanks to CEO Cha Ho-chul.

345
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,419
He's not by my side anymore,

346
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,046
but I will repay him
for the rest of my life.

347
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,049
IM Defense Industry.

348
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,467
CEO Cha Ho-chul.

TENS OF BILLIONS IN KANG'S SOLUTION

352
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,568
Mr. Cha… I miss him a lot more today.

353
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,112
I think of him a lot more too.

354
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,781
He must've seen us taking care
of that garbage too, right?

355
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,617
Cha Woo-in's father is…

356
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,287
CEO Cha Ho-chul?

357
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,593
DOH BAE-MAN

358
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,726
-Yes, Prosecutor Doh.
-Come to the interrogation room now.

359
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,686
Yes, sir.

360
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,102
It's not bad seeing you in here,
face-to-face.

361
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,523
Today, I just want to know

362
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,401
what the truth is more than anything else.

363
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,320
-I don't have any other motive.
-That's fine with me.

364
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,911
I thought you were avenging
on Han Se-na's behalf at first.

365
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,914
I thought that was why you kidnapped Alan
and released the video.

366
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,501
But that was just what the case
looked like on the outside.

367
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,294
The real reason was something else.

368
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,881
Your target was Noh Tae-nam,

369
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,591
not Alan.

370
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,093
Do you have grounds for that?

371
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,725
Do you think I don't?

372
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,310
Cha Woo-in, you're…

373
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,898
the daughter of CEO Cha Ho-chul
of IM Defense Industry.

374
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,574
CEO CHA HO-CHUL

375
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,326
It was revenge on Noh Tae-nam,
who framed your father

376
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,620
for leaking military secrets
and embezzlement,

377
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,165
and manipulated the market price
to take his company…

378
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,918
and killed your father

379
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,796
in a murder fabricated as an accident.

380
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,341
If the verdict changes
just because he's rich,

381
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,428
then the law, which should be fair
to everyone, becomes useless.

382
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,763
We, the prosecution,

383
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,141
promise that we will strictly punish
Cha Ho-chul, the defendant,

384
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,602
for deepening the people's
distrust in the law.

385
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,688
I'm sure Yong Moon-goo
is on your revenge list too.

386
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,274
That's why you wiretapped
and monitored everything I did.

387
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,743
PLEASE CHECK IF THERE
ARE ANY WIRETAPPING DEVICES

388
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,660
What?

389
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,501
I did wiretap you with that,
but I didn't hear anything.

390
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,794
I know you won't believe it though.

391
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,961
That doesn't matter to me.

392
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,425
Cha Woo-in.

393
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,094
Why did you become a military prosecutor
out of all things?

394
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,057
So this is how it feels
to be interrogated.

395
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,600
What's your real reason
for joining the military?

396
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:15,104
It looks like
you haven't figured that out yet.

397
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,150
You said that only military prosecutors

398
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,028
can make criminals
in military uniforms stand trial

399
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,988
at Division Commander Noh's inauguration.

400
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,115
So you called to provoke me

401
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,910
because you don't have grounds
to be convinced yet.

402
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,954
-Answer me.
-That's right.

403
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,121
General Noh Hwa-young.

404
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,710
Because Noh Hwa-young is
the actual owner of IM Defense Industry.

405
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,637
Hey, Cha Woo-in.

406
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,600
I don't want to be involved
in your personal grudge at all.

407
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,812
Because you'll be working
for Mr. Noh when you get discharged?

408
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,980
Yes.

409
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,524
You'll have to fight against me then.

410
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,692
Keep that in mind.

411
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,699
Since you found
all of the answers about me,

412
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,661
now it's time for you
to find answers about yourself.

413
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,288
Answers about myself?

414
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,335
Because if I tell you,
you won't believe me.

415
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,256
You found out everything yourself.

416
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,425
You will find out

417
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,679
why we must fight alongside each other.

418
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,006
NOW BEING TEST-DRIVEN
FOR AUTOMATED DRIVING

419
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,146
When in battle
or getting rid of dangerous explosives,

420
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,982
military cars can be
controlled remotely from outside,

421
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,318
so the safety of soldiers is guaranteed.

422
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,403
It's all thanks
to this car controlling chip.

423
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,406
I owe a lot to so many people
for this chip to be completed.

424
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,535
Sir, we're thinking of a remote
detonation test on an actual road.

425
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,662
When should we do it?

426
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,372
We did that already.

427
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,832
-What?
-It exceeded expectations.

428
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,687
Doh Bae-man found out about everything.

429
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,357
About who my father is, who I am…

430
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,069
And about Yong Moon-goo and Noh Hwa-young
being behind your father's death too?

431
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,363
Yes.

432
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,784
What will Doh Bae-man do?

433
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,078
Will he do everything as we expect him to?

434
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,080
Since he heard everything from me,

435
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,625
he can never go back
to where he was before that.

436
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,491
I, too, am waiting for you

437
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,286
to be out of oblivion.

438
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,593
Here. I focused on quantity
more than taste.

439
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,263
Congratulations on your discharge.

440
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,931
You worked so hard
for the past five years.

441
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,185
You're busy these days too, right?

442
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,438
Because of that jerk
named Noh Tae-nam, or whatever.

443
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,941
Those bastards,
whenever I think of those guys…

444
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,444
I'll put them all in prison.

445
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,199
The world will be a much better place
if all men in the world are like you.

446
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,036
Here, go ahead.

447
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,330
Thanks.

448
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,336
When you did a press conference
for that "Imperial Military Service",

449
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,420
you were so awesome.

450
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,881
I couldn't believe
that you were my nephew.

451
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,717
I also thought of your parents too.

452
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,679
I wish you could keep working
as a military prosecutor,

453
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,223
but that's just my greed.

454
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,726
Bae-man,

455
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,604
you're the shining sun in my life.

456
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,649
Okay.

457
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,858
Let's eat.

458
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,823
Auntie.

459
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,992
About Mom and Dad's accident…

460
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,035
Yes?

461
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,746
Can you get me the investigation materials
from back then?

462
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,125
Will it be hard
because your station isn't in charge?

463
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,418
I actually looked for it before,

464
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,088
but the material isn't being kept
by the police at all.

465
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,423
The case was transferred
to a military investigation team.

466
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,135
It was transferred to the military?

467
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,263
Yes, the driver who caused the accident
was a serviceperson.

468
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,306
A serviceperson?

469
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,560
Do you remember which base took the case?

470
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,855
I don't remember which base it was.

471
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,776
But I think I kept the business card
of the military investigator in charge.

472
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,258
YOO JUNG-YEON

473
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,557
YEOM SANG-JIN

474
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,147
MILITARY PROSECUTION INVESTIGATOR STAFF
SERGEANT YEOM SANG-JIN

475
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,538
CEO Cha Ho-chul?

476
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,542
CEO

477
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,711
What should we do? It's the CEO.

478
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,882
Turn the phone off for now.

479
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,768
CEO

480
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,817
CEO

481
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,575
Then the person who called us
that day was…

482
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,036
CEO Cha Ho-chul?

483
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,876
You're working so hard.

484
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,050
Thank you.

485
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,600
After Noh Tae-nam and Alan
both got arrested,

486
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,936
I could finally sleep
without sleeping pills, but…

487
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,481
Woo-in, how can the law be like this?

488
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,817
How can Noh Tae-nam be released?

489
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,321
Se-na.

490
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,449
I know it will be hard,
but please give me some more time.

491
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,410
You're going to help me
until the end, right?

492
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,663
I provided that video to the police.

493
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,833
I'm not helping you anymore.
It's my matter now.

494
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,418
Woo-in…

495
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,593
It was too hectic then, so I couldn't ask

496
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,514
but you decided to provide the video
because of Lawyer Yong Moon-goo?

497
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,391
Yes.

498
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,852
I couldn't stand it anymore

499
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,480
because he was even threatening
my mom to blackmail me.

500
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,067
Your mother is up to you.

501
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm sure that wasn't blackmailing.

502
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,240
What?

503
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,160
That's not the way
Yong Moon-goo blackmails.

504
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,495
Perhaps…

505
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,664
he was provoking you.

506
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,601
He used Se-na

507
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,646
so the video will be made
known to the world

508
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,481
and Noh Tae-nam will get arrested.

509
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,120
58TH DIVISION
GENERAL PROSECUTION DEPARTMENT

510
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,212
Military Prosecutor, what should we do?

511
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,256
The case file you asked for
does not exist.

512
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,509
There was an incineration order,
so it was all destroyed.

513
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,387
-It was all destroyed?
-Yes, that's right.

514
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,433
Then when will
Chief Yeom Sang-jin be here?

515
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,062
He's here.

516
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,567
Chief Yeom, this Military Prosecutor
has been waiting for you.

517
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,651
What?

518
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,490
I'm Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man
from the fourth division.

519
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:52,992
Hi.

520
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,453
By the way, what brings you here?

521
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,669
This is my old business card.

522
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,088
I'm sorry for coming here
without letting you know.

523
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,925
I heard you were in charge
of investigating my parents' case.

524
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,677
Can I ask you a few questions?

525
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,390
Follow me, then, please.

526
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
Yes, sir.

527
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,024
Thank you.

528
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,277
I'll be discharged in a few days.

529
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,737
You can tell me anything.

530
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,031
But still…

531
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,741
It's okay.

532
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,750
Both of your parents
were competent prosecution investigators

533
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,002
in the law office.

534
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,254
And I was their successor.

535
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,964
I see.

536
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,220
But I heard that the materials
on my parents' case were all incinerated.

537
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,973
Well, that doesn't happen often,
but that's not weird either.

538
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,518
Because it's the military.

539
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,853
Was there anything notable about the case?

540
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,067
Why are you looking at me like that?

541
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,235
How much…

542
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,612
do you remember about that incident?

543
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,697
You mean, the actual accident?

544
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,119
I remember that there was an accident
and the car flipped over.

545
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,204
And?

546
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,916
-What about after that?
-I think I woke up at the hospital.

547
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,295
So you remember nothing.

548
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,090
By any chance,

549
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,468
does that mean
that case was not an accident?

550
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,808
Sometimes memories can be toxic.

551
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,395
It may be a good thing for you.

552
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,731
This is all I can tell you.

553
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,402
Chief Yeom!

554
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,288
Something that I cannot remember…

555
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,915
What could that be?

556
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,213
CEO NOH TAE-NAM

557
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,302
You will be conscripted to the division
where General Noh is stationed.

558
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,304
Then what about my company while I'm gone?

559
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,265
If you really care about the company,

560
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,766
you should do
your military service even more.

561
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,727
What?

562
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,855
Stock prices have dropped
because of that video,

563
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,523
but it's recovering
after you were confined.

564
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,569
Once you begin your service,
the company will be stable again.

565
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,155
Because it will
get rid of the owner's risk.

566
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,532
But Mother, IM is my everything.

567
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,700
Don't delude yourself.

568
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,038
You got the position of CEO
simply because you're my son.

569
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,207
Any bastard who puts the company at risk

570
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,543
should be removed immediately,
whoever that is.

571
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,255
Mother.

572
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,476
What should we do
with the video the police acquired?

573
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,561
Leave it be.

574
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,313
Is that going to be okay?

575
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,733
Let the video be the issue
and send Tae-nam to the military.

576
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,569
No matter how much he struggles
to evade his military service,

577
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,987
when he faces it,

578
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,115
he won't be able to say that
he hates the military more than prison.

579
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,204
Yes, I will do as you command.

580
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,207
Lawyer Yong.

581
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,501
Yes, General.

582
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,339
When Tae-nam begins his service,
you'll be in charge of IM for a while.

583
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,176
Yes, ma'am.

584
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,668
It's been decided that
Mr. Noh will do his military service.

585
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,717
He never had a choice from the get-go.

586
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,387
And I bet everything on

587
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,807
his conscription project
without knowing that.

588
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,394
You knew everything,
but you acted like you didn't know.

589
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,689
Well, the video thing
was something I didn't expect either.

590
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,607
Practically, you reaped what you sowed.

591
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,444
It's so much for all my plans after all.

592
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,656
And you showed your true colors yourself,
so that was a gain for me.

593
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,456
I'm sorry,

594
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,542
but you lost everything
because you betrayed me.

595
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,296
I lost all connections and ties with you.

596
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,840
But for some reason, I feel very relieved.

597
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,177
I'll start over from the very bottom.

598
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,763
It's really goodbye this time.

599
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:23,155
FORGET-ME-NOT COFFEE SHOP

600
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,244
OPEN

601
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,121
CLOSED

602
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,249
-Madam, I'm here.
-Welcome.

603
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,544
You're early.

604
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,797
Thank you.

605
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,884
Thank you, Madam.

606
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
Anytime.

607
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,602
So the video being released to the world
might have been Yong Moon-goo's scheme?

608
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,520
Yes.

609
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,231
I had a hunch after seeing Se-na.

610
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,401
Noh Hwa-young gave orders,
and Yong Moon-goo carried it out.

611
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,903
That can't be.

612
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,782
Because she's never shaken
by any emergency,

613
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,410
and she turns the situation toward a way
that would be advantageous to her.

614
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,374
Yong Moon-goo must be doing
a press conference now.

615
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,923
Some doubt that his enlistment
is for an escape to avoid the trial,

616
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,716
but that's not true at all.

617
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,636
Mr. Noh was already notified
of his enlistment date

618
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,305
from the Military Manpower Administration
a month ago,

619
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,809
and he was adjusting the date
to carry out his military duty diligently.

620
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,728
Mr. Noh decided to resign

621
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,940
from all his positions related to
IM Defense Industry as of today.

622
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,484
But resigning from the CEO position
does not mean that

623
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,528
he is admitting his guilt in this case.

624
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,113
This should be made clear.

625
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,491
It was decided that postponing
the holy duty of national defense,

626
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,993
which all men
of the Republic of Korea must serve,

627
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:55,789
just because of the trial is wrong,
therefore he decided to enlist.

628
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,418
I hereby inform you that Mr. Noh
will diligently be in the military trial

629
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,296
and continue to fight to reveal the truth.

630
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,547
Good grief.

631
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,090
What happens to the CEO position

632
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,718
-of IM Defense Industry then?
-They truly are amazing.

633
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,261
Those born with silver spoons.

634
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:13,765
There will be an official announcement
by the company about that matter soon.

635
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,524
Yong Moon-goo will take over
the vacant position of the CEO.

636
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,068
Woo-in, your expectation was right.

637
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,155
She trusts her right-hand man
more than her own son?

638
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,407
They're just shells, anyway.

639
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,285
Both Noh Tae-nam and Yong Moon-goo

640
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,163
are just sitting in that position
in Noh Hwa-young's place.

641
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,124
She will never take
her military uniform off.

642
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,127
The money she makes
through IM Defense Industry

643
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,880
is just a weapon for her
to live as a serviceperson.

644
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:53,430
But there's someone else besides me
who's trying to help you by your side.

645
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,185
CHIEF YEOM SANG-JIN

646
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,485
Yes, Chief Yeom.

647
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,368
Bae-man came to see me.

648
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,621
I'm sure he asked about his parents' case.

649
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,292
And he couldn't remember
the most important part.

650
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,337
Noh Tae-nam will enlist tomorrow,

651
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,382
and Prosecutor Doh
will be discharged tomorrow.

652
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,133
On the same day?

653
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,804
That's pretty nasty for a coincidence.

654
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,140
I actually want to tell Bae-man

655
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,142
everything if I can.

656
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,143
No.

657
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,356
Even if it takes time,
Prosecutor Doh must remember it himself.

658
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,655
If he's ready to accept the truth,
he will come to see you again.

659
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,074
That will be the beginning.

660
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,534
Do you think Bae-man

661
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,911
will come see me again?

662
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,836
The mask is the best UV ray blocker.

663
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,130
I need to take it.

664
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,635
What else should I take?

665
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,220
Right, this is for Bolt.

666
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,519
You must come with me, right?

667
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,607
-You're here.
-Yes.

668
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,369
Sir.

669
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,539
None of these are allowed in boot camp.

670
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,544
Once you enter boot camp, everything
you took will be sent to your house.

671
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,300
You know that I cannot live
without any one of these.

672
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,763
Bolt can't pee or poo without this.

673
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,223
Bolt cannot enter boot camp with you.

674
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,142
He can stay in my room.

675
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,936
You're enlisting.
You're not going on a trip.

676
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,355
Trainees do not get their own rooms.

677
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,651
I don't get my own room?

678
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,653
Then where can I take a shower?

679
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,448
You must live as a part of the group
at boot camp.

680
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,328
LIVE AS A PART OF THE GROUP

681
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,539
How am I supposed to even live there?

682
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,794
It makes no sense

683
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:34,007
that I will eat and sleep
in the same space with those commoners.

684
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,304
I never even thought that I am going
to serve in the military, not even once.

685
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:40,782
CONGRATULATIONS ON
CAPTAIN DOH BAE-MAN'S DISCHARGE

686
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,617
CONGRATULATIONS ON ENLISTING
IN THE NEW RECRUIT TRAINING CAMP

687
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,703
Goodbye.

688
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,080
I'm on my way.

689
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,761
Salute!

690
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,975
I, Captain Doh Bae-man,
have been ordered to be discharged

691
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,602
as of November 20, 2021.

692
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,562
I hereby report my discharge!

693
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,480
Salute!

694
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,171
Doh Bae-man.

695
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,007
Do you think

696
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,010
you deserve to be saluted by me?

697
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,409
It will be hard for a while, sir.

698
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,869
You can hug him before you go…

699
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,537
Just go.

700
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,791
I can't go in there if I see Bolt.

701
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,545
My mother isn't here, is she?

702
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,758
You have me, sir.

703
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,551
So don't worry…

704
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,347
Bolt.

705
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,517
You're the only family I have.
You know that, right?

706
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,603
Because you're always on my side.

707
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,451
You, a military prosecutor,
tried to be a broker for money?

708
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,704
How can you call yourself
a military prosecutor?

709
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,665
You're a disgrace
to all servicepeople of Korea.

710
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,250
You wretched little worm.

711
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,300
Watch your language, please.

712
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,095
You bastard!

713
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,974
As soon as I get out of here,

714
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,851
I'm a civilian.

715
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,937
I'm not your subordinate anymore.

716
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,495
Get lost.

717
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,415
Don't you ever come near
the military base again!

718
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,936
Salute!

719
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,193
Salute!

720
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,492
Salute!

721
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,053
A MONTH AFTER

722
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,296
All rise!

723
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,010
Division Commander is coming!

724
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,495
All be seated!

725
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:01,686
The military trial of Trainee Noh Tae-nam,
the defendant, will now begin.

726
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,481
First, Trainee Noh Tae-nam, the defendant…

727
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,302
Memories are shards.

728
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,472
Someone has one shard of my memory,

729
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,516
which I have lost.

730
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,188
The memory only got shattered
for a moment.

731
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,232
It did not disappear.

732
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,984
Mom…

733
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,403
Open your eyes…

734
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,405
Mom…

735
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,908
Mom, open your eyes…

736
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,702
Open your eyes!

737
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,368
Oblivion, which was told
to be a gift from god,

738
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,120
was a punishment for me.

739
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,581
NOH HWA-YOUNG

740
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,333
The face that was hidden
under the military cap.

741
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,294
The name.

742
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,796
And that smile.

743
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,924
It took 20 years
for me to remember all of those.

744
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,425
I will be your loyal hound dog.

745
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,260
Cha Woo-in.

746
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,989
Doh Bae-man, the person
who has the same fate as I do.

747
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,700
I need you no matter what,
Military Prosecutor Doh.

748
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,577
I don't want to be stopped

749
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,663
by an unclear past.

750
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,498
Your first client is waiting.

751
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,957
If you're not here as a client,

752
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,043
-we have nothing to talk about.
-There was an accident.

753
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,046
Hey, you were forced to come here too.
How dare you give me orders!

754
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,090
About that military prosecutor brat…

755
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,008
I got a bad feeling about him.

756
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,386
From now on, I'll be your hound dog.

757
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,181
A Doberman, which does not let go
once it bites.

758
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:33,439
