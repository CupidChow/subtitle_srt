1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,067
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,193
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,278
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,783
Have you heard
of an offer you can't refuse?

7
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,499
An offer I can't refuse?

8
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,377
Don't play with words.

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,213
This is practically a threat.

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,923
Just get lost.

11
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,426
Isn't it ironic?

12
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,054
If it wasn't for Cha Woo-in,

13
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,806
your company
wouldn't have grown this much.

14
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,394
But now, your company is
in a mess because of Cha Woo-in.

15
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,939
Are you saying
that my company became your prey

16
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,567
because of Woo-in?

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,155
Like CEO Cha Ho-chul gave you a chance,
I will give you a chance this time.

18
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,494
If you don't join me,
Kang's Solution will disappear like dust.

19
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,497
Think about your employees,

20
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,625
who devoted themselves
to you and your company.

21
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,711
You did enough for the Cha family already.

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,175
I'll wait for your answer.

23
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,058
Leave the war
to those servicepeople jerks.

24
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,646
Entrepreneurs like us
should make money even during war.

25
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,204
Corps Commander,
I'll be at your residence soon.

26
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,872
The trial's around the corner,

27
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,416
so we must do a final check.

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,338
You went through a lot being questioned.

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,881
Captain.

30
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,304
Is there any person to testify
other than me?

31
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,598
Not yet.

32
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,227
There's one person left,
but we can't reach him.

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,105
So I'm the only one
that's going to testify?

34
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,861
Are you sure we can win this trial?

35
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,446
We're fighting against
Corps Commander Hong.

36
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,910
If we don't give up,
then we can win for sure.

37
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,499
I'm even more afraid
after starting the fight.

38
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,087
Will we be able to really fight
against the Corps Commander?

39
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:55,925
Staff Sergeant Shin.

40
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,095
Is there something
other than the power tripping?

41
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,766
It can be anything, so tell me everything.

42
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,270
There's something I couldn't say…

43
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,817
because I was too scared.

44
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,368
DOH BAE-MAN

45
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,208
Yes, Prosecutor Doh.

46
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,672
Yes, I'll be there soon.

47
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,097
Welcome.

48
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,141
-Have a seat.
-Yes, Corps Commander.

49
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,235
Like I said before, your charges
related to power tripping are--

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,198
Can't you use some other word
rather than "power tripping"?

51
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,367
The people hate that word,

52
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,120
and more than anything else,
we never did any power tripping.

53
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,247
Of course not.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,082
My mighty older brother is here,

55
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,167
so how would I dare do such a thing?

56
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,797
All right.

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,092
If we defend it in relation to duty,
there will be no problems.

58
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,843
And for the other charges--

59
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,638
We just need to prove
that they weren't forced.

60
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,976
Then lastly,

61
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,604
is there anything else
I must prepare for the trial?

62
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,855
Prepare?

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,984
I'm asking if you have
any more charges I don't know about.

64
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,694
Charges?

65
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,987
Lawyer Yong.

66
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,198
Choose your words wisely.

67
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,909
I don't.

68
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,202
Are you sure?

69
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,790
Even if there's more,
you should prove my innocence, right?

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,960
Okay, for now.

71
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,297
I won't ask any more difficult questions.

72
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,716
With your experience as a lawyer

73
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,136
and my sturdy connections in the military,

74
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,347
we will never lose this trial, right?

75
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,598
Of course not.

76
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,976
I will give everything I've got
for this trial.

77
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,937
I only thought of you as one
of Division Commander Noh's people,

78
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,482
but I changed my mind
after working with you recently.

79
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,609
You saw it correctly.

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,946
I will make sure you don't face
any damages by this case.

81
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,491
Just get ready
to become the Chief of Staff.

82
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,036
Well, then.

83
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,750
CLOSED

84
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,836
Hi.

85
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,006
I'm Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in.

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,259
This is Prosecutor Cha
I told you about earlier.

87
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,095
Now, tell us.

88
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,063
It's okay, so take your time and tell us.

89
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,202
We need to know in order to help you.

90
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,706
And please trust Prosecutor Doh
for this trial.

91
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,720
GENERAL HONG

92
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,427
Get up, you bastard!

93
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,891
Are you saying…

94
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,978
you were continuously assaulted like that?

95
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,982
When did the assault start?

96
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,693
It was a month after…

97
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,821
I started working at the residence.

98
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,991
It happened…

99
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,995
every Sunday at midnight.

100
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,963
Do it right!

101
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
Such a violent assault.

102
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,099
We must make…

103
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,644
Hong Moo-seob pay for his crimes.

104
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,522
I will prepare
related medical certificates immediately.

105
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,858
What about the other witness?

106
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,903
I'll go meet him in person.

107
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,239
Because this soldier is
the only witness left for us.

108
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,333
Name, Han Sam-soo.
Position, driver soldier.

109
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,835
He was discharged nine months ago.

110
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,587
He was a driver for Corps Commander

111
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,381
but was suddenly transferred
to a front-line artillery base.

112
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,636
The Corps Commander's driver
held artillery, not a steering wheel?

113
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,890
This is obviously a transfer
for the purpose of punishment.

114
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,942
Hi…

115
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,695
We're from an office of justice
of the army.

116
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,531
Are you Mr. Han Sam-soo?

117
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,076
An office of justice of the army?
What do you want from me?

118
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,079
You worked at Corps Commander
Hong Moo-seob's residence, right?

119
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,712
We need your testimony,
so we're here to see you.

120
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,630
Testimony?

121
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,258
Yo, law servicepeople?

122
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,719
I don't know, I'm a civilian now
Forget it, I've got nothing to say

123
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,473
You guys don't have the right to say this
You have nothing

124
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,767
Wait, we… What the?

125
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,852
Mr. Han Sam-soo, we need to talk…

126
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,730
Hey, Han Sam-soo!

127
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,985
You're a sniper of hip hop, you

128
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,116
I know what you went through
At the residence, yo

129
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,534
What do you know?

130
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,619
What do you know? What?
What I went through?

131
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,496
I don't know
I've always been alone

132
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,498
I ripped up what I was wearing
My uniform in military colors

133
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,588
Even after you left the residence
More soldiers continued to suffer

134
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,923
The non-commissioned officers
Are still suffering there

135
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,302
It's time for you to show
That hip hop spirit of yours

136
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,055
For all the cruelty you suffered
We will help you get paid

137
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,391
Hip hop spirit?
Shut the hell up, that's BS.

138
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,517
All the cruelty I suffered? Crap

139
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,935
I don't need anything

140
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,146
I won't go back to those 18 months again

141
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,773
The military never changes, so just leave

142
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,318
The world has changed, like autumn leaves

143
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,779
So just go and tell us about your pain

144
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,990
So the whole world
Will learn about your pain

145
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,159
Don't keep it to yourself

146
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,037
Even if you can't
Completely change the military

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,043
You can bring some changes
To the military, yes!

148
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,548
Mr. Han Sam-soo, that's enough of this.

149
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,468
Just come with us.

150
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,160
By the way,

151
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,623
-does that bastard Sergeant Ma like men?
-No.

152
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,541
He said he has a girlfriend.

153
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,542
Why?

154
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,879
Then, why were you two…

155
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,263
in the same sleeping bag a few days ago?

156
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,852
Don't ever ask that question again.

157
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,314
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,484
Ma is going to be discharged soon.

159
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,611
I just need to put up with it until then.

160
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,905
I will put up with it.

161
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,699
Put up with it?
Why on earth are you putting up with that?

162
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,410
I told you not to ask that again.

163
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,040
In the military,
most problems have solutions.

164
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,876
When you're sick,
you go to the medical office,

165
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,878
and when you're hungry, you go eat.

166
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,964
But there's one thing…

167
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,967
that doesn't have any solutions.

168
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,719
What is that one thing?

169
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,307
Later. I'll tell you later.

170
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,195
Sergeant Ahn is
being nice to you, at least.

171
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,575
Yes, but not nicer than you.

172
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,577
Sergeant Ahn

173
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,165
doesn't ask for privileges,
though he did "Imperial Service" before.

174
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,752
"Imperial Service"?

175
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,713
Yes. Didn't you know?

176
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,423
He's as famous as you are.

177
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,842
He's the son of Gusan Bank's president.

178
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,015
That bank president's son

179
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,516
must feel so wronged right now.

180
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,895
He's innocent, but you guys
sent him to military prison.

181
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,503
What's wrong?

182
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,214
Did you do something wrong to me?

183
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,424
No, sir.

184
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,968
-What breed is this dog?
-He's a Doh Bae-man.

185
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,513
Doh Bae-man?

186
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,098
No, a Doberman.

187
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,186
What's his name?

188
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,521
His name is Bolt.

189
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,563
What a cool name.

190
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,611
Hey.

191
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,780
This is a necessity.

192
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,366
Put it on secretly.

193
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,912
No, it's okay, sir.
You put it on yourself, Sergeant Ahn.

194
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,289
No?

195
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,999
No, thank you, sir.

196
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,428
The trial for Hong Moo-seob,
Commander of the IV Corps,

197
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,556
who's been indicted for power tripping,

198
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,101
will be held at the General Court
of the Armed Forces this afternoon.

199
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,103
By the special order of Minister
of the National defense,

200
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,313
a joint investigation team
has been formed,

201
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,608
and Commander Hong's younger sister,
who's been summoned as a suspect,

202
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,070
is going to be questioned
at the same time.

203
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,240
Commander Hong Moo-seob!
A few words about how you fee, please!

204
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,745
The court is a place not only
for punishing someone,

205
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,914
but also for revealing the truth.

206
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,793
I hope that the non-commissioned officer
who worked at my residence

207
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,588
does not get heartbroken
through this trial,

208
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,090
and I, too, will clear
the misunderstandings

209
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,050
and recover my tarnished honor.

210
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,635
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

211
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,555
Don't you have anything
to say to the victims?

212
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,613
This is my wife.

213
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,239
Say hi.

214
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,992
Hi, Military Prosecutors.

215
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,577
I'm glad that you're here.

216
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,412
I'm counting on you.

217
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,955
We will.

218
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,582
Go up first.

219
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,750
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,543
Let's go.

221
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,600
Corps Commander, think of it
as a chance to get rid of bad luck

222
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,936
before you become the Chief of Staff.

223
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,479
If you get through this trouble,

224
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,899
you'll only walk on the flowery path,
as people say these days.

225
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,526
You also have such a trustworthy attorney.

226
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,031
I always found the military court
more comfortable.

227
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,534
The trials are not complicated,
and the verdicts are out quickly.

228
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,704
Until yesterday, I was in vain,

229
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,958
wondering if I became a serviceperson
to be in this mess.

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,211
But seeing you two cheers me up.

231
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,048
Come in.

232
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,932
Welcome military prosecutors.

233
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,643
It's an old custom

234
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,188
to have the prosecutors
and the defense attorney

235
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,399
meet and say hello
before the trial begins.

236
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:28,529
As you know, this trial is attracting
the whole nation's attention,

237
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,282
so please be careful
with every word you say.

238
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,283
Do you understand?

239
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,201
Yes, sir.

240
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,079
Let's begin the trial.

241
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,959
The trial will now begin.

242
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,836
Make it quick.

243
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,761
Military Prosecutor Doh.

244
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,180
Can I talk to you for a moment?

245
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,017
Go ahead first.

246
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,351
Yes, sir.

247
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,278
Is it going to be your usual way?

248
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,447
What do you mean?

249
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,409
You're going to take care of it
like that trial from before, right?

250
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,910
Military Prosecutor Doh.

251
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,329
Military Prosecutor, please calm down.

252
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,715
I'll see you in court.

253
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,694
We're about to run
in a perfectly uneven playing field.

254
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,821
What does that mean?

255
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,325
You're going to lose motivation if
you hear about it. Still want to hear it?

256
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,577
Why don't you just tell me?

257
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,084
Noh Hwa-young.

258
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,251
Heo Kang-in.

259
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,296
I'm sure they were ordered
to attend the trial by Hong Moo-seob.

260
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,673
As in showing respect to superiors.

261
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,555
And the military judge already sentenced
his verdict before he entered this court.

262
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,766
What?

263
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,519
The military judge said it openly.

264
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,437
To not put in effort, like a year ago.

265
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,440
I'd like to apply
for recusal of the judge.

266
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,566
It's no use.

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,528
It's not enough to be a reason
for recusal of the judge. And…

268
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,948
as long as Hong Moo-seob
is in that position,

269
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,366
it's going to be the same.

270
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,120
We should make it inevitable
for the military judge to sentence

271
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,996
the right verdict.

272
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:52,256
I hope the results of your training
will come out through this trial.

273
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,524
Being in the same court like this

274
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,442
brings back memories.

275
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,278
I know, right?

276
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,656
I lost for you at that time.

277
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,617
Even if it was a real battle,
the result would've been the same.

278
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,830
Speaking of which, I'd like to tell you
that this was what I thought at that time.

279
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,040
What?

280
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,503
I wondered how I'll feel
if I crush you in this court.

281
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,301
Did you?

282
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,220
You go ahead and fight with the law.

283
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,057
This time, I'll fight with the truth.

284
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,864
Yes.

285
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,532
It's going to begin now.

286
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,783
What about you?

287
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,702
Yes, it’s going to begin here, too.

288
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,164
Detective Doh, I'll leave it to you.

289
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,876
You know that I never let go once I bite,
just like Bae-man, right?

290
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,588
It runs in the family,
starting with my older brother.

291
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,931
Isn't Hong Kyung-ok here yet?

292
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,515
It's late.

293
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,102
She did enter the building,

294
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,897
but she went
to the Staff Judge Advocate's office.

295
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,690
To the Staff Judge Advocate's office?

296
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,693
Why would she go there?
This is the interrogation room.

297
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,363
She said the interrogation room
is suffocating,

298
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,615
and she said you should go there.

299
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,749
So she's trying to intimidate me
from the start?

300
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,755
Please enjoy.

301
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,135
Detective Doh, the interrogation…

302
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,430
the conversation can take place here.

303
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,683
"Conversation"?

304
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,939
Do you think I'm here to have
a conversation with a crime suspect?

305
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,691
What?

306
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,651
Crime suspect?

307
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,987
What did you say?

308
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,531
You're looking down on a detective?

309
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,825
Fine.

310
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,493
The place doesn't matter.

311
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,662
Let's begin

312
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,788
the interrogation.

313
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,044
Okay.

314
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,134
What do you think you're doing?

315
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,635
We need to talk.

316
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,514
It won't take long. It won't.

317
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,149
Doh Bae-man's aunt.

318
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,986
I know this is a joint investigation,
but I'm in charge here.

319
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,572
Please watch your language.

320
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,200
What does me being Bae-man's aunt
have to do with this?

321
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,827
I'm Detective Doh Soo-kyung.

322
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,829
I called you that on purpose.

323
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,497
Doh Bae-man's aunt.

324
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,999
So you can really feel it.

325
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,542
Doh Bae-man's aunt..

326
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,712
It'll be better when things
turn out nicely.

327
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:23,216
If you mess with the Corps Commander,
Prosecutor Doh will be in trouble, too.

328
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,303
You threaten people

329
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,931
in a really cringy way.

330
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,976
Bae-man and I never go easy on anyone.

331
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,814
You, answer my question correctly.

332
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,649
What…

333
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,527
You even talk down to me now?

334
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,696
Staff Judge Advocate Seo Joo-hyuk!

335
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,909
Are you a serviceperson, or a prosecutor?

336
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,412
Are you a prosecutor, or a serviceperson?

337
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,624
Answer me!

338
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,544
Why should I answer you? Why should I?

339
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,173
Everyone I met here are servicepeople,

340
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,300
but you have to be a prosecutor!

341
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:10,180
A military prosecutor who charges crimes
accurately and reveals the truth! Get it?

342
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,851
If you go easy on her because she's
the Commander's sister,

343
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,437
I will not forgive you.

344
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,198
The fortune teller said I'll be surrounded
by women this year, and this was it.

345
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,993
The Division Commander, Cha Woo-in,
and that vixen.

346
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,455
I'm going crazy.

347
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,669
THE FIRST TRIAL OF CORPS COMMANDER
POWER TRIPPING CASE AT HIS RESIDENCE

348
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,212
I'd like to submit evidence.

349
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:46,174
This was the smartwatch he was ordered
to wear while working at the residence.

350
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,638
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob

351
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,224
made Staff Sergeant Shin Min-chul
wear this smartwatch

352
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,518
and called him dozens of times a day.

353
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,978
Violation of human rights--

354
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,771
It hasn't been verified, Your Honor.

355
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,106
Sustained.

356
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,360
Military Prosecutor,
please only speak of verifiable facts.

357
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,489
Then why did you make
Staff Sergeant Shin wear a smartwatch?

358
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,283
Wasn't it to give him orders with it?

359
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,829
He only called him three times a day
for the purpose of giving him orders.

360
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,293
Does that mean he made him a smartwatch
just to call him three times a day?

361
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,961
Your Honor.

362
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,256
May I answer this question, please?

363
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,549
Of course.

364
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,844
Military Prosecutor.

365
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,681
Are you curious about
why I made my subordinate

366
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,891
wear a smartwatch?

367
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,062
It was because…

368
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,733
I treasured Staff Sergeant Shin.

369
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,946
It was because I treasured
Staff Sergeant Shin.

370
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,240
What? Treasure him?

371
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,702
You raised your hand
at a person you treasure so much

372
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,123
at a supermarket, about to hit him,
and threw fruit in his face?

373
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,424
Detective, you're not married yet, right?

374
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,927
Those who insist
on remaining single really are selfish.

375
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,179
They only think about themselves.

376
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,391
This is based on selflessness.

377
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:23,688
I had to scold him for his mistake,
so he won't repeat it again.

378
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,191
Enough with that logic,
which makes no sense at all.

379
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,361
Why did you make Staff Sergeant Shin
cook for your grown-up son,

380
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,072
wash your underwear,
and clean your room, too?

381
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,782
I can explain that--

382
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,701
I'll answer her,
so you stay out of this, Lawyer Park!

383
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,036
Yes, Madam Hong.

384
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:43,458
To be frank, I didn't curse at him

385
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,709
or hit him!

386
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,838
I only cared for him a bit more
because I treasured him.

387
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,131
Selflessness.

388
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,299
Okay?

389
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,510
It was pity and sympathy, okay?

390
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,101
He provided a smartwatch
for Staff Sergeant Shin.

391
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,480
As you know, smartwatches
have health screening functions.

392
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,524
Health screening?

393
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,987
He was diagnosed with possible arrhythmia,
due to family history.

394
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,282
It was a gift from the defendant
so he could check…

395
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,784
his pulse with it.

396
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:24,332
Who would give an expensive smartwatch
as a gift for violate human rights?

397
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,632
And that smartwatch
also has a location tracking function,

398
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,386
so it was also to prevent desertion
from the place of duty.

399
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,930
Desertion from the place of duty?

400
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,309
Desertion is a felony for servicepeople.

401
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,063
Because of his duty, Staff Sergeant Shin
has to go leave the residence quite often.

402
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,399
His predecessors

403
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,319
were not fully aware of that
and got punished quite often.

404
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,739
So you're saying it was
to prevent Staff Sergeant Shin

405
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,575
from deserting from the place
of duty by mistake

406
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,535
and being punished, aren't you?

407
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,453
Yes.

408
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,539
The smartwatch was not a tool
for power tripping. It was…

409
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,794
a gift that proves the Corps Commander's
consideration for Shin.

410
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,800
The trial's going to have a boring ending.
Isn't it a relief?

411
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,552
Just shut up and listen.

412
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,097
Military Prosecution?

413
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,893
I'm sure you do not have any more
questions about the smartwatch.

414
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,810
Yes.

415
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,479
I do.

416
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,235
It was to prevent
Staff Sergeant Shin's desertion…

417
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,905
All right, I got it.

418
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,200
Let me ask you, Staff Sergeant Shin.

419
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,828
What is your affiliation?

420
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,290
I'm affiliated with the HQ Service
of the 4th Infantry Division.

421
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,583
HQ Service?

422
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,462
-Not the Corps Commander's residence?
-No.

423
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,382
Then were you dispatched
to the Corps Commander's residence?

424
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,134
-No.
-Of course you weren't.

425
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,721
It is impossible to be dispatched
to the Corps Commander's residence.

426
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,099
Because the residence soldier system
was abolished.

427
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,061
The superiors gave orders
to withdraw all military manpower

428
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,022
working in the residence
and replace them with civilian one.

429
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
But even if there was an order,

430
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,361
an old custom
is hard to be changed overnight.

431
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,240
The commanders who treat the soldiers
like their servants

432
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:24,244
changed their titles to
the driver soldiers or operation soldiers,

433
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,289
and used non-commissioned
officers instead of soldiers.

434
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,625
Staff Sergeant Shin
was personally selected

435
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,503
by Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob
from the first line troops.

436
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,424
So, Staff Sergeant Shin
is already deserting his place of duty,

437
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,927
and what do you mean
by preventing his desertion?

438
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,223
Didn't you just ignore all procedures,
take Staff Sergeant Shin

439
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,933
and use him as your servant?

440
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:47,851
Prosecution!

441
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,853
Watch your language!

442
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,229
Health screening?

443
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,149
Do you know how Staff Sergeant Shin's
hearing is right now?

444
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,444
A commander can't know every detail
about a subordinate's medical records.

445
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,903
Sustained.

446
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,448
Prosecution, what does
Staff Sergeant Shin's hearing

447
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,200
have to do with this case? What?

448
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,910
It is very relevant.

449
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,913
Because he was continuously assaulted
by the defendant

450
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,331
and his eardrum got damaged.

451
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,668
Assault? The prosecution is
speaking of something without grounds!

452
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,712
Here's the evidence of assault.

453
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,301
Look at that!

454
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,052
PHOTO EVIDENCE OF ASSAULT
ON STAFF SERGEANT SHIN MIN-CHUL

455
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,098
That's serious.

456
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,935
To prove continuous and serious assault

457
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,480
the defendant committed
to Staff Sergeant Shin,

458
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,024
I'd like to have
Staff Sergeant Shin testify.

459
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,242
Well done.

460
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,458
You're keep saying the word "treasure",

461
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,586
then why did you curse
at someone you treasure?

462
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,546
What? Curse?

463
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,383
I never cursed. I never did.

464
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,470
My brother is a general,
and I am a general's sister.

465
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,139
Why would I do a vulgar thing like that?

466
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,599
Are you sure you didn't do it?

467
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,975
It's not even in that video.

468
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,562
Stop falsely accusing me
and show me the evidence!

469
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,356
The way your lips are moving…

470
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,443
-is clearly cursing.
-I said!

471
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,655
I didn't…

472
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,697
Then…

473
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,825
Let's turn up the volume.

474
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,287
The supermarket installed
an expensive CCTV.

475
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,039
You idiot! Snap out of it?

476
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,582
Have you gone deaf? What?

477
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,042
You bastard! Hey!

478
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,794
You eat this cheap peace of crap!

479
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,340
Why didn't you tell me about this?

480
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,301
Yes!

481
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,887
He just couldn't understand
what I told him,

482
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,139
so I ended up yelling at him!

483
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,766
But it's not that bad!

484
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,270
Is there anyone that hasn't cursed once,
even while driving?

485
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,481
Yes, I sometimes curse too while driving.

486
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,985
When I'm alone,
and when no one can hear me.

487
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,362
Don't show stupid things like this.

488
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,489
What was that called again?
Power tripping?

489
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,908
Bring the evidence that I really did that.

490
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,743
Evidence!

491
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,748
Those who are innocent actually…

492
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,001
never demand to show evidence.

493
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,421
This is the conclusion I got
from my 17-year police career.

494
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,214
I don't care about your conclusion.

495
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,465
Since you want evidence,

496
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,260
I'll let you meet a witness
who has evidence.

497
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,888
Investigator!

498
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,474
Please let Mr. Han Sam-soo,
the former driver

499
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,393
for the Corps Commander, in here.

500
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,316
Long time no see.

501
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,942
It's me, Sam-soo.

502
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,322
The driver soldier who almost became blind
because of the ashtray you threw at me.

503
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,579
She made me wear
a smartwatch for 24 hours.

504
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,458
I got a call every five minutes,

505
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,044
and I was about to go crazy.

506
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,380
"Go bring me water.
Cold water. Put ice in it."

507
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,216
My 24 hours always belonged to that woman.

508
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:12,138
Hey, how dare you tell a lie
and turn me into a criminal!

509
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,891
I'm going to sue you for libel!

510
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,310
What are you doing, Mr. Park?

511
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,729
Write a complaint
about this bastard right now!

512
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,023
Please calm down, ma'am.

513
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,192
She ordered me to buy
sanitary pads for her.

514
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,986
When I bought them,
she told me to buy thicker ones

515
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,696
or different ones…

516
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,240
And pomegranates…

517
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,538
This is the statement
Staff Sergeant Shin wrote.

518
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,709
The details and methods
of the power tripping are 100% identical.

519
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,378
Hey!

520
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,546
Will you just sit there and watch?

521
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,507
Aren't you my brother's subordinate?

522
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,468
But even I think this is certain…

523
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,763
What? Certain?

524
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,225
Lawyer Park, aren't you going
to say something?

525
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,852
You got a retainer! What are you doing?

526
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,563
I'd like to resign from this case.

527
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,232
Go look for a different lawyer.

528
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,984
Wow, I seriously can't do this.

529
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,362
Hey!

530
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,327
Your attorney ran away.

531
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,413
What are you going to do now?

532
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,040
Are you going to admit everything?

533
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,921
Are you going to admit it,
Ms. Hong Kyung-ok?

534
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,009
Answer me!

535
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,470
My brother…

536
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,016
doesn't know anything about this.

537
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,270
It was all my doing.

538
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:48,651
My brother knows nothing!

539
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,447
Are you going to take all of the blame?

540
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,743
Oh no, my brother…

541
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:07,837
WITNESS

542
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,303
Min-chul.

543
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,724
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

544
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,103
Okay.

545
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,564
I'm ready.

546
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,947
Is it true that you've been

547
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,825
continuously assaulted
by Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob?

548
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,870
Yes.

549
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,914
There was no reason
for you to be assaulted.

550
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,084
Was it because of
your wrongdoings or mistakes?

551
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,293
At first…

552
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,421
I thought I was being punished

553
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,466
because I made a mistake.

554
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,803
But whether there were mistakes or not,

555
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,347
the days of assaults continued.

556
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,432
How did you figure that out?

557
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,559
The Corps Commander's younger sister…

558
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,144
I mean…

559
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,774
Madam Hong, goes
to her parents' house every Sunday.

560
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,068
When she does, the residence is empty,

561
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,236
and I am alone…

562
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,115
with the Corps Commander.

563
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,494
The smartwatch rings at midnight.

564
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,371
The first alarm

565
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,581
is a signal to get ready.

566
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,333
The second alarm…

567
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,379
is a signal telling me
to come to his room.

568
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,028
Did the defendant tell you
why he was assaulting you?

569
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,531
Yes.

570
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,741
What did he say?

571
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,037
The Corps Commander…

572
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,373
said it clearly.

573
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,669
-"I must beat someone up…"
-I must beat someone up…

574
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,754
to relieve my anger.

575
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,673
Your Honor.

576
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,259
Staff Sergeant Shin's testimony
is an unverified claim.

577
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,302
I submit written diagnoses on

578
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,138
traumatic tympanic membrane perforation
and sudden deafness as the evidence.

579
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,224
The doctor said that these
were all bodily harm caused by assault.

580
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,436
Is there evidence to prove
that the defendant committed that assault?

581
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,646
Like video evidence.

582
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,816
Staff Sergeant Shin spent
most of his time in the residence,

583
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,151
so isn’t it obvious?

584
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,861
Self-harm is more possible.

585
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,280
What do you mean, self-harm?

586
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,037
Watch your mouth!

587
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,830
Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man!

588
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,540
Be careful with what you say!

589
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm saying

590
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,879
it was self-harm based on his grudge
against the Corps Commander.

591
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,051
Is there proof that it was self-harm?

592
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,845
I'd like to submit
a written diagnosis, too.

593
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,225
It's a written psychiatric diagnosis
of Staff Sergeant Shin.

594
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,740
Staff Sergeant Oh, who was
Staff Sergeant Shin's closest colleague,

595
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,784
committed suicide a year ago.

596
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:28,246
Due to it, Staff Sergeant Shin suffered
from serious psychological trauma.

597
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,165
The defense attorney
is blurring the main point of this trial

598
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,042
with a story unrelated to this case.

599
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,669
One of the symptoms of that trauma

600
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,045
-is self-harm.
-Your Honor.

601
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,756
Staff Sergeant Shin
distrusted the verdict, bore a grudge,

602
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,217
and chose the wrong subject
to let his anger out on.

603
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,887
He made a false report about
the Corps Commander, and he attempted

604
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,806
self-harm for that.

605
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,557
It's wild speculation, Your Honor!

606
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,810
I'll be the judge of it!

607
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,812
Prosecution! If you finished examining--

608
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,063
I am not finished!

609
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,676
I'd like to submit the evidence
related to his diagnosis.

610
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
What was the reason for

611
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,948
enduring continuous assault and violence
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob, I mean,

612
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,201
the defendant, committed to you?

613
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,039
It was

614
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,334
because of money.

615
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,263
I heard your kid is very sick.

616
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,224
Pay for the medical bills with this.

617
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,602
And tell me if you need more.

618
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,228
MILITARY INVESTIGATOR ID
DOH SUNG-HWAN

619
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,981
Buy an ointment on your way back.

620
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,068
And buy some food for your son.

621
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,039
My son

622
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,292
is only three years old now.

623
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,047
He has heart disease,
which runs in the family,

624
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,676
and he's been growing up
at a hospital since birth.

625
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,015
I couldn't afford to

626
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,936
pay for his medical bills with my salary.

627
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,772
So…

628
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,983
so I endured it.

629
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,239
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob

630
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,116
only selected servicepeople

631
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,992
who are financially struggling

632
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,536
to work at his residence

633
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,538
and has been assaulting them.

634
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,582
These are all just groundless
assumptions by the prosecution.

635
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,753
Our claim on it being self-harm,
not an assault, is more reasonable.

636
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,426
Witness.

637
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,636
If it was self-harm, not assault,

638
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,972
you can get punished for perjury.

639
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,474
I never committed perjury!

640
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,645
I am not sure if I can trust
the testimony by you, the victim.

641
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,105
Your Honor.

642
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,732
The prosecution
is maintaining this indictment

643
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,484
solely based on written diagnosis

644
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,237
issued only by the victim's testimony.

645
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,073
Therefore, the written diagnoses
submitted by the prosecution

646
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,576
is valid only
when it's selected as evidence,

647
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,286
and I request exclusion of evidence!

648
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,495
Prosecution!

649
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,623
If the credibility
of the witness testimony is shaken,

650
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,668
the written diagnoses issued solely
based on the victim's claims

651
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,296
will be invalid as evidence as you know.

652
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,047
Exclusion of evidence? Your Honor!

653
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,757
Please be fair with the trial!

654
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,470
-This is too much!
-How can you work on a trial like this?

655
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,195
Your Honor!

656
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,157
Staff Sergeant Shin overcame his fear
and is present at this trial to testify!

657
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,327
I will review the validity
of the written diagnoses as evidence

658
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,954
and decide the selection
on the next trial! Dismissed!

659
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,789
Your Honor!

660
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:18,410
MILITARY COURT

661
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,453
Hey.

662
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,874
Detective Doh got all of her testimony.

663
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,210
Really?

664
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,753
But…

665
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,089
Hong Kyung-ok took all the blame,

666
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,259
so it may be difficult
to have it connected to Hong Moo-seob.

667
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,302
And,

668
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,137
Han Sam-soo said…

669
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,100
that he was never assaulted
by the Corps Commander.

670
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,273
Staff Sergeant Shin!

671
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,696
I treasured you
and was always considerate toward you,

672
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,323
and this is how you repay me?

673
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,034
When I get acquitted,

674
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,746
I'll put you in prison
for libel right away.

675
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,584
Let's go.

676
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,027
Hey.

677
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,238
You figured it out, didn't you?

678
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,157
What?

679
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,076
-What do you mean?
-You figured it out.

680
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,246
I don't know what you're talking about.

681
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,373
Stop talking like that in the military.

682
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,250
It's very unpleasant.

683
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,635
You know,

684
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,930
my original plan was to make you my dog.

685
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,184
But I changed my mind.

686
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,063
What are you doing? Lower your gun!

687
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,398
I said don't talk like that, you bastard!

688
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,566
What?

689
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,568
Don't talk like that.

690
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,986
Do you think I'm kidding?

691
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,822
Don't be fussy, you bastard!

692
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,574
Do you know…

693
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,370
do you know what happened
to my father because of you?

694
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,998
Do you know, you bastard? Do you?

695
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,458
Don't be fussy!

696
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,099
THE POWER TRIPPING CASE
OF CORPS COMMANDER HONG MOO-SEOB

697
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,935
We should make it inevitable

698
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,063
for the military judge
to sentence the right verdict.

699
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,900
Staff Sergeant Shin overcame his fear
and is present at this trial to testify!

700
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,069
When I get acquitted,

701
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,323
I'll put you in prison
for libel right away.

702
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,956
NOH HWA-YOUNG

703
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,716
Come to my office.

704
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,261
May I ask you what you need me for?

705
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,763
There's a witness
who can help you win the trial.

706
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,516
Well? Are you interested?

707
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,646
I'll be there soon.

708
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,861
Salute.

709
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,322
Cha Woo-in.

710
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,535
Since you came here yourself
to hear my suggestion,

711
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,704
let's be honest.

712
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,918
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

713
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,546
I know you want
to hide your hostility toward me.

714
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,464
But,

715
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,134
I'm saying it doesn't matter
even if you address me

716
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,927
as your true self, without your mask.

717
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,349
I do not understand
what you're talking about,

718
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,642
Division Commander.

719
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,772
You can't hide your true emotions
because it shows on your face,

720
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,025
just like your father.

721
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,903
You truly are Cha Ho-chul's daughter.

722
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,656
So you did know…

723
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,784
everything about me.

724
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,623
Then why did you just let me be?

725
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,543
I can easily deal with an obvious enemy.

726
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,630
But the backstabbing

727
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:43,217
is always done by a friend
aiming a gun behind my back.

728
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,846
Just like how the Corps Commander

729
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,307
will be attacked
and backstabbed by you now?

730
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,100
Yes.

731
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,436
I knew it.

732
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,897
You figured out
why I called you here today.

733
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,694
Your father was always proud of you.

734
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,113
He often talked about how smart you are.

735
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,031
Do not…

736
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,618
speak of my father anymore, please.

737
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:26,218
Do you want my witness or not? Cha Woo-in.

738
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,981
I will take them,
as a military prosecutor.

739
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,233
But it'll be hard to have them summoned.

740
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,609
Don't worry about that.

741
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,028
The military judge is my subordinate.

742
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,030
And of course, you're my subordinate, too.

743
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,616
I'm just trying
to give a chance to everyone.

744
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,331
I'm sure you only see me as your enemy.

745
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,583
But,

746
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,211
there's more to it than meets the eye.

747
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,136
I'm saying there are things
you don't know as well.

748
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,763
Because you were too young at that time.

749
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,813
Perhaps…

750
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,942
our relationship could have been
completely different from now.

751
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,447
Your Honor. I'd like to summon a witness.

752
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,824
A witness?

753
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:36,455
But I heard there's no witness summoned
by the prosecution today.

754
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,084
The witness needed time
to make a decision to be present.

755
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,815
What the…

756
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,277
Cha Woo-in.

757
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,613
From now on, you must leave…

758
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,241
today's trial completely to me.

759
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,203
Your Honor.

760
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,457
I'm Major General Noh Hwa-young,
Commander of the 4th Division of the army.

761
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,918
Staff Sergeant Shin Min-chul, the victim,

762
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,504
is a precious non-commissioned officer
of my division.

763
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,340
Please allow me to help my subordinate.

764
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,426
What do you mean, "help?".

765
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,305
First Lieutenant Yang Jong-sook,
my adjutant, has a testimony to make.

766
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,946
Stop that testimony!

767
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,489
We must stop it!

768
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,327
We won't approve any witnesses
who weren't agreed upon beforehand,

769
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,412
Your Honor.

770
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,331
First Lieutenant Yang is
a critical witness

771
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,167
who can prove Commander Hong's
violent tendencies.

772
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:14,928
You sentenced many verdicts for
civilian law firms after taking bribes.

773
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,348
That's a misunderstanding.

774
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,937
You will have to sentence
a reasonable verdict for this trial,

775
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,232
if you want to keep wearing
that judge's robe.

776
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,739
I will select and summon…

777
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,032
the prosecution's witness.

778
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,661
First Lieutenant Yang Jong-sook,
please sit in the witness' seat.

779
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,829
Objection, Your Honor!

780
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,873
It is judged that she
is a crucial witness,

781
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,958
so the defense's objection is overruled.

782
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,136
Hey. It's Noh Hwa-young's doing.

783
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,306
-What?
-It's Noh Hwa-young's doing.

784
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,312
How dare you…

785
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:09,274
how dare you do this to me?

786
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,657
First Lieutenant Yang Jong-sook.

787
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,120
Have you ever been assaulted
by Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob?

788
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:23,955
Yes.

789
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,832
I have.

790
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,084
Please tell us the details.

791
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,882
Around 0114, June 11, 2020,

792
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,468
In the Corps Commander's car,

793
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,179
I was slapped twice

794
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:45,185
and beaten on my abdomen three times
by Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob.

795
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,062
Your Honor.

796
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,023
I'd like to submit the written diagnosis
on that bodily harm.

797
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:57,489
I'll also submit the audio recording
she recorded at the time of assault.

798
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,660
You're not going to be able
to say the word "self-harm" anymore.

799
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,962
Why were you assaulted
by the Corps Commander?

800
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,218
It's okay.

801
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,011
Now you can say

802
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,472
what you couldn't at that time.

803
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,813
The Corps Commander visited

804
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,858
the base I was in at that time

805
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,443
and there was a drinking gathering.

806
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,363
After the party, he touched my body

807
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,074
in the car,

808
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,494
I refused immediately,

809
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,247
and refused firmly once again, but…

810
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,751
And there must have been

811
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,671
the Corps Commander's assault after that.

812
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:56,923
Yes.

813
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,968
So you were sexually harassed
by the Corps Commander,

814
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,720
and you were assaulted after that.

815
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,890
Military Judge! Are you going
to just sit there and listen?

816
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,933
Through First Lieutenant Yang's testimony,

817
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,728
the defendant's assault
on his subordinate has been revealed,

818
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,564
and that adds credibility
to Staff Sergeant Shin's testimony.

819
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,616
The defendant's objection is overruled.

820
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,201
We will continue to listen
to the witness' testimony.

821
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,119
What?

822
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,622
Cut it off! I said, cut it off!

823
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,166
You must maintain order, Defendant.
That's a warning.

824
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,464
Witness, you may continue.

825
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,260
The time when the assault

826
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:46,056
and sexual harassment took place
was one year and eight months ago.

827
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,352
Is there a reason
why you decided to testify now?

828
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,647
After that incident,

829
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,275
I tried to commit suicide.

830
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,945
But,

831
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,618
to him, it was nothing.

832
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,581
Thank you, Adjutant Yang.

833
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,459
You're always quiet

834
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,170
and hardworking. I like that.

835
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:26,846
You.

836
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,141
Are you still upset
about what happened in the past?

837
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
Yes.

838
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,690
You're a good girl.

839
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,696
So tell me whenever you're
having a hard time.

840
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,751
The victim who got
sexually harassed is dying,

841
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,254
but the perpetrator forgets
and lives a good life.

842
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,882
I'm sure it's still happening
everywhere, non-stop.

843
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,218
If the victim who could not prove damages

844
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,721
can only prove
their innocence through death,

845
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,222
this crime of killing the soul

846
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,433
is on the same level as murder.

847
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:16,229
Violence is a serious crime
that destroys someone's soul and body.

848
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,858
Therefore, I'd like to ask you
to sentence the defendant

849
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,359
with a severe punishment.

850
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,831
In addition,

851
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,709
we reviewed Staff Sergeant
Shin's testimony

852
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,879
and evidence from the first trial,

853
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,674
and they're proven
to be valid as evidence.

854
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,553
I will maintain the decision
to select the existing evidence

855
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,598
and attach the evidence to this verdict.

856
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,069
As the Corps Commander,

857
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,781
he used his position to lead
and direct his subordinates

858
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,449
as a chance to abuse his authority

859
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,035
and committed cruelty to them.

860
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,039
Continuous and habitual assaults
have been confirmed, too.

861
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,249
The additional charges
of sexual harassment

862
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,794
are to be dealt with at future trials.

863
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,756
Therefore, based on Article 62,
Paragraph 1 of the Military Criminal Act,

864
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,302
abusing official authority and abusing
or cruelly treating another person,

865
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:32,263
assaulting a military
serviceperson on duty,

866
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,432
Article 260, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act,

867
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,892
crime of violence,

868
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:39,479
I hereby sentence the defendant…
to three years in prison.

869
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,450
How dare you put me in prison?

870
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,079
Hey! Military judges! Are you guys crazy?

871
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:01,126
And how can you call yourselves
the servicepeople of this country?

872
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:05,797
This trial is just ridiculous!

873
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,507
Military police!

874
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,221
Don't come any closer!

875
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,681
Don't come any closer!

876
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,433
Don't you dare touch me!

877
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,226
What is your affiliation?

878
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,477
Go away!

879
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,437
I said, go away!

880
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,066
Division Commander.

881
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,572
Thank you.

882
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,742
I told you when you came to me
after suffering that incident.

883
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,203
I told you that

884
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,707
I will make you see
the Corps Commander fall, if you join me.

885
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,420
We only did what was
necessary to each other.

886
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,048
So skip the thank-you.

887
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,971
Thank you.

888
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,765
How could you sentence that verdict?

889
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,018
How dare you give me a guilty verdict?

890
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,896
Military police!

891
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,732
Let go! Let go of me!

892
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,567
Go away, you bastards!

893
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,360
You bastards!

894
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,737
Bastards!

895
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,740
Go away, you bastards!

896
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,451
You bastards! Go away!

897
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,286
Are we just going to sit here and watch?

898
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:22,123
It's a rare opportunity
to see one human being's rock bottom.

899
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,542
A Corps Commander's, to be exact.

900
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,879
Let's let everyone
be entertained for a bit.

901
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,130
You bastard!

902
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,050
-Hey!
-Oh, dear.

903
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,843
It's time for your entrance, I think.

904
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,512
The trial should end.

905
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,263
Shall I?

906
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,432
Hey, you bastard!

907
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,683
You bastard…

908
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,561
What are you doing?

909
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,147
It's your turn now, Doh Bae-man!

910
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,491
You must always be humble
in the face of the truth.

911
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,076
You have that facade of yours.

912
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,204
The most humble,
the kindest facade in the world.

913
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,125
I hope you go to prison safely,
with that facade of yours.

914
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,466
-Military Judge?
-What?

915
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,801
Yes?

916
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,469
Military police.

917
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,889
Arrest and confine the defendant
in the court, now.

918
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,716
Salute.

919
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,557
Thank you.

920
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,518
I mean it.

921
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,645
Military Prosecutor.

922
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,819
Military Prosecutor…

923
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,407
You're finally calling me that.

924
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,577
I thank you, too.

925
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,293
Thank you, Military Prosecutor.

926
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,129
Bye.

927
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,050
Let's go.

928
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,186
-Let's go.
-Sure.

929
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,855
What? When did you get here?

930
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,566
Did you see the trial?

931
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,903
Yes, good job.
You were awesome, Prosecutor Cha.

932
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,450
But, how did Noh Hwa-young's adjutant
come as a witness?

933
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,077
You see…

934
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,163
Where should I begin?

935
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,875
I'm busy, so I have to go.
You can tell me next time.

936
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,629
And I'm solving the problems
at the company, so don't worry.

937
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,216
Okay. Call me when you need something.

938
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,387
What about the hard drive?
Did you find anything?

939
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,018
That…

940
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,313
was not restorable.

941
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,190
So I discarded it.

942
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,650
Are you sure?

943
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,446
Still, thank you, Kang.

944
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,323
I'll get going.

945
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,079
The military court said
that they sentenced

946
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,581
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob

947
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,251
to an exceptionally serious punishment.

948
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,129
There will be additional indictments
on charges revealed

949
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,298
during the trial, such as
sexual harassment, and the Commander…

950
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,178
Power is an amazing thing.

951
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,890
It takes a few decades
to step on them and go up,

952
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,976
but it takes a short moment to come down.

953
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,436
How could you…

954
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,397
do this to me?

955
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,149
Without telling me anything, I mean.

956
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,777
It's a reward for my adjutant
who's been loyal to me just like you,

957
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,821
so let it slide this time.

958
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,241
Did you let Doh Bae-man and Cha Woo-in be…

959
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,911
in order to get rid
of Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob?

960
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,084
They say two things
are required for a revolution.

961
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,130
Passion and boldness.

962
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,384
I used Doh Bae-man
and Cha Woo-in as my tokens

963
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,094
and got rid of Hong Moo-seob.

964
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,139
Did I lose anything from this?

965
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,809
Power never allows vacancies.

966
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,688
Once there's a vacancy,
it would be filled by someone.

967
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,108
I knew that you wanted
to be the Corps Commander,

968
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,986
but I didn't know you would use
a method like this.

969
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,280
The Corps Commander?

970
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,033
You think that's all?

971
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,202
General.

972
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,835
Do you know why we haven't been
in any conflict until now?

973
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:23,341
It's because I've been doing
everything I can to keep boundaries.

974
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,168
Did you bring an answer to my question?

975
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,213
Among the items that were seized,

976
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,049
there's an SSD hard drive.

977
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,177
That's my answer.

978
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,513
What's in that hard drive?

979
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,016
A critical hit to attack Noh Hwa-young.

980
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,358
What perfect timing.

981
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,526
I timed it.

982
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,904
I saw how you got backstabbed
by Noh Hwa-young in court today.

983
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:30,241
I didn't expect you to bring
a gift for me, CEO Kang.

984
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,623
Like you said,

985
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,754
let's leave the war to those officers.

986
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,633
I must protect my company.

987
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,307
-Yes.
-Yes.

988
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:58,060
It's right there, when you come out
to the guardhouse.

989
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,729
Thank you, okay.

990
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,022
Okay.

991
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,941
What's all this?

992
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,903
Did our office of justice
have so many phones?

993
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,822
We had one, but we got more,
and now we have five.

994
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,450
I did this for today…

995
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,368
What…

996
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,621
Hello, you may… wait,
this is a wrong direction.

997
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:20,207
It's crazy. Reports on power tripping
are pouring in from everywhere.

998
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,627
The server for the website
for the PMHR went down.

999
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:27,256
You two, go ahead and wait in the office.
Because it's distracting.

1000
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,884
Okay, sure, good work. Bye.

1001
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:35,514
Prosecutor Doh is here, yes.
Yes, just give it to us, yes.

1002
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,350
That's right.

1003
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,441
Why did you follow me in?

1004
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,865
Since the trial is over,

1005
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:54,784
I'll tell you.

1006
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,121
Summoning Noh Hwa-young's
adjutant as the witness…

1007
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,918
It was something I had to do
as a military prosecutor.

1008
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,589
For Staff Sergeant Shin,
and for Noh Hwa-young's adjutant, too.

1009
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,925
But…

1010
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,095
it was a very hard decision to make…

1011
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,682
as my father's daughter.

1012
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:22,853
It was hard.

1013
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,482
And,

1014
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,109
I'm sorry

1015
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,153
I couldn't tell you beforehand.

1016
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,656
I'm very sorry.

1017
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,157
That's enough.

1018
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,287
I'm saying, you can stop telling me that.

1019
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,841
When you calmed me down…

1020
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,138
When you spoke for

1021
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,598
your enemy's adjutant,
as a military prosecutor…

1022
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,392
If the victim
who could not prove the damage

1023
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,853
can only prove their innocence
through death,

1024
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,688
this crime of killing the soul

1025
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,648
is on the same level as murder.

1026
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,192
When I was saluted by Staff Sergeant Shin…

1027
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:11,610
Salute.

1028
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,324
And now…

1029
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,996
I don't need any other reasons.

1030
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:26,959
So,

1031
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,878
you can stop telling me,

1032
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,296
Cha Woo-in.

1033
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,775
Private First Class Pyeon said

1034
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,154
that in the military,
most problems have solutions.

1035
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,824
That when you're sick,
you go to the medical office,

1036
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,368
and when you're hungry,
you go to the cookhouse.

1037
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,747
But there's one thing…

1038
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,874
Going mad…

1039
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,587
He said there's no solution
when a soldier who's gone mad

1040
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,214
wields a gun.

1041
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,551
So he told me not to go mad.

1042
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,638
He told me I shouldn't lose my mind.

1043
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,184
He said that I especially
should never go mad

1044
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,479
when I'm holding a gun.

1045
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,554
Now, a war will start
inside the Patriotic Society.

1046
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,639
Cha Ho-chul collected material
on the corruption

1047
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,349
of the Patriotic Society like crazy.

1048
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,268
The X-file of the Patriotic Society.

1049
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,352
Are you sure it's here?

1050
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:09,687
Are you sure you didn't put it
in the residence or anywhere else?

1051
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,606
CEO Kang, did you take the box
of Won Ki-choon's materials?

1052
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,067
There's an item I'd like to check

1053
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,195
among the items searched
and seized from Kang's Solution.

1054
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:22,158
We got a report on hearing gunfire
numerous times from the 14th GOP.

1055
