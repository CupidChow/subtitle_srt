1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,544
Trainee No Tae-nam, come out!

5
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,504
-Trainee No Tae-nam!
-Trainee No Tae-nam!

6
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,590
-Trainee No Tae-nam!
-Trainee No Tae-nam!

7
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,924
Trainee No Tae-nam!

8
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,682
-Trainee No Tae-nam, come out!
-Trainee No Tae-nam!

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,017
Trainee No Tae-nam!

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,104
Mother. Did you say
the military is better than prison?

11
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,940
I think prison would be better.

12
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,192
Trainee No Tae-nam!

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,237
Being looked down by others,
which I have never experienced

14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,532
feeling degraded, and the humiliation
I felt during the trial.

15
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,452
I can't stay here anymore.

16
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,289
My life is completely under your control.

17
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:26,294
From now on,
I will never obey your orders.

18
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
Prosecutor Cha.

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,678
Did you say that it took six years
for you to come here?

20
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,890
I will finish it in three months.

21
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,266
Exactly 90 days.

22
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,063
Look forward to vengeance as cold as ice.

23
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,275
Where are you going?

24
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,362
I must go report my return
to General No Hwa-young.

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,823
Are you going to declare war on her?

26
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,242
Come on, it's too early for that.

27
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,119
I do things

28
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,081
with a cold brain, not a fiery heart.

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,292
There's a lot more
you need to learn, buddy.

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,129
You're lacking, okay?
You're lacking in a lot of ways.

31
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,342
The defendant was found innocent

32
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,679
but the victim's trauma still remains.

33
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,559
Therefore, I promise you that Trainee No
will repent during his military service

34
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,395
and he will finish his service diligently
and sincerely, more so than anyone else.

35
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,272
That's all I need to say.

36
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,149
Thank you for your words, Lawyer Yong.

37
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,608
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,739
So it's the lawyer's victory,
not the defendant's victory.

39
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,743
Do you think those two are different?

40
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,789
No Tae-nam showed earlier in the court

41
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,708
that he's not a victorious defendant.

42
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,546
You people, who choose the military
as a place to escape from crime

43
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,009
should pay for your sins
rather than repent during this time.

44
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,596
If there are people who use the military
for such an evil purpose,

45
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:04,058
you, Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in
must eradicate them from their roots.

46
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,936
Eradicate them from their roots…

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,355
Yes, I will do that.

48
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,650
Do you know

49
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,612
why I like the job of a lawyer?

50
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,034
I really enjoy the fact
that someone's fate is in my hands.

51
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,662
A military prosecutor,
who's trying to ruin someone,

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,624
and a lawyer,
who's trying to save someone.

53
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,043
Who do you think is more right and just?

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,172
It's funny that
someone who wielded a sword mercilessly

55
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,674
at an innocent person
when he was a prosecutor

56
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,676
is saying the word "just."

57
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,640
It looks like he felt deeply humiliated
during the trial,

58
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
so I'm worried that he might run away.

59
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,813
Don't be too dazed by the victory
and protect No Tae-nam.

60
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,006
General, please say something!

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,551
Former CEO No Tae-nam
was found innocent at today's trial.

62
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,178
Please tell us how you feel.

63
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,348
Was there any special reason
why you didn't attend the final trial?

64
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,185
If I, the division commander,
watched the trial,

65
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,438
the military judge, who had to make
a ruling, would've felt pressured.

66
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,775
It is true that I feel a bit relieved

67
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,485
because a soldier in my division
had his charges lifted.

68
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,488
I do wish that he can finish
his service doing his best

69
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,283
and pay back for the concerns
and interest of the people,

70
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,745
and I will protect the military
with my honor, because it is a sanctuary

71
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,498
that cannot be used as
a place to escape from crimes.

72
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,792
Please say something as a mother too.

73
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,840
More than myself

74
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,302
when I think of the victim's mother,
it breaks my heart.

75
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,054
I truly hope those two
can overcome their trauma

76
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,307
and rise again as soon as possible.

77
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,518
Please say something to your son
who went through a lot.

78
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,229
Division Commander.

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,189
Division Commander?

80
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,072
Salute.

81
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,534
Captain Doh Bae-man.

82
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,994
I hereby report my return
as a military prosecutor.

83
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,495
Go on first.

84
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,923
What if I do not authorize your
re-enlistment as your direct superior?

85
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,135
I know it's a bit late,
because you saw me at the court first,

86
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,386
but please authorize it.

87
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,058
What happened to that arrogant attitude
from your discharge report?

88
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,268
I apologize, Division Commander.

89
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,190
As you know,

90
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,860
the one who knows Mr. No
the best in the fourth division is me.

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,322
I'm also the best person
to help him adapt to military life.

92
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,076
You won the first trial,
but the appeal by the corps still remains,

93
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,328
and Lawyer Yong Moon-goo
is just a civilian.

94
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,956
I'm sure, I, a military prosecutor,
would have a lot more to do.

95
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,255
Is that so?

96
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,926
What's the real reason for your return?

97
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:31,432
I realized that the military
is the only place I should be.

98
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,647
Congratulations on your son's acquittal.

99
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,440
Salute!

100
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,660
Wait.

101
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,789
I'd like to talk to him
before he returns to the boot camp.

102
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,624
Yes, understood.

103
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,926
I had to do it for you
to be found innocent and be acquitted.

104
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,886
Please understand.

105
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,472
You foresaw everything already

106
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,850
when you told me to enlist.

107
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,518
About today's trial.

108
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,689
What did you get from my mom
as the reward for winning the trial?

109
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,817
I'm sure she promised
to make you the CEO of IM.

110
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,776
You!

111
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,322
You planned to push me into hell
so you can take that place.

112
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,409
Isn't that right?

113
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,127
You had me found innocent,

114
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,129
but you lost me

115
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,298
forever.

116
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,692
You always said that you're a prosecutor,
not a serviceperson,

117
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,153
and look at you. Serves you right!

118
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,490
How could a military prosecutor
lose so easily like that?

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,703
I am so ashamed
as the Staff Judge Advocate!

120
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,330
It’s because of you, Cha Woo-in!

121
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,540
Please set only one route.

122
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,211
It says on your face that at least
you won't lose face

123
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,546
-because I lost the trial.
-What?

124
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,673
Captain Doh.

125
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,259
How are you managing
the office of justice?

126
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,886
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,973
Do you know how disobedient idiots
like you, who only speak the truth

128
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,017
torment their bosses?

129
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,477
Bosses who are two-faced,

130
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,438
who only take achievements
without taking any responsibility

131
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,190
torment the subordinates too.

132
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,191
Hey, Cha Woo-in.

133
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,902
Who's your father? Who?

134
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,238
Just why are you doing this?

135
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,822
I should get going now.

136
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,534
Salute.

137
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,580
Seriously…

138
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,584
Seriously…

139
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,174
Oh, yes.

140
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,717
It's a relief.

141
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:16,222
What could have happened
if we won the trial? What?

142
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,726
By the way,
was it noticeable that I was happy?

143
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,061
Quite a bit?

144
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,984
If No Tae-nam went to military prison,
I would have been kicked out too.

145
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,446
Anyway, you have no idea how glad I am
that you're back, Captain Doh.

146
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,533
You know that the Division Commander

147
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,412
and the HQ isn't saying anything
because I took action, right?

148
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,206
Yes. I'll work even harder.

149
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,168
And I will make sure
to discipline Prosecutor Cha.

150
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,170
That's good.

151
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,798
Nice shot.

152
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,936
I'll send you the address,
so please come to this place.

153
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,605
It's not far from the base.

154
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,485
FORGET-ME-NOT COFFEE SHOP

155
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,154
What the heck?

156
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,114
Is this the right place?

157
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,491
Good grief.

158
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,462
Excuse me.

159
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,464
I'd like to make an order.
Where can I sit…

160
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,635
Use the kiosk.

161
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,304
Where's the kiosk?

162
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,726
The kiosk.

163
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,398
This place is unique.

164
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,985
You can get it iced too.

165
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,865
I get cold easily. Thank you.

166
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,426
-Prosecutor Cha.
-Hi.

167
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,429
It's good to see you again,

168
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,223
Prosecutor Doh.

169
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,479
Didn't we speak casually last time?

170
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,106
Quite violently.

171
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,444
Are you changing your attitude
because of Prosecutor Cha?

172
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,950
-Why did you bring him?
-Because we're a team.

173
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,577
A team…

174
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,288
But I never allowed that.

175
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,249
Allow…

176
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,376
You got the order totally wrong.

177
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,504
You're the one
who came into this plan we set up.

178
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,090
And I'm the one who allowed it.

179
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,723
I'd rather not say anything.

180
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,726
How can we have a strategy meeting here?

181
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,271
This is not the place for that.
Do it somewhere else.

182
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,107
And she is watching too. So…

183
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,694
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.

184
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,154
Where is she going?

185
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,656
Follow us.

186
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,743
Seriously…

187
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,517
You prepared a lot over
the past six years, Cha Woo-in.

188
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,228
I set it comfortable
because CEO Kang owns this building.

189
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,106
Don't feel too burdened.

190
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,484
I made it the way Woo-in
wanted to make it.

191
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,027
Just why are you…

192
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,821
Why should you be here? Why?

193
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,657
CEO Kang is my long-time ally.

194
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,826
I'm sure he'll be helpful to you too.

195
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,457
And Ms. Paeng at the counter
is someone you can trust too

196
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,917
So you don't need to be suspicious of her.

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,505
From now on, all meetings that
require security will take place here.

198
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,174
Let's get started.

199
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,767
The Patriotic Society.

200
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,605
It's a secret private group in the army
of which No Hwa-young is a member.

201
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,690
Lee Jae-sik's father created it.

202
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,818
It was known to have disbanded
and disappeared,

203
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,447
but Mr. Lee, who became a serviceperson
following his father, inherited it.

204
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,117
They've been deeply involved
in the army's human resources

205
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,411
and inheriting the key positions,
growing their power in the headquarters.

206
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,913
The Patriotic Society…

207
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,749
What do they have to do with our revenge?

208
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:59,004
Their greed caused the deaths
of your parents and my father.

209
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,383
No Hwa-young.

210
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,678
The first female two-star general
division commander in Korean history.

211
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,805
She worked as a chief secretary
at the army headquarters

212
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,307
and assisted Lee Jae-sik,
who was the chief of staff.

213
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,768
As she was inaugurated
the commander of the fourth division,

214
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,353
she's now the third most powerful
person in the Patriotic Society.

215
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,483
Then the top most powerful
would be Minister Lee Jae-sik.

216
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,860
Who's the second in line?

217
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,195
It's Brigadier General Hong Moo-seob.

218
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,363
He was the military prosecutor

219
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,575
who was in charge
of your parents' accident 20 years ago,

220
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,035
and he played a big role
in covering it up.

221
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,538
Now, he's the commander
of the IV Corps of the army,

222
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,707
No Hwa-young's direct boss,

223
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,042
and he's the one
who's the most on guard against her.

224
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,627
Why?

225
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,338
Because rank can change anytime.

226
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,800
It means Lee Jae-sik's trust
in No Hwa-young is quite powerful.

227
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,720
Lieutenant Colonel Won Ki-choon.

228
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,805
He's commander of the Search Battalion
of the fourth division.

229
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,224
He's the rookie of the Patriotic Society
who joined them six years ago.

230
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,728
Lieutenant Colonel Won Ki-choon
is the hero of mines.

231
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,231
Yes, to him, No Hwa-young's words
are the law, and his life.

232
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,526
He's completely on No Hwa-young's team
in the Patriotic Society too.

233
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,112
The hero of the mines
is in the Patriotic Society…

234
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,280
That's interesting.

235
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,657
It would be worth digging into him too.

236
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,868
Brigadier General Heo Kang-in.

237
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,662
He's the Vice Commander of Corps
under Hong Moo-seob.

238
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,665
He's No Hwa-young's alumnus
from the KMA and he's also her rival.

239
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,919
He's recently been losing power
in the Patriotic Society,

240
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,796
as Lee Jae-sik's support
for No Hwa-young has gotten stronger.

241
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,341
It sounds like you're going to use that.

242
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,345
He's the only one
who can give orders to No Hwa-young.

243
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,933
He's going to be inaugurated
as the Minister of National Defense soon.

244
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,186
THE CURRENT PATRIOTIC SOCIETY

245
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,023
This is way bigger than I expected.

246
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,232
And…

247
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
Yong Moon-goo.

248
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,156
He may also join
the Patriotic Society soon.

249
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,741
Do you know what that means?

250
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,286
I'm sure it means No Hwa-young's power
in the Patriotic Society is growing.

251
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,875
It means she put her henchman,
a civilian, into that society.

252
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,711
Correct.

253
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,175
Yong Moon-goo filling in for the CEO
of IM which is now vacant

254
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,011
was also already planned
from a long time ago.

255
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,890
Because money is
what corrupt servicepeople need most.

256
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,230
You pulled me into a messy,
tangled spiderweb, Cha Woo-in.

257
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,359
There's only one way to catch a spider.

258
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,070
You have to pull the whole spider web.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
This doesn't work.

260
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,053
This naughty "thing"…

261
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,263
Hey, oh.

262
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,557
It always does this, anywhere, anytime.

263
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,772
The food at the boot camp is
the best thing to suppress this "thing".

264
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,276
And you don’t need to eat this.
So I'll eat it for you, okay?

265
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,280
-Hey, let me have it too.
-Me too.

266
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,534
What the heck? Why are you guys giggling?

267
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,162
Hey, just shut up and eat rice with beans.
You military bastards!

268
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,248
Jeez, that was scary.

269
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,750
"You military bastards!"

270
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,003
"You military bastards!"

271
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,297
Trainee 13.

272
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,091
It's a special meal for you!

273
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,681
Ta-da!

274
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,270
It's big.

275
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,898
I chose the biggest one available.

276
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,485
Eat this and make it as big as this!

277
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,779
Make it big!

278
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,175
It's been two days since it stopped
coming out. This is driving me crazy.

279
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,270
It's not coming out?

280
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,150
The power of pee depends on your mind.

281
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,155
-I heard you have premature ejaculation.
-You bastard…

282
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,281
What did you just say?

283
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,502
You may be a CEO out there,
but you're nothing here.

284
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,045
Got it?

285
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,672
You "tiny" bastard.

286
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,851
If I stay here any longer,

287
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,353
I'd either go mad or die.

288
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,064
I must find a way.

289
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,649
A way…

290
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,360
A way…

291
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,450
Good job. Let's go smoke.

292
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,243
-Yes, sir. Let's go.
-Let's go smoke.

293
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,215
PARCEL FROM SOLDIERS

294
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,911
I came to the military,
just as you and Lawyer Yong told me to,

295
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,498
but this is a literal hell
where people can't survive.

296
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,501
It's beyond my imagination.

297
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,715
I can't believe that such a place exists

298
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,926
in this country, Mother.

299
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,135
Let's go.

300
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,066
I heard that prison food
is better than military food

301
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,527
because many conglomerates go to prison,

302
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,989
but they never go to the military.

303
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,116
Let's go.

304
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:33,166
I eat, sleep and wash
with bastards I've never seen before.

305
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,713
And what I really can't stand is
the sound of the morning alarm.

306
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,508
The fact the same routine
repeats day after day drives me…

307
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,931
Division Commander.

308
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,975
The commander of the boot camp is here.

309
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:50,934
At this hour?

310
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,936
Let him in.

311
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,237
What is it?

312
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,032
Something happened to Trainee No Tae-nam.

313
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,326
What happened?

314
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,785
You see…

315
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,705
Don't hesitate. Report, now.

316
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,458
Trainee No Tae-nam ran away.

317
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,588
We formed a search party
and searched the base inside out, but…

318
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,922
Are you sure?

319
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,508
Yes, we are sure that he ran away.

320
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,718
What should we do?

321
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,221
Go by the book.

322
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,600
Pardon? Is it really okay to do that?

323
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,061
Have you given Trainee No
any special privileges during training

324
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,687
just because he's my son?

325
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,606
No, I swear we never did.

326
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,317
It's the same for this matter.
Take care of it according to the rules.

327
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,651
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,695
However,

329
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,532
the inauguration ceremony for
National Defense Minister is coming up.

330
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,786
The delinquent behavior of one soldier

331
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,205
must not lower the spirits
of 600,000 servicepeople

332
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,916
with the biggest
military event coming soon.

333
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,919
It's the matter
of the military's pride and dignity.

334
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,838
I understand what you're saying,
Division Commander.

335
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,840
Okay, go on.

336
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,754
NOH HWA-YOUNG

337
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,968
Yes, General.

338
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,137
Tae-nam ran away.

339
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,222
I'll be there soon.

340
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,541
It's cold.

341
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,179
Did you say it was inevitable
to reveal Tae-nam's weakness at the trial?

342
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,765
I had to think about Mr. No being hurt,

343
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,935
but I only thought of winning.
It was my fault.

344
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,565
I talked to the commander
of the boot camp already.

345
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,655
Use Doh Bae-man.

346
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,325
He's back, full of determination,

347
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,036
so he will do anything to prove his worth.

348
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,094
Wow, it's warm.

349
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,806
That feels much better now.

350
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,266
Poor boy.

351
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,520
Eat some instant ramyeon.

352
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:23,939
Buy it.

353
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,360
Hey.

354
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,779
Do you know how much money I have?

355
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,864
I'm the CEO of IM.

356
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,325
CEO?

357
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,160
I see, Mr. CEO.

358
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,956
Boy, do you have a place to sleep today?

359
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,792
I will ask my wife.

360
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,673
Let me use this phone.

361
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,009
You treated me like
a beggar just now, right? You're right.

362
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,054
If you let me borrow your phone,
I'll send you 100 million won right away.

363
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,222
Deal?

364
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,140
Hey, and give me this too.

365
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,695
What?

366
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,073
One.

367
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,199
Two.

368
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,575
Three.

369
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,660
Four.

370
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,661
Five.

371
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,704
Six.

372
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,746
Seven.

373
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,831
Eight.

374
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,040
Nine.

375
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,261
Did you think changing your name and
working hard during your military service

376
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,138
would launder your past?

377
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,639
You bastard!

378
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,351
I have a feeling that this won't be
the end of our connection.

379
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,026
Ahn Soo-ho, you have a visitor.

380
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,497
How dare you come here again?

381
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,751
Thanks to you, I was on TV
as a star military prosecutor.

382
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,420
Hey, thanks for that.

383
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,881
Because of me,

384
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,549
my father--

385
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,761
He got kicked out of the bank
he worked at all his life,

386
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,555
and that bank seized
all of his assets too.

387
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,309
He paid for raising his son wrong,
though it's late.

388
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,865
I'll get out in two months.

389
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,910
-When I get out, I'll kill you.
-Two months?

390
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,995
Hey, that's too long.

391
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,540
I'll make sure you get out before that.

392
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,878
You bastard, you're still toying with me?

393
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,927
Okay, you can't trust that?

394
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,137
Because a guy
who put you in here said that.

395
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,183
You're going to get a gift in a few days.

396
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,726
You keep blabbering nonsense.

397
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,938
When you unwrap it,
you'll be dying to contact me.

398
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,649
What does that mean? You bastard!

399
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,990
The one you should be angry at isn't me.

400
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,077
It's No Tae-nam.

401
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,879
LAWYER YONG MOON-GOO

402
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,175
You're looking for me,
so that means something happened,

403
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,386
and you need me to solve that, right?

404
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,054
Mr. No ran away.

405
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,725
You're not shocked at all.

406
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,643
You don't know him even less than I do.

407
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,645
Are you saying you saw this coming?

408
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,398
In the military, he is a racehorse.

409
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:58,611
A racehorse that's always ready to run
whenever there's a signal.

410
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,781
He'll run away anytime
if he has the chance

411
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,117
wihout considering the consequences
because he couldn't stand it anymore

412
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,953
and he must've jumped over the wall,
thinking that his mother

413
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,788
would take care of it.

414
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,667
And even if he gets caught,
he'll go to military prison.

415
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,712
The military is like prison
and prison is like the military,

416
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,882
so there's no difference for him anyway.

417
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,932
The office of justice didn't get the news
about him running away,

418
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,726
so it means you're blocking it well.

419
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,603
Yes.

420
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,980
I must take action before it gets worse.

421
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,566
I will catch him
for the Division Commander

422
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,651
and for you, Lawyer Yong.

423
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,412
The boot camp was in a frenzy overnight.

424
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,414
Because a trainee disappeared.

425
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,291
And that trainee is No Tae-nam?

426
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,961
By the way, did you come here alone?

427
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,672
Where's Doh Bae-man?

428
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,799
I don't know.

429
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,343
He's out of reach,
working outside all day long.

430
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,427
Damn it.

431
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,808
If he's not sharing information
despite knowing it,

432
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,810
then it means only one thing.

433
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,103
I'm sure he has other intentions.

434
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,655
Salute.

435
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,365
How can I help you?

436
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,076
I'm here to meet the commander
of the boot camp.

437
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,620
-Salute!
-Thanks.

438
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,375
Left foot! Right foot!

439
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,131
Salute!

440
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,384
I'm military prosecutor,
Captain Doh Bae-man.

441
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,678
Who are you?

442
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,762
I…

443
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,516
I teased Trainee No Tae-nam a bit.

444
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,476
If you do that one more time…

445
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,603
I'm going to kill you.

446
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,355
I'm sorry, Military Prosecutor!

447
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,693
If No Tae-nam's desertion
isn't taken care of properly,

448
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,404
Commander, your military career
will meet its end,

449
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,533
and you'll have to start your military
career over from the military prison.

450
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,536
You can go now.

451
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,082
Did you get special orders

452
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,585
from the Division Commander
about this incident?

453
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,961
Special orders?

454
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,130
No.

455
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,049
Division Commander actually ordered me
to go by the book.

456
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,552
So silencing the assistant instructors
who searched for him

457
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,971
was completely your decision, right?

458
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,807
Yes, it was my decision.

459
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,560
I see.

460
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,812
This is the place.

461
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,439
Where are the trainees?

462
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,608
They're on the grounds
for a training session.

463
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,942
They'll be back at 4 p.m.

464
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,348
This was found in a village near the base.

465
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,517
And this is the CCTV footage
I got from the boot camp.

466
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,482
The driver soldier stopped the car
because he heard something in the freezer,

467
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,859
and he opened the freezer…

468
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,611
You can guess what happened, right?

469
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,280
As you know,

470
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,699
in Korea, whenever a new Minister
of National Defense is inaugurated,

471
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,243
all runaway soldiers
are ordered to return.

472
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,997
In other words, there's no statute
of limitations for desertion.

473
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,917
They're labeled as runaway soldiers
until they die.

474
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,218
I've missed you!

475
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,473
So is this case
the start of the contract renewal?

476
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,810
We saw each other's capabilities
for the past five years,

477
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,603
so we don't need a contract anymore.

478
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,146
Isn't that the real deal?

479
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,485
CHA WOO-IN

480
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,029
CHA WOO-IN

481
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,700
Do you know what money wants?

482
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,161
Even more money.

483
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,082
Did you come back
after being more openly greedy,

484
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,376
or did you become more
openly greedy after you returned?

485
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,212
Just give me some information
on Mr. No's acquaintances.

486
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,132
I'll return him, so no one would know…

487
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,594
that he left the base.

488
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,016
Hey.

489
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,393
Where are you? Your phone was off, too.

490
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,479
I wasn't in a situation
to answer my phone earlier.

491
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:48,067
Was it the location
or was it the person you were meeting?

492
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,446
I'm your boss.
Why should I report that to you?

493
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,200
It looks quite heavy.
That wine box, I mean.

494
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,834
Wine you got from Yong Moon-goo…

495
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,377
Did you just

496
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,546
tail me?

497
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,549
Weren't we supposed to work as a team?

498
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,426
That's what I want to ask you.

499
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,970
Didn't we have the same goal?

500
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,601
About No Tae-nam running away…

501
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,770
Why didn't you tell me right away?

502
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,023
Hey. Follow me.

503
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,740
I heard about it from Yong Moon-goo.
But how did you find out?

504
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,325
That's not important right now.

505
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,160
I told you.

506
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,413
I can only trust you
if you tell me your source too.

507
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,581
Don't you think so?

508
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,131
There's a company that supplies stationery
to the boot camp PX.

509
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,385
So you learned about it
from someone in charge there?

510
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,512
By giving him money?

511
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,305
No.

512
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,389
Then?

513
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,101
We purchased that company.

514
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,772
What? You purchased a company
just to get information

515
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,524
during No Tae-nam's service?

516
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,817
Do you have a problem with that?

517
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,486
No.

518
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,156
You really don't know what's wrong,
so I feel intimidated.

519
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,867
That's what money is for.

520
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,162
Now, please answer my question.

521
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,456
Why didn't you tell me
about his desertion?

522
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,043
Did you already forget what I said?

523
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,547
When I said I'll be your hound dog.

524
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,134
No Tae-nam got away through the trial.

525
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,469
I gave him to you this time,
so he can't get away.

526
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,098
Because…

527
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,351
I'm the one who made No Tae-nam run away.

528
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,677
Tae-nam? Is that you?

529
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,187
Wow, you used to be a fashionista,
but that's not an option now.

530
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,564
No one would think
you're a conglomerate CEO.

531
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,733
Damn it. Just go.

532
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,401
Yes, Mr. Trainee!

533
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,495
NO TAE-NAM

534
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,625
CEO NO OF IM DEFENSE INDUSTRY
STARTS HIS MILITARY SERVICE

535
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,253
Nothing is coming up.

536
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,839
That's General No Hwa-young, all right.

537
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,343
Or not? Is Yong Moon-goo blocking it?

538
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,600
Hey, where's Bolt? My boy Bolt.

539
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,018
Did you put him in the trunk?

540
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:12,480
Are you nuts? Putting a dog in the car
will make my car stink.

541
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,814
This is an expensive car.

542
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,150
Hey, I told you to bring him with you!

543
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,152
Have you really gone mad?

544
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,238
How can you hit me when I'm here to help?

545
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,490
You're doing this
because of that damn dog?

546
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,742
What? Damn dog?

547
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,577
Hey, stop the car. You bastard!

548
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,329
-Stop the car!
-What are you doing?

549
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,748
I'm driving right now!

550
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,583
Want me to report you?

551
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,002
Should I report that
the division commander's son ran away?

552
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,839
Seriously…

553
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,802
You made No Tae-nam run away?

554
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,720
Please tell us the details.

555
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,309
The assistant instructor
of the boot camp owes me something,

556
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,145
so I told him to provoke No Tae-nam
and he did it.

557
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,898
And he closed the door
of the freezer truck too.

558
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,783
Let's go.

559
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,039
Mission accomplished.

560
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,627
Then where is No Tae-nam right now?

561
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,964
I don't know where the heck
he is right now either.

562
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,050
You made him run away, but…

563
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,136
It's sad, isn't it?

564
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,473
Making him run away is the difficult part.
Catching him is easy.

565
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,475
That's what I'm saying.

566
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,519
It's a piece of cake
for Cha Woo-in, right?

567
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,606
If you're going to do things like that,
tell me first, okay?

568
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,359
Our company has tons of tracking devices
to place on people's bodies.

569
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,862
We military prosecutors
don't use things like that.

570
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,779
Right?

571
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,909
By the way, why did you plan
No Tae-nam's desertion?

572
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:53,080
The inauguration ceremony for Lee Jae-sik,
the new Minister of National Defense…

573
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,666
I'm going to move the fire
that started with

574
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,793
No Tae-nam's desertion to No Hwa-young.

575
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,128
He has announced that

576
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,048
he will start his work as the minister
right after the inauguration.

577
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,140
Well.

578
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,601
Now the target avoids me.

579
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,227
This is sad.

580
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,357
A serviceperson who cannot hit the target
with a bullet isn't a serviceperson.

581
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,025
No.

582
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,694
It's time for you to change the target.

583
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,029
You're the Minister now,

584
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,948
so you just need to aim at politics now.

585
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,162
I have the confidence to hit that target.

586
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,250
Tomorrow is your inauguration
which all of us have been waiting for.

587
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,586
So don't worry and just focus on politics.

588
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,798
Because we have
the powerful Division Commander No

589
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,758
guarding the battlefront
of the Republic of Korea.

590
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,389
Tae-nam's trial went well too.

591
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,601
I hope he doesn't cause any more trouble.

592
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,646
-He's adapting to it, right?
-Yes, Minister.

593
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,856
You don't have to worry about him anymore.

594
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,525
Right.

595
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,735
He's now your subordinate, not your son.

596
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,530
When it comes to servicepeople,
the bosses are responsible for everything.

597
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,281
Time has…

598
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,868
Back in the day, servicepeople held trials
for the civilians too.

599
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,995
There were times like that too.

600
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,789
But nowadays,

601
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,251
a serviceperson is just a job.
No more, no less.

602
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,211
A serviceperson cannot be a job.

603
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,380
It's a social class.

604
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,382
And it never changes.

605
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,468
Yes.

606
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,720
Hwa-young, you're my true subordinate.

607
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,306
Hwa-young, show me what you've got.

608
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,211
Hey, I'll drive your car for a while.

609
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,965
Okay. But what are you going to do?

610
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,050
Do you have plans?

611
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,470
I'll stay in a hotel for a few days
to get rid of this military smell

612
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,346
and then think about it.

613
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,726
Alan was sentenced to prison,
so his life is ruined,

614
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,104
but I thought you were fine
because you ran away to the military.

615
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,774
The other bastards
changed their numbers and disappeared.

616
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,444
Those unloyal bastards, seriously…

617
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:29,904
Hey.

618
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,239
You said you worked
for private detectives, right?

619
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,492
Not private detectives.

620
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,746
You know I don't deal with just anybody.

621
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,292
We're the top one percent problem solvers
who only deal with conglomerates.

622
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,215
TOP 1%, WHO WILL PUT ANYONE
WHO MAKES YOU ANGRY TO SLEEP FOREVER

623
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,011
SEOLAK CHEONJI

624
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,850
Wow.

625
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:01,936
Boss.

626
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,356
He's the one I told you about.

627
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,857
A former North Korean soldier.

628
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,402
My name is Heuk-beom.
I was in guarding business at Unit 973.

629
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,238
Guarding business?

630
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,281
I was a bodyguard
of the Commander-in-chief.

631
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,450
Commander-in-chief, you mean…

632
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:19,954
Chairman Kim?

633
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,124
When I guarded him, I pulled the trigger
if someone stared at him

634
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,918
for more than three seconds.

635
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:33,592
Wow, your looks and experience
are perfect indeed.

636
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:34,969
But,

637
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,972
I need to test you, at least.

638
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,392
I don't want to do anything
like auditions.

639
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,518
Really?

640
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,770
If so…

641
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,774
I can't help it.

642
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,317
I don't trust resumes,

643
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,654
and I don't trust words
from people's mouths even more.

644
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,156
I only trust what I saw with my own eyes.

645
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,784
Understand?

646
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,328
Get out.

647
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,165
By the way, do North Korean soldiers
understand English too?

648
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,042
They do. This is the global era.

649
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,847
You pass.

650
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,684
You're my bodyguard from now on.

651
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,021
Negotiate the income
and sign the labor contract now!

652
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,022
Yes, boss.

653
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,316
Which one of you is Seolaksan?

654
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,442
What?

655
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,570
Seolaksan?

656
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,867
Which bastard just said my honorable name
so casually with his tongue?

657
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,121
What?

658
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,207
You look

659
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,460
extremely familiar.

660
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,050
CEO No Tae-nam?

661
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,468
You know me?

662
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,388
Shouldn't you be working your butt off
in the military right now?

663
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,481
I ran away.

664
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,233
I'm a runaway soldier.

665
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,571
So, you see, I have a job for you.

666
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,698
FORGET-ME-NOT COFFEE SHOP

667
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,992
One of No Tae-nam's gang came in.

668
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,911
He was one of those
who played cards on that day,

669
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,412
so if we dig into him,
we'll find something.

670
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,747
Yes, sir.

671
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,209
Why don't you stay out of this?

672
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,711
-What?
-Send someone else.

673
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,380
Who are you talking about?

674
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,174
An expert in things like this.

675
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,349
Hey, it must be your chauffeur.

676
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,185
Wake up! It's your chauffeur.

677
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,354
Oh, my, I hit your bumper
while parking my car.

678
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,399
This may cost a lot. What should I do?

679
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,115
What? Where did that jerk hit?

680
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,664
Damn it, blood…

681
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,376
Oops, I forgot to write
that I hit it with your head.

682
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,421
You… you're that red-haired girl, right?

683
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,464
Yes. So you remember me.

684
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,550
Aren't you just so glad to see me again?

685
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,009
-Damn it.
-Where are you going?

686
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,806
Damn, don't make me work twice.

687
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,609
What is this?

688
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,279
Damn it.

689
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,321
Untie me, right now!

690
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,158
Why are you doing this every time we meet?

691
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,912
Where's No Tae-nam?

692
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,456
Damn it, how should I know?

693
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm sure he's hiding somewhere,
so he won't get caught.

694
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,919
So you know that No Tae-nam ran away?

695
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,216
Wait.

696
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,427
Mute that jerk first.

697
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,220
Can't you talk on the phone outside?

698
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,890
No. I'll freeze to death
if I talk on the phone outside.

699
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,350
Open your mouth.

700
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,312
Shut up!

701
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,442
I found the guy Mr. No met
after he ran away.

702
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,693
Really?

703
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,655
I'm sure he silenced him.
Do you think he'll talk?

704
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,617
So I'm going to give him ten chances.

705
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,618
Ten chances?

706
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,413
-Anyway, you need to hurry.
-Okay, I'll call you.

707
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,581
Unmute him.

708
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,837
I'm asking you one last time.
Where is No Tae-nam?

709
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,673
I don't know! I don't! I seriously don't!

710
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,427
This is why I don't talk.

711
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,723
You know what happened to Alan on that day
when he tried to avoid talking, right?

712
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,650
You have ten fingers,
so I'm going to ask only ten times.

713
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,693
Wait!

714
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,737
Hey!

715
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,032
Why are you doing this?
What did I even do?

716
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,075
You?

717
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,703
Illegal gambling, aiding
and abetting No Tae-nam's desertion.

718
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,373
And sharing the illegal video
of Han Se-na.

719
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,374
How is that a crime?

720
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,086
It was just a group of guys sharing porn!
How is that a crime?

721
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,754
What?

722
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,216
You bastard!

723
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,476
What the heck?

724
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,812
Did you really cut it?

725
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,273
Weren't you just trying to scare him?

726
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,484
What this bastard said
made me put force in my hands.

727
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,487
Okay, I approve.

728
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,989
Please let me go!

729
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,783
I really don't know where he is!

730
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,745
I only know what he's trying to do!
That's all I know!

731
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,038
What is he trying to do?

732
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,707
He said he's going to stow away.

733
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,625
He said he'll be dragged back
into the military if he gets caught,

734
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,752
so he'll run away on a ship.

735
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,380
But he can't do that all by himself.

736
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,798
Who's helping him?

737
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,466
Say it.

738
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,468
You have to hurry to the hospital
if you want to put your finger back on.

739
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,304
Seriously…

740
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,098
Tae-nam will kill me if he finds out…

741
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,642
You're going to protect me.

742
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,853
Right?

743
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,282
UNKNOWN NUMBER

744
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,913
Mr. No?

745
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,500
You sound like you've been waiting
for me to call you.

746
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,919
Sir, where are you?

747
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,463
You had me win the trial,

748
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,508
and you've been working so hard
picking up after me.

749
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,804
I can't call my mother,

750
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,808
so just deliver my words.
I'm departing Korea.

751
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,560
Sir.

752
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,772
So next week will be your inauguration
as the CEO of IM?

753
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,611
Are you happy to send me to the military
and take my place?

754
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,947
Everyone gossiped about me
that I became the CEO because of my mom,

755
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,784
but you know how hard
I worked for the company.

756
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,160
You know that!

757
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,663
Even if my mom
doesn't acknowledge it, you should!

758
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,123
Please calm down and come back, sir.

759
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,958
Please, I beg you.

760
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,543
To my mother,

761
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,962
you're also just another tool.

762
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,590
Keep that in mind.

763
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,218
And,

764
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,512
I won't obey my mom's orders anymore.

765
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:37,474
Just how long are you going
to give General No a hard time?

766
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,649
DOH BAE-MAN

767
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,947
Mr. No just called.

768
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,583
You're here.

769
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,920
It looks like he's trying to go to China.

770
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,423
I just got information about the dock
and I'm on my way there.

771
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,341
Never let Mr. No get out.

772
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,009
Never!

773
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,302
Of course, I'll stop him.

774
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:18,098
If I fail, then everything I've done
will be all for nothing.

775
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,454
Okay.

776
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,194
What the heck?

777
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,665
What?

778
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,667
What do you mean, "What?".

779
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,087
You totally fell for the trap.

780
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,425
Military Doh.

781
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,012
You walked into the lion's den
with your own feet.

782
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,349
I can't ride a small boat. I get seasick.

783
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,185
I got a private jet through my friend.

784
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,020
Wow, you play big.

785
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,608
Then what's the reason for us
to do a stowaway show

786
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,070
by making someone play you?

787
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,697
I'm sure my lawyer

788
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,034
will order that serviceperson
who looks like a Doberman to find me.

789
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,453
A serviceperson who looks like a Doberman?

790
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,040
Is there another bastard
who looks like a Doberman?

791
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,501
That's not a common look.

792
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,003
What the heck?
Do you know who Doh Bae-man is?

793
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,257
Of course I do.

794
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,594
He's my only enemy under the same sky.

795
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,015
So you used your brain?

796
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,401
You're not the only one
who uses the brain.

797
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,236
Hey, what are you doing?

798
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,572
Turn the boat!

799
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,949
Turn it!

800
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,450
Turn the boat!

801
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,511
Bolt!

802
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,764
Bolt, did you miss me?

803
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,933
I've missed you so much too.

804
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,103
From now on,
we'll be together no matter where I go.

805
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,605
I will never leave you again.

806
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,817
INAUGURATION CEREMONY
FOR THE 50TH MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

807
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,273
I will put your dog
in the animal section for our jet.

808
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,860
Bolt. See you later.

809
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,921
Sir.

810
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,924
What would you like
for dinner after you board?

811
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:26,596
I want a glass of Champagne
and top grade Korean beef steak.

812
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,641
How about top grade grilled eel?

813
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,143
Trainee 13!

814
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,440
-Red hair…
-No Tae-nam, get up!

815
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,153
Are you the red-haired wench
Alan talked about?

816
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,155
And you're a runaway soldier.

817
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,408
How did you know I was…

818
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,119
Now, it's time for you
to go back to the military.

819
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,080
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Do you think I'll go back there?

820
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,417
That jerk…

821
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,591
Why is he running?

822
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,926
"Gyotosamgul."

823
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,722
-A clever rabbit digs many holes.
-How adorable.

824
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,141
-Is he a Doberman?
-Yes.

825
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,684
You're so handsome.

826
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,103
To No Tae-nam, Bolt is his only family.

827
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,229
Bye.

828
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,691
If he departs Korea,
I'm sure he will take Bolt with him.

829
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,785
-What?
-Get out.

830
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,328
-Move.
-Hey!

831
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:34,831
Trainee 13!

832
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,460
You run quite well.
Want to go back and keep running?

833
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,545
Let's go! One! Two!

834
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:44,340
One! Two! One! Two!

835
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,761
-Get out.
-Gosh.

836
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,436
We meet again.

837
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,316
What the heck?

838
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,957
Bae-man is here?

839
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,382
Show him some hospitality!

840
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,467
-Yes, boss!
-Yes, boss!

841
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,843
Hey, destroy him!

842
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,821
Why are there so many of them?

843
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:52,534
You look like you've warmed up,
so how about we get to the real game?

844
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,662
It will be different this time.

845
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,374
North Korean military guy!

846
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,173
He's a North Korean military guy
I specially hired this time.

847
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,343
He was a class 1 bodyguard.

848
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,430
Wow, I get to see a South Korean
military prosecutor too.

849
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,808
I'm seeing many great things
after coming here.

850
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,825
Wow. Your gaze is different, yes.

851
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,370
They're savage. Stop.

852
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,166
Hey, take your time, okay?

853
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,584
I need to warm up too.

854
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,360
Let's go now.

855
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,114
What the…

856
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,867
I'm not going back
to the military! No way!

857
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,663
What's wrong with him? Is she okay?

858
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,836
Hey, come in!

859
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,422
Why? Is diving into the water
going to give you ideas?

860
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,798
I'm done warming up.

861
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:31,799
Come in.

862
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,511
-Hey, go pull him out.
-Hey, go on.

863
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,514
-Pull him out!
-Pull him out! What are you doing?

864
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,933
-I can't swim.
-None of you can swim?

865
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,229
Hey, North Korean military guy,
go pull him out.

866
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,897
I did not learn to swim.

867
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,900
You were a class 1 bodyguard
and you can't swim? You bastard!

868
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,527
Hey, North Korean military guy!

869
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,321
I'm a South Korean military guy
with guts, you bastard!

870
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,531
Hey, you bastard!

871
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,491
-Come out, you bastard!
-You bastard!

872
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,159
-He's quite tenacious.
-Come in, you bastard!

873
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,203
-This is really pissing me off!
-It's nice.

874
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,330
Military Prosecutor!

875
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,208
What the heck?

876
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,294
-The maritime police are here!
-Just go now!

877
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,963
-Hurry!
-Military Doh, you bastard!

878
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,674
I'll get you next time! Just wait and see!

879
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,926
See you next time!

880
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,554
Stop!

881
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,104
Now, one, two, three!

882
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,148
Good.

883
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,693
How did you know I was here?

884
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,904
I'll explain what happened
when we get on land.

885
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,030
It's freezing.

886
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,449
It was a perfect timing, Yoon Sang-ki.

887
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,951
Pull!

888
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,164
Watch out!

889
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,338
-Wow.
-What happened?

890
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,756
He collapsed.

891
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,882
Thank you.

892
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,301
-Who's he?
-What's going on?

893
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,012
By the way, what did he do?

894
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,555
He's a runaway soldier.

895
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,099
You just need to transfer him
to the military investigation team.

896
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,642
A runaway soldier?

897
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,521
You'll go to the military prison,

898
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,857
and your period of service
will get longer too.

899
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,942
Congrats, No Tae-nam.

900
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,320
No!

901
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,155
Please transfer him.

902
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,869
No!

903
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,371
-Nice!
-Awesome!

904
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,707
UPLOADING THE SELECTED VIDEO FILE

905
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,751
NO TAE-NAM GOT CAUGHT AT THE AIRPORT

906
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,711
HIS MOM IS A GENERAL, BUT HE'S A LOSER

907
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,215
Breaking news.

908
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,468
Former CEO No Tae-nam
of IM Defense Industry,

909
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:42,388
who was indicted for the charge of rape
and got acquitted from the military trial,

910
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,892
ran away from his base
while he was in training,

911
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,186
and got arrested at the airport.

912
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,355
Due to Former CEO No's
continuous wrongdoings,

913
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,191
the stock prices of IM Defense Industry
which showed a small increase last week,

914
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,192
have dropped dramatically.

915
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,110
The owner risk of IM Defense Industry…

916
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,945
Recently,

917
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,573
our military has lost
the trust of the people

918
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,451
and faced a big crisis
due to several incidents.

919
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,577
Did you get the text?

920
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,372
-My fellow servicepeople
-Hurry and check it.

921
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,040
and everyone working in national defense.

922
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,376
-What is it?
-In this serious situation,

923
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,879
I am now taking the position
of Minister of National Defense,

924
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,006
-Isn't General No here?
-therefore I feel

925
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,758
the heavy responsibility for…

926
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,721
He ran away, and he got caught
trying to depart Korea.

927
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,889
General No's son did?

928
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,392
-What's wrong with him?
-General No's son did.

929
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,188
-He ran away?
-What's going on?

930
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:35,525
As of today, I will make…

931
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,403
-our military new…
-Division Commander.

932
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,612
Division Commander.

933
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,324
General, please say something!

934
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,577
-Please make way!
-General, where is your son?

935
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,287
General!

936
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,082
Former CEO No
of IM Defense Industry got arrested

937
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,917
for the charges of military desertion.

938
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,461
Seeing how Former CEO No
got arrested at the airport,

939
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,257
many are speculating that
he might've planned to leave the country,

940
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,008
and the fury of citizens

941
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,553
who were at the scene
are pouring out on social media.

942
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:07,640
Former CEO No was found innocent
at the trial he was in before,

943
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,394
but now, everyone's interested in
how the military prosecution will sentence

944
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,771
his charge of military desertion.

945
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,194
DOH BAE-MAN

946
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,786
Did you get the parcel?

947
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,956
I know that
the monthly payment isn't enough,

948
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,624
but as I'm a serviceperson,

949
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,294
I'll only accept payment
from the government from now on.

950
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,755
Therefore, I refuse to renew the contract.

951
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,631
Salute.

952
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,149
Let go!

953
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,859
Let go! Hey, let go!

954
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,277
-Hold still!
-Let go!

955
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,904
I'm not going in there!

956
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,655
I'm not!

957
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,407
-Hey, let go!
-Go in!

958
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,368
I'm not going in! I'm not going in there!

959
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,369
Let go!

960
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,665
Hey!

961
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,627
The one you should be angry at isn't me.

962
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,629
It's No Tae-nam.

963
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:21,923
Hey, what's this?

964
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,925
Hey, I'll give you money!

965
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:24,967
Hey!

966
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,261
Hey, open this! Open this!

967
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,604
Are you working late?

968
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,023
I must be off duty now.

969
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,865
You did a great job
catching No Tae-nam today.

970
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,992
You were number one
on trending searches too.

971
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,120
I didn't do it alone.

972
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,790
You know how to say things like that too?

973
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,669
You asked me

974
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,172
why I chose you for my revenge.

975
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,467
Because in here,

976
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:10,763
the justice discussed by society
doesn't apply at all.

977
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:18,187
Someone who doesn't hesitate to get dirty
in order to fight in the dirt.

978
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,897
You bastard!

979
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,817
Someone who charges those
who got away with their past crimes

980
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,652
with new crimes.

981
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,822
He'll run away anytime
if he has the chance

982
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:30,324
wihout considering the consequences
because he couldn't stand it anymore

983
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,578
and he must've jumped over the wall,
thinking that his mother

984
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,246
would take care of it.

985
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:39,876
Someone who throws bait
for the target of vengeance.

986
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,589
Someone who's too competent
that I do not want to be enemies with.

987
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,347
And you didn't want to fight
with that someone as your opponent?

988
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,816
Open the door.

989
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,111
This interrogation
is scripted already, right?

990
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,530
Are you having fun
because I'm playing along?

991
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,199
Say your official rank and name!

992
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,409
Make No Tae-nam your dog.

993
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,702
This is Search Battalion
Commander Won Ki-choon,

994
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,080
who saved his subordinate
from the minefield.

995
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,749
But why is the hero of mines
the first target?

996
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,209
Did you plan this too?

997
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,672
I'm sure he found out about something.

998
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,006
One thing is for sure.

999
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,883
Doh Bae-man now turned himself

1000
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,718
against you and me.

1001
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:20,810
