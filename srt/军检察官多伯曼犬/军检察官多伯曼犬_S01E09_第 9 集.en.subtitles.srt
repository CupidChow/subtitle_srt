1
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,192
THE CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
GROUPS, ORGANIZATION,

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,318
AND LOCATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,486
AND ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,612
WE STRICTLY FOLLOWED COVID-19
QUARANTINE REGULATIONS AND CHILD

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,947
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,395
We will now begin. Say your name,
official rank, and affiliation.

7
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,149
9 DAYS AGO

8
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,818
There's something else
I'm really curious about.

9
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,530
It's about Won Ki-choon's leg.

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,366
It's been cut off.

11
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,496
I cut it off.

12
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,053
You

13
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,554
cut his leg off yourself?

14
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,477
I didn't expect for you to get blood
on your own hands. That's unexpected.

15
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,273
It's my fault that I dared to think
that I know you well.

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,277
I don't care about getting blood
on my hands. I just need to wash them.

17
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,447
It's better than to just sit
and watch everything go wrong.

18
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,994
You can go now. I need to rest.

19
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,496
I have an important report.

20
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,750
-What is it?
-It's about Cha Woo-in's identity.

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,795
You'll be surprised.

22
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,297
Will I?

23
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,302
She's the daughter
of the late Cha Ho-chul.

24
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,848
Did you think that I didn't know?

25
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,727
I'm sure Cha Woo-in couldn't even imagine…

26
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,490
that I've been watching her since the day
she became a military prosecutor.

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,372
Then why are you letting her be?

28
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,166
I'm just observing her for now.

29
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,460
And it's ridiculous for me
to let one petty captain bother me.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,506
CEO Noh's trial, his desertion,
and Lieutenant Colonel Won Ki-choon…

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,009
She keeps getting involved with you.

32
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,720
And she's a military prosecutor,

33
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,514
who can bring a charge
against a serviceperson.

34
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,975
And so is Doh Bae-man.

35
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,897
Doh Bae-man only pursued money
while working for me,

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,566
but he totally changed
after he met Cha Woo-in.

37
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,819
I'm sure they're intertwined
through something.

38
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,113
We must be careful of those two.

39
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,074
But I'm actually worried about you.

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,829
You only realized
Cha Woo-in's true identity now.

41
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,166
You just realized now
that there's a spy right under my nose.

42
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,753
How will you

43
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,047
run IM in my place like that?

44
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,886
You can go now.

45
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,933
Cha Woo-in has been
preparing for a long time

46
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,309
to stand in front of you.

47
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,771
You must never underestimate that.

48
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,982
And now,

49
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,612
please address me as the CEO of IM.

50
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,408
I do not want
to be called a lawyer anymore.

51
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,518
You only realized
Cha Woo-in's true identity now.

52
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,854
You just realized now
that there's a spy right under my nose.

53
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,736
PERSONAL DETAILS
CHA WOO-IN

54
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,114
A spy.

55
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,617
She's been

56
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,121
thinking of Cha Woo-in as a spy?

57
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,127
A monster that's beyond our imagination.

58
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,548
People say monsters and devils
are created because they can't accept

59
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,676
that a human being would do such a thing.

60
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,178
If she cut off his completely normal leg…

61
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,805
Then Noh Hwa-young

62
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,140
truly is a monster.

63
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,935
In order to fight a monster,
we must make the first attack.

64
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,854
Schedule a press conference for tomorrow.

65
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,938
Press conference?

66
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,109
Let's make the public sentiment explode
with Sergeant Koo's confession.

67
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,945
The testimony is important,

68
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,614
but we also need evidence
to use as a smoking gun.

69
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,993
Kim Han-yong's brother is
getting brain surgery tomorrow.

70
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,162
Wait. They said the surgery
will be difficult

71
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,080
because of the material in the brain.

72
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,375
And Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan
gave that diagnosis.

73
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,461
And he's their accomplice.

74
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,422
So it's a wrong diagnosis?

75
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,631
We can infer that

76
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,509
they've stopped the surgery
to cover the truth up.

77
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,430
He's a rotten doctor, who even
switched the CT scan images.

78
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,391
We already found a brain specialist
to operate on him.

79
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,187
Prosecutor Doh, please meet Kim Han-yong
and get his consent for the surgery.

80
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,563
Is it…

81
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,358
really okay for my brother to get surgery?

82
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,778
It's taking out what's stuck in his brain,

83
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,488
so we must prepare for the worst.

84
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,116
Consenting is completely up to you.

85
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,749
-I know it's not an easy decision to make.
-No.

86
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,296
The choice is up to my brother.

87
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,009
He always told me to make a choice,

88
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,385
if I have 1% of courage.

89
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,013
Though it's 1%,

90
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,808
it's totally different to zero,
which means doing nothing.

91
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,188
That's why I fired a gun
at the bookstore, too.

92
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,876
-Did you meet Kim Han-yong?
-Yes.

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,504
Did he consent to the surgery?

94
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,758
Let's do it with 1% of courage,
not 1% of possibility.

95
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,593
What?

96
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,679
That's what Kim Han-yong said.

97
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,765
Did he?

98
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,061
We must expose the one
behind this Won Ki-choon case,

99
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,438
for Kim Han-yong's brother.

100
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,067
Yes, and for Kim Han-yong
who made a difficult decision.

101
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,194
We must find evidence

102
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,363
and damage Noh Hwa-young.

103
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,367
Prosecutor Cha.

104
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,619
Put it on video call mode
for a moment, okay?

105
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,997
What? All of a sudden?

106
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,957
Is something wrong?

107
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,128
What…

108
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,504
Come here.

109
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,382
Isn't that Bolt?

110
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,719
Yes. I couldn't help but take him in.

111
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,221
Gosh, that jerk CEO Kang.

112
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,182
I was actually worried about him,

113
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,559
but I'm relieved to see him there.

114
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,363
Why?

115
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,870
Tomorrow is the day of the surgery

116
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,372
and Sergeant Koo's press conference.

117
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,124
It'll be such an important day.

118
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,418
We will either overturn the situation,

119
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,963
or the situation will overturn us.
It'll be the day of a decisive battle.

120
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,549
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,305
Now, I shall go to bed.

122
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,850
-Good night and sweet dreams.
-Good night, Prosecutor Cha, and…

123
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
Gosh, she's so damn rude.

124
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,234
Come here. Time to sleep.

125
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,610
Come, it's time to sleep.

126
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,702
Is this the east?
I should sleep like this.

127
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,912
Come here. Yes.

128
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,457
Bolt, come up here. No?

129
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,418
Yes, let's go. What are we doing here?

130
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,420
Let's go. Bolt, come. Let's go.

131
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,220
Let's go.

132
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,180
Hey.

133
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,891
Hey, this is trespassing, okay?

134
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,893
And this is the house of a detective!

135
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:26,232
Why should I suffer outside
when there's my beloved aunt's house here?

136
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,568
Wow. Soybean paste stew.

137
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,569
Auntie, hold this.

138
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,903
Hey!

139
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,323
A home-cooked meal
without side dishes is the best.

140
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,616
I'm hungry.

141
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,746
Auntie.

142
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,374
-Wash his feet for me, please.
-You little…

143
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,377
That was doggone scary.

144
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,379
Auntie, you make good stew.

145
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,215
It's lonely to be alone.

146
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,932
We found the witness
of the Won Ki-choon case.

147
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,894
We'll expose it
at a press conference tomorrow.

148
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,272
But you got punished.

149
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,356
Will it be okay?

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,026
So I'm going to face it head-on
with a press conference.

151
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,237
Auntie, you know that I'm a fighter.

152
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,573
A fighter who doesn't let go once I bite.

153
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,245
And I was a witness, too.

154
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,000
The only witness
of Mom and Dad's accident.

155
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,546
Bae-man, do you
really believe there's a different reason

156
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,258
behind the car accident 20 years ago?

157
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,178
Yes.

158
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,348
I'm convinced.

159
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,398
As soon as I get a search warrant
for Won Ki-choon's house,

160
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,151
that's the real beginning for me.

161
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,527
The beginning?

162
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,077
Noh Hwa-young must've designed
the hero of mines,

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,536
but there's no physical proof.

164
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,916
We only have strong suspicion for now.
That's why I'm going to interrogate him.

165
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,293
An interrogation in a patient's room…

166
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
I hate this probation.

167
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,716
You're alone, so be extra careful.

168
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,845
It's okay even if I fail because
the second purpose is the real deal.

169
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,058
I will turn the hero of mines
into a real mine

170
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,768
that explodes when stepped on.

171
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,115
You bastard!

172
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,869
How dare you come in here?

173
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,955
I'm here for a visit.

174
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,960
Salute.

175
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,298
It's been several months
since you had your accident,

176
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,884
but you still cannot get used to it.

177
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,970
Like your leg was cut off
not too long ago.

178
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,432
What?

179
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,562
Gosh

180
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,732
You reject the nurses
and inject the painkiller yourself.

181
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,568
You must have a lot to hide.

182
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,737
Well,

183
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,949
you're suddenly starring in a show
someone scripted as the main cast,

184
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,284
I guess you can't help it.

185
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,579
But the problem is,

186
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,789
that show, which seemed
it just required you

187
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,666
to play along just as it was scripted,

188
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,295
suddenly turned into a horrible reality.

189
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,049
You don't need to play a hero anymore.

190
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,385
Because you've become a real hero now.

191
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,306
I will

192
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,142
put an end to that show today.

193
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,353
Don't try to play any dirty tricks!
Get lost!

194
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,189
There was a witness that day.

195
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,650
He saw you shooting
the Search Company Commander

196
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,818
in a friendly fire.

197
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,362
I said, who's there?

198
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,537
What?

199
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,166
Sergeant Koo is going to expose everything

200
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,709
at the press conference today.

201
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,213
"Expose?"

202
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,346
What if you take all the blame?

203
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,849
If the story says
that you cut off your own leg

204
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,976
and made up the heroic tale…

205
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,105
You'll fall
from being Korea's favorite hero

206
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,274
to Korea's craziest bastard overnight.

207
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,074
Think about it.

208
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,660
You only did
what that person told you to do.

209
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,246
And that person cut your leg off, too.

210
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,751
They're the designer and perpetrator
of this case, and you're the victim.

211
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,503
You, Lieutenant Colonel,

212
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,089
just had to play along against your will.

213
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,594
So just say one thing. Either
that person's name, rank, or position.

214
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,682
Then I'll help you
through plea bargaining.

215
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,107
Noh…

216
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,693
Noh…

217
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,074
No wonder you're a jerk! You don't even
knock on the door! Get out!

218
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,285
Get this bastard out!

219
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,661
Leave, please.

220
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,541
You're missing
such a great chance like this.

221
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,169
Then, Search Battalion Commander
Won Ki-choon,

222
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,630
I'll come see you again,
with an arrest warrant.

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,425
Salute.

224
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,729
The one who planned everything

225
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,230
was indeed Noh Hwa-young.

226
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,958
you're suddenly starring in a show
someone scripted as the main cast,

227
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,293
I guess you can't help it.

228
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,544
What? A show?

229
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,255
Doh Bae-man, that lunatic!

230
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,550
Do you think
I'll be shaken by what you say?

231
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,138
I'm a hero!

232
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,223
A real hero!

233
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,319
DIVISION COMMANDER NOH HWA-YOUNG

234
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,696
I hereby report regarding the progress

235
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,241
of the investigation on corruption
in military supply.

236
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,162
According to the investigation, some of
the supply provided to the 4th Division,

237
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,998
including 257 daily…

238
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,293
Daily outdoor uniform…

239
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,131
The 257 of them, and 419 berets…

240
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:13,138
The 419 of them were confirmed
to be of low quality, below standards.

241
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,935
The person in charge of supply
and the company exchanged bribes…

242
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,941
I'm in a meeting right now.

243
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,109
Division Commander.

244
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,944
It looks like…

245
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,696
Doh Bae-man knows everything.

246
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,741
There was a witness
among our Search Battalion members.

247
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,910
He said he'll gather all of the reporters

248
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,829
and expose everything.

249
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,622
If that gets revealed…

250
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,625
I'm dead.

251
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,794
Let's talk later.

252
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,046
Division Commander!

253
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,466
It seems Doh Bae-man also figured out

254
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,427
that you cut my leg off.

255
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,348
Okay.

256
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,019
-Keep going.
-Sure.

257
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,688
And due to the connection
between the food supply company

258
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,107
and the supply officer,
some of the bases--

259
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,317
Those who gave money
and who got the money…

260
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,819
Arrest all of them.

261
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,740
I'll hear the rest of the report later.
You can leave now.

262
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,241
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,242
Salute!

264
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,426
The phone call saved me.
It really saved me.

265
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,471
The materials were not ready yet.
That was really close.

266
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,267
I got away with it today, again.

267
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,478
The military clock still ticks,

268
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,104
though it's upside down.

269
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,233
By the way,

270
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,945
did something happen
to the Division Commander?

271
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,656
I have a bad feeling about this…

272
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,785
Anyway…

273
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,957
Where's the foot bath tub?

274
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,961
Since Doh Bae-man isn't here,
I have no one to give me a massage.

275
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,555
If you're on probation, just sit
at your desk! Why are you here?

276
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,640
Get out!

277
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,476
I have a report
about Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon.

278
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,815
Are you feeling itchy
because of your probation?

279
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,942
I was feeling great today,

280
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,444
so why did you have to
stop the military clock?

281
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,280
Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon
committed friendly fire.

282
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,741
Hey, do you have a grudge

283
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,119
against Battalion Commander Won
or something?

284
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,914
The Company Commander was
injured by gunfire, not by a mine.

285
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,543
That's enough of your nonsense!

286
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,087
The actions after the friendly fire
were even worse.

287
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,964
He won over a medical officer, too.

288
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,967
This is impossible
without involvement of a superior.

289
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,095
What? Win over? Involvement of a superior?

290
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,806
You're going overboard, aren't you?

291
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,934
Do you want me to charge you
and get you sacked?

292
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,270
Just tell me. I'll get you
out of here right now!

293
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,606
You must issue a warrant
for Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon.

294
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,607
What?

295
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,318
A warrant?

296
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,486
A warrant?

297
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,238
Okay, sure.

298
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,241
I will tell you my decision
as the Staff Judge Advocate.

299
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,367
Listen carefully.

300
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,829
Based on any possibilities
to vindicate the main criminal charges,

301
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,707
I can't acknowledge the necessity
of confinement. Got it?

302
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,375
Staff Judge Advocate.

303
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,753
Cha Woo-in, you're a great example
of confirmation bias.

304
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,463
When a prosecutor targets someone,

305
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,174
even without evidence,

306
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,259
anyone can become a criminal.

307
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,512
That's why the people are
criticizing prosecutors,

308
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,015
calling them dogs and perverts!

309
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,270
That's not something I should hear from
you, who doesn't even read my reports.

310
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,314
You…

311
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,941
Get lost right now!

312
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,484
Get lost!

313
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,777
Yes, sir.

314
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,780
But I did give you a chance.
Please keep that in mind.

315
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,365
What?

316
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,117
A chance?

317
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,873
In 30 minutes, the search battalion
member who was at the scene

318
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,541
will have a press conference.

319
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,960
What?

320
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,675
Sergeant Koo Hyun-seok, the only witness

321
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,719
to Battalion Commander Won's
friendly fire,

322
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,347
will tell the truth
in front of all people of Korea.

323
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,147
When the truth gets revealed,
the public opinion will be in turmoil,

324
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,067
and you'll be completely responsible
for a poor investigation.

325
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,694
Why will I?

326
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,948
Because you just rejected
the chance I just gave you.

327
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,913
You always told me to be
a serviceperson than a prosecutor.

328
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,166
Yes, right now, I'm a serviceperson.

329
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,711
Because a serviceperson never bends,
and would rather break.

330
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,175
Hey, Cha Woo-in.

331
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,718
Stop right there!

332
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,263
I will ask you one last time.

333
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,139
Issue a warrant for Won Ki-choon

334
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,141
and lift my probation, please.

335
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,019
And request the corps to lift
the suspension on Captain Doh.

336
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,022
Why are you making so many demands?

337
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,233
Make your decision now. We have no time.

338
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,278
All right.

339
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,989
I'll make a judgment
after watching the press conference.

340
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,658
Yes, sir.

341
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,041
Gosh, seriously.

342
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,337
Hold on.

343
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,091
What if I get in trouble, too?

344
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,553
DMZ MINE EXPLOSION
PRESS CONFERENCE TO REVEAL THE TRUTH

345
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,442
There are many reporters here.
Can you do it?

346
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,443
Yes!

347
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,862
I'll be there soon, sir!

348
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,949
Your voice sounds great. You sound
totally different from yesterday.

349
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,870
I decided to think
only about the Company Commander today.

350
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,705
He must be in surgery now.

351
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,332
I hope it goes well.

352
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,840
What's wrong?

353
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,759
What's going on?

354
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,493
Bang!

355
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,745
It's Battalion Commander Won.

356
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,375
What should I do?

357
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,294
Keep your phone on call mode.

358
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,091
Military Prosecutor.

359
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,180
SERGEANT KOO

360
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,644
It's almost time.
Aren't you getting started?

361
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,562
Ah, I have to finish my call first.

362
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,855
Please wait.

363
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,077
SERGEANT KOO

364
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,788
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

365
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,581
DOH BAE-MAN

366
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,171
DMZ MINE EXPLOSION
PRESS CONFERENCE TO REVEAL THE TRUTH

367
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,715
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

368
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,143
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

369
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,271
I must go outside of the base now.

370
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,857
-Why?
-Prosecutor Doh isn't picking up.

371
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,192
Something must've gone wrong
at the conference.

372
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,156
Subsection Chief Yoon,
Subsection Chief Ahn.

373
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,449
Can you help me, please?

374
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,289
It's time for your red-haired
alter ego to come out, right?

375
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,041
You knew?

376
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,921
When I come outside and see red hair,
I get startled without realizing it.

377
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,883
Don't worry.

378
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,676
I only use it for hunting.

379
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,012
I see. Hunting.

380
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,483
What are you doing?

381
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,278
Her cough won't stop!

382
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm sorry, Subsection Chief
Ahn Yoo-ra. Please be well.

383
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,742
Goodbye. Salute.

384
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,577
-Salute.
-Let them pass.

385
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,835
-Military Prosecutor.
-Nice!

386
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,128
Yes!

387
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,676
We're busy people, you know!

388
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,970
Sergeant Koo is coming.
If you wait for a moment…

389
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,725
It's obvious
that he either changed his mind or hid.

390
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,727
The press conference won't happen.

391
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,687
-Move. Let us go!
-Reporter.

392
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,981
You're that military prosecutor
who got punished!

393
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,107
How can we trust you?

394
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,943
Sergeant Koo?

395
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,611
Where are you?

396
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,658
Gosh, I told you not to take that road!
That road always has a traffic jam!

397
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,451
Go 50 more meters

398
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,746
and look at 1 o'clock, and there's
a byroad. Take that byroad--

399
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,831
What?

400
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,042
There's something bigger?

401
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,962
Prosecutor.

402
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,214
Where's Sergeant Koo?

403
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,758
Yes. Good grief.

404
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,926
That's not the place…

405
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,970
Have a seat and wait. I'll go bring him.

406
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,179
Yes.

407
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,683
Yes, turn right there…

408
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,935
Sergeant Koo took the wrong road.

409
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,897
But that's not the problem.
There's something bigger.

410
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,440
-Something bigger?
-Something bigger.

411
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,775
-What is it?
-A scoop.

412
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,151
-Are you sure?
-A scoop.

413
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,653
Go have a seat. I'm sure.

414
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,575
DETECTIVE DOH SOO-KYUNG

415
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,914
Prosecutor Cha, it's me.

416
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,333
Won Ki-choon snatched
Sergeant Koo on the way.

417
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,752
So it was Won Ki-choon's doing.

418
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,796
I'm outside the base now
and I'm on my way.

419
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,631
What?

420
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,882
How did you know?

421
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,553
How did you get out of there
without Staff Judge Advocate knowing…

422
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,934
I guess you could.

423
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,145
Then I'll go to Sergeant Koo.

424
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,604
-You…
-No.

425
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,607
I'll send him there safely,
so please give me the location.

426
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,526
And keep the reporters there.

427
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,361
That's an order.

428
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,244
Since it was a special order
from the hero of mines,

429
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,581
I only sent the boys who served
in the Special Warfare Command.

430
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,708
You'll feel reassured.

431
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,420
Tell CEO Yong Moon-goo I said thank you.

432
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,101
You dared to expose me?

433
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,020
Me, who was your superior?

434
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,022
This is mutiny, you bastard!

435
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,525
I'm not a serviceperson anymore!

436
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,527
I'm not your subordinate!

437
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,156
I will tell them everything,

438
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,992
everything I saw!

439
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,746
You got bribed by Doh Bae-man, didn't you?

440
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,165
How dare you do this to me, you bastard!

441
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,543
You're not well,
so don't waste your energy.

442
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,671
We have methods for bastards like him.

443
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,507
A video call with his family

444
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,467
will change his mind.

445
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,555
What the heck? The call was on?

446
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,016
So this situation aired live.

447
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,226
MILITARY PROSECUTOR DOH BAE-MAN

448
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,687
Gosh, this is because
mobile carriers sell unlimited plans.

449
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,815
There's only one thing left to do

450
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,234
to this bastard who lost
his sense of fear.

451
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,736
Boys, get to it!

452
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,306
What the heck?

453
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,891
Is that a girl?

454
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,563
She has a gun!

455
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,480
Come out here.

456
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,985
No, you can't!

457
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,158
There's a car out there, so take off now.

458
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,746
-What?
-Don't hesitate. Just go.

459
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,373
So many people are waiting
for you right now.

460
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,002
-And close the door when you leave.
-Stop!

461
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,631
-Boss!
-Boss!

462
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,883
-What the heck?
-What's this?

463
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,426
-It's a BB?
-What?

464
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,182
-Stop!
-That stings!

465
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,041
Sergeant Koo!

466
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,629
Are you okay?

467
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,423
Let's go.

468
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,511
Everyone, if you're busy,
you can leave now,

469
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,389
but if you do, you're going to miss
a huge exclusive story.

470
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,558
You know who Prosecutor Doh is!

471
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,352
Remember the "Imperial Military Service?"

472
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,312
He's a goose that lays golden eggs!

473
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,274
If you all leave now, you'll regret it!

474
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,567
Hey, old woman!

475
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,777
Old woman?

476
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,738
Yes, old woman, which means you!

477
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,574
Hey.

478
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,828
How much do you get paid for doing this?
You shouldn't do this.

479
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,289
You must be all busy, so please leave.

480
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
Today's press conference
has been canceled!

481
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,085
-No, it hasn't!
-It's been canceled!

482
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,504
-Please leave, all of you!
-What? Do I get paid?

483
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,050
I'm Detective Doh Soo-kyung
from the Gangnam Police Station.

484
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,846
You don't look very…

485
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,849
You're not a journalist, are you?
Show me your journalist ID.

486
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,310
You don't look normal, either.

487
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,853
You look suspicious, okay?

488
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,273
Why would a detective be here?
This is a military case.

489
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,280
And this case was already
proved in the military court,

490
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,491
and the military prosecutor who broke
the prosthetic leg got punished!

491
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,659
Yes!

492
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,039
That military prosecutor is my nephew!

493
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,332
Happy now?

494
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,751
He's your nephew?

495
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,921
-Hi.
-Just wait and see!

496
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:09,177
My nephew will reveal the truth
behind this case at all cost!

497
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,220
Because he's like a Doberman!

498
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,646
See? I told you!

499
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,083
I…

500
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,753
I am Koo Hyun-seok,
discharged from the Search Battalion

501
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,630
of the 4th Division.

502
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,550
I'm here to expose the truth
of the hero of mines--

503
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,551
Forget it!

504
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,680
How can we trust someone
who lacks the least amount

505
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,391
of common sense
and is late to a press conference?

506
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,643
How can we trust what you say?

507
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,478
The mine exploded quite a while ago,

508
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,439
so why are you blowing the whistle now?

509
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,900
Isn't it because you have
some other purposes?

510
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,824
Prosecutor Doh.

511
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,457
It's because I was scared.

512
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,169
I was so scared that I was the only one

513
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,339
who saw him being shot.

514
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,925
Company Commander!

515
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,389
If I exposed
what happened inside the military

516
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,474
when I was about to get discharged…

517
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,441
I thought I'd die a mysterious death,
without being able to see my mom's face.

518
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,445
I just thought I should
keep it to myself and leave.

519
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,991
That I should leave what happened
in the military in the military.

520
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes,

521
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,293
I turned a blind eye
and kept quiet for myself.

522
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,087
But,

523
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,715
someone who must be punished
turned into a hero,

524
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,884
and the moment of Company
Commander being shot

525
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,011
has not left my head.

526
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,181
I left the letter in the patient's room

527
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,224
to reduce my guilt.

528
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,394
And…

529
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:31,027
Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man
gave me the courage.

530
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,866
Is there evidence
that can prove what you witnessed?

531
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,254
I'm Captain Doh Bae-man,
a military prosecutor.

532
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,381
I will speak, starting now.

533
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,842
First, I will show you the evidence

534
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,469
as the answer to your question.

535
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,484
It was a bullet, not a fragment?

536
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,904
This bullet was taken out
of the Company Commander's head,

537
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,114
who just had surgery.

538
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,786
From what I see, as a military prosecutor,

539
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,412
this is clearly a bullet,

540
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,456
not a fragment of a mine.

541
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,750
Of course, the credibility

542
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,586
will be announced after
a precise authentication process.

543
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,629
In addition,

544
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,591
the Company Commander's
brain surgery was successful.

545
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,804
They said, once he recovers,
he'll be able to testify

546
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,974
about the accident, and live his
daily life without any difficulties.

547
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,269
Then what happened to his leg?

548
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:51,023
Why did Battalion Commander
Won Ki-choon lose his leg?

549
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:55,027
That's the question I've been waiting for.
Did he cut off his own leg

550
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,737
to complete the heroic tale?

551
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,657
Or is someone behind it?

552
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,162
We confirmed that there was an attempt

553
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,373
to kidnap Sergeant Koo while he was
on his way to the press conference

554
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,208
to stop him from exposing the truth.

555
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,801
I'm sure there's someone behind it.

556
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,014
This case isn't just a made-up story
of the hero of mines.

557
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,267
It's a trailer for a colossal gate.

558
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,152
Also, I have a request for
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob.

559
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,987
Please reconsider the punishments

560
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,116
for me and Military Prosecutor Cha Woo-in
so we can re-investigate this case.

561
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,826
Salute.

562
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,268
Who the heck are you? You wench!

563
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,436
Don't come any closer!

564
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,063
Don't you dare come any closer!

565
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,029
It was Noh Hwa-young, wasn't it?

566
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,989
The one who cut your leg off.

567
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,244
And she's the one who ordered you
to commit perjury in court

568
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,496
six years ago
to get rid of CEO Cha Ho-chul.

569
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:29,956
Who are you?

570
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,751
Who do you think I am?

571
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:37,129
Don't tell me
you are going to hurt me who--

572
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,693
When we meet next time,

573
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,945
I will tell you

574
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,656
who I am.

575
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,217
This bullet was taken out
of the Company Commander's head,

576
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,052
who just had surgery.

577
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,056
From what I see, as a military prosecutor,

578
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,518
this is clearly a bullet,
not a fragment of a mine.

579
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,567
Yes, Minister.

580
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,819
Was I wrong to give you that position?

581
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,738
The issues with your son quieted down,

582
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,948
but now, your subordinate
caused a trouble.

583
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,076
I'm now doubtful about
if you're truly capable

584
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,412
of commanding a division.

585
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,581
I trust Lieutenant Colonel Won.

586
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
Didn't you watch the press conference?

587
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,003
If a superior cannot trust
their subordinate, then who would?

588
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,004
What?

589
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,383
Sergeant Koo was won over by Doh Bae-man,
who was displeased about his punishment.

590
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,887
Then what about the friendly fire?
And the bullet found during the surgery?

591
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,306
You know military prosecutors
can exaggerate cases

592
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,267
and make up evidence that does not exist.

593
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,477
Shut up!

594
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,563
I'll take all members
of the Patriotic Society to you tomorrow,

595
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:21,233
so stay right there, come up
with a solution, and report it!

596
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,528
I really cannot let it slide
this time, understood?

597
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,791
Who's that crazy red-haired wench?

598
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,209
Who on earth is she?

599
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,253
How come she knows everything?

600
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,421
How?

601
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,217
What nonsense are you talking?

602
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,552
I did everything you told me to do.

603
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,847
I even gave you

604
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,307
this leg of mine.

605
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,851
And I played dead when you told me to.

606
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,562
For the past 20 years,
I was like your dog.

607
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,858
Calm down.

608
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,611
I have a plan.

609
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,613
When you got rid of CEO Cha Ho-chul,

610
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,115
I took the lead

611
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,283
and lied in court.

612
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,828
And it was for you.

613
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,163
That's not all.

614
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,583
That truck accident
you caused 20 years ago.

615
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,796
The accident in which you hit that young
military investigator couple with a car.

616
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,882
Don't act like you don't know!

617
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,551
Because I remember it clearly!

618
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,014
Doh Bae-man said

619
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,227
that the only thing I did wrong is
doing what you told me to do.

620
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,728
That's enough.

621
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,730
Once you cross the line,

622
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,151
your fate will change.

623
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,657
All right.

624
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,784
I now crossed the line.

625
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,287
What are you going to do now?

626
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,295
We have stepped on a real mine now.

627
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,964
I will not self-destruct.

628
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,674
I will not die alone.

629
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,677
Because I got my insurance
in case this would happen.

630
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,266
You ungrateful bastard.

631
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,979
You, Noh Hwa-young,

632
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,106
Hong Moo-seob, and Lee Jae-sik…

633
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,233
I have a bomb that will blow all of you.

634
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,156
Now, your fates are up to me.

635
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,034
So,

636
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,869
use your brain

637
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,788
and find a way to save me. Understood?

638
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,641
Staff Judge Advocate.

639
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,018
Come to my office right now.

640
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,741
Salute.

641
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,703
Process the arrest
for Battalion Commander Won Ki-choon.

642
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,374
I know we have to
due to the circumstances,

643
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,544
but I'm worried
that it might cause you damage.

644
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,129
Lieutenant Colonel Won came and confessed

645
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,631
that it was all made up.

646
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,803
So everything told
at the press conference was true.

647
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,347
He's willing to be investigated.

648
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,182
And he asked me to help him protect

649
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,976
his last pride as a serviceperson.

650
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,979
I understand.
I'll have him arrested tomorrow morning,

651
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,772
with the minimum number of members.

652
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,399
And…

653
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,734
It's about the punishment

654
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,403
on Captain Doh and Captain Cha.

655
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,155
Maintain their punishments
regardless of the arrest.

656
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,241
You see, actually…

657
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,617
What happened is…

658
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,620
-Stop hesitating and spill it.
-Yes, ma'am.

659
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,581
Their punishments are already lifted.

660
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:05,958
What?

661
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,669
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob ordered it.

662
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,964
He did it without telling me?

663
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,801
Yes, he came to the office of justice
and ordered it himself.

664
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,471
He said that Captain Doh Bae-man
and Captain Cha Woo-in

665
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,515
must be rewarded, not punished.

666
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,018
It looks like
he couldn't ignore the public opinion

667
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,061
formed due to the press conference.

668
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,688
I got it, so you can leave.

669
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,733
Yes, I will carry out your command.

670
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,985
Salute.

671
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,336
The arrest warrant will be out
tomorrow morning.

672
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,212
And he'll be put on the no-fly list.

673
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,922
Yes, sir.

674
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,675
Though your punishment is lifted,
send Subsection Chief Ahn

675
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,761
and Subsection Chief Yoon to the scene.

676
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,012
I will do so, sir.

677
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,474
You were impudent for disobeying me

678
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,977
and going around during your probation,

679
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,021
but the result is good, so…

680
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,939
Well, it can't be helped, right?

681
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,694
Thank you for believing me,
and I'm glad that you're fine.

682
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,949
It's because I'm flexible, that's why.

683
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,035
You know,

684
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:27,706
I could've stopped
the press conference until the end.

685
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,000
-But--
-I'll see you tomorrow.

686
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,838
Okay.

687
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,925
Gosh, that little…

688
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,895
Subsection Chiefs Yoon Sang-ki
and Ahn Yoo-ra are on their way.

689
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,232
Now we can reveal someone who's
behind the case of the hero of mines.

690
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,986
But it seems like Noh Hwa-young
lowered her tail too easily.

691
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,408
She ordered the Staff Judge Advocate
to arrest him herself. I think so, too.

692
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,495
What if she's cut off her tail,

693
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,456
not lowered it?

694
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,221
He must be inside.

695
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,556
I think so.

696
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,099
Shall we just go in?

697
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,817
Damn it.

698
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,288
Good grief.

699
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,417
Damaging my pride for punishing
the military prosecutors is something

700
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:39,588
I can just let slide with my generosity,
but the incident with Won Ki-choon.

701
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,924
If that broke out
along with her son's trial…

702
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,344
Then she must resign immediately!
She always said that the direct boss

703
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:49,431
must be responsible
for the faults of the subordinates.

704
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,184
She dishonored
your graciousness, Minister,

705
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,312
when you even skipped her seniors
to make her a division commander.

706
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,439
And so many male generals resigned

707
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,316
because they were against it!

708
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:06,073
Minister, I'm worried
that the criticism may attack you.

709
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,449
That's right, Minister.

710
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,661
So, are you saying we must sack
the Division Commander?

711
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,622
She is shaking up
the Patriotic Society, too.

712
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,625
I will

713
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,919
only follow your decision.

714
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,672
Division Commander.

715
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,967
I told you to come up with the solution.
Tell me.

716
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,095
I will do as you command, Minister.

717
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,848
I will take my uniform off.

718
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,812
I do not have any regrets or fear

719
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,148
in taking responsibility
for what I said. But,

720
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,860
I will make this clear to you two.

721
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,531
Stabbing a junior and a fellow soldier
in trouble

722
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,286
in the back when not all of the truth
behind the case is revealed.

723
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,454
Do you call that a military spirit?

724
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,416
Noh Hwa-young, are you nuts?

725
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,960
How dare you behave
so impudently to a superior…

726
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,965
Salute!

727
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,801
Division Commander,
I have something urgent to report.

728
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,261
Say it.

729
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,764
Search Battalion Commander
Won Ki-choon is dead.

730
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,350
-Are you sure?
-I am sure.

731
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,894
Our military investigators
confirmed it just now.

732
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,021
How did he die?

733
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,690
We're not sure yet,
but we're assuming it's a suicide.

734
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,484
We found a revolver
owned by Battalion Commander Won

735
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,236
at the scene.

736
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,366
It has been more than a week
since the death

737
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,785
of Battalion Commander Won,
who became famous

738
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,538
as the hero of mines
that turned out to be fabricated.

739
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,291
After the three-day investigation,

740
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,251
there was no sign of murder,

741
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,504
and they only examined
the exterior of the body

742
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,840
as his family is against the autopsy.

743
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:51,720
Today's star is the icon of justice
who has the characteristics of a Doberman.

744
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,973
Gosh, Doh Bae-man, that doggone bastard.

745
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,808
As soon as I get discharged,

746
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,518
I'll kill you first.

747
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,604
He's Military Prosecutor Doh Bae-man.

748
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,938
Thanks to him…

749
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,107
New soldiers are not allowed to watch TV.

750
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,151
The truth that
could've been hidden forever…

751
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,154
You can't touch the remote control.
Be careful, okay?

752
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,703
You know I'm your direct superior, right?

753
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,914
Yes, sir.

754
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,707
This is my gift to you, our newbie.

755
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,043
What is this?

756
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,462
It's my soldier's notebook,
but I memorized it all.

757
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:28,715
Everyone's names, their service numbers,
the specs of guns,

758
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,677
and the levels of the Jindo Dog
DEFCON. Everything's in it,

759
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,345
so you memorize it within a week.

760
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,391
Memorize all of this?
I don't even know my service number.

761
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,977
Want me to give you a tip?

762
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:47,150
Don't stand out. Never stand out.
Then your military life will be very easy.

763
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,738
Follow me. I'll teach you.

764
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,870
Never wear the winter jacket in layers.

765
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,206
Never let it shown over your pants.

766
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,500
Never watch TV while cleaning your rifle.

767
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,795
Never lean on the lockers.
Never shine combat boots with fire.

768
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,965
Never go on your sleeping floor
without organizing the shoes.

769
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,468
Never do these
until you become a corporal.

770
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,638
But you can put a towel around your neck
once you become a corporal.

771
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,766
Never do this, never do that…

772
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,810
What is it that I'm allowed to do?

773
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,895
What about the phone?

774
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,230
Can I use my phone?

775
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,359
Yes, once you become a sergeant,
after your daily tasks are complete.

776
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,944
That makes no sense.

777
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,739
When I become a sergeant,
I will get rid of all of these,

778
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,116
so hang in there until then.

779
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,245
But you and I are only a few months apart.

780
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,164
That's true.

781
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,598
Here.

782
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,401
Always turn your head and smoke
in front of your superior.

783
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,571
It's okay when you're with me,

784
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,240
but be careful
when you're with other superiors.

785
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,871
But you can exhale smoke through your nose
once you become a private first class.

786
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,833
Forget it. I don't want to smoke.

787
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,171
Salute!

788
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,672
I was teaching the new soldier.

789
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,468
Are you Noh Tae-nam? You're
the Division Commander's son, right?

790
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,387
Wow, that's some background.

791
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,348
But here in GOP, we don't count that.

792
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,600
Everyone works hard and suffers equally.

793
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,937
I never asked you to count that.
What's your point?

794
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,356
What?

795
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,192
What?

796
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,487
Look at the way he speaks.

797
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,240
I'm sorry, sir.
I will educate him properly.

798
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,536
Do it right.

799
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,621
You're responsible for his behavior.

800
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,873
You know it, right?

801
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,500
Yes, I know it, sir.

802
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,838
Hey, by the way, you…

803
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,467
You look pretty.

804
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,220
It's been a while
since we got a pretty boy.

805
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,721
Let's go!

806
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,390
How dare he touch my face? That…

807
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,516
Hey.

808
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,726
He might hear you.

809
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,107
Your military life isn't going to be easy.

810
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,114
What's wrong with that bastard's gaze?

811
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,242
Damn it.

812
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,785
Good job running
the office of justice without me.

813
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,415
Good job going around
outside the office without me.

814
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,295
I remember when you came in

815
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,672
through that door for Noh Tae-nam's trial.

816
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,937
You did expect
that I'd be back, didn't you?

817
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,899
I never doubted, even once,
that we were fated to fight together.

818
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,906
I told you back then

819
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,492
that I'd be your loyal hound dog.

820
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,161
You did.

821
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,247
Then did I fail to hunt Won Ki-choon?

822
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,583
You have failed.

823
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,048
That really hurts
when you actually say it.

824
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,716
Gosh, it hurts.

825
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,933
You should've made Won Ki-choon sit here.

826
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,477
You should've

827
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,105
made me sit there.

828
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,776
So, did you tell me to come here
so you could say

829
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,444
that I lost the game?

830
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,490
It's sad,

831
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,410
but I wanted to share

832
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,203
the end of our first hunt.

833
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,749
THE ACCUSED

834
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,877
We have a lot more bastards left
to bring to this seat.

835
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,755
Hong Moo-seob,

836
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,049
Lee Jae-sik,

837
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,176
Heo Kang-in,

838
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,594
Yong Moon-goo,

839
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,430
and…

840
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,849
Noh Hwa-young.

841
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,147
Yes.

842
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,858
I will try harder, Trainer.

843
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,279
But you know, hound dogs are

844
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,365
so aggressive that
even their owners cannot pet them easily.

845
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:28,992
No.

846
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:34,497
True hound dogs can only be petted
by their owners, not anyone else.

847
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,920
You said I failed to hunt
Won Ki-choon, right?

848
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,630
I have something to show you.

849
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,757
Follow me.

850
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,270
ITEMS CONFISCATED
FROM WON KI-CHOON'S RESIDENCE

851
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:03,026
Won Ki-choon wore bullet proof vests
when he went on search and patrol.

852
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,111
Such a coward wouldn't have been loyal

853
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,614
to Noh Hwa-young
without any kind of insurance.

854
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,115
That's my hunch.

855
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,659
You and your hunch again?

856
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,164
You really lack experience, okay?

857
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,209
To military prosecutors like me,
a hunch is

858
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,797
like big data built
through tons of criminals and cases.

859
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,635
Well, you've been a skilled
military prosecutor for five years,

860
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,386
so I guess that data isn't useless.

861
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,767
I really searched
his residence thoroughly.

862
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,939
You failed in the hunt,

863
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,982
but you brought a lot of trophies.

864
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,153
Now, use your hunch and pick out
any good possible clues.

865
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,405
I picked them out already.

866
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,575
Bankbooks.

867
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,952
DAHYUN AIRLINES
JIHWAN AUTOMOBILE

868
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,170
PARKING PERMIT

869
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,297
The car key is out of battery.

870
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,425
The car is being kept
in a long-term parking lot.

871
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,137
It seems like nothing,

872
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,347
but there must be something to it.

873
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,393
You learned a lot from my hunches, right?

874
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,315
Division Commander Noh is on her way
to be questioned as a testifier.

875
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,045
INTERROGATION ROOM

876
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,156
We will now begin.
Your name, official rank, and affiliation.

877
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,953
It's a formality.

878
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:22,916
Noh Hwa-young.

879
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,584
Major General.

880
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,378
Commander of the 4th Infantry
Division of the army.

881
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,255
It has been confirmed.

882
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,008
Thank you for your cooperation
with the investigation

883
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,635
on the suicide of Won Ki-choon.

884
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,011
Division Commander.

885
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,307
You brought a lawyer
for a simple questioning.

886
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,600
Do you have a reason?

887
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,227
You're rude.

888
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,938
Like you said, this is
a simple questioning.

889
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,481
Please be polite.

890
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,317
I only asked the reason.

891
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,987
You two prosecutors
broke the prosthetic leg

892
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,783
of your superior in court.

893
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,869
I'm here to prevent such an incident.

894
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,206
But you're the one overreacting to this.

895
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,503
That's enough. Please ask questions
related to the matter.

896
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,796
Military Prosecutors.

897
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:20,014
You were the last person
Won Ki-choon met before his death.

898
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,851
What did you talk about
with him in your office?

899
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,937
He confessed his crimes.

900
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,439
I told the Staff Judge Advocate,
so check with him.

901
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,110
Yes, ma'am. We will check
with the Staff Judge Advocate.

902
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,572
Did you secure evidence
of Lieutenant Colonel Won's confession?

903
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,621
Are you saying I should've recorded
my subordinate repenting

904
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,665
and asking for forgiveness in front of me?

905
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,543
Unfortunately,
such evidence does not exist.

906
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,921
Won Ki-choon's arrest warrant was
issued quickly thanks to me.

907
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,549
I didn't expect you to thank me,

908
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,593
but I didn't expect
to be treated like this.

909
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,433
What were you doing
at around 11:00 p.m. that night?

910
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,893
Why are you asking her that?

911
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,396
She is now being questioned as a witness.

912
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,149
It's okay. I can answer.

913
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,988
I got off early, because I was troubled
due to Won's confession.

914
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,781
And after that?

915
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,159
I went to the residence
and went to bed right away.

916
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,786
Why?

917
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,538
Can't you believe me?

918
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,415
Can you prove it?

919
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,043
Gosh, those jerks.

920
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,253
Please check the entry and exit records

921
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:36,215
of the division's guardhouse
and the military residence.

922
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,846
The entry and exit records of
the guardhouse can be easily fabricated.

923
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,222
We will check it.

924
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,478
Lieutenant Colonel Won
placed a silencer on his revolver

925
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,938
so the sound wouldn't be heard outside

926
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,690
when he committed suicide.

927
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,359
What do you think about that?

928
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,112
You don't need to answer that.

929
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,197
No.

930
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,702
I should satisfy
the military prosecutors' curiosity.

931
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,210
I'm sure that he didn't want

932
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,711
others to see him dead

933
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,881
right after he pulled the trigger.

934
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,509
He must've wanted
to delay it as much as he could.

935
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:27,392
I can understand him,
as a fellow serviceperson.

936
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,567
Don't you two?

937
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,328
What do you think about
Lieutenant Colonel Won Ki-choon's leg?

938
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,839
Someone who cut his leg off is in here.

939
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,430
That means it's either one of you two.

940
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,681
Which one is it?

941
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:08,975
It's…

942
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,231
you two, sitting in front of us.

943
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,280
This is interesting.

944
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,743
So you're saying our investigation made
Lieutenant Colonel Won Ki-choon…

945
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,745
Cut his leg off,

946
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,455
and made him die.

947
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,707
With a forced investigation.

948
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,377
Ask yourselves

949
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,131
if what he did
really had to be paid by death.

950
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,469
We should go now.

951
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,232
I'm sure Medical Officer Jo Soo-chan
cut Lieutenant Colonel Won's leg off.

952
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,860
Put Medical Officer Jo on the wanted list.

953
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,030
This is my tip for you two,
as a former prosecutor.

954
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,961
I need to talk
with the military prosecutors.

955
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,505
I'll be at your office soon.

956
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,757
Good job, Mr. Yong.

957
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,636
Salute.

958
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,935
No more questioning as a testifier.

959
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:37,730
She agreed to this one to show
respect for Lieutenant Colonel Won,

960
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,150
so I will not accept any more rudeness
even if it's for the investigation.

961
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:47,073
And after today, Mr. Yong, you should stop
coming into the interrogation room.

962
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,368
Didn't you give up on being a lawyer
when you became the CEO of IM?

963
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,078
I'm glad you brought that up.

964
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,790
I had something to tell Prosecutor Cha.

965
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,724
Giving you my business card,
I wanted to tell you

966
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,644
that the name "IM" will disappear forever.

967
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,273
Because I'll change
the name of the company.

968
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,407
The former CEOs Cha Ho-chul

969
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,992
and Noh Tae-nam

970
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:34,203
all ruined the reputation of IM
to the lowest.

971
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,624
I'm going to change
the shadows of the past.

972
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,628
Well, then.

973
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,803
Yong Moon-goo…

974
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,473
knows all about it.

975
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,707
Thank you for lifting my punishment,

976
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,042
Corps Commander.

977
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,755
Did you make an appointment

978
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,757
just to say that?

979
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,593
Gosh, I wouldn't have another chance

980
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,261
to talk to you like this.

981
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,764
You were just working hard
as a military prosecutor.

982
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,975
Keep up the good work.

983
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,768
Yes, sir.

984
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,148
I heard that you used to
be a military prosecutor, too.

985
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,277
That was 20 years ago, I think.

986
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,156
Stand straight, you bastard!

987
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,492
You bastard!

988
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,078
Lack of evidence!

989
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,746
Clear from suspicions!

990
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,373
Non-indictment!

991
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,208
You damn worm!

992
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,668
Hey, you bastard!

993
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,636
MILITARY INVESTIGATOR ID
DOH SUNG-HWAN

994
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,728
I will serve you with loyalty,
Corps Commander.

995
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,775
Madam.

996
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,305
Our next game is…

997
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,973
Corps Commander Hong Moo-seob.

998
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,393
There's one weird thing.
That his residence soldier changes often.

999
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,354
I can smell it already.
The foul stench of power tripping.

1000
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,607
You're working like a servant
at the residence, right?

1001
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,525
Don't you remember me?

1002
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,236
Have you ever defended a victim
of power tripping before?

1003
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,280
-Salute!
-Power is like a drug.

1004
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,532
A drug that's even more
addictive than money.

1005
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,410
All of those who bear a grudge against me
or harbor hostility toward me

1006
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,579
must be all locked up
under my surveillance.

1007
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,248
I'm sure you can do it, Prosecutor Doh.

1008
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:14,715
