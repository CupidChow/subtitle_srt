1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
   ​

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,210
 

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,050
 

4
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,630
 

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,580
 

6
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,960
 
 Sir, if I'm hiding for too long... 

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,610
 please forget about me, then. 

8
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,930
 Dong Cheol... 

9
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,330
 Woo Taek, do something. 

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,110
 If you still haven't forgotten me, 

11
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,350
 then I will look for you, Sir. 

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,970
 You should live your life peacefully and smoothly. 

13
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,200
 I don't want to. You look like you're in pain. Your body and heart both... 

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,140
 Do not let even a hair on your body get hurt. 

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,820
 I'm on your side, Mr. Lee. I'll help you. 

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,510
 What in the world happened? 

17
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,260
 Was there anything like this in the ancestors' record? 

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,260
 I'm not sure. I don't think I ever read it. 

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,950
 Unni and I will take a look. 

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,250
 I'm the one who put it there. The curse that turns you into a dog. 

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,470
 I couldn't believe it even after seeing it with my eyes. It doesn't make sense. 

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,040
 Why do you think he placed the curse? 

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,190
 That's my question. Why on us? 

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,200
 Why on earth are you doing this to me? 

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,410
 Why are you doing this to my family? 

26
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,520
 I'll lift the curse on your family. On one condition. 

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,350
 Jin Seo Won's feelings. 

28
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,870
 I'll turn things back to the time before he had feelings for you. 

29
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,640
 Take your pick. I'll give you one day. 

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,990
 Save your uncle. 

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,480
 Even if our memories get erased, our feelings will still remain. 

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,170
 So I'll approach you. 

33
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,060
 If you take a step back, I'll just take two steps forward. 

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,920
 Even if I wander a bit, it's a road I once took. 

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,640
 The palace guards are still looking for the Lady because of the 

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,870
 baby of the dead royal family member, right? 

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,270
 Is Mak Soon really a trustworthy kid? 

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,990
 She's Cho Young's close friend who grew up with her. 

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,590
 I'll look into the situation. Be safe. 

40
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,900
 Even so, you should not trust a pregnant mother so easily. 

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,390
 Did Young Master Soo Hyun come to work today by chance? 

42
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,580
 He got caught helping a traitor flee, and I heard he will be beheaded tomorrow. 

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,620
 Please allow me to meet Young Master just this once. 

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,330
 It is still not too late. 

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,190
 Tell me where Madam Han and that girl went. 

46
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,270
 Some female servant came looking for you. 

47
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,200
 Where is she now? I need to get out of here. 

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,880
 Sir! Please save Young Master Soo Hyun. 

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,230
 How dare a female servant enter this place? 

50
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,890
 I know Lady Cho Young's whereabouts. 

51
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,270
 When you and I have forgotten everything, the Mountain God's curse will find us. 

52
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,620
 The curse will find us without us even knowing 

53
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,180
 and make us lose something precious. 

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,660
Ms. Hae Na!

55
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,080
Have you eaten?

56
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,030
Yes.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,100
Last time, you said there was a performance you wanted to see.

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,790
I did?

59
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,110
Would you like to go see it next weekend?

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,400
Why would I watch a performance with you?

61
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,390
What happened?

62
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,630
What do you mean?

63
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,560
Ms. Hae Na...

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,610
Weren't my memories supposed to be erased?

65
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,700
Well, isn't it up to me to decide whose memory to erase?

66
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,990
You said you could start anew without your memories.

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,550
Good luck.

68
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,580
 

69
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,180
Keep up the good work.

70
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,330
 What do you think? 

71
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,620
 It's so pretty. 

72
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,070
 It's been a while since I saw a rainbow. 

73
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,770
♫  I may be a dot smaller than a fingernail  ♫

74
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,010
 What if my memories disappear? 

75
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,890
Then,

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,050
I'll approach you without even wandering.

77
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,600
Have you ever...

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,700
even seduced anyone in your life?

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,300
No...

80
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,080
♫  It makes me happy just to look at you  ♫

81
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,640
First of all, if you want to seduce me,

82
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,320
you just need to buy me sweets.

83
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,610
And?

84
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,350
You just need to...

85
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,460
constantly buy me something to eat.

86
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,970
 I'm a very easy woman. 

87
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,280
 So you better seduce me. 

88
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,020
♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

89
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,140
♫  Your little star  ♫

90
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,460
Ms. Han,

91
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,360
you should eat this.

92
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,510
What's that?

93
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,400
It looks good.

94
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,490
Thank you.

95
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,670
Please enjoy it.

96
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,910
What's gotten into Mr. Seo Won?

97
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,440
Do you like this?

98
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,520
- Do you want it?
- You don't want it?

99
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,940
I must've had too much for lunch. I'm full.

100
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,040
Thank you!

101
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,460
- Mr. Jin.
- Yes.

102
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,230
Your desk was very dusty.

103
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,030
That's not good for your health.

104
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,680
I was concerned about your health.

105
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,480
I'll take care of my own health.

106
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,640
 I'll take care of my health. 

107
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,550
 Of course, you should. 

108
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,870
 Are you eating properly, by the way? 

109
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,250
 Should I buy you some meat? Meat with a shot of soju. 

110
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,710
Are you eating properly?

111
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,070
How about meat with a shot of soju for dinner?

112
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,810
Just the two of us?

113
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,230
Yes.

114
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,230
Let's just all eat together next time.

115
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,580
Okay.

116
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:47,380
♫  Will you be thinking of me?  ♫

117
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:55,760
♫  Days are too far apart with you  ♫

118
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,700
♫  Will you be thinking of me?  ♫

119
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't you hear your dry hands screaming?

120
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,930
 Don't you hear your dry hands screaming? 

121
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,260
Wouldn't your life be better with a glass of moist alcohol when things are dry?

122
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,000
How about some beef intestines and soju?

123
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,870
 Ms. Han! 

124
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,870
 - We just got here! 
- Bye.

125
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,170
 Goodbye! 

126
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,900
 Ms. Han! 

127
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:48,000
♫  The closer I get, it feels far away  ♫

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,650
♫  When I'm with you, I lose track of time  ♫

129
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,220
Ms. Han!

130
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,480
Here.

131
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,610
Oh, it's okay.

132
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,080
Thank you.

133
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,400
Um, Ms. Han.

134
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,060
There's something I need to tell you.

135
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,280
- How does dinner-
- Ms. Han!

136
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,700
- Would you like a ride?
- Sure.

137
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,360
 

138
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,340
Oh, time for a walk!

139
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,010
Dong Cheol!

140
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,810
Let's go-

141
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,490
Dong Cheol!

142
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,160
Noona.

143
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,630
Uncle!

144
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,520
Uncle!

145
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,870
Is that really Uncle?

146
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,360
Thank goodness.

147
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,600
This is a true miracle.

148
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,030
Miracles really do exist.

149
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,510
What on earth happened?

150
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,000
Was there anything like this in the ancestors' record?

151
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,440
I'm not sure.

152
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,800
I don't think I ever read it.

153
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,070
Unni and I will take a look.

154
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, do you think it's like a final gift or something?

155
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,080
You know, a final gift before he dies-

156
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,550
Don't say something so unlucky!

157
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,960
Wait,

158
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,190
doesn't this scene look familiar?

159
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,440
You're right.

160
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,500
Dang it.

161
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,430
Seo-Hae couple?

162
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,700
This is my handwriting.

163
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,530
Uncle!

164
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,380
What is this?

165
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,010
It's Cocoa.

166
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,310
You want to drink Cocoa?

167
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,120
Got it! This little guy is Cocoa?

168
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,520
He's really cute.

169
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,410
So cute.

170
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,080
You...

171
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,910
don't remember anything?

172
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,500
Remember what?

173
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,080
He's so cute.

174
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,660
I'm going to keep this.

175
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,340
So cute!

176
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,800
- Hello, Mr. Bo Gyeom.
- Hi, Ms. Hae Na. You were already here.

177
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120
Did you get home safely last night?

178
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,650
Yes, thanks to you.

179
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,480
- Hello, Ms. Han.
- Hello.

180
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,620
Please prepare well for the open class with the parents in two days.

181
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,140
The Korean history and literature joint class is also coming along, right?

182
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,710
We have important guests coming,

183
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,580
so please pay attention to the school grounds both inside and outside.

184
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,800
- Class 3 is in charge, right?
- Yes.

185
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,060
I'd like another class to cooperate and work together with yours.

186
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,000
Who...

187
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,980
- My class will join in.
- Oh, that's great.

188
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,510
Hey, you're making me fall. Move.

189
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,040
Geez, I know!

190
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,780
Stop it.

191
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,960
I said, stop it!

192
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,270
Stop playing around.

193
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,410
Stop it.

194
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,080
Hey, stop playing around-

195
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,340
Are you okay?

196
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,860
 Date! Date! 

197
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,730
 Date! Date! 

198
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,680
They're going to get caught at that rate.

199
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,850
What?

200
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,650
- I thought they were going out.
- Huh?

201
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,530
You told me that.

202
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,240
I did?

203
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,600
When?

204
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,550
Ms. Han.

205
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,760
The kids were acting up because of me.

206
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,410
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,750
It's okay. You were only trying to help.

208
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,910
By the way,

209
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,770
you must really like this cake.

210
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,680
You're the one who-

211
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,230
I like it now, too.

212
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,560
You know, when you start liking someone, you start to take after their preferences.

213
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,930
That's interesting.

214
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,450
I really like these things, too.

215
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,370
I know.

216
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,580
Ms. Han.

217
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,450
Can we talk for a moment?

218
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,500
Oh, sure.

219
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,600
Should we talk outside?

220
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,970
- For our joint class-
- Guys, don't run in the hallway-

221
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,890
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry!

222
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,590
Hold on, Ms. Han.

223
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,190
It got all over you.

224
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
Are you okay?

225
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,080
What are you doing right now?

226
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,920
Ms. Han.

227
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,620
Yes?

228
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
I like you, Ms. Han.

229
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,640
I...

230
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,220
like someone else.

231
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,100
So...

232
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,830
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,230
I think the novel,

234
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,160
"Dear Won's Father," has a significant influence

235
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,960
in both literature...

236
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,860
and history- W-Why are you staring at me?

237
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,560
- I was just listening because I liked it.
- Oh, really?

238
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,980
- Okay.
- Okay, first of all,

239
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,290
as you know...

240
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,830
- Go ahead. I won't look at you.
- Okay.

241
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,280
A wife who lost her husband...

242
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,930
What do you want, Hyung?

243
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,570
I'm not sure.

244
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,260
Are you really planning to date her?

245
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,920
I guess that sounds fun, too.

246
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,590
Stop it.

247
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,720
What?

248
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,730
Everything you're doing.

249
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,150
You spoke as if memories were trivial.

250
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,460
Do you realize it now?

251
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,040
What was taken from you exactly?

252
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,980
But...

253
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,080
it's not like you earned all of it yourself.

254
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
What?

255
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,630
The reason you both got entangled in the curse

256
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,300
was all because of the kiss.

257
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,350
Don't you get it?

258
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,480
I planned all this.

259
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm the one...

260
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,830
who tossed her...

261
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,950
to you.

262
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you doing, Mr. Jin?

263
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,480
Are you okay?

264
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,540
Gosh, what is this?

265
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,700
You said you were confident, but you suck.

266
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,710
You said you were an easy woman.

267
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,780
What a lie.

268
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,240
Agreed.

269
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm a more difficult woman than I thought.

270
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,660
Even so, don't give up on me.

271
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,300
I'll think about it.

272
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,610
Hey, what's there to think about?

273
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,950
Don't think about anything else and just charge forward.

274
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,970
Okay?

275
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,810
Why in the world did you guys fight?

276
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,270
Weren't you two close?

277
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,530
There must've been a misunderstanding.

278
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,470
What misunderstanding?

279
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,790
Wait, are you worrying about me right now?

280
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,010
I'm not.

281
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,760
Your eyes are full of worry.

282
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,740
You're mistaken.

283
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,020
Ms. Han,

284
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,000
should we try dating?

285
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,500
Let's date.

286
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,030
Uncle!

287
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,400
Uncle, are you dating my teacher?

288
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,100
Huh? Are you?

289
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,330
No.

290
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,890
Right?

291
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,420
Geez, Min Ji Ah, that girl.

292
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,480
That's right. Of course not.

293
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,780
As if my teacher would date you.

294
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,000
What did...

295
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,200
Ji Ah say?

296
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,600
Well, she said you and Ms. Han are dating.

297
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,000
- Unni.
- You're home.

298
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,460
Mr. Bo Gyeom asked me out.

299
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,230
Then go out with him.

300
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,020
No, not in that manner.

301
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,920
He wants to date you?

302
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,990
Whoa.

303
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,870
That means you're dating the Korean history teacher now?

304
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,240
Whoa.

305
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,590
You shouldn't take it too fast just because it's the Korean History teacher.

306
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,230
Kisses...

307
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,960
You know, right?

308
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,490
Of course, I do.

309
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,400
Which is why I told him I'd think about it.

310
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,320
What did he say to that?

311
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,990
He suggested going on three dates, so I agreed.

312
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,830
Why don't you just date him?

313
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,230
Oh, never mind.

314
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,560
You'll seem lame if you accept him the first time.

315
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,100
Wait at least three days before telling him, "Okay, I guess."

316
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,340
Whoa!

317
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,390
Congrats.

318
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,330
Unni.

319
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,080
Today, Mr. Jin...

320
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,520
You know...

321
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,590
the calendar on my desk?

322
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,200
Were you the one who wrote "Seo-Hae" on it?

323
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,660
No.

324
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,930
Why? You want to visit the ocean?

325
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,410
What the heck?

326
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,090
Ji Ah.

327
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Can we talk?

328
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,200
So your memories are intact?

329
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,550
Yes.

330
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,610
Why only you?

331
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,890
I don't know.

332
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,000
So, you're the only one who remembers what happened between you two?

333
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,660
Why?

334
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,060
What happened?

335
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,600
It's Ms. Han's personal affairs, so I can't tell you the specifics.

336
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,820
Go inside.

337
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,470
Okay.

338
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,730
Where's Ms. Han? I don't think Ms. Hae Na's inside.

339
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,910
Where is she?

340
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,530
Did she leave?

341
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,410
I think she left.

342
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,070
Over there! Let's go.

343
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,690
Ms. Han! Ms. Han, is it true?

344
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,570
Is what true?

345
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,830
Are you really dating Mr. Bo Gyeom?

346
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,120
What?

347
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,880
Why are you flustered? It must be true!

348
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,800
Congratulations, Ms. Han!

349
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,100
You and Mr. Bo Gyeom look so good together.

350
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,410
You little rascals.

351
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,620
Go back to your class!

352
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,510
Congratulations, Ms. Han!

353
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,710
- Really?
- No, it's-

354
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,830
Congratulations, Ms. Han.

355
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,880
Good morning, Mr. Seo Won.

356
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,870
Mr. Jin.

357
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,040
Yes.

358
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,730
This.

359
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,620
I...

360
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,910
told you I'd approach you without wandering.

361
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,830
I think I might wander a bit.

362
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,270
Sorry?

363
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,810
I think I brewed it for too long.

364
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,060
It's going to taste bitter.

365
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,150
 
In the year 1998 in Andong,

366
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,890
this letter was discovered in the process of transferring a gravesite.

367
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,420
Hwa Ja, Won's mother, wrote the letter in a hurry while mourning

368
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,760
her late husband and placed it in his coffin.

369
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,810
Through this letter, we can observe the everyday language of the 16th-century nobility.

370
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,800
Shall we take a look at the deciphered content?

371
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,950
"I don't think I have the strength to live after I lost you.

372
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,750
I want to go with you,

373
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,980
so take me with you.

374
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,200
I can't forget my feelings for you in this world,

375
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,620
and my sorrow...

376
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,350
knows no limit."

377
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,300
What are you doing?

378
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,380
Everyone dies.

379
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,350
"Why did you leave me?

380
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,040
My sorrow knows no limits.

381
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,420
Come visit me in my dream after reading this letter."

382
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,010
When you lose someone you love,

383
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,260
this is usually how you'd react.

384
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,040
Just like Won's mother, whom we learned about earlier.

385
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,220
But why...

386
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,860
Just who do you resent so deeply?

387
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,340
Ms. Hae Na and Mr. Seo Won, right?

388
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,030
That's why you erased Ms. Hae Na's memories

389
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,820
and split those two apart.

390
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,300
It has nothing to do with you.

391
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,000
How...

392
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,330
did I die?

393
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,990
Did those two kill me or something?

394
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,810
Hello.

395
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,860
Hello!

396
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,760
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Why are you tailing Vice Principal?

397
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,870
I'm not.

398
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,500
You're being really obvious, Noona.

399
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,560
You scared me.

400
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,240
What?

401
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,070
You've got something to say?

402
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,640
This is all for your uncle.

403
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,650
The math teacher.

404
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,850
How did you know about that?

405
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,460
That's a secret from the school.

406
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,230
Your uncle must feel so lonely.

407
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,310
Hey, what are you talking about?

408
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,090
How did she know?

409
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,950
I don't know.

410
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,360
She really does have shamanic abilities.

411
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,980
Are you obsessed with games?

412
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,650
Oh, those?

413
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,860
But there's no one to play with.

414
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,550
When you've bought so many...

415
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,870
Aigoo. Mountain God doesn't even look at human games now.

416
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,040
Then would you like to play them with me?

417
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,430
Really?

418
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,220
But if I win,

419
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,380
give me the name of one mountain.

420
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,340
Lady- I mean... never mind.

421
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,570
Of course! What's the harm in telling you the name of one mountain?

422
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,930
Which one do you want to play? Huh?

423
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,610
So we just need to block Mr. Bo Gyeom, right?

424
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,460
Yeah.

425
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,130
Why?

426
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,180
Anyway, okay.

427
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,460
Oh, yeah! I'll go.

428
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,170
That's not it.

429
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,050
 Hurry, hurry, hurry. 

430
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,180
Oh, yeah.

431
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,590
I need to stack it.

432
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,360
I was going to choose that one.

433
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,620
Why won't it come out?

434
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,530
Let's play something else.

435
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,640
Exhilarating!

436
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,520
That was the best game of my life.

437
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,900
Now, tell me since I won.

438
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,920
Pardon?

439
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,270
Why do I keep talking like this? What did you say?

440
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,610
The mountain where I died.

441
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,510
Where is it?

442
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,910
Hey, Song Woo Taek.

443
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,800
What?

444
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,920
We're friends.

445
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,270
Right?

446
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,440
Right.

447
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,200
But I do get certain thoughts.

448
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,040
What thoughts?

449
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
Well...

450
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,420
the thought that we could break free

451
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,540
of the friend zone. Something like that...

452
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,450
Huh?

453
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,100
Why are you so oblivious?

454
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,340
T-Then...

455
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,270
you and I will really...

456
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,460
Gosh, I'm going to get some air.

457
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,520
- Hey, wait!
- What?

458
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,340
You're playing around again, aren't you?

459
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:54,160
Tomorrow, you'll tease and laugh at me, right?

460
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,660
Woo Taek.

461
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,130
Yeah?

462
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,450
We're friends.

463
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,120
If we cross this line,

464
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,480
there's no turning back.

465
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,740
But Yoo Na,

466
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,720
I have many friends besides you.

467
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,600
I don't think it would matter if I lost you as a friend.

468
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,750
What should we...

469
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,630
All right, then.

470
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,870
This is too fast.

471
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,150
Yes, I'll be right there. Okay.

472
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,840
Is today the long-awaited first date?

473
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,250
I wouldn't go that far.

474
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,050
Don't you think Mr. Bo Gyeom will be unexpectedly fast-paced?

475
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,850
Hey, come on.

476
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,480
Why? Are you feeling shy?

477
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,400
Or Mr. Bo Gyeom might grab your hand on the first date

478
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,080
and embrace you while sending you a hot look and say,

479
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,350
"I don't want to send you home tonight."

480
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,070
I'm going to the restroom before we head inside.

481
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,540
Okay. I'll buy some stuff to eat.

482
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,630
- Okay.
- Okay.

483
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,710
Would you like to place an order?

484
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,020
You should get the caramel flavor.

485
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,580
You have a knack for tailing someone.

486
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,410
I am pretty well-rounded.

487
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,090
- It's on me.
- Huh?

488
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,480
All right, then.

489
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,580
Thanks for the treat.

490
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,630
 You do love me! You do love me. 

491
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,110
 Don't, don't. 

492
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,490
 - You love me, you love me.
- We won't do this, I tell you. We won't do it. 

493
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,500
 It won't happen again. 

494
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,220
 - I'm going to take Melanie and the baby and go.
- You love me. 

495
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,620
 Say it, you love me. 

496
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,710
 All right, I'll say it. I love your courage and your stubbornness. 

497
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,660
 And I certainly have turned out disappointing. 

498
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,650
 You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag. 

499
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,850
It was so nice to watch an old movie after so long.

500
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,350
Right? I also enjoyed it.

501
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,120
Oh, Seo Won!

502
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,200
Mr. Jin.

503
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,190
You came to watch a movie?

504
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,380
Yes.

505
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,730
Did you watch the same movie-

506
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,440
Enjoy the movie, then.

507
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,390
Let's go, Ms. Hae Na.

508
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,240
We're here.

509
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,640
Isn't that your sister?

510
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,580
Oh, yes, it is.

511
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,870
 - That was so good!
- Right. 

512
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,530
You know my sister?

513
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,130
Why, of course.

514
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,000
Hold your sister's hand and go inside. I'll go home from here.

515
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,900
- Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

516
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,280
You! Woo Taek!

517
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:45,920
Hey, you crazy bastard!

518
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,320
- Unni!
- Yeah?

519
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,130
Hey.

520
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,390
- What's with him?
- Hey, don't stay out so late!

521
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,190
What's a girl doing out so late? Gosh!

522
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,420
Why are you so mad?

523
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,420
And why were you holding hands? Are you seven years old or something?

524
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,800
So tired.

525
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,520
Hey, where's the skirt you borrowed from me last time?

526
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,770
You said you don't wear it because it's too short.

527
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,580
Found it.

528
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,090
It's cold.

529
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,930
This will look pretty with boots.

530
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,510
Unni.

531
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,240
Are you seeing someone?

532
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,350
You're right. This is too short. You can keep it.

533
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,380
- Unni!
- What?

534
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,950
Have you ever met Mr. Bo Gyeom?

535
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,590
Meet the Korean History teacher?

536
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,730
I don't think so.

537
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,410
Why? Did he mention me?

538
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,640
How was your first date?

539
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:12,230
Well, it was the first date, so we just got to know each other.

540
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,930
Really?

541
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,650
I had so much fun, though.

542
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,660
Unni,

543
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,870
did you go on a date with Woo Taek today?

544
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,230
Are you dating Woo Taek?

545
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,800
- Goodnight.
- Hey.

546
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,770
Hey!

547
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,880
Mr. Jin.

548
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,150
Yes?

549
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,980
Did you get home safe last night?

550
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,690
I didn't get to properly say goodbye.

551
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,470
I got home safe.

552
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,000
Did you enjoy the movie?

553
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,080
I couldn't.

554
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,220
The person who was supposed to sit next to me

555
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,260
was sitting in front of me with someone else.

556
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,110
Why are you going there?

557
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,170
She said she's going to experience her past life.

558
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,160
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

559
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,200
You can't. It's dangerous.

560
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,450
Noona, do you want me to go with you?

561
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,960
I-I want to go, too.

562
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,630
No, you're baggage.

563
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,340
Excuse me, baggage?

564
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,070
I'm hurt, Noona!

565
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,280
Take me with you! I'm good at hiking!

566
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,720
I'm the king of hiking!

567
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,100
- Take me with you!
- Let's go together!

568
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm going to leave you behind if you complain about it being too hard.

569
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,220
Hard?

570
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,380
What's that?

571
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,290
I've never experienced that state of being in my life.

572
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,130
Same for you?

573
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,950
Aren't you going home, Ms. Hae Na?

574
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,850
I am.

575
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,410
 

576
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,180
Mr. Jin!

577
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,980
- Yes.
- Seohae...

578
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,310
Are you going to Seohae* this weekend?
("Seo-Hae" sounds like the Korean term for the Yellow Sea.)

579
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,280
- Do you remember-
- Well, you see...

580
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,530
I saw your calendar by accident

581
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,560
and it says the same thing on my calendar.

582
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,000
Would you like to go?

583
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,480
Sorry?

584
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,050
To Seohae this weekend.

585
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,630
Where did you get this?

586
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,090
Someone gave it to me.

587
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,310
It just...

588
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,680
looked cute for some reason.

589
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,190
And familiar, too.

590
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,000
It's cute, right?

591
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,930
I miss her.

592
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,900
There's a dog named Cocoa

593
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,910
who resembles this doll.

594
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,000
She must be somewhere far away now.

595
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,290
She's close by,

596
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,460
but she must've forgotten all about me.

597
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,610
Do you think...

598
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,990
she'll come to like me again?

599
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,570
Yes.

600
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,620
Of course.

601
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,100
For sure.

602
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,820
Hae Na.

603
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,150
What's going on?

604
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,040
Are you two really dating?

605
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,500
Well, we were eating chicken gizzard

606
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,980
when she suddenly forced her lips on mine.

607
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,020
Wait, hey!

608
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,660
I was just envious of you at the time,

609
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,560
so I suddenly ended up...

610
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,880
You were envious of me?

611
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,730
When?

612
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,540
I know, huh?

613
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:46,030
The vongole pasta is delicious. Is this place popular?

614
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:49,280
I think it's just all right.

615
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,700
Geez...

616
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,910
What's wrong?

617
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,020
It's nothing. Please continue.

618
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,940
Stop grabbing onto me. I'm tired!

619
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,130
You're heavy!

620
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,510
Oh, come on.

621
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,280
Just how far are you going?

622
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,710
Save me!

623
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,580
Yul, go on. It's over for me.

624
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,200
Get it together, Jun Seo!

625
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,290
Hey!

626
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,420
What did you mean last time?

627
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,860
About my uncle feeling lonely?

628
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,300
He must be lonely.

629
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,730
His girlfriend lost her memories of him.

630
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,850
She lost her memories?

631
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,430
Who?

632
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,060
My uncle has a girlfriend?

633
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,670
It's Yul.

634
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,050
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

635
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,510
Yes, Yul?

636
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:41,730
Yes, Ms. Han!

637
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,360
Please hurry over to my house.

638
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,700
Right now. Hurry, hurry!

639
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,940
Right now?

640
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,210
What's the matter?

641
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,740
Gosh, it's urgent!

642
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,580
Okay, got it. Send me your address. I'll go as soon as possible.

643
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,300
Okay, got it.

644
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,950
Yes!

645
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,410
- You did it! It's a done deal.
- Really?

646
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,740
- Just trust me. Absolutely trust me.
- Will it work?

647
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,020
Absolutely trust me.

648
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,990
Is something wrong?

649
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,570
It's Yul.

650
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:17,250
He asked me to go to his house as soon as possible.

651
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,800
Oh, then you should get going.

652
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,020
I'm sorry.

653
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,210
Yul's not home right now, though.

654
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,480
Ji Ah, where are you going?

655
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,030
Forget it! She's probably going to dig up medicinal herbs. Let her be.

656
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,650
- Medicinal herbs?
- Who knows?

657
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,010
But letting her go alone is dangerous.

658
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,720
We need to wait for the call.

659
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,730
Should we wait for the call first?

660
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,270
Am I counselor material?

661
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,460
Yul!

662
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,560
Yul.

663
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,120
Yul! Yul...

664
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,010
Mr. Jin.

665
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,970
Isn't this Yul's house?

666
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,550
Did he send me the wrong address?

667
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,790
 Uncle, I heard everything from Min Ji Ah. 

668
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,940
 Don't worry. I'll help you. 

669
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,080
Yes.

670
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,690
This is Yul's house.

671
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,260
Sorry?

672
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,220
I'm Yul's uncle.

673
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,220
Sorry?

674
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,900
He must've played a joke.

675
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,100
Wait, why on earth would he play a joke like that?

676
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,190
I'm sorry.

677
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,540
It's okay. I'm the one who's sorry.

678
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,500
I disrupted your time off.

679
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,200
Ms. Han!

680
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,980
Would you like some ramen?

681
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,320
 Sir. 

682
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,230
This is my first time here, right?

683
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,530
I don't know how this might sound,

684
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,310
but it somehow feels like I've been here before.

685
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:53,870
I feel a bit weird these days.

686
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,960
My head...

687
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,500
and my heart...

688
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,400
are acting separately.

689
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,220
It's like they're one entity,

690
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,500
but they're telling me different things.

691
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:19,440
I wonder if I should go to the hospital to see if something's wrong.

692
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,220
Lately...

693
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,840
I just don't know how I feel.

694
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,050
Should I...

695
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,060
tell you?

696
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,070
Yes.

697
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:59,890
   ​

698
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:47,970
♫  It feels like forever  ♫

699
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:56,400
♫  I'm dreaming of never  ♫

700
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:04,700
♫  The closer I get, it feels far away  ♫

701
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:13,080
♫  When I'm with you, I lose track of time again  ♫

702
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:17,250
 

703
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,940
 I don't know how I should face him. 

704
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,380
 Are you avoiding me? 

705
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,060
 It might be confusing and difficult right now, 

706
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,280
 but I'll wait until you recover all the missing pieces. 

707
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,660
 I think Mr. Bo Gyeom is preparing for the end. 

708
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,690
 What do you mean, the end? 

709
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:35,300
 That erasing Ms. Hae Na's memories isn't the end.&lt; 

710
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,080
 I don't know what you're planning, but it will never work out. 

711
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,420
 We'll meet again in the end. 

712
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:47,300
 Will you be steadfast even if you die and fall into the fires of hell?
