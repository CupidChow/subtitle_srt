1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:09,120
   â€‹

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,210
 

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,050
 

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,650
 

5
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,590
 

6
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,850
 
 Our family has an unusual secret. 

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,530
 
 If I kiss a man, I turn into a dog. 

8
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,010
 - When will she turn back into a human?
- Six in the morning. 

9
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,250
 And she'll turn into a dog again at midnight. 

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,000
 By the way, why do you hate me?
Why do you find me uncomfortable? 

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,990
 When I'm with you, it's really- 

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,370
 Anyhow, it's true I avoided you because I was a bit uncomfortable, 

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,480
 but it wasn't because I hate you. 

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,610
 

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,110
 M-Mr. Jin, please excuse me for one moment. Sorry. 

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,910
 The solution to undo this damned curse. 

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,300
 I must kiss this man again today but as a dog this time. 

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,310
 Huh? What's wrong with him? 

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,040
 Don't tell me he's afraid of dogs? 

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
 What do I do now? 

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,170
 Won, you didn't forget about us hanging out after work today, right? 

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,660
 Since you decided to help me, 

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,390
 how about we meet regularly so I can get tips from you? 

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,550
 Just one beer, please? 

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,500
 Can't you hear what I'm saying? 

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,920
 How many times did I say no just now? 

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,580
 What are you, a nutcracker? 
 

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,550
 You keep crushing me over and over and over again. 

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,300
 But you said he's really afraid of dogs. 

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,120
 But I'm sure all dogs in the area flock around her. 

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,660
 What kind of students smoke in front of a school? What are your names? 

32
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,870
 No, let's just touch her and call it even. 

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,190
 She asked what your names are just now. 

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,790
 Are you feeling better now? 

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,880
 I was a bit in shock this morning, but I'm okay now. 

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,690
 - Sorry about last night.
- I'm sorry, too. 

37
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,800
 Thinking about it, I could see why you were mistaken. 

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,000
 I don't know what it is, but you don't have to tell me if it's too difficult. 

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,360
 Everyone is in unique situations 

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,580
 and it's natural to have at least one secret of their own. 

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,510
 - Is this Ms. Han Hae Na of Garam High School?
- Ms. Han! 

42
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,800
 - The buses must've stopped running.
- I'll get going now. Bye. 

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,140
 Hello? Oppa, I'm in trouble right now. 

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,000
 Why are you still here? 

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,880
 How could a person turn into a dog? 

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,280
 Ma'am, do you live alone? Your family must be worried. 

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,800
 How do I get out of here? 

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,390
 I'll wait until it's six in the morning and leave when I turn into a human. 

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,460
 Never, ever fall asleep. 

50
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,340
 Never fall asleep... 

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,560
 What do I do now? What do I do? 

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,820
 Could you please explain this situation first? 

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,400
 You got caught? By one of your students? 

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,790
 On top of that, he's the math teacher's nephew. 

55
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,450
 You don't find me weird? 

56
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,880
 You are unique but not weird. 

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,900
 You were so cute. 

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,370
 What's with the dog? 

59
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,440
 Man Deuk will hang out here just for a day. 

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,760
 Thank you for today. I know you helped me in many ways. 

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,350
 - Was it obvious?
- I'm a bit weird, aren't I? 

62
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,610
 Neither of us are weird people. 

63
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,480
 - We're just those types of people.
- What is this? 

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,250
 I just thought you might develop 

65
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,330
 the slightest immunity toward dogs if you keep this on you all the time. 

66
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,110
 A person shouldn't change like that. 

67
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,310
 You act all coy in front of people yet wave around your tail behind others' backs. 

68
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,730
 Be careful. 

69
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,230
 So what if they're dating? 

70
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,450
 Why on Earth do you live in a place like this? 

71
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,900
 I don't know what I was in my previous life, but I just like living in nature like this. 

72
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,830
 I'll go home once my business is done here. 

73
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,000
 A wedding invitation? 

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,820
 Wait, should we get them a gift just from us, then? 

75
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,730
 Could you two go and buy it? 

76
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,380
 I need to stop by the pharmacy. 

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,530
 I get terrible motion sickness when I ride express buses. 

78
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,440
 Do you want to ride in my car, then? 

79
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,970
 As if I would let you. 

80
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,540
 Should we go to the wedding in one car this weekend? 

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,870
 Are you satisfied now? 

82
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,820
 Wait, how did you come, Ms. Song Yi? 

83
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,340
 - I agreed to go in Ms. Hae Na's place.
- Did you wait long? 

84
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,580
 Whoa, Mr. Jin, you look really great today. 

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,210
 Shall we go now? 

86
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,960
 
 This is a group chat for Mr. Bo Gyeom's car. 

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
 Please text when you're near the meeting location. 

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
 

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,260
Ms. Han, are you going to ride in Bo Gyeom's car?

90
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,880
Well, she said we're all going together...

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, please don't misunderstand when I say this.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,600
The thing is, Hyung is a heavy sleeper in the morning, so he runs late very often.

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,880
I mean, 30 minutes is a given. I've waited even up to an hour.

94
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,190
You shouldn't miss the wedding after going all the way there, right?

95
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,840
- That's true.
- But if you still want to go with Hyung,

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,690
I won't try to stop you anymore.

97
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,320
N-No, I'll not ride that car. I'll go with you, Mr. Jin.

98
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,200
I don't want to be late for the wedding, either.

99
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,770
- We'll never, ever end up arriving late.
- Yes.

100
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,280
Shall we go?

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,270
- Yes.
- Yes.

102
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,320
Aren't you taking the bus they rented? Why are you looking up the route?

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,190
I'm going to take my car.

104
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,200
- Huh? You're going to?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,520
- Why?
- To go to the wedding.

106
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,120
But you're a new driver.

107
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,150
- What day is it today?
- Thursday.

108
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,280
I still have 37 more hours.

109
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,100
You only have one life, too.

110
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,770
Geez...

111
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,180
- So you're going with the math teacher?
- Yes.

112
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,110
Why? What about the Korean history teacher?

113
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,820
Well, since Mr. Jin was the first one to ask me to come with him.

114
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,930
Why does that matter?

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,620
If you're a teacher, you have to keep your promise to an earlier commitment.

116
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,800
What does that have to do with being a teacher?

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,870
I mean, if you go with the person you like,

118
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,750
you can eat sausage and rice cakes at the rest area.

119
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,560
And you can feed each other while driving. It's just so nice!

120
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,600
Is the sausage and rice cakes delicious? I couldn't really tell.

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,060
I've got a weird feeling. There's something going on.

122
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,500
There's not a thing going on.

123
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,320
You've had a change of heart.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,280
- Did you switch lanes?
- Not at all!

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,350
Why do you keep brushing my hair this late at night?

126
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,130
You need to demo that thing.

127
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,640
But why are you combing my hair?

128
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,780
Can't you comb my fur after I become a dog?

129
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,090
Don't you think your hair becomes your fur?

130
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,420
Unni, did you know you're taking after Woo Taek these days?

131
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,380
- Are you crazy?
- Looks like you've gone mad.

132
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,590
Hey! You've gone way over the line with Song Woo Taek.

133
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,340
No! Hey, your hair! Your hair!

134
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,740
Oh, no! Don't touch your hair!

135
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,050
 Hello, it's Manly Bro. I've prepared for you today 

136
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,650
 
 how to look cool while driving. That's what I'll show you. 

137
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,720
 When you're going on a date soon after getting your license, 

138
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,740
 your date won't progress at all if it's obvious you're a new driver. 

139
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,040
 So what do you do? 

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,220
 Firstly, this is the most important thing. Roll down your window. 

141
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,140
 All right. After rolling down your window, rest your arm just like this. 

142
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,040
 At this point, it'd be great if you have tattoos, but not many people have tattoos. 

143
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,530
 You can still show off your forearm without tattoos. 

144
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,760
 After flexing your arm so your veins show, 

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,620
 place it here just like this. 

146
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,930
 It's cool, isn't it? Now, what will your date think? 

147
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,170
 She'll think, "Gosh, I want this guy." All right? 

148
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,570
 For now, that's the first step down. And then... 

149
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,400
â™«  I space out all day thinking about you  â™«

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,480
â™«  I'm like this every chance I get, it makes me laugh  â™«

151
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,290
â™«  My head is full of sweet words  â™«

152
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,800
â™«  Everything, I like everything about you  â™«

153
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,540
â™«  My heart felt like it was covered by something for a while  â™«

154
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,520
â™«  Bet you there was no trace of anyone coming into my heart  â™«

155
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,090
â™«  But what I see in you and want from you is that  â™«

156
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,030
â™«  I want to fill my day with your blinding smile  â™«

157
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,320
â™«  Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, only you, I'm falling in love  â™«

158
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,600
â™«  Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, only you, I'm falling in love  â™«

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,020
â™«  Ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody, only you, you're my girl  â™«

160
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:59,220
â™«  Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, only you, I wait for you  â™«

161
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,510
â™«  Ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody, only you, you're my girl  â™«

162
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:10,800
â™«  Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, only you, I wait for you  â™«

163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,460
Happy now?

164
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,200
What do you mean?

165
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,320
There she comes. Ms. Cheon!

166
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,530
Hello.

167
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,260
Wait, how did you come, Ms. Song Yi?

168
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,470
I agreed to go in Ms. Hae Na's place.

169
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,740
- What did you say?
- I can ride in the front, right?

170
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,690
You're not getting in, right?

171
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,940
You can go ahead.

172
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,210
I can't come with you because I forgot something.

173
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,810
What's her deal?

174
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,770
She'll be late if she doesn't go now.

175
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,820
Did she forget something important?

176
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,370
Did you wait long?

177
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,680
No, not at all.

178
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,280
Whoa, Mr. Jin, you look really...

179
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,700
great today.

180
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,260
Ms. Han, you also look...

181
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,500
- Like a pickled radish?
- Yes.

182
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,220
Shall we go now? If we leave now, we'll probably-

183
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,630
The wipers are...

184
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,670
There.

185
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,640
Should we listen to some music?

186
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,450
Listen to music?

187
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,830
Sure.

188
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,410
 I've prepared for you today how to look cool while driving. 

189
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,130
 - When you're going on a date soon after- 
Why is this playing?

190
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,540
Didn't he tell you to hold the seat like this when you reverse and go "whoa, whoa"?

191
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,820
 

192
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,300
It's Yul.

193
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,200
- Yes. Why?
-  Uncle, 

194
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,850
-  did you really get on the freeway? 
- No, not yet.

195
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,450
Hi, Yul.

196
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,870
 What the heck? Is Ms. Hae Na with you? Ms. Han, get off! 

197
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,220
 Uncle has never been on the freeway before! 

198
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,300
 Gosh! He got his license only three months ago. Get off! 

199
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,850
 - You've gone off the route. 
- Isn't this the right...

200
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,940
 Rerouting. 

201
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,110
 You've gone off the route. Rerouting. 

202
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,470
 Ms. Han, get off! You'll die at that rate! 

203
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,820
Hey, hang up now.

204
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
- Isn't this the right way? Is it that way?
-  Rerouting. 

205
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,100
Why is the windshield so foggy now?

206
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,000
 

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,100
 

208
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,340
 

209
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,360
 

210
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,180
 
 

211
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,540
 

212
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,920
 
 

213
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,430
 You've arrived at your destination. Ending navigation. 

214
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,270
We made it.

215
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,500
Are you okay?

216
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,960
Of course.

217
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,360
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

218
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,090
You went through a lot of trouble.

219
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,840
You went through more trouble.

220
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,580
Shall we get off?

221
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,550
- Yes.
- The car key.

222
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,950
- I think we're late.
- Should we run, then?

223
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,690
Let's hurry.

224
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,950
â™«  Whatever I say, it's for you  â™«

225
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,270
â™«  Learning all the love songs I taught you  â™«

226
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,980
â™«  Whatever the language, I don't mind  â™«

227
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,850
Hold on!

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,100
â™«  Ooh, there are blue moons in the sky  â™«

229
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,910
â™«  And the stars light the eternal light  â™«

230
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,950
â™«  Ooh, the waves are crashing in your temple  â™«

231
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,830
â™«  And I wish you were here to see me glow  â™«

232
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,510
â™«  Did you know you're in my writing  â™«

233
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,050
Oh, I guess we're not late.

234
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,620
Gosh, so cute.

235
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,000
Ms. Han, here.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,700
â™«  'Cause you'll be forever, only treasure, my toy  â™«

237
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,540
How pretty.

238
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,460
Next, the bride and groom will enter.

239
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,610
Please welcome them with a big round of applause and cheers.

240
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,910
 I'm here to give an officiant message, 

241
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,480
and after seeing the beautiful and handsome bride and groom up close,

242
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,330
I can't help but be amazed in awe.

243
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,400
Ms. Yoon Ji is so beautiful today.

244
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,540
- She chose the perfect dress.
- The beautiful bride and groom...

245
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,690
- Gosh, I'm so jealous.
- should be congratulated by you all...

246
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,300
- You can find a good guy and get married, too.
- so that this wedding hall would be filled...

247
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,540
 Would anyone be able to love someone like me? 

248
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,800
Next up is the congratulatory song.

249
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,080
What the? Mr. Seo Won is singing today?

250
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:25,330
â™«  When you told me you loved me and accepted me  â™«

251
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:33,500
â™«  I said confidently that I don't need anything more  â™«

252
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:41,320
â™«  And I'm ashamed because I want more  â™«

253
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:49,310
â™«  I become anxious again thinking about you all day  â™«

254
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:57,240
â™«  Because I get easily jealous, and because I get easily scared  â™«

255
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:05,470
â™«  Because I can't believe that you are smiling by my side  â™«

256
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:13,460
â™«  Because I am so happy, and because I am so overwhelmed  â™«

257
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,850
â™«  I can't fall asleep, afraid that it will all disappear when I open my eyes  â™«

258
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,310
Sir, here you go.

259
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,180
Okay. Thank you.

260
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,900
â™«  You have given me a gift called "Us"  â™«

261
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,980
â™«  I love you  â™«

262
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,120
Thank you.

263
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,660
What's this? Is it over?

264
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,170
Whoa, what was that, Mr. Seo Won? You sang so well!

265
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,820
I sang because Mr. Bong asked me to, but I was a bit nervous.

266
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,000
Not at all. You didn't look nervous at all.

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,890
Ms. Chae Ah, you came late. So, you didn't get to hear him, right?

268
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,770
No, I didn't.

269
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,810
Bong and Seo couple is here!

270
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,470
Eat up and enjoy.

271
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,420
Whoa, Bong and Seo, Bong and Seo.

272
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,510
Song Yi, Song Yi, Cheon Song Yi, thank you for coming.

273
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,440
Aigoo, our school couple is finally getting married. Congrats.

274
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,490
By the way, you should all try dating on campus. It's kind of thrilling.

275
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,720
Who knows? There might be a new campus couple at our school.

276
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,170
Wow, Mr. Jin, you were more handsome than me today.

277
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,490
Congrats.

278
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,370
Right, you should all see the beach since you're here. It's close.

279
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,520
- Should we? Get grilled clams, too.
- That'd be great.

280
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,550
Let's all go together.

281
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,320
Mr. Jin, did you bring your car, by the way?

282
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,030
- Yes. Why?
- I have a favor to ask.

283
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,720
There's a life-size display upstairs. Could you put it in your car?

284
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,260
- Sure.
- Thank you, thank you.

285
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,130
Mr. Seo Won!

286
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,340
- Are you done eating?
- Well, yes.

287
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,960
- Where are you going?
- To my car for a second.

288
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,980
Oh, really?

289
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,340
I've got a little urgent matter right now.

290
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,620
Could you give me a ride just to the terminal, please?

291
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,630
- Right now?
- Yes, something urgent just came up.

292
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,990
Ms. Hae Na, you'll come with us to the beach, right?

293
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,590
Yes, of course.

294
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,120
Whoa. It's been forever since I've been to the beach.

295
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,040
I used to run around and...

296
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,840
Mr. Jin?

297
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,080
Well...

298
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,340
- let's make it quick.
- Thank you, Mr. Jin.

299
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,730
So full.

300
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,660
Where did Seo Won go?

301
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,350
- He just left with Ms. Chae Ah.
- Sorry?

302
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,920
Ms. Chae Ah took Mr. Seo Won as if she was arresting him.

303
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,360
I see.

304
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,090
I'll give Seo Won a call.

305
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,480
Forget about the people who left. Let's just go to the beach by ourselves.

306
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,830
Is there an extra seat in your car with the three of you?

307
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,130
Sure, you can come.

308
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,000
I forgot I needed to go home and walk my dog.

309
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,710
Hello?

310
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,380
 I heard you went back with Ms. Chae Ah. 

311
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,000
No, that's not it. Ms. Yoon said something urgent came up.

312
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,680
 I'll take Ms. Hae Na in my car, then. 

313
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,240
 Ms. Hae Na, wait up! 

314
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,900
The next bus is in two hours.

315
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,220
Didn't you say it was urgent?

316
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,170
- Let's just go all the way to Seoul, then.
- Really?

317
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,020
I'd be really grateful.

318
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,030
Wait, is this...

319
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,980
the right way?

320
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,540
Ms. Jin, is everything okay?

321
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,280
There are so many cars.

322
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,780
 You've gone off the route. 

323
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,390
- Wait a minute. I'll try a U-turn first.
- Okay.

324
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,190
- Are you okay?
- Y-Yes.

325
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,700
 Rerouting. 

326
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,030
How old were you when you first saw a beach?

327
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,260
Well...

328
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,580
I think I was six.

329
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,050
I can't really remember.

330
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,540
When I saw the beach for the first time,

331
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,910
I was really mesmerized, especially by the ebb and flow of the tide.

332
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:36,670
True. I think I was surprised by the low tide because it happened a lot faster than I expected.

333
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,500
I even sat still and stared at the waters for days once.

334
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,700
Even though I was watching the tides come and go, I didn't realize it.

335
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,300
The fact that the ocean is being pulled by that tiny moon.

336
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,160
If you were the ocean,

337
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,500
would you feel it's unfair?

338
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,670
By an existence it doesn't even know well,

339
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,720
regardless of its will,

340
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,350
it gets closer to the land and grow distant again.

341
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,270
I don't think I ever thought of it that way.

342
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,430
But I think being still would also be quite boring.

343
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,520
Right?

344
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,460
Let's go eat some grilled clams.

345
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,250
Oh, I'm not really hungry.

346
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,840
Come on, no one eats them to get full.

347
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,190
It's to enjoy the beach atmosphere since we're here.

348
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,570
All right, then. Since we saw the ocean,

349
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,540
let's hurry back before the traffic hits.

350
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,210
Yes.

351
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,350
You'll grow distant faster than you think.

352
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,490
 Regardless of your will. 

353
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,640
Just as I did.

354
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,610
 You've arrived at your destination. Ending navigation. 

355
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,480
We're here.

356
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,050
Are you okay?

357
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,880
Y-Yes, I'm okay, Mr. Jin.

358
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,100
Mr. Jin, you're hungry, right?

359
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,070
I'm hungry, too.

360
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,550
Should we get dinner together?

361
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,650
You said something urgent came up earlier.

362
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,000
It all worked out already.

363
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,350
I'm not feeling too well.

364
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,880
Well, then.

365
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,620
Let's hope for next time.

366
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,790
Thank you.

367
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,640
 

368
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,300
 
 Ms. Han, did you get home safely? 

369
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,010
 I'm sorry about today. 

370
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,740
 - Ms. Yoon had something urgent come up.
- What urgent- 

371
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,150
 Not at all. Thank you for today. 

372
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,070
Whatever. I don't care.

373
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,240
- What don't you care?
- Just everything.

374
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,960
Hey, I gave it some thought, right?

375
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,420
I think you should get some help from that student.

376
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,830
- Who?
- The math teacher's nephew.

377
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,590
You said they live together.

378
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,040
What kind of help could I possibly get from him and why?

379
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,270
It's nothing, really. He just needs to sneak you into the math teacher's room.

380
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,490
Then, you can stroll up to the math teacher in his sleep and kiss him.

381
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,580
And you just walk out confidently on two feet. That's it, okay?

382
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,540
By the way,

383
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,440
how should I bring it up to him?

384
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,570
He already knows your secret. Just ask him.

385
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,880
In that case,

386
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,490
I need to tell him about the kiss as well.

387
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,100
Do it.

388
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,370
He would think I'm a total trash.

389
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,770
His homeroom teacher got drunk and kissed his uncle- Gosh, so embarrassing.

390
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,230
Hey, do you want momentary embarrassment or live as a dog for life?

391
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,360
Gosh! That's enough brushing, seriously! I'm going to lose all my hair.

392
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,890
So, will you also fail at lifting the curse and end up like Uncle?

393
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,710
I'll undo it.

394
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm going to undo it.

395
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,250
 

396
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,800
Hey.

397
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,710
I heard you know all about my family's curse.

398
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,330
- I see, that's your family's curse?
- Yes.

399
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,870
Anyhow, we came to see you today

400
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,460
to see if you're a trustworthy person.

401
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,970
- Do you turn into a dog, too, Ms. Han's unni?
- Yes.

402
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,050
It doesn't happen under a full moon, does it?

403
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,130
Hey, do you think we're werewolves?

404
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,510
We only change temporarily at dawn under the spell of the curse.

405
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,520
Why don't you advertise it more loudly?

406
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,260
He already knows everything.

407
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,480
What does he know? You're telling him everything from A to Z.

408
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,600
- When did I?
- That's what you did just now.

409
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,170
By the way, how do you get the curse?

410
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,160
Oh, you get it when you k-

411
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,210
K-Kid, you're not even tall enough!

412
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,460
- But why are you so curious?
- Anyhow!

413
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,690
- You don't need to know too much in detail.
- By the way,

414
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,640
you're also very beautiful, Ms. Han's unni.

415
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,100
Really?

416
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,510
Tell me which part, more in detail.

417
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,570
I think you'll be really cute overall in your dog form.

418
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,570
Isn't it a compliment?

419
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,280
No, he just said you're a dog.

420
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,250
Yes, yes, yes! Throw it, throw it!

421
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,100
Catch it. Here.

422
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,740
 

423
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
So it was a kiss.

424
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,140
Yes.

425
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,880
With whom?

426
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,920
Mr. Jin Seo Won.

427
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,810
Oh, I see.

428
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,890
My uncle.

429
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,580
Have you two been lying to me, then?

430
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,480
It's not that we lied to you-

431
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,210
I knew it. I knew you two had something going on.

432
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,460
It's not that we had something going on-

433
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,440
You kissed when there was nothing going on?

434
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,850
Well, I was so drunk then.

435
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,860
It was a mistake. A mistake.

436
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,240
Did you kiss before you started dating?

437
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,210
Anyway, for me to break the curse of becoming a dog,

438
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,040
I have to kiss Mr. Jin as a dog-

439
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,070
I have to kiss him again.

440
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,250
So, I was wondering...

441
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,400
could you let me in your place...

442
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,280
when your uncle is sleeping?

443
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,480
Let's do it tonight, then.

444
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,500
Thank you, Yul.

445
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,580
Ma'am, by the way,

446
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,740
will you no longer turn into a dog once the curse is lifted?

447
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,100
I won't for now.

448
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,630
But if I want to date someone else-

449
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,300
You have to go through this to date someone.

450
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,700
Why don't you just date my uncle, then?

451
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,870
Huh?

452
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,820
What? You don't like my uncle?

453
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,650
No, it's not that...

454
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Who would like me, anyway?

455
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,300
It's kind of weird that I turn into a dog.

456
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,450
I thought it was fine.

457
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,350
You're cute, Ms. Han.

458
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,060
â™«  It feels like forever  â™«

459
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,780
You can leave.

460
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,510
Leave?

461
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,240
I need some time to think.

462
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,780
Bye.

463
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,830
I'll get going, then.

464
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,580
Thank you.

465
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:06,250
â™«  When I'm with you, I lose track of time again  â™«

466
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,720
- Uncle.
- What?

467
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,770
- Aren't you sleeping?
- No, I'm a bit busy.

468
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,120
You can go to bed.

469
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,810
Okay.

470
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,150
Uncle.

471
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,650
What's this now?

472
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,350
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

473
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,650
Are you ill or something?

474
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,440
You must be tired. Go to bed now.

475
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,340
What if you get dark circles on your handsome face?

476
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,820
Why don't you go to bed?

477
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,210
Go to bed now, I said.

478
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,210
So rude...

479
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,050
Why isn't he going to bed?

480
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,770
 

481
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,780
 Ms. Han. I think we need to wait a bit. 

482
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,180
Hey, boy.

483
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,640
Gosh.

484
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,570
Ms. Han.

485
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,140
- What about the target?
- He finally fell asleep.

486
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,190
He's in a total deep sleep now.

487
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,150
Where's the outfit to exit in if it were a success?

488
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,960
- The sunglasses.
- The sunglasses.

489
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,990
- The sneakers.
- The sneakers.

490
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,170
- The cap.
- The cap.

491
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,160
- The sweatpants.
- The sweatpants.

492
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,910
The bra.

493
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,550
- This is mine.
- Thought so.

494
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,740
We'll retreat after contacting quickly and accurately. Got it?

495
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,880
Is there a Plan B if we fail?

496
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,700
There's none.

497
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,300
Follow me.

498
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,150
 No need to be nervous. I'm a dog now, anyway. 

499
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,900
 But we grew a lot closer thanks to the curse. 

500
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,410
 I've been happy, my heart fluttered, and 

501
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,020
 I kept thinking about him. 

502
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,640
 It must've been due to the curse, right? 

503
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:45,200
â™«  The way I looked lonely and the days I had to cherish alone  â™«

504
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:55,200
â™«  As if it were natural, we came together, and the times when our hearts connected  â™«

505
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:08,540
â™«  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  â™«

506
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,940
â™«  The coincidences brought us together  â™«

507
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,690
 How pretty. 

508
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:23,670
 Will the excitement disappear once the curse breaks? 

509
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:40,300
â™«  All of my pain became a path for us  â™«

510
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:47,700
â™«  It's a secret between just us two  â™«

511
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,340
It has no pulp in it.

512
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,060
 What? Why am I not changing? 

513
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,540
 Should I try one more time? 

514
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,340
 Huh? Why isn't it working? 

515
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,240
Are you okay, Uncle? What's wrong? What's wrong?

516
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,560
A dog... There was a dog...

517
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,930
What dog?

518
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,330
There's no dog here. You must've had a dog dream*.
(In Korean, a meaningless dream is called a dog-dream)

519
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,220
You scared me.

520
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,450
You're okay, right?

521
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,530
I'm sure you are. I-I'll go back to bed now.

522
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,320
Goodnight.

523
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,790
Did she fail?

524
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,340
Why?

525
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,710
 It's okay. 

526
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,220
 It's okay. I can try again. 

527
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,350
Unni, why didn't it work?

528
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,780
Why won't it work? How come it won't work for me?

529
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,100
Did I aim incorrectly?

530
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,030
No, I did it properly.

531
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,690
You must've done it correctly. You have a mouth.

532
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,310
Why didn't it work, then?

533
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,870
I see...

534
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,240
I guess I won't change immediately. I won't change after midnight later.

535
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,930
That's it. Right...

536
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,990
What a relief.

537
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,000
You changed.

538
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,490
Do we have to ask Mom after all?

539
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,160
That's not going to happen.

540
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,700
You kissed your boyfriend, but she still flipped out on you.

541
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,290
What if I said I was cursed by mistake while drunk?

542
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,510
I'm sure she'd pulverize me.

543
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,690
Should we try asking her indirectly?

544
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,830
You know how quick Mom is. That won't work.

545
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,530
Is there another way, then?

546
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,560
But...

547
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,530
if we end up asking her,

548
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,680
can we ask her about that, too?

549
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,390
About what?

550
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,170
If there are any side effects

551
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,290
if you turn into a dog.

552
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,080
Side effects?

553
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,640
Such as...

554
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,470
your heart racing out of the blue or...

555
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,220
Like a heart attack...

556
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,850
Or arrhythmia?

557
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,310
Heart attack?

558
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,080
I think you're screwed.

559
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,860
What do you mean? It doesn't work?

560
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,190
Gosh. It doesn't work, apparently.

561
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,060
You have to do it when the other person's awake.

562
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,330
Mom looked through our ancestors' records.

563
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,570
 One of them said our grandmother from five generations ago 

564
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,690
 kissed someone asleep, but it didn't work. 

565
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:21,760
So it means if they're unconscious, it doesn't work.

566
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,190
Is love necessary to break the curse? That doesn't sound right.

567
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,340
What kind of curse is so detailed, anyway?

568
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,810
Who decides it doesn't work if you kiss when they're asleep, passed out, or dead?

569
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,220
I know. The one who started the curse decided, probably.

570
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,080
- Who do you think that bastard is?
- "Bastard"?

571
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,820
There probably is a god or someone we don't know of.

572
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,990
- You mean like shamanism?
- Not exactly that.

573
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,380
I think Mom took the hint. She asked if you were cursed.

574
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,280
- So?
- I insisted that it's not true.

575
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,150
She still might barge into our house. Be prepared.

576
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,190
She said you can't easily trick the curse to break it.

577
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,150
What do we do now?

578
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,460
Hey.

579
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,680
Just be honest with him and ask for help.

580
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,620
It's easier said than done.

581
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:16,200
And you can't just tell anyone about the curse. Did you forget it already?

582
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,170
Oppa.

583
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,640
What? He said he was in the room.

584
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,580
He told me he'd break the curse, so I went there, but that son of a bitch...

585
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:58,370
To be honest, I thought your relationship was going well before that.

586
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,170
He flipped out, calling me scary and gross.

587
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,360
I got him to promise me by begging in tears.

588
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,910
She was stuck in the motel bathroom until six in the morning.

589
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,960
She said she'd kill him with an axe and actually went out to buy one.

590
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,050
I got sick trying to stop her then.

591
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:22,200
So you gave him all of your severance pay, and it was done.

592
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,480
Hey! Gosh.

593
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,270
Don't trust anyone. Whether it's the math or the Korean history teacher, don't trust anyone!

594
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,070
But Mr. Jin is a little different- Okay, okay, okay.

595
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,000
There's only one solution.

596
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,300
Tell him you'd help him overcome his fear of dogs.

597
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,060
Mr. Jin, do you want to overcome your fear of dogs?

598
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,620
I can help you.

599
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,580
So you also think...

600
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,570
I'm weird, don't you?

601
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,920
This is why I didn't want to tell you I'm scared of dogs.

602
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,840
I guess we can never...

603
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,750
understand each other.

604
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,890
What if he says that?

605
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,940
He wouldn't say that. Would he?

606
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,760
I feel like I'm abusing him, trying to break my curse.

607
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,420
What else can you do? You have to hurt the other so you don't get hurt.

608
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,940
Try to be selfish, okay?

609
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,410
But I don't want to.

610
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,860
Why not?

611
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,720
Did you already grow fond of him while bickering?

612
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,870
It's not like that.

613
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,250
Aren't you going on a school trip soon?

614
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,300
Right. You'd better break the curse soon.

615
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,270
While trying to avoid getting caught by him, the whole school might catch you.

616
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,620
Gosh, I'm so pissed!

617
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,770
Oh, no, no, no. The bone. The bone. The bone.

618
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,310
Just let her eat.

619
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,360
If you add one to this side, it's 40.

620
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,440
 

621
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,700
â™«  Two hearts dancing side by side  â™«

622
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,660
Pass it back.

623
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:03,950
â™«  Nature is complete, enchanting night for our love  â™«

624
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,290
â™«  We will be in sweet meadows  â™«

625
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,250
You have ten minutes left.

626
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,630
â™«  Graceful together  â™«

627
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:22,530
â™«  Timeless memories that love will sustain from now  â™«

628
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:33,990
â™«  Forever dancing in each other's minds and a loving melody trance  â™«

â™«  Forever hearts, timeless melodies  â™«

630
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,180
Ms. Han! Ms. Han!

631
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,240
Ms. Han, what am I going to do? Seriously...

632
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,080
- What will I do?
- Ms. Han, how?

633
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,220
The answer is all in the question.

634
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,100
Mr. Jin.

635
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,550
- Isn't the test too hard?
- Tell us the answer.

636
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,470
Your test was the hardest.

637
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,720
A test has to be hard. Get going.

638
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,270
Mr. Jin...

639
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,500
You're still wearing this around.

640
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,030
Does it help at all?

641
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,910
I'm not sure.

642
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,580
I can handle this much distance.

643
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,620
Well...

644
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,590
I don't know how this question might sound,

645
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:07,940
but how exactly are you afraid of dogs?

646
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,680
How do you feel whenever you see dogs?

647
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,090
They're cute, and I'm happy to see them.

648
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:24,780
That means you assume the dog wouldn't attack you, right?

649
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,530
- Yes.
- But how do you know that?

650
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,350
You don't even know that dog.

651
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,350
I just trust them.

652
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:36,950
Then what if you were facing a tiger instead?

653
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,470
Would you still trust it?

654
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,040
No.

655
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,750
That's what it's like for me.

656
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,760
Have you been...

657
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,760
like that since you were a kid?

658
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,930
Something happened when I was 10.

659
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,730
Whenever I saw a dog, my mind and body...

660
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,830
Ms. Han.

661
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,020
When we went to the escape room last time,

662
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,630
you yanked my hair. Do you remember?

663
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,790
To be honest, I was a bit jealous.

664
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:40,960
You expressed that you were scared and asked for help with your whole body and yelling.

665
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,430
You expressed it without hesitation.

666
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,190
But I can't do that.

667
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:53,330
I just crumble by myself.

668
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,800
You know...

669
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,910
I'll try hard to help Mr. Jin overcome his fear of dogs.

670
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,620
Yes. That's how you'll survive.

671
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,380
It's for my curse, too,

672
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,340
but I really want to help him now.

673
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:20,680
- My goodness.
- I-I'm a teacher, you know.

674
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,740
Teaching people is my duty,

675
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,150
but helping the struggling students is my duty, too.

676
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,330
You think the math teacher is your student?

677
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,790
That's not important right now.

678
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,110
What?

679
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,080
What is it?

680
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,120
Never mind.

681
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,750
What are you doing, by the way?

682
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,820
Your hair grew a lot. I need to groom you.

683
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,770
- I don't want to do it.
- Geez!

684
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,750
- No, I'm just practicing. I'm practicing.
- I don't want it! No!

685
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,320
- I can do a good job.
- I said I don't want it!

686
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,270
Hey, you have to!

687
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,260
Mr. Jin.

688
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,040
- Let me help you.
- Pardon?

689
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,480
Your fear of dogs.

690
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,940
I'll help you overcome it.

691
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,220
I mean, we aren't always at school.

692
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,530
There are work dinners, field trips, and school trips, too.

693
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,470
You know, how dogs tend to follow me.

694
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:34,560
I feel bad that you feel uncomfortable whenever that happens because of me.

695
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,860
Of course, I should be staying away from you, but-

696
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,690
That'd make me feel bad.

697
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,260
No, not at all. Not at all.

698
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,590
- How would you help me?
- Pardon?

699
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,050
I was wondering if you had an idea.

700
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:59,260
Would you like to see me outside of school first?

701
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,170
- Outside of school?
- Yes.

702
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,060
Okay.

703
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,030
Really?

704
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,700
If you don't have plans after the exam tomorrow-

705
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,590
Sounds good.

706
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,020
You promised me, then.

707
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,230
Should I not go out?

708
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,430
One.

709
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,220
Two.

710
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,950
Three.

711
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:07,820
Four.

712
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,130
Five. Success!

713
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,560
The more I looked at it, the cuter it got.

714
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,940
Right?

715
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,110
Okay, let's go. Next.

716
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,510
â™«  Whatever the language, I don't mind  â™«

717
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,860
â™«  Million words I need to describe it  â™«

718
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,660
What do you think that one's saying right now?

719
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,740
- "I'll rip you apart."
- No.

720
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,940
"No, don't come. I'm scared."

721
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,480
Scared ones bark like that.

722
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,610
Wow.

723
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,800
â™«  'Cause love is serious, so electric, you were made of potion  â™«

724
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,500
Why do you think that one's doing that?

725
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,880
- "I'll rip you apart."
- No.

726
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,350
"Hey, come here. Nice to see you. Nice to see you."

727
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,040
The social ones tend to be intense like that.

728
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,900
How about them?

729
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:22,990
- This one's really saying, "I'll rip you apart."
- No.

730
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:26,970
You seem to think they'll bite you if they bark.

731
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:32,120
But they're all very different, like humans. So different that...

732
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,330
Let's get going.

733
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,260
- Are they fighting?
- They aren't.

734
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,800
There aren't many dogs here.

735
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,320
No.

736
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:53,910
It must've been difficult today. I'm moving too quickly, aren't I?

737
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,040
- No.
- Come on.

738
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,460
You look just like my students whenever I move on too quickly.

739
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,060
I know that face, too.

740
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,360
Right? You know, right?

741
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,340
If you look in the mirror now, you look just like our students.

742
00:58:53,240 --> 00:59:01,920
   â€‹

743
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,660
Mr. Jin.

744
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,580
Try imagining this is our house.

745
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,060
The most comfortable and

746
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,500
safest place in the world.

747
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:26,200
â™«  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  â™«

748
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,850
This is the roof.

749
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:33,760
â™«  The coincidences brought us together  â™«

750
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,000
â™«  They shined just as brightly as the dark times  â™«

751
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:49,700
â™«  Even the secrets I wanted to hide turned into precious memories  â™«

752
00:59:49,700 --> 01:00:02,480
â™«  We met each other in a way we can't help but love  â™«

753
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,020
â™«  I thought we'd be very different  â™«

754
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,300
â™«  No matter how different we are from each other  â™«

755
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:24,260
â™«  But since it was us, we're finally...  â™«

756
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,280
 

757
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,260
 - Ms. Han.
- Hold on. 

758
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,750
 Why am I running away? 

759
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,960
 - What are you doing right now?
- We were practicing acting. 

760
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,510
 I'm entering the Ideal Type Contest on YouTube. Could you help me? 

761
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,670
 Why are you so nosy with another class's business? 

762
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,200
 It's not important which class it happened in. 

763
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,820
 How about how she feels? 

764
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,830
 Just because you turn into a dog, 

765
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,250
 you don't become a superhero like Ant-man or Spiderman. 

766
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,870
 Why didn't I think of that? 

767
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:58,230
 What do you think a male teacher is most sensitive about with female students, guys?
