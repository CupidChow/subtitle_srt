1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:10,250
   ​

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,590
 

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,970
 

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,720
 

5
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,560
 

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,140
 
 I feel a bit weird these days. 

7
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,200
 I just don't know how I feel. 

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,840
 Should I tell you? 

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,180
 Stop avoiding me. I'll wait. 

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,340
 Until you recover all the missing pieces. 

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,160
 Why on earth are you doing this to me? 

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,500
 You asked why? 

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,920
 Because of your cruel and selfish choice... 

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,090
 I think Mr. Bo Gyeom is preparing for the end. 

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,090
 Erasing Ms. Hae Na's memories isn't the end. 

16
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,710
 I'm sorry for remembering too late. 

17
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,200
 It's not too late. So come slowly. 

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,180
♫  I want to touch those warm fingertips  ♫

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,840
♫  But just looking at you makes me happy  ♫

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,250
 Sir, you said we will go to the beach. 

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,130
 But I meet you in the mountains again. 

22
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,840
 I know Lady Cho Young's whereabouts. 

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,720
♫  Among those countless stars  ♫

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,510
 Fire! 

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
 I must die for you two to live. 

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,120
 - So I shall save you.
- My Lady! 

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,390
 In that moment's decision, was I not included? 

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,960
 The sun setting on your face was really pretty. 

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,440
 The game is over. 

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,440
 It hurt quite a lot, and we cried from time to time. 

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,260
 But we laughed a lot and it was fun. 

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,580
 So, now it is time to go home. 

33
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,100
♫  It feels like forever  ♫

34
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,280
 Are you okay? 

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,780
 Oh, I'm sorry! 

36
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,470
 Ms. Han! 

37
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,050
♫  I'm dreaming of never  ♫

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:57,320
♫  The closer I get, it feels far away  ♫

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,250
♫  When I'm with you  ♫

40
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,810
 What color do you think I change into? 

41
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,950
 Whichever color it is, you'll be pretty. 

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,130
♫  Will you be thinking of me?  ♫

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,870
It's been so long since I ran like this.

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,450
I also ran quite a distance...

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,830
after my first kiss with you.

46
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:41,790
♫  Days are too far apart with you  ♫

47
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,730
I missed you.

48
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,280
 

49
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,120
"Garam's Got Talent?"

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,450
Oh, we're holding a festival.

51
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,070
I'm jealous of the other kids.

52
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,910
Where can we apply when we've failed the college entrance exam?

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,100
Aigoo, I guess the military is our only option.

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,570
- I'm going.
- To enlist?

55
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,300
No, here!

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh, is the first prize a laptop?

57
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,020
It's not because of that!

58
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,730
I think it'll be helpful for my practical exam.

59
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,780
Right. She wanted to major in performing arts.

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,750
Liar, you just want the laptop.

61
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,100
I said, I don't!

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,200
What will you perform? Sing? Dance? Acting?

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,420
Is that fun?

64
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,800
Yeah, look at this. Isn't Mink so cute?

65
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,700
You have no desire to go to college?

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,200
Who needs college when I have Mink?

67
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,990
Sure, as long as you're happy.

68
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,870
 

69
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,680
 

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
The new vice principal is so annoying.

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,120
I don't think he knows what an electronic sign-off is.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,100
He won't sign off, no matter how long I wait.

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,800
And when I go see him, he's never at his desk!

74
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,100
I miss our old vice principal.

75
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,130
We had Mr. Bo Gyeom last year, too.

76
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,580
It was so much fun.

77
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,630
Where did they all disappear to?

78
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,470
Who knows?

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
 

80
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,040
What now?

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,620
What?

82
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,250
You're feeling down.

83
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,020
Your breathing is rough right now.

84
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,830
I'm not.

85
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,510
Ms. Han! Ms. Han!

86
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,830
Hey, guys.

87
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,980
What's up?

88
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,750
Screenplay?

89
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,420
Yes. I want to perform at the festival,

90
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,380
but I don't know which play I should choose.

91
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,100
Sure, it'll be helpful for your admissions, so I'll think about it.

92
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,220
 Really? 

93
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,230
- Thank you, Ms. Han!
- Yay!

94
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,830
Oh, my gosh!

95
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,590
Woohoo!

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,100
It's so pretty.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,860
Oh, my eyes.

98
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,650
Pretty, right?

99
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,820
Yes.

100
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,420
2 carats.

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,050
My boyfriend bought it for me.

102
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,110
What?

103
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,170
Ms. Chae Ah, you had a boyfriend?

104
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,430
Yes.

105
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,800
He's a bit stoic,

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,190
but he's like a puppy.

107
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,100
Didn't you say you prefer cat-like men?

108
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,980
That's old news.

109
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,640
Oh, I see.

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,070
Okay.

111
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,240
 

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,750
 

113
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,580
 

114
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,910
 
(It means Korea)

115
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,920
They say history repeats itself.

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,740
Why do secret couples always film a 007 movie?

117
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,090
 

118
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,250
 

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
 
 

120
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,740
 

121
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,810
Gosh, this is too ordinary.

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,650
No, no.

123
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,640
Geez, what are you doing?

124
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,810
I'm doomed.

125
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,340
- Why? What is it now?
- Unni.

126
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,500
Do you remember Mr. Seo Won prepared an event for my birthday?

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,900
Yes, a cruise ship and fireworks...

128
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,480
It was extravagant.

129
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,440
There are only 10 days left.

130
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,900
- Until what?
- Mr. Seo Won's birthday.

131
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,200
Hey, what will you do?

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,550
What are you getting him?

133
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,810
I'm still thinking.

134
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,400
Hey, it's the thought that counts.

135
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,940
Make him seaweed soup and ask mom to make some side dishes.

136
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,420
That's thoughtful and touching,

137
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,090
but not creative.

138
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,270
If you want to be creative,

139
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,340
let's bring him to Mom's store.

140
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,540
You can introduce him to Mom while you're at it.

141
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,120
Mom's store?

142
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,180
Mom.

143
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,480
Hello.

144
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,970
Is it good?

145
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,070
It's delicious.

146
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,240
All right, now then...

147
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
take a guess.

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,600
One of the chickens you just ate

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,900
isn't our store's.

150
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,570
If you want to become our son-in-law, you better get it right.

151
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,490
Right.

152
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,310
Mother, I already know the answer.

153
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,520
Surprise!

154
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,260
Are you crazy?

155
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,070
What? Isn't it creative?

156
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,810
It's not meaningful.

157
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,670
What meaning does a birthday party need?

158
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,620
How deeply moved and surprised I was...

159
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,090
I want to return them twofold.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,670
Then where's the most meaningful place for you two?

161
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,890
School?

162
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,530
Gosh. School, my foot.

163
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,160
The haunted house?

164
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,910
We went there when I regained my memories.

165
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,400
Why are we here?

166
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,460
Mr. Jin, do you remember?

167
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,380
This is where we...

168
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,730
Surprise!

169
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,130
Birthday party!

170
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,650
Geez!

171
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,540
Do you want to die?

172
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm going to sleep.

173
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,580
Oh, Unni!

174
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,330
Good luck tomorrow.

175
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,420
I heard Woo Taek oppa is coming to meet our parents officially.

176
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,080
Well,

177
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,960
it's not like I need the luck.

178
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,140
Woo Taek just has to do well.

179
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,960
Whatever. Good night!

180
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,730
 
You look a bit different today.

181
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,530
You look handsome.

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,900
Mother, for you.

183
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,540
Whoa, my mom loves that cake!

184
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,230
What's with the formality?

185
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,900
Oh, gosh!

186
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,980
Jeju matcha cake?

187
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,970
Woo Taek knows best, huh?

188
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,680
You're right.

189
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh, Father, for you.

190
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,100
Aigoo! You shouldn't have.

191
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,400
He's like a real son-in-law, asking us for your hand in marriage.

192
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,730
Whoa, Woo Taek, sit comfortably.

193
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,930
May I?

194
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,260
By the way, why did you break up with your girlfriend in college?

195
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,130
- Well, um...
- Mom, why are you bringing that up now?

196
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,560
Why not? I'm just curious.

197
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,030
I was dumped.

198
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,090
Why?

199
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,600
Was there a problem?

200
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,130
Oh, at the time...

201
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,070
"Oppa, who's that girl?"

202
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,060
"Why did you help her separate the perilla leaves?"

203
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,660
"Oppa, why did you tear the kimchi for her?"

204
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,640
"Oppa, does she not have any hands?"

205
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,360
"Why can't she even tie her own shoelaces?"

206
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,570
That's why...

207
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,980
What?

208
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,810
Who was the girl?

209
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,260
You should tie your own shoelaces!

210
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,900
That was just once!

211
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,020
But now, I want to tie her shoelaces for the rest of my life.

212
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,960
I'll tie them for you.

213
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,330
Why? I have hands, too.

214
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,290
I'll still tie them for you.

215
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,090
- Gosh, you're such a player.
- You like that.

216
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,230
You're making me feel shy.

217
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,060
Guys.

218
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,880
You're disgusting.

219
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,930
By the way, where's Uncle?

220
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,990
On a date.

221
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,610
Uncle has a girlfriend?

222
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,770
You know,

223
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,440
that girl he's been courting for one week.

224
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,690
Anyhow, your uncle's life is a bed of roses.

225
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,710
Who knew his stocks would skyrocket after 18 years of neglect?

226
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,720
- Right on.
- Who knew that girl would become his girlfriend?

227
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,300
She knows about Uncle's circumstances, right?

228
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,820
He can't speak human language, but his curse has lifted.

229
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,360
Which is a relief.

230
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,700
Gosh, that damned curse.

231
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,380
Did you watch last week's "Single Dog's Inferno" episode?

232
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,040
It was so trashy.

233
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,330
But the cast members are so beautiful and handsome.

234
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,900
They flirt with each other-

235
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,290
It'll be a hit if we join the program.

236
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,990
What do you think about joining with me?

237
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,410
Would you like to audition with me?

238
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,540
What's this?

239
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,410
Dong Cheol!

240
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,350
Your stocks did that well?

241
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,590
It's totally me!

242
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,940
So sparkly.

243
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

244
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,610
This is...

245
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,210
This is totally mine.

246
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,000
It's so pretty.

247
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,640
Dong Cheol!

248
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,050
Are you okay?

249
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,760
 

250
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,090
 

251
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,880
 

252
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,120
 

253
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,840
 

254
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,930
 

255
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,570
- He's so nice. Such a good boy.
- Good boy.

256
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,580
I'm sorry we can't go on a date this weekend.

257
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,390
It's okay. I like volunteering to walk dogs.

258
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,840
Woo Taek oppa was supposed to come,

259
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,320
but he's meeting our parents today.

260
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

261
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,090
Hi.

262
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,180
We came at Woo Taek oppa's request.

263
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,240
Shall we go for a walk?

264
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,320
Shall we go?

265
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,910
Should we take him for a walk as well?

266
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,730
You're going to walk him yourself?

267
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
Yes.

268
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,360
Mr. Jin.

269
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,730
Yes?

270
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,340
Honey.

271
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,350
Yes?

272
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,400
Does my Honey have anything like the following?

273
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,490
Something you want or need?

274
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,820
Or something worn from long-term use?

275
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,550
Not really.

276
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,680
Oh, we should brush his fur.

277
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,310
There's a brush inside the bag. In the front pocket.

278
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,050
Guys!

279
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,070
Thanks for your hard work.

280
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,780
Good boy.

281
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,120
Wait.

282
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,470
Good boy.

283
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,770
Thank you so much for your hard work.

284
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,760
Toto, did you have a nice walk?

285
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,240
Toto, you need to eat well, okay?

286
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,330
By the way,

287
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,660
what's his name?

288
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,270
Oh, he's new, so he doesn't have a name yet.

289
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,830
Would you like to give him a name?

290
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,140
Deok Gu?

291
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,820
Deok Gu?

292
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,370
Deok Gu, it was nice to meet you.

293
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,770
Hang in there.

294
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,330
Deok Gu, take care.

295
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,560
I'm glad...

296
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,330
that you've overcome...

297
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,500
your fear of dogs.

298
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,280
I still get scared when a big dog appears.

299
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,150
That goes for most people, too.

300
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,870
I'm like that, too.

301
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,000
More importantly,

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,100
being able to share these conversations comfortably with someone

303
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,370
is like a great gift.

304
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,300
Thank you...

305
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,780
for being my gift.

306
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,820
 Thank you... 

307
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,070
 for being my gift. 

308
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,900
♫  The way I looked lonely  ♫

309
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,340
 By the way, why do you hate me? 

310
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,580
 Why do you find me uncomfortable? 

311
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,420
 When I'm with you, it's really- 

312
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,110
 I have my reasons. 

313
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,880
 So, tell me about those reasons. 

314
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,950
♫  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  ♫

315
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,630
 I also like them. 

316
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,120
 - Like what?
- Crabs. 

317
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,730
 Oh, really? 

318
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,510
 They taste good. 

319
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,900
♫  They shined just as brightly as the dark times  ♫

320
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:14,500
♫  Even the secrets I wanted to hide turned into precious memories  ♫

321
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:24,140
♫  We met each other in a way we can't help but love  ♫

322
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,390
♫  I couldn't look forward to it  ♫

323
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,700
♫  I couldn't even hope for you to understand  ♫

324
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:46,300
♫  The parts of me I concealed are being understood  ♫

325
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:56,100
♫  The pain I tried so hard to ignore gave me a reason to hug you  ♫

326
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:06,980
♫  All of my pain became a path for us  ♫

327
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,870
♫  It's a secret between just us two  ♫

328
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:18,070
 

329
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,430
 

330
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,200
 

331
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,090
Oh, hello.

332
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,200
Does Mr. Jin Seo Won work here?

333
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,430
 

334
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,480
You know, "Single Dog's Inferno," right?

335
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,030
I'm the producer, Do Min Kyung.

336
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,400
Sorry?

337
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,300
I sent him a DM,

338
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,700
but he didn't reply, so I came personally.

339
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,620
Oh, I see...

340
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,500
Mr. Jin Seo Won already went home... got transferred...

341
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,020
He emigrated.

342
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,100
- Sorry?
- He's not here.

343
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
But I heard he's here-

344
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,660
Gosh, he's right there.

345
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,440
Excuse me?

346
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,330
Hello.

347
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,540
You're Mr. Jin Seo Won, right?

348
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,450
No, I have a girlfriend.

349
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,140
Oh, is that right?

350
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,340
Gosh, so blinding.

351
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,510
I'm sorry for displaying a moment of disarray, unlike a professional.

352
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,660
But did you know?

353
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,970
Sorry?

354
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,740
In this world,

355
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,170
there's no such thing as eternal love.

356
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,670
But I can do it.

357
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,050
Do what?

358
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,160
Eternal...

359
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,010
love.

360
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,480
You're in quite a disarray right now.

361
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,450
Gosh, I'm usually not like this.

362
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,910
Right.

363
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,840
Well, then.

364
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
Oh, wait...

365
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,760
Mr. Jin.

366
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,410
- Are you really joining "Single Dog's Inferno?"
- I'm-

367
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,400
Last season's members were no joke.

368
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,310
A chaebol* family's youngest daughter, a famous pianist,
(Wealthy family who own corporations)

369
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,420
and wasn't there a physicist, too?

370
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,320
Oh, her?

371
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,640
No wonder you didn't date anyone. You were waiting for this moment, weren't you?

372
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,150
You would suit a physicist.

373
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,450
The communication will be great since both are in the natural sciences.

374
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,040
How perfect.

375
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,380
You can meet a great partner there.

376
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,060
Whoa, Mr. Seo Won is going to marry a diamond spoon.

377
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,840
I'm leaving first.

378
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,300
Are you stupid, Ms. Han?

379
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,790
Why can't you speak up?

380
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,230
"This man is my man!"

381
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,270
"I can't let my man join 'Single Dog's Inferno!'"

382
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,350
Why can't you say any of that?

383
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,120
Why are you shooting a drama all of a sudden?

384
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,310
Let's go, baby.*
(Referencing a K-drama, "Lovers in Paris")

385
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,600
Then, we can call you here?

386
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,300
Everyone, there's something we'd like to tell you.

387
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,280
Are you finally coming out?

388
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,170
What, already?

389
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,120
It was so fun making fun of them like earlier.

390
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,250
Geez, you should've kept it a secret for another year.

391
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,160
It'll become a nuisance if the kids see you.

392
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,830
Let go of her hand.

393
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,540
Everyone already knew?

394
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,270
If you become single again,

395
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,410
- contact me.
- No, I don't think that'll be necessary.

396
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,510
Goodbye.

397
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,620
Goodbye.

398
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,910
Hey,

399
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,170
- you should eat first.
- Okay.

400
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,760
I heard you passed the first exam for Hanguk University.

401
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,120
Are you writing your thesis?

402
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,340
Yeah.

403
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,000
By any chance,

404
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,800
are you possessed by a ghost who died because she couldn't study?

405
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,730
Do I still look like Ji Ah to you?

406
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,990
Just kidding.

407
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,930
I was aware.

408
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,850
Who...

409
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,260
Who is that?

410
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,000
A second-hand sales website.

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,050
I posted the board games the Vice Principal left behind.

412
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,380
To sell them?

413
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,190
No, to find him.

414
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,060
- Who?
- A fox.

415
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,550
Vice Principal?

416
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,710
Why?

417
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,570
I just...

418
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,920
want to greet him.

419
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,290
What greeting?

420
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,100
Don't worry about it.

421
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,200
I just want to see his face.

422
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,500
Why do you want to see-

423
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,170
Go practice for your performance.

424
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,900
Eat!

425
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,960
Still here?

426
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,370
Aigoo!

427
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,030
Deok Gu!

428
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,220
He was suffering from diarrhea these days.

429
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,300
Thank goodness they found a home for him quickly.

430
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,980
That's good.

431
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,370
Deok Gu, don't worry.

432
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,390
You'll adjust soon.

433
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,000
Deok Gu...

434
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,350
Hold on.

435
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,380
Come here.

436
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,510
Let's go.

437
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,520
Go.

438
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,380
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

439
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,580
He looks different from his photo.

440
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,900
He's bigger than I expected, with all this fur, too.

441
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,520
- You should take him to the hospital first.
- What?

442
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,230
He's suffering from diarrhea.

443
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,430
It's just diarrhea. He'll get better if I starve him a bit.

444
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,430
A stomach virus?

445
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,740
 So, he'll get better after a week in the hospital? 

446
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,990
Yes.

447
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,580
Gosh, I should've gone with you.

448
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,460
You're busy.

449
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,370
Is the play coming along?

450
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,630
Yes, of course.

451
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,100
Why won't you tell me what it's about?

452
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,850
Are you trying to kill me with curiosity?

453
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,740
If you're that curious...

454
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,560
 

455
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,380
I'll tell you just before your curiosity kills you.

456
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,690
Which is right now.

457
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,130
I'm about to die of curiosity right now.

458
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,970
You can't die. What should we do?

459
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,320
Maybe you should go to the hospital?

460
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,340
Hae Na, I'm serious right now.

461
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Not right now.

462
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,710
 
 I'm kidding. Come on, tell me. 

463
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,280
All right, let's give it a try.

464
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,250
Ready,

465
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,220
action.

466
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,790
♫  Stay with me with paws instead of feet  ♫

467
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:26,400
♫  Unless I forget myself, it feels complete  ♫

468
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,630
♫  Inside my head, I remain the same  ♫

469
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,120
Closer. A little closer.

470
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,670
Quiet.

471
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,230
How much closer are you going to get?

472
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,150
I don't want to, either!

473
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,150
All right, this is a rehearsal. Let's start with the scene where Da Eun pulls on the rope.

474
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,630
Okay.

475
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,120
♫  If you'd still love me, too  ♫

476
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,690
Cut! That's it for today.

477
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,000
Guys, you're a tree.

478
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,430
♫  On in this journey we'll embark through the love still, that's tenderly  ♫

479
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,840
Okay, Yul will jump

480
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,470
onto the desk.

481
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,400
That was perfect.

482
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,610
♫  My heart is dismayed, returning to you now  ♫

483
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,220
♫  Still I hear you, I'm here for you  ♫

484
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,470
Ready, action.

485
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,160
Go!

486
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,630
Is this hard?

487
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,650
- I can do well, too!
- Ready?

488
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,790
Make the tail stick out a bit more.

489
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,880
Good, good. That's perfect.

490
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,060
Perfect, perfect.

491
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,410
Rehearsal is over!

492
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,410
That was perfect.

493
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,980
Good job!

494
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,190
I'm a bit scared.

495
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,620
No, be quiet! Just be quiet, Uncle.

496
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,200
Just a little further.

497
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,280
To the left, to the left.

498
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,220
Where are we?

499
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,000
We've arrived.

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,650
One, two, three!

501
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,700
Ta-da!

502
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,210
You cooked this?

503
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,970
No, I bought it.

504
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,270
But I personally put it in the microwave.

505
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,960
Happy birthday, Uncle.

506
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,640
Thanks.

507
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,730
Go on. Sit down.

508
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,120
You take a seat, too.

509
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,060
- This looks good!
- Right?

510
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
- Shall I dig in?
- Yeah.

511
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,310
- Thank you for the food.
- Eat up.

512
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,170
Great job with the microwave.

513
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,430
Right? I prepared all this for you, Uncle.

514
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,950
You used to be this small.

515
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,370
When did you grow so big?

516
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,130
What are you saying?

517
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,460
Do you remember?

518
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,520
You would eat all the strawberries and chocolate on the cakes.

519
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,850
Me?

520
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,320
I only ate the bread and cream.

521
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,340
What are you talking about?

522
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,790
Little Yul used to be glued to his mom

523
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,320
and laugh at anything with the word "poop."

524
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,230
Where did he go?

525
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,030
Uncle, I'm right here.

526
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,200
He was so cute.

527
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,210
What about now?

528
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,240
You used to be so cute.

529
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,950
What about now?

530
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,760
Eat up.

531
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,070
Okay.

532
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,750
 

533
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,010
 

534
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,850
- Click, clack!
- Clack!

535
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,710
Give it some energy.

536
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,430
For three generations.

537
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,500
I can tell you don't have a girlfriend.

538
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,220
This one's for CSAT*.
(College Scholastic Ability Test)

539
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,270
Just buy one.

540
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,630
Virgin ghost! You'll never be able to stick a talisman on me!

541
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,020
They're doing that all day!

542
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm at the site of Garam's Night,

543
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,720
the specialty and symbol of Garam High School.

544
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,420
They're right in the center of it all.

545
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,770
Could we have a word with you for an interview?

546
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,570
Hello, I'm looking for a bachelor ghost.

547
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,490
I hope he'll be at least 188 cm tall and

548
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,420
- I hope he looks like Gong Yoo-
- Hey!

549
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,310
Hey, you became a maiden ghost because you wanted to party!

550
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,720
All the moments I shared with you were bright.

551
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,710
Because it was a good day. Because it was a bad day.

552
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,370
Because the day was just right.

553
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,900
It's the end.

554
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,100
- Yes, the interview-
- Whoa!

555
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,640
My goodness.

556
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,720
I have the talisman that can put those ghosts to sleep. Come with me.

557
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,820
 

558
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,530
 
What should we do after tonight's festival?

559
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,890
Well, we should go home early. I think we'll be tired.

560
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,590
But today is...

561
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,380
the festival. Yes.

562
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,570
A fun and happy one.

563
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,870
Right, my students prepared a show at eight.

564
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,710
Make sure you come to see it.

565
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,500
See you later.

566
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,000
I told you to take her hand and go to a sunny place.

567
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,220
Hey, Ji Ah.

568
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,540
Why are your eyes so sad?

569
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,100
- They're not.
- Hello.

570
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,430
Hi.

571
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,210
I'm not sad.

572
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,750
What's this?

573
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,840
Don't cry, Mr. Jin.

574
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,070
Hey, I said I'm not sad. Ji Ah!

575
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,400
Hey, what are you doing there alone? Hurry along.

576
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,100
 

577
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,070
- Please!
- Move aside!

578
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,220
Hey, don't do it.

579
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,100
Did you come to buy Holly Molly?

580
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,190
Are you open for negotiations, by any chance?

581
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,440
You look familiar.

582
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,890
Weren't you shoved in some haunted house last year...

583
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,380
Vice Principal?

584
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,910
Gosh, how did you know?

585
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,800
 

586
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,210
- The kids did great with the makeup.
- I know.

587
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,630
They got me good.

588
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,450
Hello.

589
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,600
- Hi.
- Hello.

590
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,390
By the way,

591
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,880
you know how we have been really busy lately?

592
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,310
When was our last date?

593
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,360
Not sure. I don't even think I remember.

594
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,000
In that case,

595
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,080
how about tonight...

596
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,110
Excuse me for a moment...

597
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,960
Looks like Uncle came.

598
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,700
- Your uncle?
- Yes.

599
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,490
He was depressed because he broke up with his flirt recently.

600
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,580
So I told him to come and have fun.

601
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,310
Let's go together, so I can say hi.

602
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,030
Do you want to?

603
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,920
- Hi!
- Hello.

604
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,860
Uncle!

605
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,750
You made it.

606
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,410
Uncle, this is my boyfriend.

607
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,180
- Hello.
- This is my uncle.

608
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,620
Did you look around?

609
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,650
Right.

610
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,350
You said she's a teacher at our school.

611
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,600
 

612
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,970
Gosh, Uncle, it's okay.

613
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,650
One second.

614
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,830
Yes, Da Eun.

615
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,850
Okay, I'll be there soon.

616
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,420
I think I'll have to go because of my students.

617
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,870
- What should we do?
- You can go ahead. I'll be with him.

618
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,200
I'll be counting on you, then.

619
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,350
Uncle, have fun.

620
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,860
And cheer up.

621
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,690
Don't worry too much.

622
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,500
Make sure you come by later, at 8 o'clock.

623
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,390
Where is...

624
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,570
Mr. Bo Gyeom?

625
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,130
I don't know.

626
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,540
I really don't know. Seriously don't know.

627
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,870
Don't look for him.

628
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,210
He completely forgot about this world now.

629
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,680
They don't make this anymore, do they?
 

630
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,700
Yes.

631
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
It was really fun.

632
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,100
I know.

633
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,740
Aigoo, how thrilling.

634
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,840
Aigoo.

635
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,870
A match...

636
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,790
that'll no longer...

637
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,410
exist.

638
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,550
Geez!

639
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,000
Hold on!

640
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,380
 

641
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,820
 

642
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,070
 

643
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,290
 

644
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,970
 

645
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,290
Vice Principal?

646
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,620
 

647
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,470
 

648
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,580
- Hello.
- Go in order.

649
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,850
 - Hello. 
- Go in order.

650
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,940
What's this? Is it an event?

651
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,680
Wait, w-why-

652
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,550
Why do you keep following me?

653
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,650
 

654
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,040
- Wait a minute.
- Who are you?

655
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,800
 

656
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,810
Oh, you're the one from...

657
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,600
But why are you still barking like a dog?

658
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,040
 

659
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,360
Stop, stop, stop!

660
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,380
I mean, I didn't know my ability was this great.

661
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,670
You can turn him back, then, right?

662
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,270
Of course.

663
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:27,080
Aigoo, do I need to show you my ability?

664
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,560
Sit over there.

665
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,970
Open your eyes. Open them.

666
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,810
Open your eyes and look at me. You need to look at me.

667
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,860
Relax.

668
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,270
Relax.

669
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,720
All right!

670
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,700
Say, "A"!

671
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,350
All right, make your tongue

672
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,750
into this shape and say, "A"!

673
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,290
Just try it.

674
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,010
 

675
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,410
 

676
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,040
 
It's okay, relax now.

677
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,790
It's okay. All right, you've got all the vocal organs.

678
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,290
So you just need repeated practice. Next up,

679
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,730
"Na"!

680
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,070
For "Na," make your tongue into this shape and say, "Na"!

681
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,120
 

682
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,900
 
It's okay!

683
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,850
It's okay. Next up is...

684
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,460
say, "Da"!

685
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,880
One, two, three.

686
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,480
Thank you.

687
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,400
Please take care.

688
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,540
 

689
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,600

690

691
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,350
 I'm sorry. 

692
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,960
 It was really a mistake. 

693
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,230
 I know. 

694
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,230
 You mistook me for Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom. 

695
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,950
 Oh, my! There was so much dust on your desk. 

696
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,900
 It's not good for your lungs, right? 

697
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,790
 I was just worried about your health. 

698
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,570
 I'll take care of my health. 

699
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:00,150

♫  I was just being careful when I first met you  ♫

703
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,200
 Try imagining this is our house. 

704
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,670
 The most comfortable and... 

705
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,830
 safest place in the world. 

706

♫  I didn't know what to do, I was worried  ♫

♫  I only just realized it  ♫

724
00:51:48,600 --> 00:52:08,600
♫  My heart just fluttered in my imagination like the spring rain  ♫

725
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,050
Did you...

726
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,350
resent me back then?

727
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,380
What do you mean?

728
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,180
When I told you not to come near me because I was afraid of Cocoa.

729
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,450
Just a little bit.

730
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,980
Should I do something for you?

731
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,360
I feel bad.

732
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,320
Well, it's all in the past

733
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,530
and I did throw myself at you without knowing anything.

734
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,560
It's okay.

735
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,200
Then what about today?

736
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,300
Should I do something for you?

737
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,920
To be honest,

738
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,120
I'm more sorry today.

739
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,770
Well...

740
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,310
Thank you...

741
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,110
for the gift.

742
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,020
It was the best gift...

743
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,930
in my entire life.

744
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,690
You watched it?

745
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,640
How was it?

746
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,420
I liked that part the best.

747
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,920
Which part?

748
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,970
When I take a step forward,

749
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,330
you also take a step forward.

750
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:16,800
♫  I'm dreaming of never  ♫

751
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:26,650
♫  The closer I get, it feels far away  ♫

752
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:35,720
♫  When I'm with you, I lose track of time again  ♫

753
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,810
 Uncle, eat everything by yourself this time. 

754
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,830
 I'll especially make an exception. 

755
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,740
 Happy birthday! 

756
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,300
 Time that felt like a gift passed us by 

757
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,520
 and we also got to live an ordinary life. 

758
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,870
This one's a bit elegant. What do you think?

759
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,010
Look at this.

760
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,450
I said, look at this!

761
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,190
Which one looks good? Hey!

762
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:11,870
Look at this. Which one is better?

763
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,190
I keep looking at you because you're so pretty.

764
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,460
Oh, my gosh. You're crazy!

765
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,010
I just wanted to try speaking in dog language.

766
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,690
I wanted to completely understand

767
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,800
how my dog, Pomi, felt.

768
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,090
It seems the one I need is my Pomi, not you.

769
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,130
From now on, I'm going to live as an incredible pet- I mean...

770
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,200
I'm going to live

771
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,440
as an incredible owner.

772
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,030
You can keep the bracelet.

773
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,910
Goodbye.

774
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,800
Dong Cheol...

775
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,660
Noona, what do you think love is?

776
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,180
I keep thinking about her even as I fold this.

777
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,250
Her hobby is flamenco dancing

778
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,740
and I keep hearing flamenco music.

779
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,100
I think I should also start a hobby and...

780
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,900
- Dong Cheol, keep folding.
- I think it'll be great to start the same hobby as her.

781
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,240
I would get to meet her and think about what we could do in the future.

782
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,490
I'm not sure if I should even contact her or not.

783
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:24,060
So I keep thinking all-day-

784
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,390
Dong Cheol!

785
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,190
You said you put worldly matters behind you.

786
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,020
But it seems you're as worldly as ever.

787
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,310
I told Ddaeng Pal it was a trap,

788
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,590
but he never listens.

789
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,470
I did really well on my CSAT.

790
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,750
Did you come all the way here to tell me that?

791
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,930
Just to...

792
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,090
tell you I'm living a good life.

793
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,010
I was curious.

794
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,060
Because we parted before I could see you smile.

795
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,820
I'm moving forward.

796
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,280
So...

797
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,080
you should do the same.

798
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,040
Let's go out.

799
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,040
 Should we also set that afloat? 

800
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,740
You gave it to me so I can float it when I'm sick.

801
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,110
I've changed my mind now.

802
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,830
Do not be sick.

803
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,550
Your body and heart both...

804
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,220
Do not let even a hair on your body get hurt.

805
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,730
I am going to set that afloat,

806
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,190
so you never have to use it.

807
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,820
Sure, let's do that.

♫  The parts of me I concealed are being understood  ♫

837
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:48,300
♫  The pain I tried so hard to ignore gave me a reason to hug you  ♫

838
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:59,280
♫  All of my pain became a path for us  ♫

839
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:06,300
♫  It's a secret between just us two  ♫
