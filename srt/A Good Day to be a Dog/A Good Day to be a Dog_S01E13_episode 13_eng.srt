00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:10,310
   ​

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,360
 

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,010
 

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,740
 

5
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,370
 

6
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,120
 

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,570
 
 What happened? Weren't my memories supposed to be erased? 

8
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,040
 Well, isn't it up to me to decide whose memory to erase? 

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,770
 You said you could start anew without your memories. 

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,740
 Thank you. 

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,880
 How about meat with a shot of soju for dinner? 

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,540
 Just the two of us? 

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,220
 Seo-Hae couple? This is my handwriting. 

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,350
 Hey, stop playing around- 

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,430
 Ms. Han. I like you, Ms. Han. 

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,950
 I'm sorry. I like someone else. 

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,850
 Stop it. Everything you're doing. 

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,660
 Do you realize it now? What was taken from you exactly? 

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,470
 What are you doing, Mr. Jin? 

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,230
 Ms. Han, is it true? Are you really dating Mr. Bo Gyeom? 

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,220
 - You have a knack for tailing someone.
- I am pretty well-rounded. 

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,940
 - Why are you going there?
- She said she's going to experience her past life. 

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,320
 By yourself? You can't. It's dangerous. 

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,860
 Are you going to Seohae* this weekend?
("Seo-Hae" sounds like the Korean term for the Yellow Sea.) 

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,790
 - Would you like to go?
- Where did you get this? 

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,620
 Someone gave it to me. I miss her. 

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,190
 She's close by, but she must've forgotten all about me. 

28
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,060
 Do you think she'll come to like me again? 

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,420
 What did you mean last time? About my uncle feeling lonely? 

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,600
 His girlfriend lost her memories of him. 

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,280
 - Yes, Yul?
- Please hurry over to my house. It's urgent. 

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,660
 Okay, got it. Send me your address. I'll go as soon as possible. 

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,750
 Mr. Jin. 

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,440
 Uncle, I heard everything from Min Ji Ah. Don't worry. I'll help you. 

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,500
♫  Your little star  ♫

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,150
This is my first time here, right?

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,710
I don't know how this might sound,

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,530
but it somehow feels like I've been here before.

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,810
I feel a bit weird these days.

40
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,180
My head...

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,050
and my heart...

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,450
are acting separately.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,050
Lately...

44
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,120
I just don't know how I feel.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,210
Should I...

46
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,120
tell you?

47
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,690
Yes.

48
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,340
Yip!

49
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,810
Yip!

50
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,900
You guys kissed?

51
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,800
 

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,500
Already?

53
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,630
But why haven't you transformed?

54
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,170
Why are you still human instead of a dog?

55
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,800
That's what I'm saying.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,160
Why aren't I changing?

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,210
I thought you already lifted the curse.

58
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,090
With...

59
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,760
that Math Teacher.

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,510
What are you talking about, Uncle?

61
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,090
How could she lift the curse with the Math Teacher? She's dating the Korean History teacher.

62
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,330
What?

63
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,050
Am I mistaken?

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Our uncle must still be out of it.

65
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,000
Or maybe she doesn't know what a kiss is.

66
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,150
You know, right? That bubbly feeling the moment two lips collide.

67
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,220
You know what I'm saying, right? That feeling.

68
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,630
Anyway, what would she know?

69
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,110
If she kissed someone and didn't turn into a dog, we'd feel cheated.

70
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,400
Geez, she doesn't know what a kiss is. She didn't kiss.

71
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,590
 Mr. Jin, earlier... 

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,700
 I like you, Ms. Han. 

73
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,360
 Would you like to go? 

74
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,470
 To Seohae this weekend. 

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,170
 Do you think... 

76
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,570
 she'll come to like me again? 

77
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,930
 Lately... 

78
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,040
 I just don't know how I feel. 

79
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,430
- Mr. Jin!
- Hello, Mr. Jin.

80
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,160
Mr. Jin, hello.

81
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,600
- Hello.
- Hello! You're so pretty.

82
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,970
- Hello.

86
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,600
If x is 3, then the answer is 29!

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,980
- That's right.
- Gosh, Mr. Jin!

88
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,550
I totally got this.

89
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,430
- I'll ask you if I need help again.
- Sure.

90
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,220
Thank you.

91
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,750
I don't know how I should face him.

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Are you avoiding me?

93
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,030
Stop avoiding me.

94
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,660
It makes me sad.

95
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,110
Oh, well...

96
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,110
It might be confusing and difficult right now,

97
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,560
but I'll wait.

98
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,670
Until you recover all the missing pieces.

99
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,900
Until you become sure of your feelings.

100
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,790
Anyway,

101
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,710
stop avoiding me.

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,130

I was right.

Sure.

124
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,920
 I'm at your school. I have something to show you, 

125
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,220
 - so come to the school field after your class. 
- Excuse me.

126
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,000
Outsiders aren't allowed on-

127
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,570
I smell a dog.

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,530
I'm here to see Ms. Han Hae Na.

129
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,530
Where can I find her?

130
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,660
Ms. Han Hae Na?

131
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,140
You see...

132
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,640
She's my niece.

133
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,590
 

134
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,240
I see.

135
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,400
You're here to see Ms. Han.

136
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,560
This?

137
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,090
This?

138
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,180
Do you like these? I have another one.

139
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,470
I have this, too. My favorite.

140
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,230
There's more for you over there.

141
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,940
Shall we? Come here.

142
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,130
That's what the Vice Principal gave us last time.

143
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,140
Wear it on your dates.

144
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,030
It's supposedly really good for couples.

145
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,150
Are you making progress?

146
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,490
Well, you see...

147
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,870
Oh, right!

148
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,520
Did Mr. Bo Gyeom okay it?

149
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,590
Huh?

150
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,130
You know, "Yes to dating. No to kissing."

151
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,400
No.

152
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,910
But...

153
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,550
I don't think it'll be a problem anymore.

154
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,610
You were so adamant about it, so why not?

155
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,390
I don't really know why.

156
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,590
 I thought you had already lifted the curse. 

157
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,430
 With... 

158
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,390
 that Math Teacher. 

159
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,440
 Seo-Hae couple? 

160
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,640
 This is my handwriting. 

161
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,490
 I told you I'd approach you without wandering. 

162
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,770
 I think I might wander a bit. 

163
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,200
 There's a dog named Cocoa who resembles this doll. 

164
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,210
 She's close by, 

165
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,760
 but she must've forgotten all about me. 

166
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,650
Ms. Hae Na keeps trying to regain her memories.

167
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,700
I only wanted to give her a little scare.

168
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,210
Isn't it a good thing?

169
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,930
Did I make a mistake?

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
 

171
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,300
 

172
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,500
 

173
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,500
To the front.

174
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,160
 

175
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,550
 

176
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,490
 

177
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,750
Uncle!

178
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,440
Uncle!

179
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,720
Uncle, are you all right?

180
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,510
 

181
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,500
Uncle, you need to speak.

182
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,600
Why are you barking all of a sudden?

183
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,300
 

184
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,630
What on earth does that mean?

185
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,140
Uncle, do you have your phone? Message me!

186
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,560
You forgot how to write, too?

187
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,350
Gosh, what's going on?

188
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,630
Where did you get this?

189
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,280
 

190
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,160
 

191
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,960
This person...

192
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,070
made you unable to speak?

193
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,970
Why would the Vice Principal do that?

194
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,110
Okay! Okay, Uncle.

195
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,520
I'll ask the Vice Principal.

196
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,610
Are you able to go home by yourself?

197
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,500
Okay, I'll ask the Vice Principal.

198
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,780
 

199
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,440
Fighting.

200
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,790
 

201
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,610
 

202
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,220
 I'll wait. 

203
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,970
 Until you find the missing pieces. 

204
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,950
 Until you become sure of your feelings. 

205
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,510
 Why on earth are you doing this to me? 

206
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,970
 Why are you doing this to my family? 

207
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,230
You asked why?

208
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,060
The choice you made...

209
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,110
 Take your pick. 

210
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,960
 Between your family's curse 

211
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,920
 or that beautiful love of yours. 

212
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,430
Because of your cruel...

213
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,740
and selfish choice...

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Right now, as well as back then...

215
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,440
Choice?

216
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,240
What do you mean?

217
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,820
You abandoned Jin Seo Won.

218
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,610
Mr. Jin...

219
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,700
and I...

220
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,030
That's why my uncle turned back into a human.

221
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,430
How in the world did you...

222
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,520
Return them.

223
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,890
Return my memories.

224
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,940
Which memories?

225
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,460
Of Mr. Jin and me-

226
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,810
The memory of your friendship with the Lady you served?

227
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,100
The memory of cornering your Lady to a cliff?

228
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you talking about?

229
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,800
For you, oblivion...

230
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,480
is not a curse but a blessing.

231
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,300
When every moment is still clear to me.

232
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,770
The complexion of her lovely, rosy cheeks

233
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,770
became pale in mere moments.

234
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,600
The red blood flowing from her wound turned cold on the frigid ground

235
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,830
 racing against time. 

236
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,720
Come to that mountain.

237
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,610
To that ground.

238
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,220
To that mountain.

239
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's where I'll recollect that blessing of oblivion from you.

240
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,570
I'll go.

241
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,470
I'll turn things back to the way they were.

242
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,960
To me, oblivion is...

243
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,440
not a blessing. It's a horrible curse.

244
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,470
I don't know what you're planning, but it will never work out.

245
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,950
Even if we're temporarily apart,

246
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,920
we'll meet again in the end.

247
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,450
 That's why you abandoned it. 

248
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,050
 You abandoned your green forest for that dead woman. 

249
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,330
 To sword dance like some mangnani*.
("Mangnani" means executioner in Korean.) 

250
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,380
Cho Young,

251
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,400
you and I...

252
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,850
ended back then.

253
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,870
But those sinners were reborn

254
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,730
and hope for love once again.

255
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,280
Even though I placed a curse and stole their memories,

256
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,940
they persist...

257
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,420
on loving each other again.

258
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,970
Will they be steadfast even if they die...

259
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,520
and fall into the fires of hell?

260
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,350
Everyone, this is the class!

261
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,370
- Hi!
- Are you recording a v-log?

262
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,860
She's coming.

263
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,650
- What's this?
- Hello!

264
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,130
We've decided to seek a professional who can solve our problem.

265
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,680
Whoa, are you recording Min Ji Ah right now?

266
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,880
Our club is trying to film a horror experience.

267
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,110
Apparently, there's a haunted house on Hyeongi Mountain.

268
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,730
Who said there's such a thing on that mountain?

269
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,160
To be honest, the Vice Principal is the one who recommended it.

270
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,500
He said we'd be able to record an incredible video-

271
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,680
The Vice Principal told you to bring me along?

272
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,160
No, it was our idea to cast you.

273
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,930
It's okay. It's not dangerous at all.

274
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,040
Ms. Hae Na agreed to supervise us on-site, too.

275
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,840
- Ms. Hae Na?
- Yes.

276
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,130
- Hyeongi Mountain?
- The Vice Principal said he personally visited there.

277
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,690
Sure, I'll help you out.

278
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,770
Thank you, Ms. Han.

279
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,070
Hey, Ji Ah. Where are you going?

280
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,190
Ji Ah.

281
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,340
Why are you going in there?

282
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,040
Don't follow me.

283
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,780
I think Mr. Bo Gyeom...

284
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,480
is preparing for the end.

285
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,500
What do you mean, the end?

286
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,300
Erasing Ms. Hae Na's memories isn't the end.

287
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,960
Then what more is he planning?

288
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,190
Ms. Hae Na...

289
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,640
must not accompany them on field study as a supervisor.

290
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,570
To Hyeongi Mountain.

291
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,080
That's where Mr. Bo Gyeom resided as a Mountain God for a long time

292
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,990
and where I died in my past life.

293
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,630
Past life?

294
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,010
I briefly saw you and Ms. Hae Na in your past lives.

295
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,230
I didn't know why I was seeing it at the time,

296
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,000
but the shadows of our past lives

297
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,210
 hang over our current lives. 

298
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,440
 All of ours. 

299
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,080
You just need to keep going forward.

300
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,670
What about you?

301
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,740
I need to know

302
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,340
what my shadow is trying to tell me.

303
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,330
 

304
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,400
I'll go to Seohae.

305
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,280
You asked me to go to Seohae with you.

306
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,270
Why is it Seohae?

307
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,100
Is it because we're the Seo-Hae couple?

308
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,670
It was written on my calendar.

309
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,790
That was the only answer that made sense.

310
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,930
The affection you showed me should've felt weird,

311
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,760
but it didn't feel unfamiliar to me at all.

312
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,580
I'm sorry...

313
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,240
for remembering too late.

314
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,790
It's not too late.

315
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,140
So...

316
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,900
come slowly.

317
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,480
And don't fall.

318
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,950
Before that,

319
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,560
there's someplace I have to visit.

320
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,050
I want to go...

321
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,790
and recover some missing pieces.

322
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,620
We can start anew...

323
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
even without those pieces.

324
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,920
Don't go.

325
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,390
I want to make a sincere choice for us this time.

326
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,180
Then let's go together.

327
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,630
- I'm scared.
- It's okay.

328
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,220
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're making me scared!

329
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,810
It's okay.

330
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,150
Ms. Han!

331
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,390
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Ms. Han.

332
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,720
We're all here, right?

333
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,840
Did we bring chocolate bars?

334
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,470
- We brought ssamjang, too.
- Oh, yay!

335
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,180
Hurry up!

336
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,430
We've finally arrived!

337
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,720
The atmosphere is a bit creepy. Let's get a little closer.

338
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,110
We're going to die.

339
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,030
- Hey, you scared me!
- I'm done!

340
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,210
Are you okay?

341
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,570
Geez, stick together.

342
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,160
I think it's being recorded too dark.

343
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,330
But it won't be scary if it's too bright.

344
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,410
Is it going well, guys?

345
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,240
- Yes.
- Yes!

346
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,110
Why did you join us here?

347
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,880
Uncle,

348
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
you see...

349
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,610
I must protect someone.

350
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,260
Ji Ah,

351
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,800
there's nothing here, right?

352
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,060
She's still hanging even in death.

353
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,490
Huh?

354
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,350
Her eyes just opened.

355
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,860
- She's looking at us.
- Stop lying!

356
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,380
Hey!

357
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,570
Hey, stop lying!

358
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,010
Guys! Guys! Hey!

359
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,280
Hey!

360
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,790
- Come!
- Hey!

361
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,070
Guys!

362
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,980
Guys. Guys!

363
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,600
Guys!

364
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,310
D-Don't worry, Ji Ah.

365
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,850
I'll protect you. I'm not afraid of ghosts.

366
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,070
It's not a ghost.

367
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,530
- It's a fox.
- What?

368
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,310
It's Vice Principal.

369
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,090
Those punks.

370
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,060
I told you I was amazing.

371
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,810
There you go again!

372
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,640
It's covering the path.

373
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,390
Cover my ears?

374
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,270
Ms. Han!

375
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,570
Mr. Jin.

376
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,860
Are you hurt?

377
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,210
I almost slipped earlier and kind of...

378
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,400
No, it's okay. It's not that bad.

379
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,880
 What a relief. 

380
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,600
 I was worried. 

381
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,510
Do you think you can walk?

382
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,050
I had lost...

383
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,880
something very precious, huh?

384
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,060
Do you...

385
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,120
remember something?

386
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,740
For about five seconds.

387
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,160
See?

388
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,890
Remembering five seconds got you all sentimental.

389
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,210
What are you going to do when you remember everything?

390
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,920
You don't resent me?

391
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,510
I don't.

392
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,030
You said this is what I chose.

393
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,980
It was also what I chose.

394
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,720
Gosh, where did everyone go?

395
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,490
I think we passed by here already.

396
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,870
Oh, right.

397
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,740
That was me, right?

398
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,430
Cocoa.

399
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,470
Was I that cute?

400
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,940
Of course.

401
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,640
When was I so cute?

402
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,600
All the time.

403
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,500
Then, the curse must've been lifted pretty easily since I was cute. You probably kissed me quickly.

404
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,280
It wasn't easy.

405
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
Because I have...

406
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,140
a fear of dogs.

407
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,720
Why?

408
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,150
Is that weird?

409
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,260
 Neither of us are weird people. 

410
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,960
 We're just... 

411
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,430
 those types of people. 

412
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,330
Wait...

413
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,800
I don't think I can run anymore.

414
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,510
Mr. Lee.

415
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,800
 Sir. 

416
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,330
 You appear every time I stand at the cliff... 

417
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,740
Mountain God who has...

418
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,790
all the time in the world.

419
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,610
You said we will go to the beach.

420
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,520
But I meet you in the mountains again.

421
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,580
Cho Young.

422
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
Have you...

423
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,660
been doing well?

424
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,810
 The sun is also... 

425
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,330
 setting on your face. 

426
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,980
 You will also perish without exception, 

427
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,400
 only leaving behind all these memories. 

428
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,530
 Just like the sun that disappears without fail when the sunset is over. 

429
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,680
 Just like the waves that go away without fail after flowing in. 

430
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,540
 Your fleeting life will also, in the end... 

431
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,680
 I do not want even an inch of you to be hurt. 

432
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,510
 However, 

433
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,460
 if I disappear after filling your heart, 

434
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,590
 it will leave a scar in the end. 

435
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,970
 No number of sky lanterns set afloat 

436
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,570
 will be enough to stop it. 

437
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,400
 Will you still fill my heart? 

438
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,300
 Will you still hold me in your heart? 

439
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,930
 It is only a play, is it not? 

440
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,970
 I will fill your heart only for a moment. 

441
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,560
 Sure. 

442
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,100
 No one can stop your stubbornness. 

443
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,420
I...

444
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,720
I know Lady Cho Young's whereabouts.

445
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,310
If you are lying,

446
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,830
you shall pay the consequences!

447
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,290
Where is she?

448
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,100
Tell me this instant.

449
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,120
I do not know anything. I do not-

450
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,620
Please spare my life...

451
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,140
I have...

452
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,300
I am carrying a child.

453
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,350
Please spare me-

454
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,500
I will...

455
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,710
I will bring Young Lady...

456
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,520
to the village myself.

457
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,840
This...

458
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,370
Where did you get this?

459
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,690
Some female servant came looking for you.

460
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,560
Where is she now?

461
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,500
Is she safe?

462
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,200
She returned for now,

463
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,600
but things do not look so good.

464
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Young San, I need to get out of here.

465
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,300
That female servant looked pregnant.

466
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,600
Sir,

467
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,300
the three years of my mother's medicine you paid for...

468
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,420
This is how I will repay my debt to you.

469
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,410
My Lady! My Lady!

470
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,510
My Lady, we must flee-

471
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,850
Deok Gu,

472
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,090
where did My Lady go?

473
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,870
- My Lady.
- Mak Soon!

474
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,320
- Drag them out!
 - Yes, sir! 

475
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,080
Do not follow us.

476
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,720
Are you all right, Sir?

477
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,250
Chase them!

478
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,220
Fire!

479
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,300
My Lady...

480
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,720
My Lady! My Lady!

481
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,090
Mak Soon...

482
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,960
my baby may have died,

483
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,720
but we can still save your baby.

484
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,270
I must die...

485
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,640
for you two to live.

486
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,120
So,

487
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,670
I shall save you.

488
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,200
No.

489
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,410
You cannot do this, My Lady.

490
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,770
My Lady... My Lady!

491
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,740
 Sir. 

492
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,280
Mak Soon...

493
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,390
was I...

494
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,460
affectionate to you?

495
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,400
Can you tell our child...

496
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,950
that his father...

497
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,300
was affectionate?

498
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,550
Yes, yes!

499
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,430
Good.

500
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,200
That's all I need.

501
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,800
No.

502
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,900
No, Young Master. No!

503
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,760
No!

504
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,210
Mak Soon!

505
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,070
Let's head back down now!

506
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,820
Okay!

507
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,630
 I wish we can meet again. 

508
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,020
 I only wish we can... 

509
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,340
 meet again. 

510
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,020
 Even if my life ends, 

511
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,910
 I wish... 

512
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,560
 I can meet you again... 

513
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,670
Was it your own decision?

514
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,330
I am asking if you ran into the sword on your own.

515
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:28,380
Did you really throw yourself away

516
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,690
and throw me away as well?

517
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,960
I wanted to save the baby.

518
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,070
Thinking about my child who did not

519
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,780
get to feel a ray of sunshine or

520
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,550
a single breeze of wind.

521
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,600
In that moment's decision,

522
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,120
was I not included?

523
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,030
It flew quite high.

524
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,000
The kite you had lost.

525
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,420
I was reminded of the kite.

526
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,220
Had I known I would become a sword and

527
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:32,190
rip apart your heart like this,

528
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,130
I should have...

529
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,010
cut off...

530
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,940
my feelings just like that kite.

531
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,570
That is what I thought.

532
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,190
Are you leaving without even a farewell?

533
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,420
Deok Gu's father.

534
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,930
The sun setting on your face

535
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,020
was really pretty.

536
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,930
Will you show me one more time?

537
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,630
The game is over.

538
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,680
It hurt quite a lot...

539
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,600
and we cried from time to time.

540
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,400
But we laughed a lot...

541
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,900
and it was fun.

542
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,800
So, now it is time...

543
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,310
to go home.

544
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:31,660
♫  I suddenly thought about the past times  ♫

545
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:43,000
♫  The sad days that remained in my memory  ♫

546
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:54,600
♫  I was just being careful when I first met you  ♫

547
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:00,940
♫  I'm afraid I'm the only one who thought this way  ♫

548
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,280
♫  I didn't know what to do, I was worried  ♫

549
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,820
♫  I liked everything about you  ♫

550
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,220
 Where are you going? 

551
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,340
 Come here. 

552
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:24,170
♫  My heart would beat if our eyes met sometimes  ♫

553
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:28,830
♫  I couldn't hide my feelings  ♫

554
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:34,580
♫  You were always great to me  ♫

555
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,460
♫  I imagined every day  ♫

556
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:45,700
♫  I was happy by myself without even realizing it  ♫

557
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,460
 Mr. Jin. 

558
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,390
 Ms. Han? 

559
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:01,310
♫  I thought about it for a second  ♫

560
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:03,360
 - What is this?
- What? Whoa! 

561
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,410
 It's a dog. 

562
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,300
 Didn't he tell you to hold the seat like this when you reverse and go "whoa, whoa"? 

563
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:19,660
♫  My time stopped  ♫

564
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:25,380
♫  I liked everything about you  ♫

565
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,950
♫  I liked everything we did together  ♫

566
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:36,150
♫  My heart would beat if our eyes met sometimes  ♫

567
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,120
 Are you okay? 

568
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,660
 How many are you going to stack up? 

569
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:47,920
♫  You were always great to me  ♫

570
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,890
♫  I imagined every day  ♫

571
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,410
♫  I was happy by myself without even realizing it  ♫

572
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,110
 I like it. 

573
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,170
 So, I'm saying... 

574
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,730
 What color do you think I change into? 

575
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,300
 Whichever color it is, you'll be pretty. 

576
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:18,270
♫  My feelings become more clear  ♫

577
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,040
 Are you okay? 

578
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,220
 Ms. Han! 

579
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,820
 Hold on! 

580
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:33,180
♫  It's unfolding right before my eyes  ♫

581
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:39,720
♫  I'm so in love I can't escape it  ♫

582
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,520
 - Mr. Jin.
- What? 

583
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:50,100
♫  You were my love  ♫

584
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:55,000
♫  I only just realized it  ♫

585
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:13,780
♫  My heart just fluttered in my imagination like the spring rain  ♫

586
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,930
It's been so long since I ran like this.

587
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,690
I also ran quite a distance

588
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,170
after my first kiss with you.

589
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:56,290
   ​

590
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,450
I missed you.

591
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:18,300
♫  The way I looked lonely and the days I had to cherish alone  ♫

592
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:28,700
♫  As if it were natural, we came together, and the times when our hearts connected  ♫

593
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:40,890
♫  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  ♫

594
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,040
 

595
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,060
 Thank you for being my gift. 

596
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,390
 - Who is that?
- A second-hand sales website. 

597
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,180
 I posted the board games Vice Principal left behind. 

598
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:53,990
 To sell them? 

599
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,990
 No, to find him. 

600
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,180
 There are only 10 days left. 

601
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,490
 Mr. Seo Won's birthday. 

602
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,440
 How deeply moved and surprised I was... 

603
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,470
 I want to return them twofold. 

604
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,990
 Does Mr. Jin Seo Won work here? 

605
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,740
 Will you be joining the program, "Single Dog’s Inferno"? 

606
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,100
 I heard the cast is extraordinary. 

607
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,600
 Are you stupid, Ms. Han? Why can’t you speak up?
