1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
   ​

2
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,373
 

3
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,113
 

4
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:37,663
 

5
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:44,063
 

6
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:47,543
 
 Are you really dating the math teacher now? 

7
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:51,233
 Hey, watch your smile. You said you're keeping it a secret at school. 

8
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,293
 Can't you end things here and return now? 

9
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:55,803
 Those two must lose what I've lost as well. 

10
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:58,533
 Those two must feel what I've felt as well. 

11
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:02,433
 Was their love so overflowing that they had to act like that at school? 

12
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,173
 Anyway, this has absolutely nothing to do with us. 

13
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:09,693
 Of course. It's been over 100 years since my love cells died out. 

14
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,803
 Why was my face on the wall? 

15
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:14,443
 That memory... Could that be my memory, too? 

16
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:17,973
 It's been a while since I came as a human, and it feels very different. 

17
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:19,633
 Yul's not home? 

18
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,323
 He said he was sleeping over at a friend's house. 

19
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:27,923
 Actually, I think I left something here the last time I was here. Let me get it. 

20
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,863
 - What's wrong with this?
- It must be broken. 

21
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:32,463
 Give it a hard push. 

22
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:37,933
 Want to watch a movie? There's one I wanted to watch. 

23
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:41,403
 Ms. Han, now that I think about it, this isn't school. 

24
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:44,233
 Then can I do whatever I want? 

25
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,323
 I fainted a couple of days ago. 

26
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,613
 I need to know why that happened. 

27
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:51,643
 You abandoned your green forest for that dead woman. 

28
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:54,223
 To sword dance like some mangnani*.
("Mangnani" means executioner in Korean.) 

29
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:57,423
 When the dead woman doesn't even expect you to. 

30
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,363
Hyung.

31
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:39,503
They say a piece of metal that's had a taste of blood

32
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:44,053
will continue to thirst for blood.

33
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:49,223
I don't know how the owner might feel.

34
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:51,223
What's wrong?

35
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:53,793
That toy looks pretty real.

36
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:02,193
You should go now.

37
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:06,293
Okay.

38
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,183
I'll go.

39
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:40,813
Mr. Seo Won is a great person.

40
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,863
Must you be like that toward him?

41
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:49,723
Cho Young's blood isn't even dry yet.

42
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,743
I mean,

43
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,973
mountain gods aren't...

44
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,653
punishing beings.

45
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,763
They take care of living things-

46
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,453
A mountain god that abandoned its mountain

47
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:05,863
is no longer a mountain god.

48
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,903
 

49
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,793
It must be good.

50
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,393
You don't want some?

51
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:30,893
I'll have some after I wipe you off.

52
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:41,903
You still carry that around?

53
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,943
Have you noticed

54
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:49,253
Bo Gyeom acting weird these days?

55
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:51,603
Mr. Bo Gyeom?

56
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,393
I met up with him yesterday,

57
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:56,753
but he seemed unfamiliar as if he was someone else.

58
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:58,953
Is something going on with him?

59
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,623
Wait!

60
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:03,953
Maybe he was upset because you went empty-handed.

61
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:06,293
You think so?

62
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:09,823
Are you okay?

63
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,503
Drink this.

64
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:20,683
Let's go everywhere we want to from now on.

65
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,353
In that case, let's go to Han River,

66
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:29,053
camping, and... where else should we go?

67
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:35,803
What's wrong?

68
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,053
That's odd.

69
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,843
What is?

70
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:49,843
Dogs usually like me so much that they race up to me.

71
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,213
But...

72
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,813
I feel like they're avoiding me these days.

73
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:59,603
Maybe it's because your curse is lifted?

74
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,493
Let's go to an adventure park.

75
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,023
- Should we go tomorrow?
- Yes.

76
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:13,863
- Are you really okay?
- Yes, I am.

77
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,673
- I don't think you are.
- Nope!

78
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:24,143
Hey,

79
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,003
your fever is above 39°C!

80
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:30,013
Where do you think you're going in that condition?

81
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:33,233
An adventure park date...

82
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,133
Perfect, right?

83
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,303
Hello?

84
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,323
Hello, I'm Jin Seo Won.

85
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:41,853
Oh, hello.

86
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:45,103
Is Ms. Han all right?

87
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,083
She must have the flu.

88
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:51,623
But she insisted on going on the date, so I called you despite feeling bad.

89
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,413
Please take good care of her.

90
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:57,593
I'm really late right now. Let's grab a meal with Hae Na later!

91
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:58,953
Okay.

92
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,183
Oh, right!

93
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,913
I think I'll return very late today.

94
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,833
Have a good time.

95
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,533
Fighting!

96
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:34,183
My boyfriend's handsome even in my dream.

97
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,213
Do you want to lie down?

98
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:39,993
Sorry?

99
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:42,223
Come on.

100
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,283
It's warm.

101
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:49,413
My arm hurts.

102
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:07,093
Snug and cozy.

103
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:16,063
My boyfriend even smells nice.

104
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,703
Where are you going?

105
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:23,473
Come here.

106
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,883
Snug and cozy.

107
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,063
- This is an old...
- Wow...

108
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:08,823
Is this a field trip, or is this fashion week?

109
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,723
Do you have a cold?

110
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,123
Go away.

111
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:19,243
Why?

112
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:22,843
Look, these are travel logs from the Qing Dynasty.

113
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:24,633
Are you okay?

114
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,813
- Do you have a cold, Mr. Jin?
- Are you okay?

115
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,833
I'm okay.

116
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,913
You gave it to him, didn't you?

117
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,633
No.

118
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:34,413
- Oh, is that so?
- And this is an old map.

119
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,340
It's all yellowed.

120
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,833
- Guys, take a look around.
- Okay.

121
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,683
Isn't this too small?

122
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:21,213
Open the door.

123
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,923
Young Master Soo Hyun has arrived!

124
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,973
Master,

125
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,993
it's Soo Hyun.

126
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,973
Mak Soon!

127
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:17,773
Come here.

128
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,813
Yes, My Lady.

129
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:24,693
The baby is moving.

130
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,033
This is amazing, My Lady.

131
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:40,023
- Is it?
- Yes.

132
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,463
Min Ji Ah!

133
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,223
It's been sometime now.

134
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,963
You have a really good hunch.

135
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:06,493
But they said it's still a secret.

136
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,293
What is?

137
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,433
That they're dating.

138
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:16,023
- You didn't know?
- No.

139
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:27,643
It's this puppy, huh?

140
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:28,973
What?

141
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:32,623
The puppy with a story you're entangled with.

142
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,283
Wait,

143
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:36,013
what?

144
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:47,643
Yes, hi.

145
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:54,493
They're funeral shoes.

146
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:57,923
To put on the corpse for their burial.

147
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,963
Had I known these existed,

148
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:08,423
I would've made her some pretty ones, too.

149
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:39,023
Why do you keep cleaning an abandoned house?

150
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:42,243
I'm going to move in.

151
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:45,513
A fox should live in a fox's den as a fox should.

152
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:47,763
Fox dens are cold.

153
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,323
Wait.

154
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,660
Is this the underside?

155
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,593
Whoa! It's so warm.

156
00:16:56,593 --> 00:17:01,323
How do humans make such astounding things?

157
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:04,803
Your tail is going to catch fire.

158
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:07,843
Huh? Is my tail out again?

159
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,413
Geez, it didn't come out.

160
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,423
Anyhow,

161
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:18,983
what on earth are these things for?

162
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,053
Why did you store them when you don't even know what they are?

163
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:30,393
Once I've perfected my transformation spell, I'll go down to the human world one day-

164
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:32,293
Ddaeng Pal,

165
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:36,283
Humans are all ungrateful and cruel beings.

166
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:39,083
Do not even think about going down.

167
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:44,783
Anyway, when will she ever give you that thing called a flint?

168
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:47,123
It's been over a year already.

169
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:51,053
She has forgotten. There's no need to wait.

170
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,403
He was waiting, too.

171
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,343
Halt!

172
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:13,763
Stop right there!

173
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:17,653
Move!

174
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,053
What the hell?

175
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,893
Halt!

176
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,313
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

177
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,253
It's that way!

178
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,493
- Hurry and drop it off.
- Okay.

179
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:52,613
Use it on the wound from your fall last time.

180
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:03,993
Instead of that, why don't you try this?

181
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:11,583
"I found this on the way here. Use it."

182
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:23,543
When we were younger, My Lady got in big trouble for treating me like a friend

183
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:25,673
instead of a servant.

184
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:27,823
So you should also

185
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:32,093
treat me cold and unkind, Young Master.

186
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:40,203
I'll treat you how I want to.

187
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:44,133
Here. Use this.

188
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,833
You got hurt because of me last time.

189
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,293
If you do not use this,

190
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:01,193
my conscience will greatly suffer from guilt.

191
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,413
This lowly servant

192
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,433
would not dare make a nobleman of high rank suffer.

193
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:15,133
Then, I will accept this with reluctance.

194
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,553
Mak Soon.

195
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:38,433
Yes?

196
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:42,073
I came over because I could not fall asleep.

197
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:44,433
So you can end up sleeping here again?

198
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,093
Do you not want me to?

199
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,333
Of course not.

200
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,463
Did you get hurt?

201
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:59,533
Why are you rubbing doenjang* on it instead of the ointment?
(Soybean paste)

202
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:03,733
That should not be used at a time like this.

203
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,183
Then?

204
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,903
That should be used little by little

205
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:13,243
when you feel like you might die.

206
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:16,703
Who gave it to you?

207
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:23,483
Have you chosen a name for the child?

208
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,493
Not yet.

209
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,693
The character "Deok" is shared in the family,

210
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:31,933
so it would have to contain "deok."

211
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,853
Do you think it's a boy?

212
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:45,073
That's what it seems like, but I'm not sure.

213
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:47,293
"Deok"...

214
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:50,073
Grow healthily.

215
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,663
This won't come off.

216
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:01,343
- Gosh, what should we do?
- Are you all right?

217
00:22:01,343 --> 00:22:03,283
I'm fine.

218
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:13,883
Why is this not getting better?

219
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:18,043
How about the ointment?

220
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,403
Did you throw it away or something?

221
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,063
No, sir.

222
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,983
Here.

223
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,133
Did I do all right earlier?

224
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:30,333
I do not know how to treat someone coldly.

225
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,073
Whoa!

226
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,213
I also fell for it.

227
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,163
Did you?

228
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:47,133
But what's with your expression?

229
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:01,173
Do not be too good at it.

230
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,053
What are you talking about?

231
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:04,433
You know...

232
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:08,833
treating me cold and unkindly.

233
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,703
I liked it better when you were awkward.

234
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:19,693
Aren't you cold from getting wet?

235
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:24,193
I am. I might freeze to death from getting drenched.

236
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,853
What should we do?

237
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:35,233
I did not even see you like an idiot.

238
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,413
It happened because I was not paying attention like an idiot.

239
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:47,563
You will warm up if we stay like this.

240
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:50,033
You will get wet.

241
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:52,833
This is why you are an idiot.

242
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:00,483
Are you not cold?

243
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:04,393
I am not cold at all.

244
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:18,293
Do you know someone named Yi Wol Hwa?

245
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:23,393
He's the great-grandson of Grand Prince Eun Seong.

246
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:27,293
He might be from the collateral family, but he's still of the royal bloodline.

247
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,403
He was killed today

248
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,343
during the arrest process for treason.

249
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:37,543
Yi Wol Hwa's wife...

250
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:42,173
is at this place for pregnancy care.

251
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,903
We will capture her immediately. So be aware.

252
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,503
Mak Soon!

253
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:03,633
Lock the doors.

254
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:08,653
Where is the Master?

255
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,653
He became the ambassador to the Qing Dynasty.

256
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,223
He left early yesterday.

257
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:17,123
The traitor, Yi Wol Hwa's wife, Lady Han!

258
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:18,903
Come out and surrender yourself.

259
00:26:18,903 --> 00:26:22,493
My Lady! My Lady, be careful.

260
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:23,733
Hurry and flee!

261
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:27,633
Mak Soon, take good care of Lady Han.

262
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,683
Aigoo! Aigoo, what is going on with her?

263
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,303
Aigoo! Aigoo!

264
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:44,463
- Aigoo!
- Stop! Search every corner!

265
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:46,833
Aigoo, aigoo! What's going on?

266
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,253
Sir, why are you doing this?

267
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,153
- Move!
- Aigoo, aigoo!

268
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,493
Sir!

269
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:56,543
- Sir, please!
- Let go of me!

270
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:02,233
My Lady. My Lady!

271
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,823
 That way! 

272
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,833
 Go! 

273
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:12,823
You must be careful, My Lady.

274
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,213
 - Get her! 
- Go with her!

275
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:19,903
She'll die if they catch her!

276
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:21,893
- Catch her!
- Find her!

277
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:23,233
Find her!

278
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:26,313
- Get her!
- Find her!

279
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,633
Get her!

280
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:38,893
Young Master, what are you...

281
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:42,863
Take care of the Lady first. I'll look into the situation.

282
00:28:42,863 --> 00:28:45,793
Must you go?

283
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,443
There must be a way.

284
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:53,463
But...

285
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:58,473
Let's meet again.

286
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,383
Be safe.

287
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:12,043
 What is your name? 

288
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:22,033
 My name is Cho Young. 

289
00:29:39,783 --> 00:29:42,483
Who is this woman?

290
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:49,193
You can light the fire with a flint.

291
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,063
A flint.

292
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:54,713
One cannot be found here.

293
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:58,753
Then I'll bring it next time.

294
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:03,813
Were you not waiting as well?

295
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:08,003
A flint!

296
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:11,273
Fate has abandoned this woman.

297
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:14,263
She lost her husband overnight

298
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:17,303
and was chased by wolves.

299
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:20,463
She has become prey to a group of jackals

300
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:24,633
because she's a distant member of the royal bloodline.

301
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:28,733
Will her baby survive?

302
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:34,603
- Its life has already been extinguished.
- Gosh.

303
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:38,163
What should we do?

304
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:40,353
Lady Han!

305
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:42,823
Lady Han.

306
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:44,233
Lady Han...

307
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,773
Lady Han!

308
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:47,793
Fortunately, someone to take care of her is here.

309
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:50,273
Go out and bring her here.

310
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:53,513
Yes.

311
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:08,193
Even if I bring her these things, she will not eat them.

312
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:12,343
She spaces out all day like the dead.

313
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:15,853
And she whimpers all night

314
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:19,733
as if she's getting gutted.

315
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,743
Why did you save me?

316
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:19,163
It would not be...

317
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,543
this troublesome if you had just let me die.

318
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:29,323
If you're going to jump off, do it elsewhere.

319
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:35,383
I hate the stench of rotting corpses.

320
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,933
Fox.

321
00:34:06,223 --> 00:34:09,253
Fox.

322
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:37,263
Ddaeng Goo, don't worry and take care, okay?

323
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:38,933
Go on, Ddaeng Goo!

324
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:10,723
There's no sight of the fox who used to bring us fish from time to time.

325
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:16,043
Isn't it amazing? To think a fox would bring us fish.

326
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,513
My Lady!

327
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,573
Come out here.

328
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:48,603
Do you think it got lost?

329
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:54,303
Isn't it so cute?

330
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:58,393
I have lived a long life,

331
00:35:58,393 --> 00:36:01,973
but you're the first person I've seen to stand

332
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:04,253
on that cliff three times.

333
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:10,343
Why are you so insistent on dying?

334
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:13,673
My newborn...

335
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:16,473
went to the afterlife by himself.

336
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:19,423
He must be looking for his mother.

337
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:22,163
Your child did not go to the afterlife.

338
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,703
Its spirit...

339
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:29,153
lingered around you for a while

340
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:32,603
and got dragged into the body of a dying puppy.

341
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:35,893
Nonsense.

342
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,163
Your mom cannot recognize you.

343
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,993
You're so stubborn

344
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,733
and blind to top it off.

345
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:05,083
I'm sorry I'm late.

346
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,913
A lot had happened all this time.

347
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:16,803
Is this the so-called flint?

348
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:24,783
If you're well-acquainted with the mountain god,

349
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:28,703
are you a gumiho* or something?
("Nine-tailed fox" in Korean folklore.)

350
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,943
Yes, I'm a gumiho.

351
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:45,573
Watch your liver.*
(Gumiho eats its victim's liver first in folklore)

352
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,363
Just leave it be.

353
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:17,663
I will pave a stream to where you are staying.

354
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:27,563
Do gumihos possess such ability?

355
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:36,923
Gosh, seriously.

356
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:40,473
He's the one who acts cool

357
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:44,793
and I'm the one who paves the stream.

358
00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:47,593
If only I had one more tail.

359
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,073
Gosh, my back.

360
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:51,123
Deok Gu.

361
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:54,023
Deok Gu!

362
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,703
He must've gone to town again.

363
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:09,913
Did you make that these past couple of days?

364
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,393
Yeah...

365
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:14,183
I'm not sure if it will fit him.

366
00:39:17,363 --> 00:39:19,493
What's the matter?

367
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:21,363
It seems like...

368
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,733
you've found the will to keep living.

369
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:27,463
I'm relieved.

370
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,593
You must've been very worried

371
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:33,183
because of your foolish owner. I am sorry.

372
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:36,133
That's not the case, My Lady.

373
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:40,003
Have you heard any news about Young Master Soo Hyun?

374
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,433
I will probably hear about him soon.

375
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:55,823
Wait, this man...

376
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:58,093
crossed this mountain for over 10 years

377
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:01,923
and donated precious foods to the shrine.

378
00:40:02,623 --> 00:40:04,363
Aigoo...

379
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,353
I wonder what happened...

380
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:15,563
Why do the people whom Mountain God treasures leave so soon?

381
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,893
It's you, is it not?

382
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,333
The one with a face as bright as the moon

383
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:14,853
and spoke meanly but had kind eyes.

384
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:18,033
The Mountain God who saved my mother.

385
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:27,433
Mother spoke a lot about the one who saved her.

386
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:33,343
It was all pointless.

387
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:35,233
Even if I save your lives,

388
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:38,993
you'll only live 10 or 20 more years and leave.

389
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:44,053
I'll care for you for a moment, and you'll be gone in no time.

390
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:47,433
Ever so ungratefully.

391
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:57,633
You should also stop making me care and leave this mountain quickly.

392
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:16,813
Lady Han, just leave it. I can do it alone.

393
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:19,553
It's fine. Let's do it together.

394
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:27,683
By the way, I don't think I've seen Mountain God lately.

395
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:35,733
I already told Deok Gu to look because I was curious, too.

396
00:42:38,313 --> 00:42:43,093
Well, then, I'll be going back down now.

397
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,913
Would it not be dangerous to go to the village again?

398
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:49,133
Who would ever recognize a female servant's face like me?

399
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:52,493
Also, three months have passed already.

400
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:55,623
Okay, take care, then.

401
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,663
It's still not too late.

402
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:11,103
Tell me where Madam Han and that girl went.

403
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:13,703
Are you really going to get taken to the

404
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:16,143
execution grounds and get beheaded?

405
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:19,983
Deok Gu!

406
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,253
Deok Gu, where are you?

407
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,433
Deok Gu!

408
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:30,443
Deok Gu!

409
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,253
Sir.

410
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:41,763
Sir, Sir!

411
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:55,193
Sir!

412
00:43:57,723 --> 00:43:59,543
Sir!

413
00:44:02,993 --> 00:44:05,223
Sir!

414
00:44:05,223 --> 00:44:07,303
Sir!

415
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:11,543
Sir!

416
00:44:11,543 --> 00:44:13,483
Sir...

417
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:23,153
Sir...

418
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:29,343
I have been looking for you for so long.

419
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,453
Mother used to

420
00:44:34,453 --> 00:44:38,393
make flower pancakes with rosebay whenever spring came.

421
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:40,833
Whenever it was summer,

422
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:44,833
we soaked our ankles together by the valley.

423
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,963
When winter came,

424
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:51,663
she put my hands in her armpits and let them thaw.

425
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:56,143
It's not pointless.

426
00:44:57,253 --> 00:45:01,623
The 10 years you helped my mother live

427
00:45:03,463 --> 00:45:07,373
were the most precious gift to me.

428
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:10,323
However, she is gone and no more.

429
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:13,893
Though people wither,

430
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:16,323
memories remain all the time.

431
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:18,833
What use are those memories ever good for?

432
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,793
I'll give them to you as a gift, then.

433
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:26,273
Warm, beautiful,

434
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:29,623
and joyful memories.

435
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:31,233
I do not need them.

436
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,173
Memories are shared between two people,

437
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:35,963
so would it not also be a great gift for me?

438
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:37,863
I said I do not need them!

439
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:40,543
No matter how stubborn you are about it,

440
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:43,073
you will not be able to out-stubborn me.

441
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,233
Come on now!

442
00:45:46,183 --> 00:45:49,973
My stubbornness was certified by the Mountain God, was it not?

443
00:45:59,213 --> 00:46:01,063
So, in summary,

444
00:46:01,063 --> 00:46:03,533
you just want me to play with you.

445
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,973
I'm way too busy.

446
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:08,923
You have a lot of free time.

447
00:46:08,923 --> 00:46:12,253
Is that not why you appeared every time I stood by the cliff?

448
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:14,203
No, that was because...

449
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:18,930
I told you it's because I hate the smell of rotting corpses!

450
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,583
I see, huh?

451
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:54,743
The sun is also...

452
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:58,273
setting on your face.

453
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:06,423
Why did it turn so red?

454
00:47:14,993 --> 00:47:16,673
What kind of pastime is this?

455
00:47:16,673 --> 00:47:18,883
It's doll play.

456
00:47:18,883 --> 00:47:21,533
Gosh, by the way,

457
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:23,633
the floor is too hard.

458
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,483
Excuse me.

459
00:47:37,003 --> 00:47:39,303
Should we also set that afloat?

460
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:42,923
You gave it to me so I can float it when I'm sick.

461
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:45,803
I've changed my mind now.

462
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:49,033
Do not be sick.

463
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,793
Your body and heart both...

464
00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:54,703
Do not let even a hair on your body get hurt.

465
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:59,443
I am going to set that afloat,

466
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,653
so you never have to use it.

467
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:03,823
Sure, let us do that.

468
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:06,223
However, we must do it by the water.

469
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:11,053
If it falls in the woods, the fire can spread and start a wildfire.

470
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:13,453
Wait, why give me such a dangerous thing?

471
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:17,283
T-That's why I gave you the firestone only now.

472
00:48:18,783 --> 00:48:20,593
I see...

473
00:48:23,363 --> 00:48:25,423
All right, then.

474
00:48:25,423 --> 00:48:28,343
Let's set it afloat at the beach.

475
00:48:28,343 --> 00:48:30,053
The beach?

476
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:32,353
Have you ever been to one?

477
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:35,703
I've never.

478
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:41,703
It's a place that's endlessly blue and where waves

479
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:44,863
come and go without an end.

480
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:48,763
Should we go right away tomorrow, then?

481
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,773
Let's do that.

482
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:02,773
What are we going to do now?

483
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:08,473
What about playing house?

484
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,723
How do you do that now?

485
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:13,353
Deok Gu will be our child,

486
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:17,813
I'll be Deok Gu's mother, and you'll be Deok Gu's father.

487
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:21,863
Wait, does that mean

488
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:25,773
I'll be your husband?

489
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:41,473
The sun is setting

490
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:43,963
on your face again.

491
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:52,503
Are you feeling ill somewhere?

492
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:55,943
We're in the middle of playing.

493
00:49:56,523 --> 00:50:00,093
It's because I was excited to see my husband.

494
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:07,243
How can I make the sun set on my face, then?

495
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:17,043
This is for play,

496
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:19,503
so it would not matter, right?

497
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:59,293
Now, the sun has set beautifully

498
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:01,983
on your face as well.

499
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:21,603
Deok Gu!

500
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,053
Deok Gu!

501
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,473
Deok Gu is chasing squirrels.

502
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:32,183
Again?

503
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:38,423
Are you prepared to leave now?

504
00:51:39,573 --> 00:51:44,293
When Mak Soon comes back, I plan to entrust Deok Gu to her and leave.

505
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:47,493
Did she go down to the village again?

506
00:51:47,493 --> 00:51:49,273
Yes.

507
00:51:50,263 --> 00:51:52,893
I'm sure her heart is heavy.

508
00:51:52,893 --> 00:51:56,943
She cannot even sleep well because she's worried about her lover.

509
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:03,483
About Mak Soon...

510
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,873
 Is Mak Soon really a trustworthy kid? 

511
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:11,293
She's Cho Young's best friend whom she grew up with

512
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,893
since they were young.

513
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:17,383
I saw her in the village this time.

514
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:21,743
She seemed to be looking for something.

515
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:23,573
I heard she's looking for her lover.

516
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,283
Even so,

517
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:28,693
you should not trust a pregnant mother so easily.

518
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:31,253
To put it bluntly, if she sells out My Lady

519
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:34,123
along with her lover, the two of them-

520
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:39,703
No, including her kid, the three of them can at least save themselves, right?

521
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:44,993
Never mind.

522
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,733
Oh, that's right.

523
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:58,473
I heard the wind is harsh at the beach.

524
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:30,963
No wonder we could not find them...

525
00:53:30,963 --> 00:53:33,963
since she was hiding in the deep mountains.

526
00:53:33,963 --> 00:53:36,383
Keep it on, nice and warm.

527
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:42,223
It's beautiful.

528
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,793
You're more beautiful, Deok Gu's mother.

529
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:55,083
Where's the sky lantern?

530
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,853
The swordsmen are here.

531
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:20,443
Sir.

532
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:31,783
Cho Young,

533
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:34,703
let's play one more time

534
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:40,173
before we go to the beach.

535
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,943
What are we going to play?

536
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,533
- Get her!
- Chase her!

537
00:56:34,993 --> 00:56:37,073
The wench and her baby are...

538
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:41,023
descendants of a traitor!

539
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:45,743
If you do not turn them in right now, I'll kill you!

540
00:56:48,663 --> 00:56:50,483
Shoot him!

541
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,563
 Sir. 

542
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:27,423
 Sir, 

543
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:31,723
 if I'm hiding for too long... 

544
00:59:32,203 --> 00:59:34,423
 if I don't come out 

545
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:36,803
 even after the play is over, 

546
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:40,423
 please forget about me, then. 

547
00:59:41,513 --> 00:59:43,973
 My Mountain God, 

548
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:46,593
 whose face is as bright as the moon, 

549
00:59:46,593 --> 00:59:49,153
 who speaks meanly, 

550
00:59:49,763 --> 00:59:52,083
 but has kind eyes. 

551
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:57,790
   ​

552
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:05,583
♫  I suddenly thought about  ♫

553
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:09,823
♫  the past times  ♫

554
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:14,803
♫  The sad days that remained  ♫

555
01:01:14,803 --> 01:01:19,333
 

556
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:22,953
 I'm the one who put that curse on you where you turn into a dog. 

557
01:01:22,953 --> 01:01:24,923
 What did you do to Ms. Hae Na? 

558
01:01:24,923 --> 01:01:28,523
 I still couldn't believe it after seeing it with my eyes. It doesn't make sense. 

559
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:30,123
 Why do you think he placed the curse on you? 

560
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:32,833
 That's my question. Why on us? 

561
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,073
 Why on earth are you doing this to me? 

562
01:01:35,073 --> 01:01:37,373
 Why are you doing this to my family? 

563
01:01:37,373 --> 01:01:40,423
 You have to undo Jin Seo Won's heart. 

564
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:44,363
 I'll get rid of every ounce of feelings he has for you. 

565
01:01:44,363 --> 01:01:47,023
 Where's Ms. Hae Na right now?
