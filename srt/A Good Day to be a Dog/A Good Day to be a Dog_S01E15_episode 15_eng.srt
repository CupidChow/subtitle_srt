1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,620
 

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,040
 

3
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,690
 

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,730
 

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,160
 Our family has an unusual secret. 

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,570
 I think someone once said, "There are no bad dogs in the world." 

7
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,380
Unni.

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,910
 
I won't be able to kiss now?

9
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,740
 Only... 

10
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,910
 bad curses exist. 

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
 

12
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:28,815
 Oh, my! 

13
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,835
 The cake is shaped like lips. 

14
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:33,748
We're probably the only couple to have the first kiss on their one-year anniversary.

15
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:35,093
 What? 

16
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:36,963
 Did he say, "Kiss"? 

17
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,428
What the heck?

18
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,951
Oppa, I'm sorry!

19
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,990
 Once again, this is how my relationship ended. 

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,550
 

21
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:55,849
 

22
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,117
Hey, C.C.K.

23
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:02,587
Can you not call me that?

24
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:04,687
So, why did you go around cutting off couples who kiss?

25
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:06,287
You should've just passed them by.

26
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:10,017
It's reprehensible. They're at school doing something I haven't even done yet.

27
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:15,287
- Reprehensible, or are you just envious?
- Huh?

28
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:19,107
You said so before. "Yes to dating. No to kissing."

29
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:22,397
But you got dumped right away when you tell the guys about "no kissing."

30
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:27,057
I can truly do anything for them except kiss them.

31
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:28,287
That's weirder.

32
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:33,007
If kissing isn't allowed, everything shouldn't be allowed. Why is only kissing off-limits?

33
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:35,697
Don't tell me you've really never done it before.

34
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,825
Gosh, I don't know- Oh, my.

35
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,671
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

36
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,721
Are your hands okay-

37
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,851
That jerk.

38
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,351
Why do you hate Mr. Jin so much?

39
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:52,321
He's a bit blunt, but he's handsome.

40
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,061
And he's popular with the students.

41
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:57,621
It's not that I don't like him. He doesn't like me.

42
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:58,720
Why?

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,910
Hey, give it back!

44
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,461
Daebak!

45
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,231
- Whoa.
- Wow.

46
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,951
Hello, ladies.

47
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,961
Hello, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

48
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:30,321
Oh, we're all going to get together later

49
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,181
and have a drink. You'll be there, right?

50
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:33,521
Of course, we'll be there.

51
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,251
- Okay.
- You said you have plans-

52
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:37,881
Of course, we'll be there. It's not often that we meet.

53
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,741
That's good to hear.

54
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:44,611
We're going to eat meat, so have a light lunch. Okay?

55
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:51,021
Gosh, he's so sweet.

56
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:54,791
I come to work for Mr. Bo Gyeom.

57
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,061
Mr. Bo Gyeom, you don't have a girlfriend, do you?

58
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:05,591
Do you think I do or not?

59
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,411
If I had a girlfriend, I'd be on a date right now.

60
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:12,521
I'm the type to go all-in on my girlfriend.

61
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,321
Then what's your ideal type?

62
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,081
I don't really have an ideal type.

63
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:23,071
But still. You must be attracted to something.

64
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:25,111
I just...

65
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,631
like someone who likes me.

66
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:30,121
I hate that pre-dating flirting phase.

67
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:34,191
I appreciate it when they tell me first, "I like you."

68
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,571
"Do you want to date me?"

69
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,581
- I'm going to get this call.
- Sure.

70
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:48,221
Hey, Seo Won! It's cold outside. Wear this.

71
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,971
He hates complicated things.

72
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,721
Just simply go!

73
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:58,051
Go?

74
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,025
Ms. Han!

75
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:10,115
Yes, it's me.

76
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,145
Are you okay? You seem really drunk.

77
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:18,225
No, no. I'm not drunk at all.

78
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,285
I came to tell you something.

79
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:26,065
You said so before. That you...

80
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,595
appreciate simple things.

81
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:36,475
Which is why you like women who like you. And that...

82
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:42,705
you'd like...for them to be honest with you.

83
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:49,165
So what I want to tell you is...

84
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:58,205
I like you, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

85
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:09,875
 That's right. 

86
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,795
 If it's Mr. Bo Gyeom, he'll accept a woman like me, too. 

87
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,895
Ms. Hae Na.

88
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:03,115
 Whoa! Mr. Bo Gyeom can even talk while he kisses. 

89
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,805
Whoa!

90
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,715
Are you okay?

91
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,510
Whoa!

92
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,720
Oh, I'm sorry!

93
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,437
Ms. Han. Ms. Han! Ms. Hae Na!

94
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:29,027
 I only have one minute left. 

95
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:31,507
 If I kiss a man, 

96
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,367
 I turn into a dog. 

97
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,917
 Because of that damned curse. 

98
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,279
 When we come across a dog without its owner, 

99
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,157
 we go through a confirmation process. 

100
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,159
Zero...

101
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,679
Zero...

102
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,486
Seven...

103
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,824
Who's this?

104
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,974
This is Hae Na's shoe.

105
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,594
You're Han Hae Na?

106
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,256
Han Hae Na, what will you do?

107
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:41,866
- What will you do?
- What's going on?

108
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:45,986
What the hell? What happened?

109
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,066
What is she saying?

110
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:50,706
She has to talk, so I understand! She's barking right now.

111
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,536
 What do I do now? What do I do? 

112
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:56,297
All right, so be quiet!

113
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:08,926
She'll be naked when she wakes up tomorrow.

114
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,036
When will she turn back into a human?

115
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,136
Six in the morning.

116
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,456
And she'll turn into a dog again at midnight.

117
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,836
For how long?

118
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:20,776
For 100 days.

119
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:25,046
If she can't undo the curse by then, she'll live the rest of her life as a dog.

120
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,097
 Are you okay? 

121
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,522
What is it?

122
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:50,392
What? What, what?

123
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,712
Resignation?

124
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:53,892
Are you crazy?

125
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:58,782
I can't go to school. I'd rather die than go to school.

126
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,490
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,240
Even when I think about it in your shoes, I really...

128
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,750
Anyhow, thank you so much for keeping it a secret.

129
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,680
Honestly, I didn't know you were this generous.

130
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,120
Are you sure you're sorry?

131
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm sorry. It was really a mistake.

132
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,700
I know.

133
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,990
You mistook me for Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom.

134
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,900
Oh! How did you know?

135
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,300
It was impossible not to know in that situation.

136
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,960
So why were you wearing Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom's jacket?

137
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,920
Was that a question?

138
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,310
Nonetheless, it's okay.

140
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,360
It's not like you committed a grave sin.

141
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,768
Let's just say it never happened.

142
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:48,148
Thank you, thank you.

143
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,298
Let's forget about it.

144
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,760
Excuse me, Mr. Jin!

145
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Do you happen to like dogs?

146
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,040
 The solution to undo this damned curse. 

147
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,590
Woo Taek,

148
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,238
it's all right.

149
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,680
 It's kissing the other person again as a dog. 

150
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,930
Yoo Na!

151
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,900
 I must kiss this man again today but as a dog this time. 

152
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,810
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

153
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,160
I mean, it's because I like dogs, so I was wondering if you also like dogs.

154
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,790
But why are you getting annoyed with me?

155
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,290
When did I?

156
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,520
Right now.

157
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,020
Not at all.

158
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,880
M-Mr. Jin!

159
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:06,640
I'll buy you a meal as an apology.

160
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,769
Sorry?

161
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,271
Please let me buy.

162
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,720
- It's okay.
- Gosh,

163
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,950
I'd feel really uncomfortable if I didn't.

164
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,310
There's no need to feel uncomfortable.

165
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,220
No, it's...

166
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:22,356
My sense of guilt and my conscience...

167
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,490
They hurt too much.

168
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,940
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,620
The kids just don't listen, do they?

170
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,030
When you're stressed, pig feet and soju are the best.

171
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,450
Gosh, you're picking at your food so much.

172
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,070
When you don't have an appetite, have chicken feet with soju.

173
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,350
Dang it!

174
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,570
Why are you in a bad mood this time?

175
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,380
 
 This evening works for me. 

176
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,240
My goodness.

177
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,428
By the way...

178
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,928
why do you hate me, Mr. Jin?

179
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,448
Why would I hate you, Ms. Han?

180
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,678
Exactly! Why do you hate me?

181
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,118
What did I ever do to you?

182
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:09,468
But I never hated you.

183
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,778
Whoa! You make me laugh.

184
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:16,288
I've got an upset note in my heart, okay? I remember everything.

185
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,648
 During fifth period's free period on April 20th, last year, 

186
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,898
 when the teachers chipped in to buy snacks. 

187
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:24,308
Whoa, gosh.

188
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,948
We didn't buy soondae.

189
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:32,668
Whoa, you disappeared in a split second.

190
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,578
Did you use an invisible cape or something?

191
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,988
- Do you remember or not?
- I remember.

192
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:40,558
And also, on Ms. Song's birthday last year,

193
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:43,018
 when we went to buy the cake together. 

194
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,328
They say the mango flavor tastes good,

195
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:48,778
but Ms. Song likes matcha flavor.

196
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,388
But that one looks tasty, too.

197
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,738
What should we do?

198
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:01,978
Do you remember or not?

199
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:07,178
I remember.

200
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,708
See?

201
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,968
I mean, why on Earth do you hate me?

202
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,378
Why do you find me uncomfortable?

203
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:18,148
When I'm with you, it's really-

204
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,128
I have my reasons.

205
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:26,138
So, tell me about those reasons.

206
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,628
Anyhow, it's true I avoided you because I was a bit uncomfortable,

207
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,338
but it wasn't because I hate you.

208
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:44,527
I'm sorry if I made you misunderstand.

209
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,071
Wait, what's that supposed to...

210
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,559
 Five minutes left. Hurry up and come out! 

211
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,369
Whoa! M-Mr. Jin, please excuse me for one moment. Sorry.

212
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,029
Where are you-

213
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,699
Yes, Mr. Jin! I'm at the alley right outside.

214
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,639
 Can you come outside for a minute? 

215
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,509
 There's a really cute... 

216
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,739
Boss, one bottle of soju, please.

217
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:20,079
What?

218
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,342
 
What the heck?

219
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,103
Ms. Han?

220
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,088
 I'm cute, right? You know I'm cute. 

221
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:52,515
 Great. Now, to put things to an end. 

222
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,061
 Huh? 

223
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,479
Don't come.

224
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,724
 What's wrong with him? 

225
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:05,664
 Did he see a ghost? 

226
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,189
 There's nothing there. 

227
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,833
 Don't tell me. He's not afraid of ghosts, 

228
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,413
 but afraid of dogs? 

229
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:10,073
 No way, right? 

230
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:12,553
 It can't be. No way. 

231
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,597
 He is. 

232
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,245
 It really was me! 

233
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:19,270
 Gosh! 

234
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,810
 I'm totally doomed! 

235
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,880
What are you doing over there?

236
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,154
Hyung.

237
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:28,704
 - Mr. Bo Gyeom? 
- Are you drunk?

238
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:30,784
What are you doing up there?

239
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:32,034
There's a rat.

240
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,014
 A rat? A rat? 

241
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,424
A rat?

242
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,148
My gosh.

243
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,294
All right, let's see.

244
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,304
Where did you come from?

245
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,124
Gosh, you're so cute.

246
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:48,354
Where's your owner?

247
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:50,934
 You're my owner. 

248
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:55,204
Is it the owner's dog?

249
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:58,474
 No, you can have me. 

250
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,014
Jjong!

251
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:07,274
Gosh, where were you?

252
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,884
Gosh, where did you lose your collar?

253
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:14,034
Well, I'm not sure, but it looks like things are resolved.

254
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,374
Right, Jjong?

255
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:17,524
Let's go.

256
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,166
 Did she see that? 

257
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,687
Did you take care of the urgent situation last night?

258
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:02,987
Yes, my sister suddenly called me.

259
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,817
I'm so sorry.

260
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,977
Did anything else happen by chance?

261
00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:09,237
L-Like what?

262
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:14,463
Never mind.

263
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,758
If so, since you decided to help me,

264
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,932
how about we meet regularly so I can get tips from you?

265
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,732
- Regularly?
- Yes.

266
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,842
Is that too much?

267
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,592
Yes, it is.

268
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:32,262
Just think of it as a charity and doing good deeds.

269
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,282
Please help me out.

270
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,742
I'll just help you once, then.

271
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,462
Really?

272
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:50,522
I'm going somewhere with Hyung tonight.

273
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:51,912
Do you want to go instead of me?

274
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:54,052
Aren't you coming with us?

275
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,782
- Of course not.
- Why not?

276
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:57,662
Why do I have to go?

277
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:00,622
If it's just the two of us, it'd feel too much like a date.

278
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:03,152
I thought you wanted to go on a date. No?

279
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:06,152
Well, yes, but...

280
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:12,312
What if I die of a heart attack while hanging out alone with him?

281
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:19,352
I didn't know you liked him that much.

282
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:23,392
Well, I'm just wondering, what if?

283
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,712
Okay.

284
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,522
I'll come with you, but

285
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:39,772
feel free to do whatever afterward.

286
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:43,742
Thank you.

287
00:21:55,902 --> 00:21:59,342
Over here. I think there's something here.

288
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:03,392
But it's too high up.

289
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,086
Oh? There's something.

290
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,056
Let this go!

291
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,043
Hold on, hold on.

292
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:22,078
Are you okay?

293
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,935
We found it. We found it.

294
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:28,262
I think I could stretch it to midnight.

295
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:32,397
I'm breaking the curse today. Just wait and see-

296
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:33,927
Ms. Han.

297
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:37,641
I'm so sorry about earlier.

298
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:39,521
I was so scared.

299
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:40,791
It's okay.

300
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,581
Should I buy you fried chicken and beer to make it up to you?

301
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:44,831
Deal?

302
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:47,791
The three of you should go. I'll get going.

303
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,781
Huh? Why?

304
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:52,431
I'm a bit tired.

305
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:55,551
Just sit with us for a bit and leave, then. Okay?

306
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,131
No, I'll get going now.

307
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:58,916
No.

308
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,505
Just one beer, please?

309
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,485
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

310
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:05,765
How many times did I say no just now?

311
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,235
I just wanted to get close to you-

312
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,755
Why all of a sudden?

313
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:13,745
Because of Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom?

314
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:18,385
Yes, you said you'd set us up.

315
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,825
That's why I came all the way here.

316
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:28,695
Yes, you must've done a lot for us from your perspective.

317
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,865
I happened to hear it before.

318
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:34,985
That you feel uncomfortable with me.

319
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:37,595
You said there's a reason why.

320
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:41,035
Why do you feel uncomfortable with me, anyway?

321
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,775
I didn't mean it like that-

322
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:47,395
What are you, a nutcracker?

323
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,195
And am I a walnut?

324
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:53,515
You keep crushing me over and over and over again.

325
00:23:56,235 --> 00:24:01,385
I need to know why so I can do something about it.

326
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:09,655
Never mind. I'll get going.

327
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,120
 The math teacher is so harsh. 

328
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,380
Did you say he's afraid of dogs?

329
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,900
I don't know if it's because of the curse, but since you were kids,

330
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,006
the dogs in the neighborhood used to follow you.

331
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:28,092
But I'm sure all dogs in the area flock around her.

332
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,054
You guys aren't allowed to approach me anymore.

333
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:44,727
Guys.

334
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:49,667
What kind of students smoke in front of a school?

335
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:56,427
Just keep going where you were going, Ahjumma.

336
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:59,347
I'm a teacher at Garam High School.

337
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:01,517
What? You're not even a teacher at our school.

338
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:03,317
You guys go to Gyeonghoon High, right?

339
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:06,017
What year and class are you in? Put out your cigarettes right now.

340
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:10,302
I'll just smoke this one and put it out, Ma'am.

341
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,587
What are your names?

342
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:15,082
Why don't you wear your name tags?

343
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:18,727
Ma'am, you just touched my chest, didn't you?

344
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,582
Gosh, isn't this sexual harassment?

345
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:23,927
Is it okay for a female teacher to touch male students' chests like that?

346
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:26,632
Should we report her?

347
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:28,607
Daebak.

348
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:32,852
No, let's just touch her and call it even.

349
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:36,872
Excuse me for a second, Ma'am.

350
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,970
She asked what your names are just now.

351
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,530
You'd better let go of this.

352
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:17,727
What's your name?

353
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,687
Sir.

354
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:26,507
They're Seo Chang Soo, Min Gyeong Seok, and Do Jae Min.

355
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,267
Move. Move!

356
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,147
Are you okay, Ms. Han?

357
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,727
Huh? Yes.

358
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,947
Kids these days aren't afraid of teachers.

359
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,297
Yes. Thank you.

360
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:00,587
See you later at school.

361
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:02,077
Okay.

362
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:22,683
Mr. Jin.

363
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:29,303
What are you doing here at this time of day?

364
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:31,713
I don't have a class now, either.

365
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,613
Are you feeling better now?

366
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,383
I was a bit in shock this morning,

367
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,473
but I'm okay now.

368
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:43,693
It's so pathetic.

369
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:46,383
What kind of teacher is afraid of a student?

370
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:48,283
No.

371
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,643
It was enough to be afraid of.

372
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,943
Right. Sorry about last night.

373
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:13,028
I'm sorry I suddenly lost my temper.

374
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,593
I'm sorry, too.

375
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:19,913
Thinking about it, I could see why you were mistaken.

376
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,111
Because of the situations that occur whenever I'm with you...

377
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:31,587
I gave you the impression that I'm avoiding you.

378
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:33,897
But...

379
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:38,347
To be honest, I...

380
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,067
Show him what you got.

381
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:57,097
Block properly. You'll break your bones otherwise.

382
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:13,707
Mr. Jin.

383
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:18,257
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,897
I don't know what it is,

385
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:23,767
but you don't have to tell me if it's too difficult.

386
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:26,607
You're trying so hard to explain.

387
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:30,377
So I don't think it's because you dislike me. And...

388
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:35,257
everyone is in unique situations

389
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:39,897
and it's natural to have at least one secret of their own.

390
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,297
I'll get going now, then.

391
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:55,287
Ms. Han.

392
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:59,937
Thank you for understanding.

393
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,707
Sure.

394
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,139
I'm getting expelled if I get caught smoking again.

395
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,479
Just get expelled, you idiot.

396
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,269
Geez.

397
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,039
Do some research on that bastard.

398
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,849
I want to beat him up with the kids sometime.

399
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:15,923
Should we mess up a kid from Garam High?

400
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:18,944
- Hello.
- Welcome.

401
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,489
Huh?

402
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:31,409
What?

403
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,239
Hey, buddy.

404
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,199
You want to come over here?

405
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:40,209
Please call the police.

406
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:57,909
Yes. Hello?

407
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,499
 Is this Ms. Han Hae Na of Garam High School? 

408
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:04,079
Yes, this is she.

409
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,419
 This is Hyeonseo Police Station. 

410
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,039
Yes, I see.

411
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,289
 You're Choi Yul's homeroom teacher, correct? 

412
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:17,639
Police Station?

413
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:22,675
I caught your son smoking this morning.

414
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:26,465
I think that's why he took revenge on my student.

415
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,525
If you find it so unfair,

416
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:31,685
should we settle through the school violence committee?

417
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:33,605
School violence committee, my foot.

418
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:36,485
Is there any evidence? Is there?

419
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:44,185
Excuse me for a second.

420
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:52,625
He still has what he smoked this morning.

421
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:55,545
Kids can do stuff like that.

422
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,345
They should not.

423
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:01,325
And it's the teachers' and...

424
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:03,405
parents' job to teach them that.

425
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,140
How do you get home from here? I'll drop you off.

426
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,350
The buses must've stopped running.

427
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,450
Gosh, when did it get so late?

428
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,970
I'm so sorry, but you can go on your own, right?

429
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,020
I forgot I have something to do at home.

430
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,680
I'll get going now. Bye.

431
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,350
Ms. Han.

432
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,900
D-D-Don't come.

433
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,370
Don't come.

434
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,020
Bye.

435
00:32:44,982 --> 00:32:46,832
Why are you still here?

436
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:47,982
Ms. Han, I got your phone.

437
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,252
W-What time is it?

438
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:52,912
It's 12.

439
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,342
Dog... Ms. Han...

440
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,621
What a well-behaved dog.

441
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,163
Yes.

442
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,769
It knows how to open the window.

443
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,710
Ma'am, do you live alone?

444
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,620
Your family must be worried.

445
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,760
Should I call them for you?

446
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,139
It's locked.

447
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,060
I-It unlocked.

448
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:25,463
M-Ms. Han.

449
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,043
I-It's really you.

450
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:33,699
Ms. Han.

451
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,939
How did you turn into a dog?

452
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:42,373
What if you could never go back to normal?

453
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:46,225
Say something.

454
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,659
 I'll wait until it's six in the morning 

455
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:03,379
 and leave when I turn into a human. 

456
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:09,229
 Never, ever fall asleep. 

457
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:12,549
 Never fall asleep... 

458
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,249
 Who's that? 

459
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:08,569
Ms. Han?

460
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:11,969
Is this a dream?

461
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:15,597
Earlier...

462
00:37:15,597 --> 00:37:19,227
The scene I witnessed with my own two eyes...

463
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:21,857
Was it an accident?

464
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,537
A mistake?

465
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:26,697
Uncle, what do you take me for?

466
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:28,827
A really absurd situation took place yesterday.

467
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:33,787
Well, I went to get Yul at the police station in the middle of the night last night.

468
00:37:33,787 --> 00:37:34,847
Police station?

469
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:37,027
Ms. Han, how could you expose me like that?

470
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:38,377
Why were you at the police station?

471
00:37:38,377 --> 00:37:39,977
Did you cause trouble?

472
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:44,389
The students from Gyeonghoon High School must've started a fight with Yul yesterday.

473
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:48,560
But why did you contact Ms. Han instead of me?

474
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,140
Who knows what they'd do to you if they find out I'm your nephew and dox you?

475
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,590
Why would you worry about that? I'm your guardian.

476
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,270
You should've called me!

477
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,920
Don't be too hard on him. I'm his homeroom teacher, so-

478
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,280
Please let us finish our conversation.

479
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,990
But why did you come all the way to our house?

480
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, you see... I-

481
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,610
Ms. Han was in the middle of drinking when she rushed over to help me.

482
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,130
- So...
- That's right.

483
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,890
So once we left the police station, we got into a taxi to drop Yul off.

484
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,820
But once I got in the taxi, all the tension left my body, and I felt tipsy.

485
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,880
So I passed out in the taxi.

486
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,840
I had no idea where Ms. Han lived.

487
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,310
Nor could I communicate with a dog.

488
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,140
Dog?

489
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,580
Ms. Han...

490
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,170
was drunk like a dog.

491
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,620
That's right. I was drunk like a dog last night.

492
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,080
Why did you drink so much?

493
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,250
Did you drink because you were upset about the Gyeonghoon High kids?

494
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,883
That's right.

495
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:04,428
I drank because I was really upset.

496
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:07,373
Yul is nice! He won't spread rumors.

497
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:08,698
How can you trust him?

498
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:10,743
He can be trusted.

499
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:12,793
Drop me off here.

500
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,931
Take this with you.

501
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,484
- What is it?
- Give it to the math teacher.

502
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:24,889
You said he's afraid of dogs.

503
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:29,689
Who knows? He might develop the slightest immunity while carrying that around.

504
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,020
Oh! Also, keep this in mind.

505
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,620
The math teacher might freak out when he sees dogs racing at the sight of you.

506
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,720
Good luck!

507
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,370
As if he would carry this around.

508
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,260
What is that?

509
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,790
Mr. Lee!

510
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,630
Gosh, this is so cute!

511
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,790
Oh, it kind of resembles you, Ms. Hae Na.

512
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,560
Really?

513
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,590
True. You do have a puppy look.

514
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:23,640
I like dogs because they're loyal.

515
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,090
Once a dog meets its owner, it'll follow them for life.

516
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,110
Are you like that, too?

517
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,700
When you like someone, do you like them until the end?

518
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,300
Of course.

519
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,241
What in the world...

520
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,172
She's popular with the dogs, for sure.

521
00:40:47,172 --> 00:40:49,087
The dogs really love her.

522
00:40:49,087 --> 00:40:50,701
What's with the puppy?

523
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,620
Oh, that's Man Deuk.

524
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,855
He's going to stay here for the day, okay?

525
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,995
My daughter kept begging me.

526
00:41:09,923 --> 00:41:11,858
Sorry! Should I get you a napkin?

527
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:14,128
Geez, it's fine!

528
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:26,651
Vice Principal, I'm actually allergic to dog hair.

529
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,819
All of a sudden?

530
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,294
It started this spring.

531
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:31,679
Gosh, what a shame.

532
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,814
You should take allergy meds, then.

533
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:37,339
Well...

534
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,744
he seems a bit wary, too. Should we put him in his cage for now?

535
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:44,764
No, no! Our Man Deuk hates being caged.

536
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:48,626
- Mr. Jin.
- Yes?

537
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:51,466
Why are you standing there blocking the doorway?

538
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:54,921
I left my cell phone in my car.

539
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:57,106
Oh, you bring your car?

540
00:41:57,106 --> 00:41:59,451
That's great! If you're going to the parking lot,

541
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,746
stop by my car and bring me Man Deuk's belongings.

542
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:07,391
There should be a bag of dog food and bowls.

543
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,595
- All right.
- Thank you.

544
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:10,065
Sure.

545
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,270
Mr. Jin, I'm sorry!

546
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,030
I'm late for class.

547
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,567
Mr. Seo Won! Why are you...

548
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:56,227
Is it because of the dog?

549
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,757
Hey, no way.

550
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:02,267
Man Deuk!

551
00:45:05,657 --> 00:45:10,077
The sprinkler above your seat must be broken, too. It's leaking, isn't it?

552
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:13,187
Yes, it's...

553
00:45:15,177 --> 00:45:17,377
Mr. Seo Won, are you okay?

554
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:19,947
I'm okay.

555
00:45:20,757 --> 00:45:22,527
That's what I thought.

556
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:25,467
As if a grown man would act like that because he's afraid of a dog.

557
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:28,097
A grown man can't be afraid of dogs?

558
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:29,417
Sorry?

559
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:30,707
Sorry?

560
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:33,247
Oh, right, Ms. Hae Na.

561
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:36,407
Didn't you say you were allergic to dog hair earlier?

562
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:40,917
Whoa, I must be cured. Whoa!

563
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:44,297
Does it just disappear like that?

564
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:23,527
These are our new teachers starting this semester.

565
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:26,937
Hello, everyone!

566
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:30,907
Hello, I'm the English teacher, Cheon Song Yi.

567
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:38,727
Hello, I'm Han Hae Na.

568
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:53,517
♫  Who in the world are you looking at?  ♫

569
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:58,257
♫  When I'm standing right here in front of you?  ♫

570
00:46:58,257 --> 00:47:02,377
♫  Don't make me wait too long  ♫

571
00:47:02,377 --> 00:47:06,907
♫  Don't think I'll always be smiling  ♫

572
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:11,267
♫  I don't expect many things  ♫

573
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:15,797
♫  I just need your loving gaze  ♫

574
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:20,227
♫  Even if I try to convey my feelings  ♫

575
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:29,597
♫  Your eyes are telling me something else  ♫
Come on!

576
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:34,007
♫  I thought we knew each other well  ♫

577
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:38,337
♫  That's why I thought this was love  ♫

578
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:42,737
♫  Please stay somewhere not too far away  ♫

579
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:51,637
♫  You'll tell me one day that you love me  ♫

580
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:56,443
Thank you for today.

581
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:58,113
Sorry?

582
00:47:58,113 --> 00:48:01,483
I know you helped me multiple times today.

583
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:02,903
Was it obvious?

584
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:05,453
I thought I was very thorough.

585
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:06,973
You were thorough.

586
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:09,684
Since no one else noticed.

587
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:13,353
My fear of dogs.

588
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:19,503
I thought that was the unique situation you couldn't talk about last time,

589
00:48:19,503 --> 00:48:23,123
so I tried to help you without being obvious.

590
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:25,473
I was helpful, right?

591
00:48:25,473 --> 00:48:27,613
Of course.

592
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,133
But...

593
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,943
I'm a bit weird, aren't I?

594
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:33,923
No, you're not!

595
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:36,743
If we're talking weird, I'm a lot more weird-

596
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:43,733
By the way, Mr. Jin,

597
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:49,363
can I ask why your situation is difficult to talk about?

598
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:52,783
Well,

599
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:58,603
it's embarrassing for a grown adult to fear dogs.

600
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:02,734
Gosh, I've done a lot more embarrassing things.

601
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:05,799
Even though I did all those embarrassing things,

602
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:11,039
you didn't avoid me or think weirdly of me.

603
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:15,496
Neither of us are weird people.

604
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:19,446
We're just those types of people.

605
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:06,173
♫  The way I looked lonely and the days I had to cherish alone  ♫

606
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,509
- What is this?
- What?

607
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:11,329
Whoa! It's a dog, huh?

608
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:14,636
What do you think?

609
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,927
I just thought you might develop the slightest

610
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:24,882
immunity toward dogs if you keep this on you all the time.

611
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:27,259
Like a vaccine, for example.

612
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:31,489
If it's a vaccine, has it passed clinical trials?

613
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:36,416
You're my first experiment.

614
00:50:38,976 --> 00:50:41,246
Forget it if you don't like it.

615
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,482
Take this.

616
00:50:45,482 --> 00:50:47,372
I owe you one today and

617
00:50:47,372 --> 00:50:49,642
you gave me this immunity dog, too.

618
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:53,352
I should give you this, at least, to sleep comfortably.

619
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,842
Of course, you should.

620
00:50:55,842 --> 00:51:01,012
You need to sleep well to improve your skin and maintain your popularity.

621
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:05,332
Why on Earth do you live in a place like this?

622
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:07,355
Don't you have a home?

623
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,615
I do have a home.

624
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:12,991
Then why don't you go home and live out here?

625
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:17,056
I don't know what I was in my previous life,

626
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:19,952
but I just like living in nature like this.

627
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,947
I'll go home once my business is done here.

628
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:23,577
What business?

629
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,442
Whoa, that's a pretty wedding invitation.

630
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:06,727
A wedding invitation?

631
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:09,022
Yes, it's for Ms. Seo and Mr. Bong.

632
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:13,472
Should we get them a gift just from us, then?

633
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,949
Could you two go and buy it?

634
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:19,099
Yes, sure. Shall we?

635
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,475
Ms. Han, are you free this evening?

636
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:24,746
Yes, I'm free.

637
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,986
In that case, let me know how much after you pick one.

638
00:53:27,986 --> 00:53:29,446
Okay.

639
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,751
Where should we go?

640
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:36,336
Hyung, aren't you behind in grading the performance assessment?

641
00:53:36,336 --> 00:53:38,671
The NEIS* entries are due in two days.
(National Education Information System)

642
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:41,736
The research department will give you an earful if you're late.

643
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:43,581
Gosh, that's right!

644
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:47,326
♫  Please don't pretend not to know  ♫

645
00:53:47,326 --> 00:53:50,939
♫  I know how you feel  ♫

646
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:55,804
♫  Even if you act like you're nonchalant  ♫

647
00:53:55,804 --> 00:53:57,889
♫  You make it obvious  ♫

648
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:02,034
♫  Don't act like you don't know, it's love  ♫

649
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,620
♫  Don't walk on eggshells, tell me everything  ♫

650
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,370
I think matching pajamas would be nice, too.

651
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:12,877
This is cute, isn't it?

652
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:15,517
- It's pretty.
- What about this one?

653
00:54:15,517 --> 00:54:17,647
Will you be able to handle it?

654
00:54:17,647 --> 00:54:21,227
Which one gets you more excited?

655
00:54:21,227 --> 00:54:22,907
What about these?

656
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:25,487
Those are a bit uncomfortable.

657
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:26,767
Then, let's buy this one.

658
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:27,987
I won't wear it, so why?

659
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:30,437
You don't buy these to wear in the first place.

660
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,677
Then?

661
00:54:31,677 --> 00:54:33,657
You know what I mean.

662
00:54:33,657 --> 00:54:36,017
Be quiet. There are people around us.

663
00:54:36,017 --> 00:54:37,927
So what?

664
00:54:39,077 --> 00:54:41,937
- S-Should we go?
- Yes.

665
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:45,617
You two are such a good-looking couple.

666
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:49,057
I think these pajamas would look great. What do you think?

667
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:56,957
 - Thank you. 
- Thank you, please take care.

668
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,627
Whoa!

669
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:08,587
We should have bought a lamp.

670
00:55:19,637 --> 00:55:22,017
Should we go now?

671
00:55:22,017 --> 00:55:24,407
I need to stop by the pharmacy.

672
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:25,577
Are you feeling sick?

673
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:28,477
No, I want to buy motion sickness medicine for the trip to the wedding.

674
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:32,377
I get terrible motion sickness when I ride express buses.

675
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:34,907
Are you fine in other vehicles?

676
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:38,167
Yes. It gets bad only on express buses.

677
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:41,827
Do you want to ride in my car, then?

678
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:45,067
Really? Can I?

679
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:49,467
If we leave around nine o'clock at the park, we'll arrive right on time.

680
00:55:50,837 --> 00:55:52,147
Okay.

681
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,427
As if I would let you.

682
00:56:09,897 --> 00:56:11,047
Ms. Hae Na?

683
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:12,317
Ms. Che Ah!

684
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:14,417
What are you two doing here?

685
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:17,567
We came to buy a wedding gift for Mr. Bong and Ms. Seo.

686
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:20,327
Oh, just the two of you?

687
00:56:20,327 --> 00:56:21,987
What about you?

688
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:25,067
I came for a change of pace.

689
00:56:25,857 --> 00:56:28,267
Looks like you were in a terrible mood.

690
00:56:29,797 --> 00:56:35,347
Right. Should we go to the wedding in one car this weekend?

691
00:56:35,347 --> 00:56:36,497
Pardon?

692
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:39,787
Mr. Bo Gyeom wanted to gather people because he doesn't like the bus.

693
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:42,897
Oh, i-is that so?

694
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:46,657
Let's all go together. It's also better to take turns driving.

695
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,287
Please leave me out for the count.

696
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,567
Why?

697
00:56:57,567 --> 00:57:00,387
I'd just like to refuse that car.

698
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:03,817
Why don't you just go together? It's more convenient.

699
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:05,437
I'm fine.

700
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:09,697
What about you? You'll come with us, right?

701
00:57:09,697 --> 00:57:11,557
Well, I'm...

702
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:12,817
Come with us!

703
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:16,167
If you don't, it's just Mr. Bo Gyeom and me. How can I go alone with him?

704
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:19,527
It's awkward. You'll come with me, right?

705
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:21,507
Sure, I'll do that, then.

706
00:57:21,507 --> 00:57:24,737
Okay. I'll be going now, then.

707
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:30,417
 I don't want to. 

708
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:32,977
Mr. Lee, that's not it.

709
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:38,157
You also don't want to ride the crowded rental bus, do you?

710
00:57:38,157 --> 00:57:42,007
 Gosh, it's still better than having to drive for hours. 

711
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:44,467
I have a license. Let's take turns driving.

712
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:47,687
Come on, entrust my life to you?

713
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:49,517
Lend me your car, at least, then.

714
00:57:49,517 --> 00:57:52,867
Ms. Hae Na already agreed to ride in your car, too.

715
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:55,697
Listen to this. I can tell something's up. Isn't there?

716
00:57:55,697 --> 00:57:57,907
Just tell me everything already.

717
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:01,597
Who knows? I just might be convinced.

718
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:07,237
 I mean, it looked like Ms. Hae Na was about to go with Mr. Seo Won alone. 

719
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,657
I knew it.

720
00:58:08,657 --> 00:58:10,607
There was something.

721
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:14,357
So you split them up, using me as an excuse?

722
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,277
I just didn't want weird rumors going around.

723
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:20,597
I did see something last time, so I got worried.

724
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:23,667
What did you see last time?

725
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,727
It's really a secret, okay?

726
00:58:25,727 --> 00:58:28,177
I was jogging the other day and...

727
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:41,347
Okay, I got it. Let's do that.

728
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,877
 
 This is a group chat for Mr. Bo Gyeom's car. 

729
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:59,117
 Please text when you're near the meeting location. 

730
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:09,214
Ms. Han, are you going to ride in Bo Gyeom's car?

731
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:11,834
Well, she said we're all going together...

732
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:14,954
Well, please don't misunderstand when I say this.

733
00:59:14,954 --> 00:59:19,554
The thing is, Hyung is a heavy sleeper in the morning, so he runs late very often.

734
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:21,834
I mean, 30 minutes is a given. I've waited even up to an hour.

735
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:25,144
You shouldn't miss the wedding after going all the way there, right?

736
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,794
- That's true.
- But if you still want to go with Hyung,

737
00:59:28,794 --> 00:59:31,644
I won't try to stop you anymore.

738
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:36,274
N-No, I'll not ride that car. I'll go with you, Mr. Jin.

739
00:59:36,274 --> 00:59:40,154
I don't want to be late for the wedding, either.

740
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:46,503
- We'll never, ever end up arriving late.
- Yes.

741
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:48,046
Shall we go?

742
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:50,136
- Yes.
- Yes.

743
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:55,006
 When you're going on a date soon after getting your license, 

744
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:59,026
 your date won't progress at all if it's obvious you're a new driver. 

745
00:59:59,026 --> 01:00:00,326
 So what do you do? 

746
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:03,506
 Firstly, this is the most important thing. Roll down your window. 

747
01:00:03,506 --> 01:00:07,441
 All right. After rolling down your window, rest your arm just like this. 

748
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,791
 It's cool, isn't it? Now, what will your date think? 

749
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:14,031
 She'll think, "Gosh, I want this guy." All right? 

750
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:17,451
 For now, that's the first step down. And then... 

751
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:22,873
♫  I space out all day thinking about you  ♫

752
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:27,978
♫  I'm like this every chance I get, it makes me laugh  ♫

753
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:32,813
♫  My head is full of sweet words  ♫

754
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:38,222
♫  Everything, I like everything about you  ♫

755
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:43,987
♫  My heart felt like it was covered by something for a while  ♫

756
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:48,992
♫  Bet you there was no trace of anyone coming into my heart  ♫

757
01:00:48,992 --> 01:00:54,587
♫  But what I see in you and want from you is that  ♫

758
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:59,535
♫  I want to fill my day with your blinding smile  ♫

759
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:04,835
♫  Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, only you, I'm falling in love  ♫

760
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,267
Happy now?

761
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:09,007
What do you mean?

762
01:01:10,427 --> 01:01:12,097
There she comes. Ms. Cheon!

763
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:14,307
Hello.

764
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:17,037
Wait, how did you come, Ms. Song Yi?

765
01:01:17,037 --> 01:01:19,247
I agreed to go in Ms. Hae Na's place.

766
01:01:19,247 --> 01:01:22,517
- What did you say?
- I can ride in the front, right?

767
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:26,551
You're not getting in, right?

768
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:27,801
You can go ahead.

769
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,071
I can't come with you because I forgot something.

770
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:31,671
What's her deal?

771
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:34,631
She'll be late if she doesn't go now.

772
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:37,681
Did she forget something important?

773
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:43,231
Did you wait long?

774
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:46,541
No, not at all.

775
01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:52,141
Whoa, Mr. Jin, you look really...

776
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:56,561
great today.

777
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:01,121
Ms. Han, you also look...

778
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:07,361
- Like a pickled radish?
- Yes.

779
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:17,081
Shall we go now? If we leave now, we'll probably-

780
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,491
The wipers are...

781
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:02,531
There.

782
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,460
Should we listen to some music?

783
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,295
Listen to music?

784
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,675
Sure.

785
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:23,242
 I've prepared for you today how to look cool while driving. 

786
01:03:23,242 --> 01:03:26,974
 - When you're going on a date soon after- 
Why is this playing?

787
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:32,384
Didn't he tell you to hold the seat like this when you reverse and go "whoa, whoa"?

788
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:41,555
 

789
01:03:41,555 --> 01:03:43,135
It's Yul.

790
01:03:43,845 --> 01:03:45,935
- Yes. Why?
-  Uncle, 

791
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:48,585
-  did you really get on the freeway? 
- No, not yet.

792
01:03:48,585 --> 01:03:50,185
Hi, Yul.

793
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:54,605
 What the heck? Is Ms. Hae Na with you? Ms. Han, get off! 

794
01:03:54,605 --> 01:03:56,955
 Uncle has never been on the freeway before! 

795
01:03:56,955 --> 01:04:00,035
 Gosh! He got his license only three months ago. Get off! 

796
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:02,585
 - You've gone off the route. 
- Isn't this the right...

797
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:05,675
 Rerouting. 

798
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,845
 You've gone off the route. Rerouting. 

799
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,205
 Ms. Han, get off! You'll die at that rate! 

800
01:04:12,205 --> 01:04:14,555
Hey, hang up now.

801
01:04:16,975 --> 01:04:21,055
- Isn't this the right way? Is it that way?
-  Rerouting. 

802
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:30,835
Why is the windshield so foggy now?

803
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:40,011
- I think we're late.
- Should we run, then?

804
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:46,721
Let's hurry.

805
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:55,051
♫  Whatever I say, it's for you  ♫

806
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:59,171
♫  Learning all the love songs I taught you  ♫

807
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:03,881
♫  Whatever the language, I don't mind  ♫

808
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:05,751
Hold on!

809
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:12,001
♫  Ooh, there are blue moons in the sky  ♫

810
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:15,811
♫  And the stars light the eternal light  ♫

811
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:20,851
♫  Ooh, the waves are crashing in your temple  ♫

812
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:24,731
♫  And I wish you were here to see me glow  ♫

813
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:27,411
♫  Did you know you're in my writing  ♫

814
01:05:27,411 --> 01:05:30,351
Oh, I guess we're not late.

815
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:33,821
Gosh, so cute.

816
01:05:35,864 --> 01:05:38,984
Ms. Han, here.

817
01:05:38,984 --> 01:05:44,684
♫  'Cause you'll be forever, only treasure, my toy  ♫

818
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,524
How pretty.

819
01:05:51,962 --> 01:05:59,892
♫  Because I get easily jealous, and because I get easily scared  ♫

820
01:05:59,892 --> 01:06:08,122
♫  Because I can't believe that you are smiling by my side  ♫

821
01:06:08,122 --> 01:06:16,112
♫  Because I am so happy, and because I am so overwhelmed  ♫

822
01:06:16,112 --> 01:06:23,771
♫  I can't fall asleep, afraid that it will all disappear when I open my eyes  ♫

823
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:27,022
Right, you should all see the beach since you're here. It's close.

824
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:30,172
- Should we? Get grilled clams, too.
- That'd be great.

825
01:06:30,172 --> 01:06:32,202
Let's all go together.

826
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:36,199
Mr. Seo Won!

827
01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:40,409
- Are you done eating?
- Well, yes.

828
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:43,029
- Where are you going?
- To my car for a second.

829
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:45,049
Oh, really?

830
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:48,409
I've got a little urgent matter right now.

831
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:50,589
Could you give me a ride just to the terminal, please?

832
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:54,699
- Right now?
- Yes, something urgent just came up.

833
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:57,059
Ms. Hae Na, you'll come with us to the beach, right?

834
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:58,559
Yes, of course.

835
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,189
Whoa. It's been forever since I've been to the beach.

836
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:05,943
I used to run around and...

837
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:07,743
Mr. Jin?

838
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:11,031
Well...

839
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:14,291
- let's make it quick.
- Thank you, Mr. Jin.

840
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:26,799
So full.

841
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,729
Where did Seo Won go?

842
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:31,819
- He just left with Ms. Chae Ah.
- Sorry?

843
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,779
Hello?

844
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:39,393
 I heard you went back with Ms. Chae Ah. 

845
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:43,038
No, that's not it. Ms. Yoon said something urgent came up.

846
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:45,649
 I'll take Ms. Hae Na in my car, then. 

847
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:48,209
 Ms. Hae Na, wait up! 

848
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,969
The next bus is in two hours.

849
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:58,289
Didn't you say it was urgent?

850
01:08:00,689 --> 01:08:04,239
- Let's just go all the way to Seoul, then.
- Really?

851
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,089
I'd be really grateful.

852
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:10,099
Wait, is this...

853
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:12,049
the right way?

854
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:15,537
Ms. Jin, is everything okay?

855
01:08:15,537 --> 01:08:17,857
There are so many cars.

856
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:22,416
 You've gone off the route. 

857
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:30,117
- Wait a minute. I'll try a U-turn first.
- Okay.

858
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:34,865
- Are you okay?
- Y-Yes.

859
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:37,646
 Rerouting. 

860
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,350
How old were you when you first saw a beach?

861
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:51,580
Well...

862
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,900
I think I was six.

863
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,370
I can't really remember.

864
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:59,860
When I saw the beach for the first time,

865
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:04,230
I was really mesmerized, especially by the ebb and flow of the tide.

866
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:10,990
True. I think I was surprised by the low tide because it happened a lot faster than I expected.

867
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:17,820
I even sat still and stared at the waters for days once.

868
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:24,020
Even though I was watching the tides come and go, I didn't realize it.

869
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:29,620
The fact that the ocean is being pulled by that tiny moon.

870
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,480
If you were the ocean,

871
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,820
would you feel it's unfair?

872
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,990
By an existence it doesn't even know well,

873
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:40,940
regardless of its will,

874
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,670
it gets closer to the land and grow distant again.

875
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:51,590
I don't think I ever thought of it that way.

876
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:56,750
But I think being still would also be quite boring.

877
01:09:57,823 --> 01:09:59,653
Right?

878
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:25,753
You'll grow distant faster than you think.

879
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,893
 Regardless of your will. 

880
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,580
Just as I did.

881
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:08,913
 
 I'm sorry about today. 

882
01:11:08,913 --> 01:11:12,643
 - Ms. Yoon had something urgent come up.
- What urgent- 

883
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:22,859
 Not at all. Thank you for today. 

884
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,078
Whatever. I don't care.

885
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:30,248
- What don't you care?
- Just everything.

886
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:35,036
Hey, I gave it some thought, right?

887
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:38,521
I think you should get some help from that student.

888
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:40,961
- Who?
- The math teacher's nephew.

889
01:11:40,961 --> 01:11:42,746
You said they live together.

890
01:11:42,746 --> 01:11:46,135
What kind of help could I possibly get from him and why?

891
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:50,377
It's nothing, really. He just needs to sneak you into the math teacher's room.

892
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:54,622
Then, you can stroll up to the math teacher in his sleep and kiss him.

893
01:11:54,622 --> 01:11:58,494
And you just walk out confidently on two feet. That's it, okay?

894
01:12:04,703 --> 01:12:06,629
Hey, boy.

895
01:12:06,629 --> 01:12:08,089
Gosh.

896
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:12,143
Ms. Han.

897
01:12:12,143 --> 01:12:14,713
- What about the target?
- He finally fell asleep.

898
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:17,763
He's in a total deep sleep now.

899
01:12:17,763 --> 01:12:20,423
Where's the outfit to exit in if it were a success?

900
01:12:24,812 --> 01:12:27,497
- The sunglasses.
- The sunglasses.

901
01:12:27,497 --> 01:12:29,563
- The sneakers.
- The sneakers.

902
01:12:29,563 --> 01:12:31,743
- The cap.
- The cap.

903
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,733
- The sweatpants.
- The sweatpants.

904
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:36,483
The bra.

905
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:38,123
- This is mine.
- Thought so.

906
01:12:38,123 --> 01:12:42,313
We'll retreat after contacting quickly and accurately. Got it?

907
01:12:42,313 --> 01:12:46,453
Is there a Plan B if we fail?

908
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:51,193
There's none.

909
01:12:52,983 --> 01:12:54,873
Follow me.

910
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:46,723
 No need to be nervous. I'm a dog now, anyway. 

911
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:06,373
 But we grew a lot closer thanks to the curse. 

912
01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:09,983
 I've been happy, my heart fluttered, and 

913
01:14:09,983 --> 01:14:12,593
 I kept thinking about him. 

914
01:14:12,593 --> 01:14:15,213
 It must've been due to the curse, right? 

915
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:28,773
♫  The way I looked lonely and the days I had to cherish alone  ♫

916
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:38,773
♫  As if it were natural, we came together, and the times when our hearts connected  ♫

917
01:14:42,673 --> 01:14:52,113
♫  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  ♫

918
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:56,513
♫  The coincidences brought us together  ♫

919
01:14:56,513 --> 01:14:58,263
 How pretty. 

920
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:07,164
 Will the excitement disappear once the curse breaks? 

921
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:23,774
♫  All the things that happened before us were a path for us  ♫

922
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:31,174
♫  It's a secret between just us two  ♫

923
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:35,199
 What? Why am I not changing? 

924
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,679
 Should I try one more time? 

925
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:44,382
 Huh? Why isn't it working? 

926
01:15:56,473 --> 01:16:00,218
Are you okay, Uncle? What's wrong? What's wrong?

927
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:02,563
A dog... There was a dog...

928
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:03,981
What dog?

929
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:07,401
There's no dog here. You must've had a dog dream*.
(In Korean, a meaningless dream is called a dog-dream)

930
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,316
You scared me.

931
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,571
You're okay, right?

932
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:15,651
I'm sure you are. I-I'll go back to bed now.

933
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,347
Goodnight.

934
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:30,674
Unni, why didn't it work?

935
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:32,296
Why won't it work? How come it won't work for me?

936
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,507
I see...

937
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:38,804
I guess I won't change immediately. I won't change after midnight later.

938
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:41,594
That's it. Right...

939
01:16:41,594 --> 01:16:43,354
What a relief.

940
01:16:46,097 --> 01:16:48,527
I think you're screwed.

941
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:51,307
What do you mean? It doesn't work?

942
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:53,637
Gosh. It doesn't work, apparently.

943
01:16:53,637 --> 01:16:56,507
You have to do it when the other person's awake.

944
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:04,777
Mom looked through our ancestors' records.

945
01:17:14,247 --> 01:17:17,017
 One of them said our grandmother from five generations ago 

946
01:17:17,017 --> 01:17:20,137
 kissed someone asleep, but it didn't work. 

947
01:17:20,137 --> 01:17:25,178
So it means if they're unconscious, it doesn't work.

948
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:29,313
You're still wearing this around.

949
01:17:30,991 --> 01:17:33,811
Does it help at all?

950
01:17:33,811 --> 01:17:35,691
I'm not sure.

951
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:42,579
I don't know how this question might sound,

952
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:48,929
but how exactly are you afraid of dogs?

953
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:55,601
How do you feel whenever you see dogs?

954
01:17:57,957 --> 01:18:01,037
They're cute, and I'm happy to see them.

955
01:18:01,037 --> 01:18:05,727
That means you assume the dog wouldn't attack you, right?

956
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:08,477
- Yes.
- But how do you know that?

957
01:18:08,477 --> 01:18:10,297
You don't even know that dog.

958
01:18:10,297 --> 01:18:13,297
I just trust them.

959
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:17,897
Then what if you were facing a tiger instead?

960
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:21,417
Would you still trust it?

961
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,987
No.

962
01:18:24,987 --> 01:18:27,697
That's what it's like for me.

963
01:18:40,377 --> 01:18:42,707
Have you been...

964
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:46,707
like that since you were a kid?

965
01:18:47,737 --> 01:18:50,877
Something happened when I was 10.

966
01:18:50,877 --> 01:18:55,677
Whenever I saw a dog, my mind and body...

967
01:19:00,947 --> 01:19:02,777
Ms. Han.

968
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:06,967
When we went to the escape room last time,

969
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:10,577
you yanked my hair. Do you remember?

970
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:15,737
To be honest, I was a bit jealous.

971
01:19:15,737 --> 01:19:21,907
You expressed that you were scared and asked for help with your whole body and yelling.

972
01:19:22,777 --> 01:19:25,377
You expressed it without hesitation.

973
01:19:26,977 --> 01:19:29,137
But I can't do that.

974
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:34,277
I just crumble by myself.

975
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,917
Mr. Jin.

976
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:39,279
Your fear of dogs.

977
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:41,698
I'll help you overcome it.

978
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:45,053
- How would you help me?
- Pardon?

979
01:19:45,053 --> 01:19:47,513
I was wondering if you had an idea.

980
01:19:53,196 --> 01:19:56,706
Would you like to see me outside of school first?

981
01:19:56,706 --> 01:19:59,449
- Outside of school?
- Yes.

982
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,506
Okay.

983
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,476
Really?

984
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:13,146
If you don't have plans after the exam tomorrow-

985
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:15,036
Sounds good.

986
01:20:15,036 --> 01:20:17,466
You promised me, then.

987
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,294
One.

988
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:36,084
Two.

989
01:20:36,084 --> 01:20:37,814
Three.

990
01:20:39,014 --> 01:20:40,684
Four.

991
01:20:41,724 --> 01:20:43,994
Five. Success!

992
01:20:47,564 --> 01:20:50,424
The more I looked at it, the cuter it got.

993
01:20:50,424 --> 01:20:51,804
Right?

994
01:20:51,804 --> 01:20:53,974
Okay, let's go. Next.

995
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:59,297
♫  Whatever the language, I don't mind  ♫

996
01:20:59,297 --> 01:21:01,772
♫  Million words I need to describe it  ♫

997
01:21:01,772 --> 01:21:05,472
What do you think that one's saying right now?

998
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:11,521
- "I'll rip you apart."
- No.

999
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:14,921
"No, don't come. I'm scared."

1000
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:18,344
Scared ones bark like that.

1001
01:21:20,424 --> 01:21:22,474
Wow.

1002
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:29,776
♫  'Cause love is serious, so electric, you were made of potion  ♫

1003
01:21:29,776 --> 01:21:32,364
Why do you think that one's doing that?

1004
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:35,744
- "I'll rip you apart."
- No.

1005
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:39,214
"Hey, come here. Nice to see you. Nice to see you."

1006
01:21:39,214 --> 01:21:42,904
The social ones tend to be intense like that.

1007
01:21:48,864 --> 01:21:50,764
How about them?

1008
01:21:52,214 --> 01:21:55,854
- This one's really saying, "I'll rip you apart."
- No.

1009
01:21:55,854 --> 01:21:59,878
You seem to think they'll bite you if they bark.

1010
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:05,028
But they're all very different, like humans. So different that...

1011
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:12,194
Let's get going.

1012
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:15,124
- Are they fighting?
- They aren't.

1013
01:22:15,124 --> 01:22:17,664
There aren't many dogs here.

1014
01:22:18,574 --> 01:22:20,184
No.

1015
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:26,774
It must've been difficult today. I'm moving too quickly, aren't I?

1016
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:28,904
- No.
- Come on.

1017
01:22:28,904 --> 01:22:33,324
You look just like my students whenever I move on too quickly.

1018
01:22:36,704 --> 01:22:38,924
I know that face, too.

1019
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:41,224
Right? You know, right?

1020
01:22:42,464 --> 01:22:47,204
If you look in the mirror now, you look just like our students.

1021
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,690
Mr. Jin.

1022
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:44,610
Try imagining this is our house.

1023
01:23:45,776 --> 01:23:49,126
The most comfortable and

1024
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:52,390
safest place in the world.

1025
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:59,215
♫  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  ♫

1026
01:23:59,215 --> 01:24:00,965
This is the roof.

1027
01:24:01,839 --> 01:24:06,694
♫  The coincidences brought us together  ♫

1028
01:24:06,694 --> 01:24:12,845
♫  It shone as brightly as it was dark  ♫

1029
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:22,570
♫  Even the secrets I wanted to hide were precious memories  ♫

1030
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:35,350
♫  We ended up meeting, having no choice but to fall in love  ♫
