1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:09,620
   ​

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,390
 

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,030
 

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,590
 

5
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,490
 

6
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,190
 
 If it's Mr. Bo Gyeom, he'll accept a woman like me, too. 

7
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,900
 
Ms. Hae Na!

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,540
I'm sorry!

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,680
Ms. Hae Na!

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,540
 I only have one minute left. 

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,980
 If I kiss a man, I turn into a dog. 

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,460
When will she turn back into a human?

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,710
 Six in the morning. 

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,830
And she'll turn into a dog again at midnight.

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,730
- For how long?
- For 100 days.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,550
 If she can't undo the curse by then,
she'll live the rest of her life as a dog. 

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,360
 The solution to undo this damned curse. 

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,860
 I must kiss this man again today but as a dog this time. 

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,990
 By the way, why do you hate me? 

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,680
 Why do you find me uncomfortable? 

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,450
 When I'm with you, it's really- 

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,010
Anyhow, it's true I avoided you because I was a bit uncomfortable,

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,930
but it wasn't because I hate you.

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,330
 

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,470
M-Mr. Jin, please excuse me for one moment. Sorry.

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,700
Ms. Han!

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,820
 Huh? What's wrong with him? 

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,600
 Don't tell me, he's afraid of dogs? 

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,530
What do I do now?

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,020
 He hates dogs so much. 

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,950
Did anything else happen by chance?

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,880
Won, you didn't forget about us hanging out after work today, right?

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,340
 Since you decided to help me, 

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,250
 how about we meet regularly so I can get tips from you? 

35
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,370
Just one beer, please?

36
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,320
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,940
How many times did I say no just now?

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,250
 Why do you feel uncomfortable with me, anyway? 

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,820
 What are you, a nutcracker? 
 

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,570
 And am I a walnut? 

41
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,680
 You keep crushing me over and over and over again. 

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,230
Did you say he's afraid of dogs?

43
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,240
 But I'm sure all dogs in the area flock around her. 

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,500
What kind of students smoke in front of a school?

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,780
What are your names?

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,990
No, let's just touch her and call it even.

47
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,410
She asked what your names are just now.

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,900
 Are you feeling better now? 

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,970
 I was a bit in shock this morning, but I'm okay now. 

50
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,550
 Sorry about last night. 

51
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,790
I'm sorry, too.

52
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,820
 Thinking about it, I could see why you were mistaken. 

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,450
 I don't know what it is, 

54
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,120
 but you don't have to tell me if it's too difficult. 

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,510
 Everyone is in unique situations 

56
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,720
and it's natural to have at least one secret of their own.

57
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,580
 Is this Ms. Han Hae Na of Garam High School? 

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,990
The buses must've stopped running.

59
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,870
I'll get going now.

60
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,800
Hello? Oppa, I'm in trouble right now.

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,930
Why are you still here?

62
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,000
 How could a person turn into a dog? 

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,240
 Ma'am, do you live alone? 

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,100
 Your family must be worried. 

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,660
 Should I call them for you? 

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,360
 How do I get out of here? 

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,810
 I'll wait until it's six in the morning and leave when I turn into a human. 

68
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,210
 Never, ever fall asleep. 

69
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,050
 Never fall asleep... 

70
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,960
 I'm done for! I'm done. 

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,230
 What do I do now? What do I do? 

72
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,630
 Who's that? 

73
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,520
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

74
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,450
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

75
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,590
♫  Happy birthday dear Ms. Hae Na  ♫

76
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,740
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

77
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,850
You bought this, Mr. Jin?

78
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,630
Yes, since you like tiramisu.

79
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,680
Thank you.

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,540
But should I have given you something like this instead?

81
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,940
Why a dog bone?

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,160
Eat this.

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,420
Eat this!

84
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,520
Our Man Deuk at home loves this.

85
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,840
Want to play with this?

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,980
I heard dogs like chew toys.

87
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,270
Bite this. Bite it!

88
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,760
If we want to train her, we should put a collar on her first.

89
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,560
Hey, give me your paw. Your paw!

90
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,720
These clothes would look so good on you, right?

91
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,650
No! I'm not a dog.

92
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,710
I just temporarily turn into a dog!

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,140
I saw a huge rat recently.

94
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,500
That was you, wasn't it?

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,030
Ms. Han?

96
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,360
Is this a dream?

97
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,060
Wait, what are you doing here, Mr. Jin?

98
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,720
Why are you here, Ms. Han?

99
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,450
Ms. Han, you're back?

100
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,980
Uncle!

101
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,670
Uncle? What do you mean? Uncle?

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,640
Could you please explain this situation first?

103
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,090
 

104
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,590
Ms. Han, regarding your transformation into a dog-

105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
Earlier...

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,790
The scene I witnessed with my own two eyes...

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,420
Was it an accident?

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,100
A mistake?

109
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,260
Uncle, what do you take me for?

110
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,390
A really absurd situation took place yesterday.

111
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,350
Well, I went to get Yul at the police station in the middle of the night last night.

112
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,410
Police station?

113
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,590
Ms. Han, how could you expose me like that?

114
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,940
Why were you at the police station?

115
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,540
Did you cause trouble?

116
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,090
The students from Gyeonghoon High School must've started a fight with Yul yesterday.

117
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,550
Were you hurt anywhere?

118
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,550
No, Yul is completely fine.

119
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,960
It's not a big deal.

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,000
Ms. Han came and took care of it.

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,700
But why did you contact Ms. Han instead of me?

122
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,280
Who knows what they'd do to you if they find out I'm your nephew and dox you?

123
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,730
Why would you worry about that? I'm your guardian.

124
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,410
You should've called me!

125
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,060
Don't be too hard on him. I'm his homeroom teacher, so-

126
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,420
Please let us finish our conversation.

127
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,130
But why did you come all the way to our house?

128
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,140
Oh, you see... I-

129
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,750
Ms. Han was in the middle of drinking when she rushed over to help me.

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,270
- So...
- That's right.

131
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,030
So once we left the police station, we got into a taxi to drop Yul off.

132
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,960
But once I got in the taxi, all the tension left my body, and I felt tipsy.

133
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,020
So I passed out in the taxi.

134
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,980
I had no idea where Ms. Han lived.

135
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,450
Nor could I communicate with a dog.

136
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,280
Dog?

137
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,720
Ms. Han...

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,310
was drunk like a dog.

139
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,760
That's right. I was drunk like a dog last night.

140
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,220
Why did you drink so much?

141
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,390
Did you drink because you were upset about the Gyeonghoon High kids?

142
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,980
That's right.

143
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,400
I drank because I was really upset.

144
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,660
Shouldn't you have slept outside if Ms. Han had slept in your room?

145
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,630
Of course, I slept outside.

146
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,630
That's odd. I'm sure I was sleeping on the sofa.

147
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,160
Because you were uncomfortable!

148
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,970
You came back in your sleep because you were uncomfortable, right?

149
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,240
She's right.

150
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,720
That's right, Uncle. It was in my sleep.

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,410
Do I sleepwalk?

152
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,200
Homing instinct. It could be homing instinct.

153
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,930
As expected, you're smart since you're a teacher.

154
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,700
So that's why...

155
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,300
Young lady, didn't you say you were going to exercise?

156
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,250
Stay put.

157
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm sure he told me he jogs at this time.

158
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,730
What's with those two?

159
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,620
Why are they leaving together?

160
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,300
Hey, Ms. Han.

161
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,430
Could you keep it a secret that I'm Yul's uncle?

162
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,260
Gosh, of course. Yul might feel uncomfortable.

163
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,030
I'm sorry about yesterday.

164
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,880
Things like this keep happening when I'm with you.

165
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,720
What is this situation?

166
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,200
If I hadn't been so wasted...

167
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,970
She got wasted, huh?

168
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,740
I'm also sorry...

169
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,770
about getting riled up earlier.

170
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,570
He got riled up?

171
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,210
And I'll make sure to keep your secret.

172
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,950
Secret?

173
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,100
Shoo! Shoo, shoo!

174
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,470
Ms. Han,

175
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,930
I recommend you cut back on drinking.

176
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,140
The world can be scary these days.

177
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,440
Okay.

178
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,530
I'll see you at school then.

179
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,530
 

180
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,380
You got caught?

181
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,210
By one of your students?

182
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,030
On top of that, he's the math teacher's nephew.

183
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,040
What? Nephew?

184
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,520
Hey, are you out of your mind?

185
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,090
That hurts! What's wrong with you?

186
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,120
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

187
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,640
You still haven't come to your senses after getting into this mess?

188
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,670
Oppa, calm her down.

189
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,370
Hey, like you've never gotten into a mess?

190
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,460
Your ex-boyfriend threatened to expose you, so you shut him up with money.

191
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,100
- Huh! Why would you bring up that jerk now?
- Wait, Hae Na!

192
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,050
- Calm her down!
- That's on you for bringing that up.

193
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,860
- That scumbag.
- You dare bring him up to me?

194
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,760
Yul, come out and eat.

195
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,410
So cute.

196
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,690
Why do you always watch these?

197
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,030
Since I can't raise one because of you.

198
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,230
Can't we get a dog?

199
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,850
You already keep my hands full.

200
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,870
What are you doing?

201
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,500
Picture this.

202
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,280
When you come home,

203
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
the dog will always greet you like this.

204
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,440
I wouldn't want to come home.

205
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,330
Screw it!

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,560
Come on.

207
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,350
Crack attack!

208
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,290
Come on, let's eat.

209
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,670
I'll clean up after it.

210
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,530
- Let's eat before it gets cold.
- I'll walk it, too. I promise!

211
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,110
Sit down.

212
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,190
I'll think about it while I eat.

213
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,740
Really?

214
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,210
Nice!

215
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,200
If you eat 10 bowls.

216
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,180
Thank you for the food.

217
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Thank you for the food.

218
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,750
How can I eat 10 bowls?

219
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,340
Go on and eat.

220
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,730
Look at this. It's cute, right?

221
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,260
It is a bit cute.

222
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,760
 

223
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,370
 

224
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,640
Yul is nice! He won't spread rumors.

225
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,940
How can you trust him?

226
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,960
He can be trusted.

227
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,010
Drop me off here.

228
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,160
Take this with you.

229
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,680
- What is it?
- Give it to the math teacher.

230
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,060
You said he's afraid of dogs.

231
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,860
Who knows? He might develop the slightest immunity while carrying that around.

232
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,160
Oh! Also, keep this in mind.

233
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,760
The math teacher might freak out when he sees dogs racing at the sight of you.

234
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,860
Good luck!

235
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,510
As if he would carry this around.

236
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,400
What is that?

237
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,930
Mr. Lee!

238
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,770
Gosh, this is so cute!

239
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,930
Oh, it kind of resembles you, Ms. Hae Na.

240
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,700
Really?

241
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,730
True. You do have a puppy look.

242
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,780
I like dogs because they're loyal.

243
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,230
Once a dog meets its owner, it'll follow them for life.

244
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,250
Are you like that, too?

245
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,840
When you like someone, do you like them until the end?

246
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,440
Of course.

247
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,980
Mr. Jin!

248
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,360
Mr. Jin.

249
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,300
- Yes?
- Did you have a nice weekend?

250
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,670
- Yes.
- How so?

251
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,650
Sorry?

252
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,950
Tell me how nicely you spent your weekend.

253
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,420
Is there something you want to say?

254
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,210
Mr. Jin,

255
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,640
do you have a girlfriend?

256
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,140
No.

257
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,730
Then, I'll be straightforward.

258
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,550
I'd like for us to open up to each other

259
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,610
without reserve and share everything as coworkers.

260
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,540
What do you think?

261
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,630
Sure, I guess.

262
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,190
Then shall we tell each other one secret?

263
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,550
To be honest...

264
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,800
I have uneven buttocks.

265
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,550
We now have the type of relationship where we share secrets.

266
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,980
Right?

267
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,630
Sorry?

268
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,550
What in the world...

269
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,490
She's popular with the dogs, for sure.

270
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,380
The dogs really love her.

271
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,030
What's with the puppy?

272
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,040
Oh, that's Man Deuk.

273
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,250
He's going to stay here for the day, okay?

274
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,390
My daughter kept begging me.

275
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,260
Sorry! Should I get you a napkin?

276
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,530
Geez, it's fine!

277
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,130
Vice Principal, I'm actually allergic to dog hair.

278
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,240
All of a sudden?

279
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,690
It started this spring.

280
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,050
Gosh, what a shame.

281
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,360
You should take allergy meds, then.

282
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,660
Well...

283
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,040
he seems a bit wary, too. Should we put him in his cage for now?

284
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,060
No, no! Our Man Deuk hates being caged.

285
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,040
- Mr. Jin.
- Yes?

286
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,880
Why are you standing there blocking the doorway?

287
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,350
I left my cell phone in my car.

288
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,510
Oh, you bring your car?

289
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,830
That's great! If you're going to the parking lot,

290
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,100
stop by my car and bring me Man Deuk's belongings.

291
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,720
There should be a bag of dog food and bowls.

292
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,980
- All right.
- Thank you.

293
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,350
Sure.

294
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,010
Oh, Mr. Jin.

295
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,620
Why are you so startled?

296
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,390
Our Man Deuk should be hungry.

297
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,780
Please give him food and water.

298
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,510
Me?

299
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,390
I'm very busy right now.

300
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,570
- I appreciate it.
- W-Wait-

301
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,410
Mr. Jin, I'm sorry!

302
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,170
I'm late for class.

303
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,860
 Hello. 

304
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,450
You're going to keep my secret, right?

305
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,860
Yes, of course.

306
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,850
But will you be okay at school?

307
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,010
You won't change?

308
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,270
I'm fine during school.

309
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,890
You don't find me weird?

310
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,250
Even though I transform like that?

311
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,790
You are unique but not weird.

312
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,010
Really?

313
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,190
Yes. You were so cute.

314
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,630
When will you transform again?

315
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,470
I want to see it again.

316
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,360
I don't really want to transform.

317
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,450
Why not? I'll play fetch and tug with you-

318
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,750
...too.

319
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,520
I bought a bunch of these, too.

320
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,670
Cut it out.

321
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,310
Don't have too much!

322
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,710
What are you doing?

323
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,910
Huh? Nothing.

324
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,100
- Keep it up.
- Hyung.

325
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,790
Yeah?

326
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,990
Put this on my desk.

327
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,320
Why should I?

328
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,710
Just do it.

329
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,290
You do it.

330
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,390
I'll buy you the cake from last time.

331
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,420
Excuse me, I have money, too.

332
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,050
Come on, Hyung.

333
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,590
Why are you being so bothersome?

334
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,490
Hyung,

335
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,830
it's me.

336
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,350
What about you?

337
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,230
You know.

338
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,020
I don't know.

339
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,320
Hyung!

340
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,180
It's me...

341
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,670
Won.

342
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,320
What's gotten into you today?

343
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
Did you eat something wrong? Geez...

344
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,820
Real cheese, choco, pong-dang, pong-dang cake!

345
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,390
How about that?

346
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,430
Gosh!

347
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,940
Aigoo.

348
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,230
Your only crime is being too cute. Right?

349
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,980
- Thank you.
- Sure.

350
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,900
Thank you!

351
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,930
Go!

352
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,570
So cute!

353
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,770
Good boy.

354
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,390
Good.

355
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,000
Did you have fun?

356
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,430
Good job.

357
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,810
He's not here again.

358
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,760
Is he in class?

359
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,090
 

360
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,780
What the?

361
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,630
He's not.

362
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,600
Why haven't I seen Mr. Seo Won all day?

363
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,420
You're right. I couldn't see that handsome face in the office all morning.

364
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,670
Girls keep stopping by with snacks during recess, asking, "Where's Mr. Seo Won?"

365
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,560
Just record your answer.

366
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,270
"I don't know. He's not here."

367
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,850
I don't know. He's not here.

368
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,380
But the dog is here.

369
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,210
Oh, he's not anymore.

370
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,030
Man Deuk left?

371
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,060
Yeah, the Vice Principal just took him and left.

372
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,150
His doggy needs to take a nap, but his favorite cushion is at home.

373
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,450
He really went home?

374
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,390
When I passed my teacher certification exam,

375
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,310
I wonder if my mom knew I'd be cleaning up dog poop.

376
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,030
Hey.

377
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,280
Hey!

378
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,140
What? Man Deuk went home?

379
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,570
Oh, so Man Deuk went home.

380
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,380
I see...

381
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,760
Let's finish the exam questions by Wednesday

382
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,410
and check each other's for errors.

383
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,290
Who's going to edit the exam?

384
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,490
It usually depends on the order of tenure-

385
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,460
Oh, I still have to take care of the school trip details.

386
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,130
I don't think I could handle editing on top of it.

387
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,780
Oh, I'll do it.

388
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,930
We'll leave it to you, Ms. Hae Na.

389
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,220
- Sure.
- Good job, everyone.

390
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,020
I'm saying this out of consideration for you, Ms. Hae Na.

391
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,660
- Be careful.
- With what?

392
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,560
I saw it.

393
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,570
- Saw what?
- Why are you so stunned?

394
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,250
Well, it was shocking indeed.

395
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,090
Should I say it,

396
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,840
or will you say it first?

397
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,890
Well, you see...

398
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,840
I don't know when or how you saw it, but-

399
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,360
A person shouldn't change like that.

400
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,560
You act all coy in front of people yet wave around your tail behind others' backs.

401
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Ms. Yoon, I'll explain everything.

402
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,310
I don't plan on spreading rumors.

403
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,410
Phew, thank you.

404
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:21,060
A dirty rumor like that won't benefit Mr. Seo Won's reputation anyway.

405
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,860
Rumors are almost always blown out of proportion.

406
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,490
A simple visit can turn into a date.

407
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,720
And two or three dates in the house can turn into cohabitation.

408
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
Sorry?

409
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,280
I don't know how you might feel, but Mr. Seo Won and I are getting to know each other.

410
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,530
Oh, is that so?

411
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,890
Should I call it the flirting phase?

412
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,510
We share secrets, too.

413
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,470
Anyway, I think something like that Saturday morning can happen.

414
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,170
Saturday morning...

415
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:04,080
A man and a woman could've made a mistake after drinking together.

416
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,850
I'm on the laid back side.

417
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,530
Well, Ms. Yoon, the reason I was there that day

418
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,530
was because of a different situation. Seriously, nothing happened.

419
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,010
What situation?

420
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,010
That's not something I can tell you.

421
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,570
Anyway, it's nothing like that, for sure.

422
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,170
Please believe me.

423
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,210
So there's nothing between you?

424
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,730
Yes.

425
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,050
No feelings whatsoever?

426
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,210
No feelings at all.

427
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,010
All right, then. You can't change your mind later!

428
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,080
What the?

429
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,740
Why am I explaining myself to her?

430
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,590
So what if they're dating? What does she want from me?

431
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,450
- You're here.
- Yeah.

432
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,800
I escaped because I didn't want to clean dog poop.

433
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,240
Why would you clean dog poop?

434
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,830
He's back... Man Deuk.

435
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,480
- What?
- Man Deuk is better than a human.

436
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,250
He returned with his favorite cushion.

437
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,420
♫  I space out all day thinking about you  ♫

438
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,410
♫  I'm like this every chance I get, it makes me laugh  ♫

439
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,610

♫  Everything, I like everything about you  ♫

441
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:39,390
♫  My heart felt like it was covered by something for a while  ♫

442
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,750
- Mr. Jin.
- Yes.

443
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,670
Why is it so hard to see your face today?

444
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,390
I'll send you the materials right away.

445
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,120
Guys! Out of the way, guys!

446
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,620
Move! Move!

447
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,840
Guys, move!

448
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,360
♫  I'm falling in love  ♫

449

453
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,510
Sorry, guys.

454
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,710
- Ms. Chae Ah.
- Yes?

455
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,190
Are you done editing the questions?

456
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,530
I finished that ages ago.

457
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,350
There aren't any questions to ask for physical education.

458
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,290
Mr. Seo Won! Why are you...

459
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,950
Is it because of the dog?

460
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,480
Hey, no way.

461
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,990
Man Deuk!

462
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,800
The sprinkler above your seat must be broken, too. It's leaking, isn't it?

463
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,910
Yes, it's...

464
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,100
Mr. Seo Won, are you okay?

465
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,670
I'm okay.

466
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,250
That's what I thought.

467
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,190
As if a grown man would act like that because he's afraid of a dog.

468
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,820
A grown man can't be afraid of dogs?

469
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,140
Sorry?

470
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,430
Sorry?

471
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,420
Oh, right, Ms. Hae Na.

472
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,130
Didn't you say you were allergic to dog hair earlier?

473
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,640
Whoa, I must be cured. Whoa!

474
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,020
Does it just disappear like that?

475
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:28,440
These are our new teachers starting this semester.

476
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,660
Hello, everyone!

477
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,630
Hello, I'm the English teacher, Cheon Song Yi.

478
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,450
Hello, I'm Han Hae Na.

♫  When I'm standing right here in front of you?  ♫

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,970
Good boy.

492
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,400
House!

493
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,480
Vice Principal.

494
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,050
Here.

495
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,540
Oh, yes.

496
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,420
Man Deuk...

497
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,310
you did great today.

498
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,190
"Man Deuk, you did great today."

499
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,130
Hey, Seo Won.

500
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,960
You didn't forget about buying me a cake, right?

501
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,190
Sure, okay.

502
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,420
Are you here to buy a cake?

503
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,790
Yes.

504
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,060
I've been contemplating for 30 minutes.

505
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,730
It's good there's still some left.

506
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,700
Yes, although I don't know if it's good or bad.

507
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,420
You know how something off-limits is more desirable?

508
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,170
I must never consume cacao at night,

509
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,350
but I think about it every night since I can't eat it.

510
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,990
Should I help you?

511
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,360
Sorry?

512
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,630
Please give me everything that's left here.

513
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,190
Okay.

514
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,090
Thank you.

515
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,690
I'm grateful.

516
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,110
Well, then.

517
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,290
Thank you for today.

518
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,960
Sorry?

519
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,330
I know you helped me multiple times today.

520
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,750
Was it obvious?

521
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,300
I thought I was very thorough.

522
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,820
You were thorough.

523
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,490
Since no one else noticed.

524
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,200
My fear of dogs.

525
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,350
I thought that was the unique situation you couldn't talk about last time,

526
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,970
so I tried to help you without being obvious.

527
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,320
I was helpful, right?

528
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,460
Of course.

529
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,980
But...

530
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,790
I'm a bit weird, aren't I?

531
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,770
No, you're not!

532
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,590
If we're talking weird, I'm a lot more weird-

533
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,580
By the way, Mr. Jin,

534
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,210
can I ask why your situation is difficult to talk about?

535
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,630
Well,

536
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,450
it's embarrassing for a grown adult to fear dogs.

537
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,570
Gosh, I've done a lot more embarrassing things.

538
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,820
I got wasted and stole your lips,

539
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,860
I yanked your hair at the escape room,

540
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,790
and got wasted and slept 10 hours in my student's room.

541
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,530
See? I have a lot more, don't I?

542
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,370
You should tell me one more embarrassing thing, too.

543
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,340
Just to be fair.

544
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,540
Even though I did all those embarrassing things,

545
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:10,780
you didn't avoid me or think weirdly of me.

546
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,890
It's the same for me.

547
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,710
Neither of us are weird people.

548
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,660
We're just those types of people.

549
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:13,320
♫  The way I looked lonely and the days I had to cherish alone  ♫

550
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,720
- What is this?
- What?

551
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,540
Whoa! It's a dog, huh?

552
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,900
What do you think?

553
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,080
I just thought you might develop the slightest

554
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,010
immunity toward dogs if you keep this on you all the time.

555
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,450
Like a vaccine, for example.

556
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,680
If it's a vaccine, has it passed clinical trials?

557
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,670
You're my first experiment.

558
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,500
Forget it if you don't like it.

559
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,730
Take this.

560
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,910
Now that I think about it, no one will eat it even if I bring it home.

561
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,210
Make sure to eat it during the day, not at night.

562
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,470
During the day.

563
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,140
I'll make sure to eat it during the day.

564
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,470
I owe you one today and

565
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,740
you gave me this immunity dog, too.

566
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,450
I should give you this, at least, to sleep comfortably.

567
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,940
Of course, you should.

568
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:24,110
You need to sleep well to improve your skin and maintain your popularity.

569
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,780
I don't know about popularity.

570
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,540
Huh? I'm sure you know.

571
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,250
The entire universe knows.

572
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,240
You write diaries at home, don't you?

573
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,740
"I was handsome today, yet again."

574
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,430
"I looked pretty decent today as well."

575
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,560
I don't write diaries.

576
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:57,930
♫  When I fell in love, everything became a path for me  ♫

577
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:04,300
♫  With secrets between the two of us  ♫

578
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,090
What's wrong with her?

579
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,200
She'll turn into a dog soon.

580
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,050
- She needs to avoid chocolate.
- Right.

581
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,670
How does it taste?

582
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,000
Why ask? It's exactly the taste you know.

583
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,160
I don't know.

584
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,070
I can't remember.

585
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,540
Did the math teacher accept the doll?

586
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,770
Well, he did take it with him.

587
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,250
Great. Since it resembles you, he'll grow some immunity.

588
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,270
Hey, what about this?

589
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,240
Increase the size of the doll gradually.

590
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,980
You know, that Russian doll that keeps popping up.

591
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,620
It's M-Matryoshka!

592
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,480
Yes, a-anyway, give it to him in levels one, two, and three.

593
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,420
And at the end, act like you're a doll and sit still.

594
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,630
Then, when he lowers his guard, kiss him!

595
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,550
Hey, you're a genius!

596
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,050
- Yes.
- Wow!

597
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,420
Eat up.

598
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,990
- It's so good, huh?
- Yes.

599
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,380
Can't you stop eating now?

600
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,110
Just keep eating. It's totally fine.

601
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
I want to eat it, too.

602
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,220
- Hyung.
- Yes.

603
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,780
Is eating cacao at night bad for you?

604
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,810
It's totally fine.

605
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,330
Hey, by the way, is that a trend?

606
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,890
Why on Earth do you live in a place like this?

607
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,870
Don't you have a home?

608
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,130
I do have a home.

609
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,940
Then why don't you go home and live out here?

610
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,680
I don't know what I was in my previous life,

611
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,600
but I just like living in nature like this.

612
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,570
I'll go home once my business is done here.

613
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,700
What business?

614
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,180
Hey, drink that and warm up.

615
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,880
It's good for you.

616
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,680
By the way, this teacup looks really old.

617
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,170
Right?

618
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,520
You'd have no idea how old it is.

619
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,790
About 100 years old or something?

620
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,360
About the time it takes for the light from that star to shine and reach us here.

621
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,280
That sounds like a pickup line.

622
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,150
- Huh?
- I got you, right?

623
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,840
Man, what the heck?

624
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,440
Gosh, it's nice.

625
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,270
Mr. Lee, I-I love you.

626
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,180
Thank you!

627
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,650
Whoa, that's a pretty wedding invitation.

628
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,050
- Seosan?
- Whoa.

629
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,380
That's too far.

630
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,900
Sorry, that's where Mr. Bong's main family home is located.

631
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,820
I already rented a bus. Don't worry about it.

632
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,570
I don't like buses, though.

633
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,330
Oh, Mr. Gong!

634
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,880
Here's our wedding invitation.

635
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,200
Gosh, what a hassle.

636
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,300
A wedding invitation?

637
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,860
Yes, it's for Ms. Seo and Mr. Bong. They're finally getting married.

638
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:47,180
They dated in secret for so long, although everyone except those two knew.

639
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,720
During the school trip, at that terrace...

640
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,590
It feels like we're Romeo and Juliet doing this, right?

641
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,000
What do you mean, Romeo and Juliet?

642
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,000
Bong-meo!

643
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,210
Oh, Seo-liet!

644
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,610
How long do we have to meet secretly like this?

645
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,250
No one would know we're doing this, right?

646
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,470
Of course, this is so thrilling.

647
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,960
Be quiet!

648
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,430
Now that I think about it, the four of us were on the terrace back then.

649
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,900
The living witnesses to Bong and Seo couple.

650
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:42,350
Wait, should we get them a gift just from us, then?

651
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,460
Could you two go and buy it?

652
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,610
Yes, sure. Shall we?

653
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,010
Ms. Han, are you free this evening?

654
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,270
Yes, I'm free.

655
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,460
In that case, let me know how much after you pick one.

656
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,920
Okay.

657
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,180
Where should we go?

658
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,840
Hyung, aren't you behind in grading the performance assessment?

659
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,150
The NEIS* entries are due in two days.
(National Education Information System)

660
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,190
The research department will give you an earful if you're late.

661
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,010
Gosh, that's right!

662
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,730
♫  Please don't pretend not to know  ♫

663
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:20,490
♫  I know how you feel  ♫

664
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:25,330
♫  Even if you act like you're nonchalant  ♫

665
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,390
♫  You make it obvious  ♫

666
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:31,500
♫  Don't act like you don't know, it's love  ♫

667
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,120
♫  Don't walk on eggshells, tell me everything  ♫

668
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,040
♫  Who cares what other people say  ♫

669
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,450
Whoa! It's expensive.
♫  What does it matter?  ♫

670
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,030
♫  It's the perfect timing for us to love  ♫

671
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,390
♫  It's the perfect timing even at a glance  ♫

672
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,010
♫  You don't need to lie to know the answer  ♫

673
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,950
♫  Before time passes, now is the timing  ♫

674
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:02,670
♫  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, perfect timing  ♫

675
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,440
♫  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, now is the timing  ♫

676
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,420
Gosh, there goes all my stress.

677
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,170
I think matching pajamas would be nice, too.

678
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,570
This is cute, isn't it?

679
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,210
- It's pretty.
- What about this one?

680
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,340
Will you be able to handle it?

681
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,920
Which one gets you more excited?

682
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,600
What about these?

683
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,180
Those are a bit uncomfortable.

684
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,460
Then, let's buy this one.

685
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,680
I won't wear it, so why?

686
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,130
You don't buy these to wear in the first place.

687
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,370
Then?

688
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,350
You know what I mean.

689
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,710
Be quiet. There are people around us.

690
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,620
So what?

691
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,630
- S-Should we go?
- Yes.

692
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,310
You two are such a good-looking couple.

693
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,750
I think these pajamas would look great. What do you think?

694
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,650
 - Thank you. 
- Thank you, please take care.

695
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,320
Whoa!

696
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,280
We should have bought a lamp.

697
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,710
Should we go now?

698
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,100
I need to stop by the pharmacy.

699
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,270
Are you feeling sick?

700
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,170
No, I want to buy motion sickness medicine for the trip to the wedding.

701
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,070
I get terrible motion sickness when I ride express buses.

702
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,600
Are you fine in other vehicles?

703
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,860
Yes. It gets bad only on express buses.

704
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,520
Do you want to ride in my car, then?

705
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,760
Really? Can I?

706
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,160
If we leave around nine o'clock at the park, we'll arrive right on time.

707
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,840
Okay.

708
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,120
As if I would let you.

709
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,740
Ms. Hae Na?

710
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,010
Ms. Che Ah!

711
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,110
What are you two doing here?

712
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:47,260
We came to buy a wedding gift for Mr. Bong and Ms. Seo.

713
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,020
Oh, just the two of you?

714
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,680
What about you?

715
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,760
I came for a change of pace.

716
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,960
Looks like you were in a terrible mood.

717
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:05,040
Right. Should we go to the wedding in one car this weekend?

718
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,190
Pardon?

719
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,480
Mr. Bo Gyeom wanted to gather people because he doesn't like the bus.

720
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,590
Oh, i-is that so?

721
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,350
Let's all go together. It's also better to take turns driving.

722
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,980
Please leave me out for the count.

723
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,260
Why?

724
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,080
I'd just like to refuse that car.

725
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,510
Why don't you just go together? It's more convenient.

726
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,130
I'm fine.

727
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,390
What about you? You'll come with us, right?

728
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,250
Well, I'm...

729
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,510
Come with us!

730
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:45,860
If you don't, it's just Mr. Bo Gyeom and me. How can I go alone with him?

731
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,220
It's awkward. You'll come with me, right?

732
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,200
Sure, I'll do that, then.

733
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,430
Okay. I'll be going now, then.

734
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,110
 I don't want to. 

735
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,670
Mr. Lee, that's not it.

736
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,850
You also don't want to ride the crowded rental bus, do you?

737
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,700
 Gosh, it's still better than having to drive for hours. 

738
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,160
I have a license. Let's take turns driving.

739
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,380
Come on, entrust my life to you?

740
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,210
Lend me your car, at least, then.

741
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,560
Ms. Hae Na already agreed to ride in your car, too.

742
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,390
Listen to this. I can tell something's up. Isn't there?

743
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,600
Just tell me everything already.

744
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,290
Who knows? I just might be convinced.

745
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:36,930
 I mean, it looked like Ms. Hae Na was about to go with Mr. Seo Won alone. 

746
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,350
I knew it.

747
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,300
There was something.

748
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,050
So you split them up, using me as an excuse?

749
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,970
I just didn't want weird rumors going around.

750
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,290
I did see something last time, so I got worried.

751
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,360
What did you see last time?

752
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,420
It's really a secret, okay?

753
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,870
I was jogging the other day and...

754
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,040
Okay, I got it. Let's do that.

755
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,570

No. You wouldn't stand out.

Wait, how did you come, Ms. Song Yi?

You can go ahead.

787
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,650
I can't come with you because I forgot something.

01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,110
 That's pretty. 

817
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,540
 I'll help you out. 

818
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,400
 Your fear of dogs. 

819
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,440
 Can you start by meeting me outside of work? 

820
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,600
 Just tell him honestly and ask for help! 

821
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,710
 That's easier said than done. 

822
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,570
 You really can't tell just anyone about the curse. Did you forget it already? 

823
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:45,800
 Is there a side effect to turning into a dog? 

824
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,040
 Like your heart racing out of nowhere, for example. 

825
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,870
 You'll grow distant faster than you think. 

826
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,730
 Regardless of your will.
