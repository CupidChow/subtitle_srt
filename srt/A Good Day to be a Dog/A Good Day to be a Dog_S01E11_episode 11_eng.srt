1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,820
   ​

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,310
 

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,310
 

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,800
 

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,230
 

6
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,280
 
 Have you noticed Bo Gyeom hyung acting weird these days? 

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,600
 I met up with him yesterday, but he seemed unfamiliar, as if he was someone else. 

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
 It's this puppy, huh? The puppy with a story you're entangled with. 

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,630
 Stop right there! 

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,700
 Are you all right? 

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,800
 Use it on the wound from your fall last time. 

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,250
 My Lady got in big trouble for treating me like a friend instead of a servant. 

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,500
 So you should also treat me cold and unkind, Young Master. 

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,010
 Do you know someone named Yi Wol Hwa? 

15
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,100
 He might be from the collateral family, but he's still of the royal bloodline. 

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,300
 Yi Wol Hwa's wife is at this place for pregnancy care. 

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,500
 We will capture her immediately. So be aware. 

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,900
 You must be careful, My Lady. 

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,700
 Go! She'll die if they catch her! 

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,440
 Young Master, what are you... 

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,600
 I'll look into the situation. Be safe. 

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,780
 Fate has abandoned this woman. 

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,860
 She lost her husband overnight and was chased by wolves. 

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,200
 Will her baby survive? 

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
 Its life has already been extinguished. 

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
 I have lived a long life, 

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,300
 but you're the first person I've seen to stand on that cliff three times. 

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,800
 My newborn went to the afterlife by himself. 

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,620
 Your child did not go to the afterlife. 

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,460
 Its spirit lingered around you for a while 

31
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,000
 and got dragged into the body of a dying puppy. 

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,500
 It's still not too late. Tell me where Madam Han and that girl went. 

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,180
 I have been looking for you for so long. 

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,800
 Warm, beautiful, and joyful memories. 

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,100
 Memories are shared between two people, so would it not also be a great gift for me? 

36
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,620
 No wonder we could not find them since they were hiding in the deep mountains. 

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,840
 The swordsmen are here. 

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,270
 Let's play one more time before we go to the beach. 

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,010
 Sir, if I'm hiding for too long... 

40
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,300
 if I don't come out even after the play is over, 

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,230
 please forget about me, then. 

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,300
 My Mountain God, whose face is as bright as the moon, 

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,400
 who speaks meanly but has kind eyes. 

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,180
 

45
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,400
 

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,780
 

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
 Sir... 

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,270
 if I'm hiding for too long... 

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,430
 if I don't come out even after the play is over, 

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,880
 please forget about me, then. 

51
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,580
Dong Cheol...

52
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,740
Woo Taek, do something.

53
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,200
My poor Dong Cheol.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,570
Dong Cheol...

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,200
Dong Cheol, look at me.

56
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,830
No...

57
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,740
No, Dong Cheol...

58
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,200
Dong Cheol!

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,510
 If you still haven't forgotten me, 

60
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,410
 then I will look for you, Sir. 

61
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,000
Found you.

62
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,370
 My Mountain God, whose face is as bright as the moon, 

63
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,430
 who speaks meanly 

64
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,730
 but has kind eyes. 

65
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,180
Mountain God ahjussi, who abandoned his home

66
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,500
and lives in a box.

67
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,800
You'll get punished if you keep being cheeky with your shamanic abilities.

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,050
That's me, isn't it?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,500
The name you once called so affectionately,

70
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
Cho Young.

71
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,890
No, I don't recall.

72
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,880
What if that memory resided within me?

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,210
Memories are shared between two people.

74
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,260
 Memories are shared between two people, 

75
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,890
 so would it not also be a great gift for me? 

76
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll find it.

77
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,660
That memory.

78
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,380
Past lives...

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,700
are just past lives.

80
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,330
You should live your life peacefully and smoothly.

81
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,340
I don't want to.

82
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,500
Why not?

83
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,460
You look like you're in pain.

84
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,230
 Do not be sick. 

85
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,580
 Your body and heart both... 

86
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,530
 Do not let even a hair on your body get hurt. 

87
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,900
I'm on your side, Mr. Lee.

88
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,620
I'll help you.

89
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,050
Don't come looking for me again.

90
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,600
If you come back, you'll be in real trouble.

91
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,910
There we go, there we go.

92
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,030
- That's right. Good boy.
- Good boy.

93
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,880
Oh, baby, be careful!

94
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,250
- Good job.
- It'll be all right.

95
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,410
- He weathered the storm last night.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,390
Dong Cheol!

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,690
Noona!

98
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,600
 
Why do you keep shivering?

99
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,740
I mean, my fur suddenly disappeared.

100
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Is that really Uncle?

101
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Yes, he's your uncle, Dong Cheol.

102
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,700
So suddenly? But how?

103
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,200
It's a miracle. Miracles really do exist.

104
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,300
Uncle! Uncle, I really thought you were going to die!

105
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,100
All of us were so scared.

106
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,800
- Noona.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,310
I'm hungry.

108
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,300
Oh, okay! You're hungry?

109
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,780
Here, Dong Cheol.

110
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,600
Whoa, Uncle!

111
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,310
You have to use your hand.

112
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,780
Here's a fork. Hold it and use this to stab a piece.

113
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,340
Aigoo. Yes, here, here. Poke it.

114
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,280
That's right!

115
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,080
Slowly, slowly.

116
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,100
- It's so delicious!
- Is it?

117
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,310
- Here. Drink the Coke, too.
 - Whoa! 

118
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,000
H-Hold on. Put down the fork

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,910
and hold this with your hand. There, there.

120
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,000
- What? What?
- What?

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,680
- It's so delicious!
- It's delicious?

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,700
Dong Cheol.

123
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,800
How did you turn back into a human?

124
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,650
Well...

125
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,950
I'm not sure.

126
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,400
H-He's not sure.

127
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Slow down, slow down.

128
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,900
- Ow!
 - Oh, it stings! 

129
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,510
What in the world happened?

130
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,400
Was there anything like this in the ancestors' record?

131
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm not sure.

132
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,420
I don't think I ever read it.

133
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,450
Unni and I will take a look.

134
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,100
Do you think it's like a final gift or something?

135
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,500
You know, a final gift before he dies-

136
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,700
Don't say something so unlucky!

137
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,600
Yes, Garam building 6, Dongdo Villa.

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,100
Building A, unit 306.

139
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,200
Okay, thank you! We'll send it right over!

140
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,310
- Pan Dong! One fried chicken.
- Okay!

141
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,100
It's time for Dong Cheol's walk.

142
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,500
Wait, Uncle! Uncle!

143
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,600
Uncle, sit down.

144
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,500
Uncle, these are your hands.

145
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,900
You have to use your hands. Use your hands.

146
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,900
Yoo Na, Hae Na. You grew up well.

147
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,630
You should find someone now.

148
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,500
And congrats to you on getting a boyfriend.

149
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,820
Uncle.

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,100
I wanted to ask you this even when I was sick.

151
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,400
- Where did you get this?
- This?

152
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,750
It reeks of a tiger.

153
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,100
The curse was lifted even without a kiss?

154
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,200
Do you think there's some sort of a secret?

155
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 

156
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,610
 

157
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,400
 

158
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,940
"Mountain God"?

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,700
It seemed like a letter about a curse.

160
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,300
But aren't Mountain Gods helpful to humans?

161
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,230
I'm almost home now. I'll call you right back.

162
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,100
Mr. Bo Gyeom.

163
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,700
Is Seo Won at home?

164
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,370
Yes.

165
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,290
It's nice going out with Seo Won, right? You look good together.

166
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,610
You already heard.

167
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,980
It's comfortable dating in human form, isn't it?

168
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,100
- Human form?
- Yes, human form.

169
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,630
You know, instead of dog form.

170
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

171
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,100
Geez...

172
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm the one who put it there.

173
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,440
The curse that turns you into a dog.

174
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,000
I-I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going inside.

175
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,500
Hae Na, you're home.

176
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,300
Will she believe me if I do this?

177
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,140
Who...

178
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,060
are you?

179
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't tell you that easily.

180
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,960
Take your time and think carefully about it.

181
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,950
You see...

182
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,000
I was beside you people

183
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,850
for a much longer time than you think.

184
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,010
Unni!

185
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,970
Unni, are you okay?

186
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,100
What the heck?

187
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,710
Go wash up.

188
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,100
Gosh, it's cold.

189
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,380
Guys, come at me!

190
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,910
Stop that! Stop it.

191
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,170
Come over here.

192
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,760
- Kids, do you want fish-shaped bread?
 - Yes! 

193
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,890
- Thank you.
- Sure.

194
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,200
- Enjoy. See you around.
 - Okay. 

195
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,150
 - Thank you!
- Goodbye! 

196
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,030
 You see, I was beside you people 

197
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,740
 for a much longer time than you think. 

198
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,500
I think it really is Hyung.

199
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,030
I couldn't believe it even after seeing it with my eyes. It doesn't make sense.

200
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,900
- How could this be real?
- Why do you think he placed the curse?

201
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,180
That's my question.

202
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,740
Why on us?

203
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,060
 

204
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,040
Looking for someone?

205
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,840
It's all right.

206
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,370
No wonder it reeked of fox.

207
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,900
A Mountain God tiger...

208
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,040
and a fox who stays by his side.

209
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
No...

210
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,360
The flint lady-

211
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,500
I mean, Min Ji Ah...

212
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,270
seems to remember you.

213
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,580
How would you know that?

214
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,060
Sorry?

215
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Well, since her shamanic abilities are exceptional.

216
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,900
If she regains all her memories, wouldn't that mean the return of the flint Lady?

217
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,300
If that's the case, there would be no reason for you to bother with getting revenge.

218
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,000
And you could return to the mountain...

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,100
The Mountain God she remembers...

220
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,670
isn't me.

221
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
What I'm saying is you should stop-

222
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,500
There's no turning back now.

223
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,100
Since I already started it.

224
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,180
Hyung.

225
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
What is this?

226
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,700
Wow, how long ago was this?

227
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,500
She has grown so much, hasn't she?

228
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,280
It seems like you two started dating recently.

229
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,430
Is it going well?

230
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
See you around, kiddo.

231
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,710
See you around, kiddo.

232
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,790
Hyung.

233
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,300
You'll find out soon.

234
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,400
Welcome! Please come this way.

235
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,800
Welcome! Please stand in line in the order you arrived.

236
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,130
Hello, hello.

237
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,300
Hello. Bok Sil, you're here? Come here.

238
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,800
Gosh, you got so big. Aigoo...

239
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,040
You made such a long trip,

240
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,000
so I brought you some potatoes and sweet potatoes. They're delicious.

241
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,600
Whoa, thank you!

242
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,800
You can't feed her too many sweet potatoes, ma'am.

243
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,600
- Bok Sil gained more weight than last year.
- Okay.

244
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,800
I trust you with all my heart, Doctor.

245
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,100
Bok Sil will become healthier as long as she goes on a diet.

246
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,500
- Let's go, Bok Sil.
- Good girl! Good girl.

247
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,000
By the way, Doctor.

248
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
Who's that young lady?

249
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,780
I brought this for you.

250
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,900
Oh, thank you! Please wait a moment.

251
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,500
- My friend.
- Not your girlfriend?

252
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,200
- You can eat it!
- No! No!

253
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,810
- Gosh.
- It's okay!

254
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,200
Gosh, Woo Taek!

255
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,100
I wondered where you always wandered off to every year.

256
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,370
Volunteer medical services?

257
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,790
I guess you're a bit cool.

258
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,600
Yeah.

259
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,200
You booked our return boat ride, right?

260
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,950
Yeah.

261
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,610
Huh?

262
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,400
Huh?

263
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,600
Excuse me! Are there any departing boats?

264
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,300
Oh, no. The last boat just left.

265
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,370
What?

266
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,800
What moron books a one-way ticket?

267
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,300
I-It wasn't intentional.

268
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,100
No more boats, and this room was the only one left.

269
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,800
Haven't you seen this before?

270
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,900
I have seen it happen a lot in dramas.

271
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,140
Woo Taek, I'll only hold your foot and sleep. Just your foot.

272
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,890
Then the female protagonist will go, "Oh, stop it!"

273
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,970
"Come on, oppa. I'll only hold your hand! Come here!"

274
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,500
- "Stop it! Oh, stop it!"
- "Come over here!"

275
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,500
Wait, hey!

276
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's have a beer! I'm going to the mart!

277
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,250
The fridge is out of beer.

278
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,800
- Hurry back.
- The mart should sell some.

279
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,700
Okay, see you soon!

280
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,230
- Your phone has been activated.
- Okay.

281
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,400
- Please take this, too.
- Aigoo, thank you!

282
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,800
Yes, thank you. Take care.

283
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,090
Happy?

284
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,300
Do you have anyone to call?

285
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,000
- You punk, don't tell me-
- W-What?

286
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,600
- You were going to call that woman, weren't you?
- I'm not.

287
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,520
Get it together, you punk!

288
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,900
Why still think about a woman who didn't lift your curse and left you?

289
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,600
- Hand it over!
- Why?

290
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,200
- Hand it over now!
- Geez, stop it!

291
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,320
You punk!

292
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,500
Stop right there!

293
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,600
Stop right there!

294
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,950
Dong Cheol!

295
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,740
Dong Cheol!

296
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,240
Yeah, Mom.

297
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,140
 Aigoo, Hae Na, what should we do? Your uncle... 

298
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,600
 Your uncle! 

299
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,000
Were you able to figure anything out?

300
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,990
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

301
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,550
Why are you doing this to my family?

302
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,940
Mak Soon.

303
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Deok Gu died along with Cho Young.

304
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,680
How are you still alive...

305
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,110
when even a dog dies along with its owner?

306
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,840
I am...

307
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,500
I am carrying a baby in my womb.

308
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,200
Did you bring swordsmen into my mountain for your child?

309
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,570
- No, I just-
- You abandoned your owner...

310
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,890
for the person you love?

311
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,570
This lowly body has no regrets,

312
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,490
but please save my child in my womb.

313
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,000
I will not swing my sword thoughtlessly.

314
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I cannot let it end so easily.

315
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,230
In return, that child...

316
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,000
Your sin will eventually find your child.

317
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,480
That cannot be...

318
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,400
That cannot be, Sir.

319
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,200
That child's child and the child of that child...

320
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,420
If your descendants have a lover and they kiss,

321
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,590
their appearance will turn into something that is not human.

322
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,740
They must be able to prove their outstanding love

323
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,260
in order to change back into a human.

324
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,790
My curse will pass down to generations, and they will not escape the cycle!

325
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,700
They shall ruminate their ancestor's sin

326
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,250
and ruminate again.

327
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,140
That cannot be.

328
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,000
That cannot be, Sir. That cannot be! That cannot be!

329
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,300
I'll lift the curse on your family.

330
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,800
On one condition.

331
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,350
You remember the day your curse started, right?

332
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,380
 Hey, Seo Won! It's cold outside. Wear this. 

333
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,000
 Mr. Lee. 

334
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,370
 Are you okay? 

335
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,350
 Hey, Seo Won. 

336
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,440
 You didn't forget about buying me a cake, right? 

337
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,550
You developed feelings for each other after that

338
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,890
and have ended up in love.

339
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,900
I'll turn things back to...

340
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,380
before all that happened.

341
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,690
Turn back?

342
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,230
Jin Seo Won's feelings.

343
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,570
I'll turn things back to the time...

344
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,810
before he had feelings for you.

345
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,710
Once his memories of you disappear,

346
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,520
Jin Seo Won will...

347
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,490
no longer like you.

348
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,700
Since I'm going to erase every ounce of his feelings for you.

349
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,870
Take your pick.

350
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,800
Between your family's curse

351
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,690
or that beautiful love of yours.

352
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,330
I'll give you one day.

353
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,300
What did you do to Ms. Hae Na?

354
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,300
Where's Ms. Hae Na right now?

355
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,900
How would I know that?

356
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,320
Stop lying!

357
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,120
I lost my one and only...

358
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,490
because of you two.

359
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,600
Wouldn't it be fair for you two to also pay the price?

360
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:45,610
Those warmhearted and beautiful memories you two shared...

361
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,650
I'm going to erase them all.

362
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,400
No.

363
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,350
You can't do anything.

364
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,220
Even if our memories disappear,

365
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,600
we'll still fall back in love.

366
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,680
All right, then.

367
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,820
♫  In your eyes  ♫

368
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,600
♫  I may be a dot smaller than a fingernail  ♫

369
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:54,680
♫  Even far away, even if you couldn't see me  ♫

370
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,140
♫  I was always shining down your side  ♫

371
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,710
 I'll turn things back to the time... 

372
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,890
 before he had feelings for you. 

373
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,110
 Take your pick. 

374
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,440
 Between your family's curse 

375
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,850
 or that beautiful love of yours. 

376
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,670
♫  It's okay even if you don't recognize me  ♫

377
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:35,760
♫  A nameless star, that's me  ♫

378
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,660
♫  I'll still shine from this spot every day  ♫

379
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,430
♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

380
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,010
♫  Your little star  ♫

381
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,530
I wanted to come here with you.

382
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,840
The ocean.

383
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,860
Me, too.

384
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,320
Save...

385
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,100
your uncle.

386
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,700
We can't leave him to die.

387
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,030
I...

388
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,800
liked you since the moment I first saw you.

389
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,590
It didn't seem like you liked me very much,

390
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,180
so I did fold pretty quickly.

391
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,980
But the trace remained, and

392
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,210
I kept thinking about you and kept looking at you.

393
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,590
That might be why...

394
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,870
I seemed cold at first.

395
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,210
I'm sorry.

396
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,410
Even if our memories get erased,

397
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,410
our feelings will still remain.

398
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,060
So I'll approach you.

399
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,530
If you take a step back, I'll just take two steps forward.

400
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,170
Even if I wander a bit,

401
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,320
it's a road I once took.

402
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,060
Open the door!

403
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,400
Young Master Soo Hyun has arrived!

404
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,400
Young Master Soo Hyun has arrived!

405
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,800
Young Master Soo Hyun is here.

406
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,610
Young Master is here again.

407
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,960
He's here.

408
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,150
- My Lady, be careful-
- Oh, my.

409
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,300
- Let's go that way.
- Okay.

410
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,800
- Mak Soon.
- Yes?

411
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,800
The weather is quite nice today.

412
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,720
Go have fun.

413
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,930
- You, there!
- Yes!

414
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,200
Young Master Soo Hyun?

415
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,720
Hello.

416
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,100
I will take my leave now.

417
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,020
Mak Soon.

418
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,900
Mak Soon!

419
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,000
The sun will set soon. Why are you going to town?

420
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,580
Leave it open.

421
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,800
What? Why?

422
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,070
Take the lead.

423
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Why is Mak Soon so upset that she will not even have dinner?

424
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,980
What brings you to come back here?

425
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,830
Why did you go inside like that earlier?

426
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,360
That Lady from earlier...

427
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,270
It seems like our families are discussing marriage.

428
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,310
Mak Soon...

429
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,080
even if I'm a poor village boy,

430
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,730
would you still like me?

431
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,960
Mak Soon...

432
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,770
come live somewhere far away with me.

433
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,620
Even if it's a bit colder

434
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,480
or a bit hotter,

435
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,520
even if we have to eat a little less,

436
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,470
let's weave wicker mats

437
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,840
and make straw shoes.

438
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,630
While talking gently...

439
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,660
and affectionately.

440
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,340
Somewhere no one will object,

441
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,600
no matter how affectionate I am with you.

442
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,480
Are you sleeping?

443
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,950
Do you know someone named Yi Wol Hwa?

444
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,430
He's the great-grandson of Grand Prince Eun Seong.

445
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,460
He might be from the collateral family, but he's still of the royal bloodline.

446
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,560
He was killed during the arrest process for treason today.

447
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,590
Yi Wol Hwa's wife...

448
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,430
is at this place for pregnancy care.

449
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,180
We will capture her immediately. So be aware.

450
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,440
Mak Soon!

451
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,480
Young Master-

452
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,620
Where is the Master?

453
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,650
He became the ambassador to the Qing Dynasty.

454
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,190
He left early yesterday.

455
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:15,870
The traitor, Yi Wol Hwa's wife, Lady Han! Come out and surrender yourself.

456
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:19,450
My Lady! My Lady, be careful.

457
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,870
Hurry and flee!

458
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,500
Mak Soon, take good care of Lady Han.

459
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,640
 - Aigoo!
- Get her! 

460
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,790
 Search every corner! 

461
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,070
Aigoo, aigoo!

462
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,000
Sir!

463
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,860
My Lady. My Lady!

464
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,870
 That way! Find them! 

465
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,200
You must be careful, My Lady.

466
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,120
Young Master, what are you...

467
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,100
Take care of the Lady first. I'll look into the situation.

468
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,000
Must you go?

469
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,780
There must be a way.

470
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,650
But...

471
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,580
Let's meet again.

472
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,720
Be safe.

473
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,450
Even with a mask...

474
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,500
did you think I wouldn't recognize your sword?

475
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,480
 Let's meet again. 

476
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,530
 Be safe. 

477
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,840
Please make sure Young Master is safe

478
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,940
and help My Lady get better.

479
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,940
And...

480
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,110
may this baby in my womb also...

481
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,790
Did something happen here?

482
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,540
Get going!

483
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,390
Have you heard any news about Young Master Soo Hyun?

484
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,950
No.

485
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:27,460
He would be overjoyed to hear about the baby you are carrying.

486
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,550
Have you thought about the baby's name?

487
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,190
If it's a son, I'll name him after Young Master.

488
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,310
And if it's a daughter,

489
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,810
I'll name her after you.

490
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,200
- My name?
- Yes.

491
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,870
I'll name her Cho Ah.

492
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,240
What a beautiful name.

493
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,990
Since you two are having this baby, the child will be beautiful, no matter who it takes after.

494
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,240
Eureka!

495
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,730
Okay.

496
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,870
Oh, that's cold! That's cold!

497
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,900
Whoa, that's too cold! I can't go back in there!

498
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,990
I'll just do it from here.

499
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,700
Geez.

500
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,910
But is it not too much?

501
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,360
How could you play all those games without me?

502
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,010
Well, you were busy yesterday.

503
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:35,120
Even so, all those fun games...

504
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,540
Geez, I got nothing.

505
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,080
Aigoo, aigoo!

506
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,600
Oh, right! About that flint lady.

507
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,590
The palace guards are still looking for the Lady

508
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,900
because of the baby of the dead royal family member, right?

509
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,200
They will demand her to hand over the baby if they catch her.

510
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,900
They will not believe her even if she tells them it died.

511
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,300
But I saw that girl in the village.

512
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,450
The flint Lady's female servant!

513
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,320
- You mean Mak Soon?
- Yes, Mak Soon. Mak Soon!

514
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,530
I think she was looking for something.

515
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,870
I heard she was looking for her lover.

516
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,080
He disappeared after he got swept into Cho Young's affair.

517
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,170
It seems like she's pregnant. It's probably her lover's child, right?

518
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,010
I assume so.

519
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:29,030
Is Mak Soon really a trustworthy kid?

520
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,670
She's Cho Young's best friend whom she grew up with

521
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,300
since they were young.

522
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,140
Even so,

523
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,970
you should not trust a pregnant mother so easily.

524
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,630
Who knows what she would do to protect her baby?

525
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:52,850
To put it bluntly, if she sells over the Lady along with her lover,

526
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,230
the two of them- No, including her kid, the three of them

527
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,580
can at least save themselves, right?

528
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:21,210
Sir, did Young Master Soo Hyun come to work today by chance?

529
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,010
Do you mean the Chief?

530
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,920
Yes.

531
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,570
Forget about work. He got caught helping a traitor flee

532
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,190
and I heard he will be beheaded tomorrow.

533
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,170
Sir.

534
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,050
Please allow me to meet Young Master just this once.

535
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,190
Gosh, if you get caught, my head is on the line.

536
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,680
Please, I beg of you.

537
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,500
Here.

538
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,840
Please take this and help me this once.

539
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,330
Before you helped her flee,

540
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,910
you must have arranged a shelter for her.

541
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,060
It is still not too late.

542
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,240
Tell me where Madam Han and that girl went.

543
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,610
That is your only way to live.

544
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,960
Are you really going to get dragged to the execution site like this tomorrow

545
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,780
and get your head cut off?

546
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,370
Where did you get this?

547
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,970
Some female servant came looking for you.

548
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:48,720
Where is she now? Is she safe?

549
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,440
She returned for now, but things do not look so good.

550
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,540
Young San, I need to get out of here.

551
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:05,680
That female servant looked pregnant.

552
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,360
Sir,

553
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:20,930
the three years of my mother's medicine you paid for...

554
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,380
This is how I will repay my debt to you.

555
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,420
Sir!

556
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,940
Please...

557
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,900
Please save Young Master Soo Hyun.

558
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,510
How dare a female servant enter this place?

559
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,170
Please!

560
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,470
I'll do whatever it takes.

561
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,750
Please save Young Master's life!

562
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,220
I...

563
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,330
I know Lady Cho Young's whereabouts.

564
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,900
If you are lying, you shall pay the consequences!

565
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,550
Where is she?

566
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,740
Tell me this instant.

567
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:44,900
   ​

568
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,050
 

569
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:54,720
 To my daughter Cho Ah. 

570
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,460
 My sin will find you. 

571
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,090
 To your child and your child's child... 

572
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,540
 When you and I... 

573
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,100
 and your child's child... 

574
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,920
♫  Even if you couldn't see me  ♫

575
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,990
 have forgotten everything, 

576
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:22,280
 the Mountain God's curse will find us. 

577
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,850
 The curse will find us without us even knowing 

578
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,310
 and make us lose... 

579
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,620
 something precious. 

580
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:43,040
♫  Among those countless stars, I am one of them  ♫

581
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,830
♫  It's okay even if you don't recognize me  ♫

582
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:56,730
♫  A nameless star, that's me  ♫

583
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:03,740
♫  I'll still shine from this spot every day  ♫

584
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,630
♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

585
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:12,440
♫  Your little star  ♫

586
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,400
 

587
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,700
 What happened? Weren't my memories supposed to be erased? 

588
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,370
 Isn't it up to me to decide whose memory to erase? 

589
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:28,740
 Ms. Han, is that true? Are you really dating Mr. Bo Gyeom? 

590
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,390
 Seo-Hae couple? This is my handwriting. 

591
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:36,060
 You spoke as if memories were trivial. Well, good luck. 

592
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,200
 I feel a bit weird these days. 

593
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,700
 I can't identify my own feelings. 

594
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,240
 Stop it. Everything you're doing. 

595
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,230
 Mr. Jin, what are you doing right now? 

596
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,980
 Do you realize now? 

597
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,980
 What was taken away from you exactly?
