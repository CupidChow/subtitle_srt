2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,550
 

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,020
 

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,700
 

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,510
 

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
 
 Mr. Jin, I no longer like Mr. Bo Gyeom. 

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,230
 Han Yoo Na's sister? Does he know his girlfriend is a monster? 

8
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,280
 "A woman who turns into a dog every night"? 

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,930
 He looks like a familiar face. 

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,230
 I'm a reporter. 

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,000
 I'd like to talk about this story on my channel. Please give me a reply. 

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,150
 My feelings have become so precious that I want to protect them. 

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,090
 But in order to protect them, I need to tell him now. But I'm so scared. 

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,810
 - Oh, Seo Won!
- We're not on terms to ask how we're doing, no? 

15
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,290
 Are you still sulking about what happened in the past? 

16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,210
 I saw your picture on the internet. Your girlfriend is so pretty. 

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,870
 Stop with the bullshit and leave. 

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,590
 - Are you sure it was here?
- Did someone take them in that short time? 

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,400
 I hid them carefully. 

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,770
 Which one of you is it? You'll play innocent? 

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,420
 Fine, I'll just wait until midnight then. 

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,360
 I knew it. Bring him here first thing tomorrow. 

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,160
 - Bring who?
- Who do you think? Her boyfriend! 

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,190
 I'm sorry, Mom. The man I kissed is someone else. 

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,750
 I was going to contact you separately. 

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,340
 There's something I want to tell you. 

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,340
 Oh, hold on! May I tell you something first? 

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,440
 Actually... 

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,740
 If it's hard to say, you don't have to. 

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,670
 What the? They go to the same school? 

31
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,800
 How should I catch this wild horse? 

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,770
 Hey, Yo Seob, let's do a job. 

33
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,110
 - What are you doing here?
- There's something here. 

34
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,050
 - What?
- I don't know. I feel some sort of presence. 

35
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,690
 Can you unlock this? 

36
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,240
 I'll ask Mr. Bo Gyeom. 

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,180
 - Mr. Lee.
- This isn't fun. Let's go. 

38
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,210
 Girls, what did that man say to you? 

39
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,890
 He asked about Ms. Hae Na. 

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,390
 How did you know to find me here? 

41
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,460
 Don't ever come to our school again. 

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,640
 I wasn't there to see you. I was there to see your girlfriend. 

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,470
 If you ever appear in front of me again, I won't sit back. 

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,410
 You only have a few days left now. 

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,940
 - I'll have to confess.
- Is he someone you can trust? 

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,420
 What color do you think I change into? 

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,750
 Whichever color it is, you'll be pretty. 

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,790
 If it's him, I think it'll be fine. 

49
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,980
 I'm scared that you might go through the same thing I did. 

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,100
 Please give my daughter a proper kiss. 

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,700
 Whoa. This was for real? 

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,600
 Hi, I'm the reporter who contacted you last time. 

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,130
 Do you happen to have any videos? I'd like to buy them from you. 

54
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,900
 Why are you so bent on exposing them by even using this much money? 

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,300
 It just seems like fun. 

56
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
 Yeah... 

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,600
 
 You have one week left. 

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,900
 Did you talk to him at school? 

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
 No, I've been avoiding him. 

60
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 Han Hae Na, what are you planning to do? 

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
 I don't know. 

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
 Ask him to meet you today. 

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 I can't. 

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,700
 Are you going to wait until you're hanging off the cliff? 

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,200
 I'm so scared of what he'll think of me. 

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
 I understand what you're feeling, 

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
 but you really don't have much time, Hae Na. 

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,900
 He only now started smiling at me. 

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,290
 I feel like everything between us will crumble. 

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,800
 We can only trust that he's a good person. 

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
 You also trusted that man. 

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 You should just trust him, too. 

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,200
 I despise that bastard, but I don't regret trusting him. 

74
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,710
 Unni, 

75
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,620
 I must really be turning into a dog. 

76
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,140
 One that keeps waiting for him 

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,800
 and feels happy when he looks at me... 

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,800
 My heart pounds when he calls my name. 

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,700
 One that wishes for nothing more 

80
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,080
 than being loved by him. 

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,200
 A puppy like that. 

82
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,620
 Try imagining this is our house. 

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,180
 The most comfortable and 

84
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,210
 safest place in the world. 

85
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,740
Ms. Han!

86
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,100
 What color do you think I change into? 

87
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,590
 Whichever color it is, 

88
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,310
 you'll be pretty. 

89
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,940
Ms. Han!

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,600
Ms. Hae Na!

91
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,630
What the?

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,300
- Dad?
- Hae Na!

93
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,700
Dad?

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,430
I'm sorry!

95
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,620
I thought a suspicious person was following Ms. Han. I misunderstood.

96
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,000
Dad, were you following me?

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,660
No, I was just trying to surprise you.

98
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,900
- Is he the one?
- Huh?

99
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,800
I heard everything from your mom.

100
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,910
Young man, what's the reason you keep dragging this out?

101
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,200
Dad! No.

102
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,920
Hurry up and take my daughter!

103
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,600
- When a man makes up his mind-
- Dad, stop!

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
- Be a man! Make her yours-
- Take care, sir!

105
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Sorry, Mr. Jin! Today won't work out.

106
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,500
- I'll see you tomorrow at school.
- Hurry and take my daughter!

107
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,700
- He's handsome!
- Gosh, Dad!

108
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,430
He doesn't know anything about the curse.

109
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,700
What?

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,000
What should we do?

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
How did this happen?

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
It just ended up like that.

113
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,100
Anyway, I'll take care of it, so don't worry too much.

114
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
I need to be honest with him and lift the curse.

115
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,700
My puppy...

116
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,430
I told you not to call me a puppy.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,850
My daughter...

118
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,800
it's hard, isn't it?

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,960
I think it was a few days after I met your mom.

120
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,620
I kept pestering her to marry me without a second thought.

121
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,600
But your mom wasn't even fazed.

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,130
She sat up straight and just silently stared at me.

123
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,310
So, I asked her what's wrong,

124
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,550
and she told me about the curse.

125
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,100
I didn't believe her at first.

126
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,820
No, I couldn't believe her.

127
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,700
Honestly, I was a bit scared.

128
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,820
This is between you and me,

129
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,100
but I also thought about running away.

130
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,760
But you know...

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,130
that's when I saw your mom's hands.

132
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,700
She was sitting up so proudly,

133
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,700
but her hands were shaking on top of her knees.

134
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,500
So...

135
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,400
I held her hands.

136
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,340
This woman might've been struck by a fearsome curse,

137
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,620
but that didn't make her scary.

138
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,300
She was probably more scared than I was.

139
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,890
Scared that people might point their fingers at her and say gross,

140
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,100
and afraid that I might leave her.

141
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,530
How could I run away and leave a woman alone

142
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,100
when she's shaking in fear?

143
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,720
Would he also...

144
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,920
think of me the same way you did?

145
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,650
Of course!

146
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,900
He seemed like a good person.

147
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,560
Oh, he wasn't as strong as me, though.

148
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,190
So...

149
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,510
don't worry too much.

150
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,650
He's going to...

151
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,660
trust in you, too.

152
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,200
All I hope for...

153
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,960
is for the weight to be lifted off your heart as soon as possible.

154
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,660
That's the only thing I hope for.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,900
Sweetheart,

156
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,400
congratulations on your first kiss.

157
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,700
Huh?

158
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,860
It was fine before!

159
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,300
What is this? Oh, my!

160
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,200
 I'm sorry about earlier. 

161
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,400
 I couldn't even properly say goodbye because I was out of sorts. 

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,730
 Did you get home safely? 

163
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,700
 I'm fine... 

164
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,900
 since I got to see you briefly. 

165
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
 See you tomorrow at school. 

166
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,100
 Come here tonight at 11:00 p.m., Ms. Han Hae Na. 

167
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,430
Unni!

168
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,340
Unni!

169
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,480
- What do I do?
- Why?

170
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,280
What is it?

171
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
You can't even guess who it might be?

172
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,980
Let's think about this calmly.

173
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,800
How could they have gotten Hae Na's number?

174
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,450
That's a piece of cake for people like them.

175
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You really didn't see anyone when you ran away that time?

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Did they see you turn into a dog?

177
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,700
To be honest, I couldn't check properly because I was in a rush.

178
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,600
If they're simply a witness, why would they call you out

179
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,200
at this hour?

180
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,820
Money?

181
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,600
Or are they trying to take a video of you like that bastard, Sang Su?

182
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,120
Let's first go and see.

183
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,100
We need to find out who it is and how much they know.

184
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,630
It's okay. We'll take care of everything.

185
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,600
Don't worry. This oppa will protect you.

186
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,800
Here!

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
That's yours, right?

188
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,200
You oddly don't smell like a dog.

189
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,610
Oh, right.

190
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,290
This is the most popular handmade dog chew these days. Have a bite.

191
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,100
What is it you want to say to me?

192
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,360
Jin Seo Won, that bastard must not know yet.

193
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,500
Seeing how you're still cursed.

194
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,100
Who the hell are you? Why are you doing this to me-

195
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,600
Why does that matter? Does that change anything?

196
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Oh, I will tell you why, though.

197
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,800
Why do you think? It's all about money these days.

198
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,200
Why should I give you money?

199
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,980
Then you must be okay with me sharing all the video clips I took.

200
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,000
I really took everything.

201
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,400
Go ahead and share them. No one will believe you anyway.

202
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,760
You're wrong. It's pretty believable.

203
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,220
Let's see...

204
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,010
Here it is.

205
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,010
I sent it to you. Take a look.

206
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,740
 You'll really lift the curse for me today, right? 

207
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,600
 Oppa, I really don't have much time left. 

208
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,500
I'll tell you my plan from here on out.

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm going to start by sharing all the videos I have.

210
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,750
Then I'll call out that bastard, Jin Seo Won, and show them to him in person

211
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,400
and tell him everything.

212
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Imagine how funny his expression will be. His girlfriend turns into a dog.

213
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,000
After I record his expression, I'll release real dogs.

214
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,100
You know how f***ing scared he is of dogs, right?

215
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll tell him right when he's shaking in fear.

216
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,380
"Hey...

217
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,900
Hey, bastard!

218
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,800
Your girlfriend is one of those dogs, you bastard!"

219
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,490
Gosh, that's going to be so funny.

220
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,290
Of course, it's only a plan for now.

221
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,300
And it's something I can cancel, depending on your sincerity.

222
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,700
How much do you want?

223
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,140
Empty out your bank account, your sister's account,

224
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,100
your parent's account, your friend's account,

225
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,980
and even your friend's parent's bank account in cash and bring it to me.

226
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,310
I'll make my decision after I see the amount.

227
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,800
Bring it here tomorrow by 11:55 p.m.

228
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
Okay?

229
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,000
Bye for now.

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
Oh, and...

231
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,950
don't bring those idiots tomorrow.

232
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,300
You should hide properly. What's with that?

233
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,970
Hae Na!

234
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,530
Hae Na.

235
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,600
- Are you okay?
- Damn it.

236
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,400
Are you okay?

237
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,720
Unni, what should I do?

238
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,580
- Shit...
- What's with Big Chin?

239
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,200
I've seen him somewhere before.

240
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,550
Sang Su, that son of a bitch...

241
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,400
had a video all along.

242
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,460
What's wrong?

243
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
Mom...

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,600
 

245
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,000
 I opened my eyes after kissing her 

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,900
 and a dog was sitting in front of me. 

247
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,800
 I couldn't believe it at first, either. 

248
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,250
 Have you ever heard of a person turning into a dog before? 

249
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,600
 I'm going to deliver some unbelievable news soon. 

250
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,500
 Would you believe there's a woman who's a teacher by day 

251
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,520
 and dog by night? See you tomorrow. 

252
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,300
Aigoo, that Sang Su, that pile of dog poop!

253
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,520
Let's think about this calmly, Honey. Calmly.

254
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,600
How can I be calm in this situation?

255
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,300
We don't know anything for sure, Ma'am.

256
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,350
That blackmailing YouTuber seems to have

257
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,500
bought the video from that bastard, Sang Su.

258
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,660
I should've torn him to pieces back then!

259
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,600
I should've torn that bastard to pieces back then!

260
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,300
Why are you sorry? Be quiet. Don't cry.

262
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
 I'm sorry. 

263
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,800
Stop with the feeble nonsense.

264
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,100
Everyone take the day off tomorrow.

265
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,600
We have a group reservation-

266
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:22,300
â™«  It feels like forever  â™«

267
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:30,910
â™«  I'm dreaming of never  â™«

268
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:40,350
â™«  The closer I get, it feels far away  â™«

269
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:49,730
â™«  When I'm with you, I lose track of time again  â™«

270
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:57,840
â™«  Will you be thinking of me?  â™«

271
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:08,800
â™«  Days are too far apart with you  â™«

272
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Mr. Seo Won, are you looking for something?

273
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,650
No.

274
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
Did Ms. Han not come to work?

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,580
She took a sick day today.

276
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,200
Why?

277
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,050
Is she sick?

278
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,080
Oh, you must have a question for Hae Na, huh?

279
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,470
No.

280
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,910
Jun Seo, why didn't you turn in your cell phone?

281
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,100
I will after I feed Cocoa.

282
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,190
What?

283
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,600
You know who, Mr. Jin.

284
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,130
Cocoa.

285
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,430
Why the counseling room all of a sudden?

286
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,320
Aren't you eating lunch?

287
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,700
Yul.

288
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,690
What's with the serious mood?

289
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,830
Is Cocoa doing well?

290
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,050
O-Of course, she is.

291
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,890
But Yul...

292
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,570
Jun Seo was feeding Cocoa with his phone earlier.

293
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,210
W-Why is he feeding her with his phone?

294
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,640
Be honest.

295
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,030
I'm always honest with you, Uncle.

296
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,740
Where's...

297
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,250
Cocoa from, and who's her owner?

298
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,520
You see...

299
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,700
It really is Jun Seo's dog.

300
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,000
Her name just overlaps with a game character.

301
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,560
Is that so?

302
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,830
Of course. What were you thinking?

303
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,680
All right. Go and eat.

304
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,450
- What about you?
- I have somewhere to go.

305
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,670
 I heard you caught a cold. 

306
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,890
 I left some porridge at your door. 

307
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,180
 Rest up and get well soon. 

308
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,140
Eat up.

309
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,890
Why is this happening to you, too?

310
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,660
That person wouldn't seek out Mr. Jin, would he?

311
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,760
- I should go before he-
- No!

312
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,470
Just worry about yourself for now.

313
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,230
What will you do if you go out and get harassed?

314
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,240
Unni, why are you crying?

315
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,700
I'm sorry.

316
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,800
What are you sorry for?

317
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,900
It's my fault.

318
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,130
If it didn't end like that

319
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,260
with Sang Su,

320
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,640
it wouldn't have turned out this way.

321
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,260
No, Unni. This isn't your fault.

322
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,340
You don't need to feel bad about anything.

323
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm the one who's sorry. I should've been careful.

324
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,530
I'm sorry, Unni.

325
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,100
You shouldn't be sorry.

326
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,940
You're the one who shouldn't be sorry.

327
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,170
I'm more sorry.

328
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,850
Shit.

329
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,140
Damn it!

330
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,090
Time to empty my wallet again.

331
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,680
Oh, shit!

332
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,640
Sang Su, how have you been?

333
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,740
How in the world did you find me here?

334
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,110
I said I will find you and then kill you!

335
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,410
- Me, too!
 - Didn't I say I'd find you wherever you are? 

336
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,550
Don't you remember me?

337
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,540
- I don't know English!
- You punk!

338
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,400
Open the door right now!

339
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,690
I'm going to call the police!

340
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,350
Damn it!

341
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,870
An illegal gambler is going to call the police?

342
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,730
The Leith police dismisseth us.*
(Korean tongue twister containing the word "police")

343
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,060
He must be crazy!

344
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,560
Sang Su, what did I say I'd do if you showed up in front of me again?

345
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,890
You came looking for me.

346
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,230
Oh, my!

347
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,750
You made my beautiful first daughter's heart bleed

348
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,500
and now you stab my cute second daughter in the back?

349
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,660
Father!

350
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,110
Who are you calling, father?

351
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,140
Ahjussi?

352
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,270
I ought to karate chop you!

353
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,500
- Damn it!
- No, no, no...

354
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,130
Tell me where it is this instant.

355
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,280
Wherever that bastard, Eun Hwan, lives or works.

356
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,200
How should I know that?

357
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,020
I don't know. I'm telling the truth!

358
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,700
Really?

359
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,960
All right. You'll find out soon.

360
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,130
Woo Taek?

361
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,660
I won't kill you.

362
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,760
I'll anesthetize you, too.

363
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,200
Don't be scared. It'll be over soon.

364
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,890
Our Woo Taek here has done 38,000 cases of neutering. Right?

365
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,260
- 70,000 cases.
- Good job.

366
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,810
He fled?

367
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,420
Oh, my gosh!

368
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,190
You're no match for us.

369
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,690
Aren't you tired, Sang Su?

370
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,980
What a perfect weather for jogging.

371
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,860
Aigoo, aigoo! What will you do?

372
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,400
What? Are you tired already?

373
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,700
Honey, begin.

374
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,760
Huh? Gosh!

375
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,390
What are you doing?

376
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,010
Stay still.

377
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,310
- There.
- Woo Taek?

378
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,200
Let's see...

379
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,300
There's nothing in there. I'm serious!

380
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,200
- Seriously!
- Shut up!

381
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,760
- I got the address.
- You got it?

382
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,180
Okay, you punk.

383
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,600
You...

384
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,630
Help me out.

385
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,380
Hey, isn't he that guy from before?

386
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,630
Oh, that reporter?

387
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,400
I think that really is our school. The wall is the same!

388
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,760
Exactly! And that's the gym.

389
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,740
 - Have you ever heard of a person turning into a dog before? 
- No way!

390
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,690
Don't try to know too much.

391
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,770
- Didn't he ask about Ms. Han Hae Na?
- Yes! That looks just like her!

392
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,870
 - I'm going to deliver some unbelievable news soon. 
- How scary...

393
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,100
- Mr. Jin, look! Isn't that him?
 - Would you believe... 

394
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,200
- That really is our school!
 - there's a woman who's a teacher by day 

395
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,350
 and dog by night? 

396
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,900
I'm going to deliver some unbelievable news soon.

397
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,680
Would you believe there's a woman who's a teacher by day

398
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,010
 and dog by night? 

399
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,690
Kang Eun Hwan, open the door!

400
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,000
Hey.

401
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,180
What the hell are you doing here?

402
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,670
You are trespassing-

403
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,310
I told you, didn't I?

404
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,560
I said I will not let you be.

405
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,200
If you won't let me be, what are you going to do, crazy bastard!

406
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,370
What the hell is up with him?

407
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,250
He's f***ing fast!

408
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,070
Gosh.

409
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,570
I'm so tired.

410
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,940
Hey,

411
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,940
I'm going to lose weight because of you, bastard.

412
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,660
Do you remember where this is?

413
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,560
I'll remind you.

414
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,930
Hey!

415
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,050
Hurry up and come out!

416
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,400
 

417
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,410
Anyone there?

418
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,390
Is anyone there?

419
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,610
- Anyone there?
- Is anyone there?

420
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,320
- What's all this?
- Gosh, what was this guy doing in here?

421
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,180
T-This crazy bastard!

422
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,340
This is Hae Na's!

423
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,980
- Honey!
- Huh?

424
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,400
- Hurry up and come over here.
- Y-Yes.

425
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,090
- Look at this. This crazy bastard.
- W-What is this?

426
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,130
Honey, kill this computer.

427
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,770
I got it!

428
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,770
What are you doing right now?

429
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,860
Wait, this thing won't budge.

430
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,320
I told you to kill this computer!

431
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,650
I got it!

432
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,510
- The bag!
- The bag.

433
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,070
Here.

434
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,470
- There.
- W-Whoa.

435
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,750
- There!
- A-Aigoo.

436
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,820
- Hold it!
- Y-Yes, I got it.

437
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,390
Why on Earth are you going this far?

438
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,340
Because she's family.

439
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,510
You're not even her family.

440
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,140
Jin Seo Won, long time no see.

441
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,610
Looks like you remember now.

442
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,260
You always got beat up powerlessly whenever you were brought here, right?

443
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,170
Hey, he's still the same.

444
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,440
Come on, continue what you were doing. You had pretty good fists.

445
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,990
Hey, continue what you were doing!

446
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,440
I thought you were a martial artist or something.

447
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,630
How dare he fight with his fists in this day and age.

448
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,940
Aigoo, Soon Ja, good job.

449
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,660
Shit.

450
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,550
Gosh.

451
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,200
Why is he so heavy?

452
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,330
Good job.

453
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,190
Hey, by the way,

454
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,580
why are you going this far on Jin Seo Won?

455
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,190
Who knows?

456
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,280
It's annoying.

457
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,620
Hey.

458
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,200
You're supposed to teach your dog what happens when he bites his owner.

459
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,760
Right?

460
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,100
Look at her. How nice is she?

461
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,400
Aigoo, good girl.

462
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,790
Let's see.

463
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,590
Look at this, look!

464
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,850
Damn it.

465
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,670
You bloody lunatic!

466
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,750
There, there.

467
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm sure this isn't everything from Kang Eun Hwan, that evil bastard!

468
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,360
You'll have to bring me his phone, okay?

469
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,790
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

470
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,360
Call Kang Eun Hwan right now and

471
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,200
lure him out here, okay?

472
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,160
- You better answer him.
- Yes!

473
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,950
Hurry up and get to it!

474
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,830
Put him on speaker.

475
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,230
 Hello? 

476
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,020
Hyungnim, where are you?

477
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,710
I'm taking care of business outside. Why?

478
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,180
Hyungnim, I think you need to go home right now.

479
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,330
Why? What's wrong?

480
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,430
Someone broke into my house and took everything.

481
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,790
 It looks like... 

482
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,150
that woman, Han Hae Na's family, did it.

483
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,440
The same thing happened before, too.

484
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,290
 To find her sister's video. 

485
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,520
Wait, so what are you telling me to do?

486
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,430
H-Hyungnim, I just received a picture.

487
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,880
 I think it's your home. 

488
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,420
What?

489
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,090
Wait, hang up for a second.

490
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,630
These bloody crazy maniacs!

491
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,370
Damn!

492
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,720
 
 

493
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,510
 Hey. 

494
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,480
 Come to last night's spot right now. 

495
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,240
 If you don't, I'll kill this asshole, okay? 

496
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,060
And you better come alone this time.

497
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,950
I won't tell you twice.

498
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,970
Hey, watch him carefully.

499
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,360
If he tries anything funny, let her go, okay?

500
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,790
- These f***ing assholes.
- W-Wait.

501
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,520
How long am I supposed to stay like this?

502
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,650
How long would it be? It's until I come back, asshole.

503
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,850
Gosh, stop hitting my head.

504
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,310
Hey, hey, hey!

505
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,040
Since when did you talk back to me?

506
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,070
Hold onto him tightly.

507
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,670
Okay.

508
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,610
Hey.

509
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,350
You know what will happen if you talk, right?

510
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,780
Huh?

511
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,660
Okay, good.

512
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,530
Hello, everyone. It's Hwan.

513
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,990
Today is finally here.

514
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,120
None of my viewers believed me until now.

515
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,650
I completely understand.

516
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,470
I also didn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.

517
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,820
Those of you watching this video today,

518
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,700
something unbelievable will happen.

519
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,420
How in the world is this possible?

520
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,400
A human that turns into a dog actually exists!

521
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,590
Let me introduce that person. This is her!

522
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Please introduce yourself.

523
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, this woman who turns into a dog is a bit shy and timid.

524
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,050
Yes, she's a teacher. She is a teacher.

525
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,930
She is a teacher,

526
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:50,800
but it's too much to expose her identity here.

527
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,300
She is a high school Korean Language teacher. That's all I'll tell you.

528
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,220
Now...

529
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,500
Hey,

530
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,310
you're still scared of dogs?

531
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,390
You're like a little kid.

532
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,830
My goodness.

533
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,400
You live a difficult life.

534
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,490
It's hard for you, too, isn't it?

535
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,110
What?

536
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,850
You're no different from that dog.

537
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,840
Leashed by Eun Hwan.

538
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,660
What, you bastard?

539
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,980
You can, at least...

540
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,300
undo that leash yourself.

541
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,500
You see, this woman will

542
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,750
turn into a dog at midnight.

543
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,800
Human by day, dog by night.

544
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,120
Not those crabs* that walk sideways.
(Same sound as dog in Korean)

545
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,940
We are talking about dogs that bark and go "woof."

546
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:18,880
Duckmouth, thank you for the donation, and I'll give you a thumbs up.

547
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,540
Wait a second.

548
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,910
Will she turn into a dog even when I kiss her?

549
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,230
That is a really smart question.

550
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,890
Well, I'm not sure.

551
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,660
I'm suddenly getting curious about that, too.

552
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,020
Everyone,

553
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,030
in that case,

554
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,490
I'll try kissing her.

555
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,400
Ms. Han, are you okay?

556
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,030
Ms. Han.

557
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,620
Ms. Han!

558
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,380
Ms. Hae Na!

559
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,660
Ms. Hae Na!

560
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,570
Ms. Hae Na!

561
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,980
Ms. Han!

562
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,130
Ms. Han!

563
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,360
One moment, please.

564
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,200
Stay away for a moment, please.

565
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,110
I'm sorry.

566
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,250
I was really going to tell you everything.

567
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,400
I'm sure it was shocking

568
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,270
and unpleasant for you.

569
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,680
I'm sure you might even hate me now.

570
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,500
Because...

571
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,520
Because I'm such a weird woman.

572
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,530
I'm scared of dogs.

573
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,440
I avoid and run away when I encounter dogs on the street.

574
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,610
Do you find me...

575
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,600
weird for being this way?

576
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,740
Are you shocked and feel unpleasant?

577
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,300
No.

578
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,530
Tell me now, then.

579
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,030
Your secret, Ms. Han.

580
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:21,180
I know I shouldn't hear it from Kang Eun Hwan, that bastard.

581
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,330
I'll not stand for it.

582
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:34,870
â™«  Days are too far apart with you  â™«

583
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,550
I...

584
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,040
Whenever it's dawn...

585
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,840
When it's dawn...

586
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,030
During dawn, I...

587
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,240
I-I can't tell you.

588
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,400
I want to.

589
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:09,400
â™«  The closer I get, it feels far away  â™«

590
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,080
â™«  When I'm with you, I lose track of time again  â™«

591
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,740
I do want to get closer...

592
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,800
to Cocoa.

593
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:35,140
â™«  Days are too far apart with you  â™«

594
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,190
 I like you, Mr. Jin. 

595
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,290
 Do I look like a pickled radish? 

596
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,910
 Yes. 

597
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:55,530
â™«  Thinking back to our time spent together  â™«

598
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,220
 Mr. Jin, I'm sorry! 

599
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,090
 I'm late for class. 

600
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,550
 Mr. Jin... 

601
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,750
 when you want to cry, 

602
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,320
 it's okay to cry a little. 

603
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:20,800
â™«  In case I was the only one who knew  â™«

604
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,070
â™«  I didn't know what to do, and all I did was worry  â™«

605
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,200
 Are you okay? 

606
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,770
â™«  I liked everything when I thought of you  â™«

607
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,110
 If it's really you, 

608
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,000
 I won't be scared. 

609
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,930
â™«  My heart used to race  â™«

610
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,670
â™«  I couldn't hide my feelings  â™«

611
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:54,270
â™«  You were love to me  â™«

612
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:59,280
â™«  I found out only now  â™«

613
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,100
â™«  That made my heart flutter out of nowhere  â™«

614
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:18,500
â™«  You were like spring rain in my imagination  â™«

615
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,760
 If your children have a lover and they kiss, 

616
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,970
 their appearance will turn into something that is not human. 

617
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,590
 They must be able to prove their outstanding love 

618
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,700
 in order to change back into a human. 

619
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,940
Where did those assholes go?

620
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,610
Hey, where are you going?

621
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,450
Who the hell are you?

622
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,400
You should know when to stop.

623
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,650
You're also with them, huh?

624
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,190
W-Whoa, what the f-f***?

625
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,030
It's over now.

626
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,620
You'll forget about everything.

627
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,770
Where is this place?

628
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,290
Where am I?

629
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,570
W-Where am I?

630
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,750
M-My phone!

631
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,400
What the? What the hell?

632
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,920
Young Lady, be careful! Aigoo.

633
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,020
Aigoo, you will hurt yourself!

634
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,950
God of Mountain, h-have...

635
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:39,070
Right! Have you had a good night?

636
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:43,510
Please put this to good use when you are bored.

637
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,000
Now, then, I will come again next time.

638
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,180
Aigoo, aigoo!

639
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,890
Aigoo, you are so fast!

640
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,730
Young Lady!

641
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,960
Wait for me!

642
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,320
 Mountain Spirit, thank you for saving 

643
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,600
 my mother, who was almost bitten to death by the wolves. 

644
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,910
 Mountain Spirit, 

645
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,190
 have you been well? 

646
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,920
I have been away so far because my father was appointed as

647
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,070
Ahsan's governor.

648
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,460
Why are you giving me such a useless thing?

649
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,950
Who are you?

650
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,570
Mountain Spirit...

651
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,180
I am quite close to him.

652
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,650
Gosh, rice cake would have been better.

653
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,250
Give it back.

654
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,900
I gave it to the Mountain Spirit so he can float it when he is sick.

655
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,420
And if he does?

656
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,980
I can see this mountain from my house.

657
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,150
So I will come running.

658
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,510
When will Mountain Spirit ever fall sick, and how?

659
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:20,550
His heart could be in pain.

660
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,410
What is your name?

661
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,000
My name is Cho Yeon.

662
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,350
 
Mr. Jin.

663
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,910
I'm sorry.

664
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,220
I lied to you,

665
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,430
bothered you to undo my curse,

666
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,320
and clung to you like a leech.

667
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,610
You won't cling to me anymore?

668
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,260
Will you ignore me since you became human?

669
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,750
Nope.

670
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,110
I'll totally cling to you.

671
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,210
I won't let go of you now.

672
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,880
Ms. Han.

673
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,640
I like you.

674
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,150
Do you really like me when I'm weird like this?

675
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,840
You're the one who told me this.

676
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,400
Neither of us are weird people.

677
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,000
We're just those types of people.

678
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,440
Mr. Jin.

679
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,070
By the way...

680
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,380
The kiss.

681
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:05,000
Can we do it one more time?

682
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,800
As a human to another human.

683
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,270
But wait.

684
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,860
Won't you turn into a dog when you kiss?

685
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,710
Nope.

686
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,490
With the person who lifted your curse,

687
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,870
you can kiss them 100 or 1,000 times without changing.

688
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,230
100 or 1,000 times, huh?

689
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:42,170
   â€‹

690
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:51,490
â™«  I miss you whenever and wherever  â™«

691
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:55,790
â™«  It's really a weird thing  â™«

692
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:00,300
â™«  When you look at me  â™«

693
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:07,570
â™«  It feels like the whole world is closing in on me  â™«

694
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:10,330
â™«  Step by step, closer to you  â™«

695
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:13,820
â™«  Should I get closer to you?  â™«

696
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:17,530
â™«  I won't let go of you  â™«

697
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:23,590
â™«  Someday, sometime, someone, that's you  â™«

698
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:28,680
â™«  I like that we've become "us"  â™«

699
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,470
â™«  Someday, that day, full of love  â™«

700
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:41,350
â™«  I want to stay with you forever  â™«

701
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:45,300
 

702
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:49,230
 Those teachers were kissing at school and were caught by the students. 

703
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:52,290
 Complaints about them reached even the Board of Education. 

704
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:56,570
 Was their love so overflowing that they had to act like that at school? 

705
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:01,090
 Aigoo, it's been over 100 years since my romantic cells died out. 

706
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:03,230
 Why is my face on the wall? 

707
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,970
 Are those memories mine, too? 

708
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,590
 Yul's not home? 

709
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,370
 He said he'll sleep over at a friend's house.&lt;/ 

710
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,530
 Now that I think about it, we're not at school. 

711
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:16,060
 We can do whatever we want.
