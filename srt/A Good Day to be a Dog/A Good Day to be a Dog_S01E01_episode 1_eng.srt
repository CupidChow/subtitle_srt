1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:10,280
   ​

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,620
 

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,040
 

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,790
 

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,730
 

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,160
 Our family has an unusual secret. 

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,570
 I think someone once said, "There are no bad dogs in the world." 

8
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,380
Unni.

9
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,910
 
I won't be able to kiss now?

10
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,740
 Only... 

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,910
 bad curses exist. 

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
 

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,620
Hae Na!

14
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,110
Hae Na! Hae Na, come on!

15
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,880
Hurry up!

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,990
We're here!

17
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,720
Ta-da!

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,720
Hae Na, happy one-year anniversary.

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,370
- I'm so jealous!
- Thank you, Oppa.

20
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,890
Hey, you even passed the certification exam. You should just live together.

21
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,590
 Oh, my! 

22
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,760
 The cake is shaped like lips. 

23
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,750
- Congratulations!
- Congrats.

24
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,610
We're probably the only couple to have the first kiss on their one-year anniversary.

25
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,930
 What? 

26
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,800
 Did he say, "Kiss"? 

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,780
 Gosh! What do I do? 

28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,560
 This one's going to be tough to get out of. 

29
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,970
What the heck?

30
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,920
Oppa, I'm sorry!

31
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,900
 Once again, this is how my relationship ended. 

32
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,940
 

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,870
 

34
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,880
 

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,150
- Hello.
- Ms. Hae Na!

36
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,240
Oh, hi.

37
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,370
 Daebak! 

38
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,970
 Jun Woo sunbae's getting married! 

39
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,430
 Hey, Hae Na's in this chat, too. 
 -  I know. 

40
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,200
 Hae Na, you're okay, right? 

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
 - I'm okay-
- Why wouldn't she be okay? 

42
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,760
 Hae Na, I'm really worried about you. 

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,900
 Will you grow old and die alone? 

44
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,130
 What can she do about her extremely high standards? 

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,640
 - That's not the-
- Anyway, who's the bride? 

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,520
 The bride looks familiar. 

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,600
 Who wants to drink tonight? 

48
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
 Sorry, I'm watching a movie with Oppa tonight. 

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,780
 It's my one-year anniversary today! This is what I'm getting. 

50
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,000
 Sorry, I also have plans today. 

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,500
These traitors.

52
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,510
Hey, kids!

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,590
 

54
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,620
 Hello. 

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,300
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

56
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,580
He's so handsome.

57
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,150
Hey, girls.

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,180
Here.

59
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,760
Today's our first day, then.

60
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,200
Today's the 24th.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,270
What? You want a calendar?

62
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,730
Out!

63
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,870
 

64
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,980
Hello.

65
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,210
Guys, do you see this?

66
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,600
My love for you guys is starting to crack...

67
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,720
down the middle.

68
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,120
Good job.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,670
Not everyone has applied for the duties on the list back there.

70
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,200
Phone collector, waste sorter, and blackboard manager. There are still many open spots.

71
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,070
I'm trying to make your school records look even the slightest bit prettier,

72
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,500
so diligently apply for a duty while I tell you nicely.

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,800
- Okay.
- Okay!

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,020
Ms. Hae Na,

75
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,580
shouldn't you make yourself pretty, not just our school records?

76
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,800
This is me dressed up pretty.

77
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,710
I mean, C.C.K. You'll stop C.C.K.-ing once you start dating.

78
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,120
What's C.C.K.?

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
"Cutting off couples who kiss."

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,900
 Ms. Hae Na, seriously, what's wrong with you? 

81
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,810
Hey!

82
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,790
Is it because you're envious?

83
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,700
Envy is ignorance, Ms. Hae Na.

84
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,200
Ms. Hae Na, hang in there.

85
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,300
Hey, come on.

86
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,740
Fighting!

87
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,600
All right, I'm taking attendance.

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,300
- Min Ah.
- Here.

89
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,200
- Soo Jin.
- Here.

90
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,230
Hey, C.C.K.

91
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,900
Can you not call me that?

92
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,000
So, why did you go around cutting off couples who kiss?

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
You should've just passed them by.

94
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,330
It's reprehensible. They're at school doing something I haven't even done yet.

95
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,600
- Reprehensible, or are you just envious? 
 - Huh?

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,420
You said so before. "Yes to dating. No to kissing."

97
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,710
But you got dumped right away when you tell the guys about "no kissing."

98
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,370
I can truly do anything for them except kiss them.

99
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,600
That's weirder.

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,320
If kissing isn't allowed, everything shouldn't be allowed. Why is only kissing off-limits?

101
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,830
Don't tell me you've really never done it before.

102
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,820
Really?

103
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,200
Do you have some kind of illness?

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
I guess you can say...

105
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,960
Uncle, I got 100!

106
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,340
It is an illness.

107
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,640
What?

108
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,100
Geez, what is it?

109
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,320
Gosh, I don't know- Oh, my.

110
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,150
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

111
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,200
Are your hands okay-

112
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,330
That jerk.

113
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,830
Why do you hate Mr. Jin so much?

114
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,800
He's a bit blunt, but he's handsome.

115
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,540
And he's popular with the students.

116
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,100
It's not that I don't like him. He doesn't like me.

117
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,190
Why?

118
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,380
Hey, give it back!

119
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,940
Daebak!

120
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,710
- Whoa.
- Wow.

121
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,430
Hello, ladies.

122
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,440
Hello, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

123
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,800
Oh, we're all going to get together later

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,660
and have a drink. You'll be there, right?

125
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,000
Of course, we'll be there.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,730
- Okay.
- You said you have plans-

127
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,360
Of course, we'll be there. It's not often that we meet.

128
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,220
That's good to hear.

129
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,090
We're going to eat meat, so have a light lunch. Okay?

130
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,500
Gosh, he's so sweet.

131
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I come to work for Mr. Bo Gyeom.

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,790
Good for you. At least you have a reason to come to work.

133
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,550
When will they get here?

134
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,150
They'll be here soon.

135
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,600
Hello, ladies.

136
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,740
 Gosh, he's handsome. 

137
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,900
Ms. Yoon Chae Ah isn't here?

138
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh, she told us to go first because something came up.

139
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,690
You're hungry, right? Let's go.

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,030
As if. She's probably busy doing her full makeup.

141
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, my.

142
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,620
Oh, my gosh! This is heaven. They're so pretty.

143
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,390
Why are they all here?

144
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,000
So cute.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,870
Do you also like dogs?

146
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,670
Of course. They're so cute, right?

147
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,920
 You're cuter. 

148
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,690
That's right.

149
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,710
Let's get going.

150
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,100
Let's just watch them for a bit.

151
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,240
Whoa, they're so cute!

152
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,580
Earlier, that was the hand-

153
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,960
I'll go on ahead.

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,180
Gosh, that jerk.

155
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,560
They're all cooked.

156
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,860
You guys did a good job being handsome today.

157
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,670
Eat up.

158
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,790
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

159
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,330
This looks delicious.

160
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,600
Calm down. You're sensitive because you're hungry.

161
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,190
Why is everyone holding back on the alcohol?

162
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,890
Oh, here.

163
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,050
We, younger teachers, should meet often

164
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,570
and have dinner and go on trips, too.

165
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,000
That sounds great!

166
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,500
Staying at home after work gets lonely. Right?

167
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,990
I'm not lonely.

168
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,100
Oh! Mr. Jin, you're more like the chic cat type, huh?

169
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,660
This is my baby. He looks like you, right?

170
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,320
This is your cat?

171
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,540
It's so pretty!

172
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,060
You must like cats, too.

173
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,190
Yes, I guess. But I like dogs more.

174
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,920
That's because dogs are just really kind. Right?

175
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,700
Like him.

176
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,280
Goochie goochie goo. You're so kind.

177
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,100
Don't you think?

178
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,920
One, two!

179
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,090
Whoa!

180
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,790
That was so cool!

181
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,200
Hold on.

182
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm going to use the restroom.

183
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,490
- She's so cool!
- So cool!

184
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,400
Ms. Chae Ah is so cool!

185
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,020
 Daebak! Jun Woo sunbae's bride is Doo Na! 

186
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,680
 Your best friend is marrying your first love. 

187
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,460
 

188
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,900
These jerks.

189
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,340
Ms. Hae Na, is something wrong?

190
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,050
It's nothing.

191
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,540
Mr. Bo Gyeom, you don't have a girlfriend, do you?

192
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,070
Do you think I do or not?

193
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,890
If I had a girlfriend, I'd be on a date right now.

194
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm the type to go all-in on my girlfriend.

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,800
Then what's your ideal type?

196
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,560
I don't really have an ideal type.

197
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,550
But still. You must be attracted to something.

198
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,590
I just...

199
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,110
like someone who likes me.

200
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,600
I hate that pre-dating flirting phase.

201
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,660
I appreciate it when they tell me first, "I like you."

202
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,040
"Do you want to date me?"

203
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,060
- I'm going to get this call.
- Sure.

204
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,700
Hey, Seo Won! It's cold outside. Wear this.

205
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,450
He hates complicated things.

206
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,900
Just simply go!

207
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,530
Go?

208
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,190
Ms. Hae Na?

209
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,320
Guess what I like more than dogs.

210
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,250
It's you.

211
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,670
Really?

212
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,880
So...

213
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,170
tell me first.

214
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,230
Go.

215
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,430
Mr. Bo Gyeom.

216
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,780
Mr. Lee.

217
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,840
Ms. Han!

218
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,930
Yes, it's me.

219
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,960
Are you okay? You seem really drunk.

220
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,040
No, no. I'm not drunk at all.

221
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,100
I came to tell you something.

222
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,880
You said so before. That you...

223
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,410
appreciate simple things.

224
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:05,290
Which is why you like women who like you. And that...

225
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,520
you'd like...for them to be honest with you.

226
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,980
So what I want to tell you is...

227
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,020
I like you, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

228
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,690
 That's right. 

229
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,610
 If it's Mr. Bo Gyeom, he'll accept a woman like me, too. 

230
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,710
Ms. Hae Na.

231
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,930
 Whoa! Mr. Bo Gyeom can even talk while he kisses. 

232
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,620
Whoa!

233
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,530
Are you okay?

234
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,730
Mr. Jin, what are you doing here?

235
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,110
Sorry?

236
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,650
Your lips...

237
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,140
Why are you wearing this coat?

238
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,740
Whoa!

239
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,950
Oh, I'm sorry!

240
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,110
Ms. Han. Ms. Han! Ms. Hae Na!

241
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,280
Hey! Your bag!

242
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,720
Where's Ms. Hae Na going?

243
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,430
Oh, well...

244
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,170
Her family must be strict. Something about a curfew?

245
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,360
Doesn't she live with just her older sister?

246
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,840
 I only have one minute left. 

247
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,120
 If I kiss a man, 

248
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,180
 I turn into a dog. 

249
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,730
 Because of that damned curse. 

250
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,950
Shit!

251
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,300
What do I do?

252
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,730
Hae Na, aren't I handsome today?

253
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,400
No.

254
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,340
- I'm more handsome than your dad, right?
- No.

255
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,130
You rascal.

256
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,330
I'll be back.

257
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,420
Okay, see you later.

258
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,510
 My uncle was fine when he left in the morning... 

259
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,760
Uncle! I got 100!

260
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,770
 returned as a dog. 

261
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,030
What's with this mutt?

262
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,710
It's not a mutt. It's my uncle.

263
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,340
His name is Uncle? Uncle, give me your paw.

264
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't touch my uncle. He's really my uncle.

265
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,680
No way. Stop bluffing.

266
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,420
She's not. Our mom said our family turns into dogs when we kiss someone.

267
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,600
Then you'll turn into a dog if you kiss someone, too?

268
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,860
Yeah.

269
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,750
I'll believe you if you show me.

270
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,940
What the heck?

271
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,430
You haven't changed!

272
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,080
I'll change after one minute.

273
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,460
Mom! It's not working!

274
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,740
What's not working?

275
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,750
I kissed him, but I haven't changed!

276
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,170
What?

277
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,680
♫  Going home with, but instead of me  ♫

278
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,250
♫  Unless I forget myself, it feels complete  ♫

279
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,470
♫  Inside my head, I remain the same  ♫

280
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,020
♫  If you'd still love me, too  ♫

281
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,590
♫  Going home with, but instead of me  ♫

282
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,110
♫  Unless I forget myself, it feels complete  ♫

283
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,400
♫  Inside my head, I remain the same  ♫

284
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,430
♫  If you'd still love me, too  ♫

285
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,870
♫  So, here I am...  ♫

286
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:31,060
 This is Hyunseo Station. This is the last train from Hyunseo Station. 

287
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,090
♫  We'll embark on the love still  ♫

288
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,910
♫  Now, I'm going home  ♫

289
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:44,120
♫  You're by my side, now I'm going home  ♫

290
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,390
 

291
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,240
♫  Going home  ♫

292
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,360
♫  My heart remains true, now I am going home  ♫

293
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,020
♫  Still I hear you  ♫

294
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,550
 When we come across a dog without its owner, 

295
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,820
 we go through a confirmation process. 

296
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,240
Zero...

297
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,010
Zero...

298
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,950
Seven...

299
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,850
Han Yoo Na?

300
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,440
You just left like that last time. And now...

301
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,900
Who was it this time?

302
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,600
Which bastard did you kiss this time, Han Yoo Na?

303
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
- What about me?
- Geez, you scared me!

304
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,670
You...

305
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,940
y-you're not...

306
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,900
Who's this?

307
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,050
This is Hae Na's shoe.

308
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,720
You're Han Hae Na?

309
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
Han Hae Na, what will you do?

310
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,610
- What will you do?
- What's going on?

311
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,730
What the hell? What happened?

312
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,810
What is she saying?

313
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,450
She has to talk, so I understand! She's barking right now.

314
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,280
 What do I do now? What do I do? 

315
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,560
All right, so be quiet!

316
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,670
She'll be naked when she wakes up tomorrow.

317
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,780
When will she turn back into a human?

318
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,880
Six in the morning.

319
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,200
And she'll turn into a dog again at midnight.

320
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,580
For how long?

321
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,520
For 100 days.

322
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,790
If she can't undo the curse by then, she'll live the rest of her life as a dog.

323
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,910
Like your uncle?

324
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,350
She's still able to sleep in her situation?

325
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,790
You've never turned into a dog, have you?

326
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,270
Of course not.

327
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,510
It's exhausting.

328
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,640
You're a tenth of your normal size, but the world is the same.

329
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,210
The world is 10 times bigger.

330
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,080
I guess your food expenses are reduced by a tenth, too.

331
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,740
That must be nice.

332
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,810
I mean, she can just undo the curse like you did back then.

333
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,790
You think that's easy?

334
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,660
Gosh, why did your family have to be cursed like this?

335
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,620
If your children have a lover and they kiss,

336
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,100
their appearance will turn into something that is not human.

337
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,560
They must be able to prove their outstanding love

338
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,440
in order to change back into a human.

339
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,840
My curse will pass down to generations, and they will not escape the cycle!

340
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,560
 Are you okay? 

341
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,930
What is it?

342
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,800
What? What, what?

343
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,120
Resignation?

344
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,300
Are you crazy?

345
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,390
I can't go to school. I'd rather die than go to school.

346
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,410
Why? What is it? Go on and tell me the details.

347
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,280
I must've been possessed. I was sure it was Mr. Bo Gyeom.

348
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,510
What are you saying?

349
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,200
Unni.

350
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,570
Yeah, I must've been possessed. Yeah, I must've been possessed, Unni.

351
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,840
I was possessed.

352
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,900
- I must've been possessed.
- I'm scared.

353
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,820
So, you thought you came onto the sweet Korean history teacher,

354
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,740
but it was that jerk of a math teacher?

355
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,390
Because they switched clothes?

356
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,570
Hey, how'd you pass the teacher certification exam?

357
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,580
These problems don't come out on the exam!

358
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,360
What do you think? Does it look like I'm atoning?

359
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,110
Are you going to a funeral?

360
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,610
Gosh, why did it have to be Mr. Jin, of all people?

361
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,990
I'm the most awkward with him at school.

362
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,400
- Whatever the case, you got your wish. 
 - What?

363
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,760
Your first kiss at 28 years old.

364
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,290
- Congrats. 
 - That wasn't a kiss.

365
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,300
It was just a collision between lips.

366
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,740
No, no.

367
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,350
Rather than a collision, wouldn't it be sexual assault?

368
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,580
Physical contact without the other party's consent.

369
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,350
I'm trash.

370
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,940
Whatever, just get to school.

371
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,290
Mr. Jin is at school.

372
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,690
Hey, get it together.

373
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,780
If you can't undo the curse, you know you'll turn into a dog every night, right?

374
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,890
Gosh, seriously!

375
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,160
Hey, put this on your face and-

376
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,800
What are you doing? Hey, get out of there.

377
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,190
- I'm not going to school.
- Go to school!

378
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,310
No, I won't!

379
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,520
This wench! Go to school!

380
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,120
 

381
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,990
Hello.

382
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,930
Good morning.

383
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,470
I have...your bag.

384
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,270
I'm going to homeroom now.

385
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,520
Have a good one.

386
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,530
Thanks.

387
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,100
Ms. Yoon.

388
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,400
- Yes?
- One moment, please.

389
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,380
Did you get home okay last night?

390
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,670
Yes.

391
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,740
- About last night...
- Oh, yes.

392
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,200
It's a secret.

393
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,480
People make mistakes when they're drunk.

394
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,880
Yes.

395
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,230
It was truly a mistake.

396
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,710
Not an ounce of emotion involved.

397
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,410
It was truly, really just a pure mistake.

398
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,360
That's right.

399
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,000
But it was totally a kiss-

400
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,830
Okay, okay. I'll stop.

401
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,950
Seo Won told me...not to say a thing about it.

402
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,390
- Really?
- Yes.

403
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,040
Seo Won may be a little blunt, but he's a decent guy.

404
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,500
Huh.

405
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,150
Anyhow, I think you should apologize to Seo Won properly.

406
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,280
It looks like he was really shocked.

407
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,780
Yes, I should.

408
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,530
Of course, I should.

409
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,470
I want to preserve this sight.

410
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,190
How is he so handsome?

411
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,320
You started out right, but

412
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
I think it went wrong from here.

413
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,470
Look closely.

414
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,910
All right. You get it, right?

415
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,690
- Yes.
- Yes!

416
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,950
- Hey, did you see Mr. Seo Won's face?
- Of course!

417
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,900
Gosh, I think he's getting more handsome by the day!

418
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,750
Just when I think he can't get more handsome, he becomes more handsome the next day!

419
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,960
- He looks the same every day.
- And he's Garam High School's brain.

420
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,030
- I'm sure he's better than most top tutors.
- Totally.

421
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,300
 He's popular among the kids and close to Mr. Bo Gyeom. 

422
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,740
 But why is he only like that to me? 

423
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,890
 Are your hands okay- 

424
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,450
Your house is in the same direction as Ms. Hae Na's, so you can go together.

425
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,280
I feel uncomfortable with her.

426
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,590
Huh? Why uncomfortable?

427
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,430
 I avoided him because he finds me uncomfortable, 

428
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,330
 but why did it have to be him? 

429
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,730
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,480
Even when I think about it in your shoes, I really...

431
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,990
Anyhow, thank you so much for keeping it a secret.

432
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,920
Honestly, I didn't know you were this generous.

433
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,360
Are you sure you're sorry?

434
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,560
I'm sorry. It was really a mistake.

435
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,940
I know.

436
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,230
You mistook me for Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom.

437
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,140
Oh! How did you know?

438
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,540
It was impossible not to know in that situation.

439
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,200
So why were you wearing Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom's jacket?

440
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,860
Was that a question?

441
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,260
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,650
Nonetheless, it's okay.

443
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,600
It's not like you committed a grave sin.

444
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,090
Let's just say it never happened.

445
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,430
Thank you, thank you.

446
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,580
Let's forget about it.

447
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,200
Excuse me, Mr. Jin!

448
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,000
Do you happen to like dogs?

449
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,340
 The solution to undo this damned curse. 

450
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,830
Woo Taek,

451
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,580
it's all right.

452
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,920
 It's kissing the other person again as a dog. 

453
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,170
Yoo Na!

454
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:22,140
 I must kiss this man again today but as a dog this time. 

455
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,050
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

456
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,500
I mean, it's because I like dogs, so I was wondering if you also like dogs.

457
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,030
But why are you getting annoyed with me?

458
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,530
When did I?

459
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,760
Right now.

460
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,260
Not at all.

461
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,120
M-Mr. Jin!

462
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,880
I'll buy you a meal as an apology.

463
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,900
Sorry?

464
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,260
Hey!

465
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,230
Isn't that our homeroom teacher?

466
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,980
Why is our homeroom teacher...

467
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,400
She must have something to tell him.

468
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,870
Please let me buy.

469
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,300
- It's okay.
- Gosh,

470
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,530
I'd feel really uncomfortable if I didn't.

471
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,890
There's no need to feel uncomfortable.

472
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,800
No, it's...

473
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,970
My sense of guilt and my conscience...

474
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,070
They hurt too much.

475
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm sorry.

476
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,950
Why did she ask about dogs all of a sudden?

477
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,320
Mr. Jin!

478
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,070
Mr. Jin?

479
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,200
Are you dating my homeroom teacher?

480
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,320
What?

481
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,340
I'm asking because I saw you talking to her lovingly over there earlier.

482
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,230
Did that look loving?

483
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,410
Well, sort of?

484
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,500
Please throw this out for me!

485
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,960
Hey-

486
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,350
Hey!

487
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,400
 

488
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,000
Was she talking about crabs, not dogs*?
(Dogs and crabs sound similar in Korean.)

489
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,180
Easy.

490
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,540
What a good boy.

491
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,470
- Be gentle.
- It's okay, it's okay.

492
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,780
A little further in.

493
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,360
Dong Cheol...

494
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,090
Let's go home together. Let's go to Noona's house, okay?

495
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,550
What should I do? I'm so sad...

496
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,490
It's okay.

497
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,170
BUN, creatinine... all kidney levels are bad.

498
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,940
I think dialysis is needed,

499
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,880
but he's too old to get surgery for his brain tumor.

500
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,280
How much longer...will Uncle be able to live?

501
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,790
Don't worry too much.

502
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,310
They do live six more months after getting told one month.

503
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,620
That's why you need to undo your curse quickly.

504
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,020
Didn't you see Mom crying her eyes out earlier?

505
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,900
Ask that guy out to dinner and make him drink alcohol until midnight.

506
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,200
When he's all drunk and confused, kiss him in your dog form, and that's it.

507
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,590
Gosh. It's easier said than done.

508
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,700
Ask him out first, for now.

509
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,140
We'll also come since you need to cover up if you fail.

510
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,590
Yes, you do need to cover up.

511
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,080
"We"?

512
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,310
Woo Taek,

513
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,340
you know what?

514
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,620
After my curse was undone and when I feel sad or disappointed,

515
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,410
I get this urge to bite.

516
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,960
Do you want to get bitten?

517
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,070
I-I got you.

518
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,890
I'm going inside first.

519
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,690
Okay.

520
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,460
Good night.

521
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,070
Don't worry too much.

522
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,990
She'll undo the curse soon.

523
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,440
Woo Taek.

524
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,350
You should... do something with me...

525
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,330
Hey, did you discuss this with her?

526
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,180
Even if you're family, doesn't she have the right to privacy?

527
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,650
Go turn her face a little to the left.

528
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,970
Gosh, I'm sure she'll get mad.

529
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,460
This will be a good memory once her curse is undone.

530
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,260
Okay.

531
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,290
My!

532
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,060
Isn't Hae Na so cute? Look at this.

533
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,950
Even if you're family, this is- Whoa, she is cute, though.

534
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,530
Right, right?

535
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,660
I'm naturally terrible at flattering someone.

536
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,230
Hello.

537
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,190
What are you doing right now?

538
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,740
Oh, my! There was so much dust on your desk.

539
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,440
It's not good for your lungs, right?

540
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,410
I was just worried about your health.

541
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,610
I'll take care of my health.

542
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,510
Of course, you should.

543
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,000
Are you eating properly, by the way?

544
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,190
Should I buy you some meat? Meat with a shot of soju.

545
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,130
Gosh, we really don't click.

546
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,630
I still need to try.

547
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,230
Don't you hear your dry hands screaming?

548
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,070
Sorry?

549
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,000
When it's dry, wouldn't your life be better with a glass of moist alcohol?

550
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,230
I don't like humidity.

551
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,790
You must hate the rainy season.

552
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,330
So, shall we make plans to prepare for the upcoming rainy season?

553
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,110
With some beef intestines and soju, yeah?

554
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,250
Class dismissed.

555
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,630
 Thank you! 

556
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,240
The kids just don't listen, do they?

557
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,650
When you're stressed, pig feet and soju are the best.

558
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,070
Gosh, you're picking at your food so much.

559
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,690
When you don't have an appetite, have chicken feet with soju.

560
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,970
Dang it!

561
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,190
Why are you in a bad mood this time?

562
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,800
 
 This evening works for me. 

563
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,860
My goodness.

564
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,010
 Operation launches this evening. 

565
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,300
Whoa, finally.

566
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,250
Mr. Song Woo Taek, today's the day.

567
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,070
Excuse me, two bottles of soju for us, please.

568
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,800
Please give me the lukewarm ones, not the cold ones.

569
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,540
- I won't be drinking alcohol.
- Sorry?

570
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,200
How can you not drink soju with spicy stir-fried chicken? That's the unwritten law.

571
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,370
- I still don't-
- Still,

572
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:49,770
you should abide by the unwritten law since it's still a law.

573
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,590
I'll just have a glass of beer, then.

574
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,340
Excuse me! Please give us a bottle of beer

575
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,560
in addition to the soju.

576
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,950
Beer tastes smoother when mixed.

577
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,340
I know the killer ratio for somaek*. Should I show you one?
(Soju and beer.)

578
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,770
I'm fine.

579
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,860
I get drunk too quickly when I drink soju.

580
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,910
I'll take this call.

581
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,060
Oh, okay! You can go ahead. Hurry!

582
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,850
 Get him totally plastered. 

583
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,500
So he won't even realize if it's a dream or not

584
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,980
when a dog he just kissed becomes human.

585
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,770
You got it?

586
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,920
Even that bastard who said he loved me thousands of times

587
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,900
treated me like a monster when I became a dog in front of his eyes.

588
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,240
Worse off, you've got an awkward and uncomfortable coworker.

589
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,140
Make sure no one catches you.

590
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,970
More, more, more.

591
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,800
More!

592
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,560
Cheers.

593
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,480
Sure.

594
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,170
I'm getting so drunk.

595
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,940
Gosh, why are we leaving this early when she turns at midnight?

596
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,840
You have nothing to do anyway.

597
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,510
Get a girlfriend or something if you don't want to do this.

598
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,070
Y-You think I can't get a girlfriend, huh?

599
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,600
Well...

600
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,650
I kind of know why you insisted on wanting to see me tonight.

601
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,200
Sorry?

602
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,340
Since I'm close to Bo Gyeom,

603
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,580
you want me to connect you both, isn't it?

604
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,790
Oh, you're right. That's right. The connection.

605
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:54,910
But I don't know if I could help you because I'm very clumsy at this.

606
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,890
Come on, what's there to be clumsy about?

607
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,550
You just need to be there in that place.

608
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,770
If you'll just stay there in your spot,

609
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:06,970
I won't think twice and go to him with your help.

610
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,510
By the way...

611
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,010
why do you hate me, Mr. Jin?

612
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,530
Why would I hate you, Ms. Han?

613
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,640
Exactly! Why do you hate me?

614
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,200
What did I ever do to you?

615
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,550
But I never hated you.

616
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,860
Whoa! You make me laugh.

617
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,370
I've got an upset note in my heart, okay? I remember everything.

618
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,730
 During fifth period's free period on April 20th, last year, 

619
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,980
 when the teachers chipped in to buy snacks. 

620
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,390
Whoa, gosh.

621
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,030
We didn't buy soondae.

622
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,750
Whoa, you disappeared in a split second.

623
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,660
Did you use an invisible cape or something?

624
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,070
- Do you remember or not? 
 - I remember.

625
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,640
And also, on Ms. Song's birthday last year,

626
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,100
 when we went to buy the cake together. 

627
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,410
They say the mango flavor tastes good,

628
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:05,860
but Ms. Song likes matcha flavor.

629
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,470
But that one looks tasty, too.

630
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,820
What should we do?

631
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,060
Do you remember or not?

632
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,260
I remember.

633
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,790
See?

634
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,050
I mean, why on Earth do you hate me?

635
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,460
Why do you find me uncomfortable?

636
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,230
When I'm with you, it's really-

637
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,210
I have my reasons.

638
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,220
So, tell me about those reasons.

639
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,710
Anyhow, it's true I avoided you because I was a bit uncomfortable,

640
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,420
but it wasn't because I hate you.

641
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,630
I'm sorry if I made you misunderstand.

642
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,730
Wait, what's that supposed to...

643
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,530
And...I think I also misunderstood.

644
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,050
I also like them.

645
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,070
Like what?

646
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,260
Crabs*.
(Sounds similar to dogs in Korean)

647
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,410
Oh, really?

648
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,610
They taste good.

649
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,040
Sorry?

650
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,290
They taste good steamed and also

651
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,300
taste great stewed.

652
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,160
 Is he picking a fight with me right now? 

653
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,290
Do they have a stew here?

654
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,560
 Five minutes left. Hurry up and come out! 

655
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,370
Whoa! M-Mr. Jin, please excuse me for one moment. Sorry.

656
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,030
Where are you-

657
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,700
Yes, Mr. Jin! I'm at the alley right outside.

658
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,640
 Can you come outside for a minute? 

659
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,710
 There's a really cute... 

660
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,740
Boss, one bottle of soju, please.

661
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,080
What?

662
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,360
 
What the heck?

663
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,400
Do I need to call Bo Gyeom or something?

664
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,360
 Calling Bo Gyeom. 

665
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,070
 
What?

666
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,930
My goodness.

667
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:50,010
 Gosh, I really can't get used to this alt character. 

668
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,860
 This sorrowful doggy life. 

669
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,170
 I'll get over with this soon. 

670
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,450
Ms. Han?

671
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,570
Ms. Han!

672
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,740
Ms. Han?

673
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,650
Ms. Han!

674
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,130
Hi.

675
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,830
Hey, you're cute.

676
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,080
♫  Whatever I say, it's for you  ♫

677
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,550
♫  Learning all the lessons I taught you  ♫

678
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:10,990
♫  Whatever the language, I don't mind  ♫

679
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:14,360
♫  Million words I need to describe it  ♫

680
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,330
♫  Ooh, there are blue moons in the sky  ♫

681
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:23,090
♫  And the stars light the eternal light  ♫

682
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,910
♫  Ooh, the waves are crashing in  ♫

683
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,910
 And it'll be game over. 

684
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,420
Ms. Han!

685
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,020
 What?  Dogs* taste good? 
(Sounds similar to crabs in Korean)

686
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,090
 What a jerk. I'm done with you once the curse is lifted. 

687
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,000
What in the world...

688
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,410
 I'm cute, right? You know I'm cute. 

689
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,690
 Great. Now, to put things to an end. 

690
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,100
 Huh? 

691
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,730
Don't come.

692
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,950
 What's wrong with him? 

693
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,890
 Did he see a ghost? 

694
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,410
 There's nothing there. 

695
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,000
 Don't tell me. He's not afraid of ghosts, 

696
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,580
 but afraid of dogs? 

697
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,240
 No way, right? 

698
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,720
 It can't be. No way. 

699
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:49,280
   ​

700
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,680
 He is. 

701
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,390
 It really was me! 

702
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,390
 Gosh! 

703
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,910
 I'm totally doomed! 

704
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,360
All right, attention.

705
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,510
It won't come out on the test, but we'll do a review.

706
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,980
Number one.

707
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,070
You turn into a dog within one minute after kissing the opposite sex.

708
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,420
Number two.

709
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,520
You become a dog from midnight to six in the morning every day.

710
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,900
Number three.

711
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,920
If 100 days pass before you undo the curse,

712
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,260
you live as a dog for the rest of your life.

713
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,030
Lastly, number four. The most important one.

714
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:33,910
How can you lift the curse, then?

715
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,800
Yes, that's right. Number four!

716
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,310
You need to kiss the same person you kissed again as a dog.

717
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,960
All right, everyone got it now, right?

718
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,350
Any student with a question, please post it on the bulletin board

719
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:48,620
and that's it for today's class.

720
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:52,280
♫  Please don't pretend not to know  ♫

721
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,020
♫  I know how you feel  ♫

722
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:00,850
♫  Even if you act like you're nonchalant  ♫

723
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,970
♫  You make it obvious  ♫

724
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,120
♫  Don't act like you don't know, it's love  ♫

725
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,790
♫  Don't walk on eggshells, tell me everything  ♫

726
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:15,600
♫  Who cares what other people say  ♫

727
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,660
♫  What does it matter?  ♫

728
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,490
♫  You're too shy  ♫

729
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,020
♫  Too shy  ♫

730
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,600
♫  Let's not waste any more time  ♫

731
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,650
 

732
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,970
 I heard Ms. Hae Na suddenly disappeared last night. 

733
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,410
 - Did something happen? 
 - Did she see? 

734
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,060
 Like hell, you'll take care of it. 

735
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,380
 You kiss him by mistake, 

736
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,470
 make him go out to dinner with you to apologize and run off without even paying. 

737
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,740
 From Mr. Jin's perspective, you're... 

738
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,700
 Dine and dash. Yes, you're a dine and dasher. 

739
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,970
 Since you agreed to help, can we meet regularly, and can you give me some good tips? 

740
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,200
 Regularly? 

741
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,160
 - Is this Ms. Han Hae Na from Garam High School? 
 -  Ms. Han! 

742
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,190
 The buses probably stopped running. 

743
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,840
 Hello? I'm in big trouble right now- 

744
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,580
 Whoa, you dog... 

745
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,690
 Just one glass of beer, please? 

746
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,640
 Don't you even hear what I'm saying? 

747
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,410
 
 How many times do I have to say no? 

748
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,920
 I have been very clingy lately. 

749
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,560
 I'm sure he thought of me as a leech. 

750
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,290
 Ms. Han, you see... 

751
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,510
♫  Take care of your image  ♫
