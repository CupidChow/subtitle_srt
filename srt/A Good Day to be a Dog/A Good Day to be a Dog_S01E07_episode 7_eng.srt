00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,980
   â€‹

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,670
 

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,010
 

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,730
 

5
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,720
 

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
 
 She's a returning student who's three years older. She's a shaman. 

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,680
 She's super clairvoyant. 

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,840
 You have no desire to get along with a dog, do you? 

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,950
 Make sure to stay alert over there. 

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,900
 Don't let anyone catch you. 

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,610
 Looks like they'll work out, huh? 

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,900
 I think she even switched night duty time slots to partner with him. 

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,190
 It's a swallow. A welcome guest... 

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,180
 Or a reunion. 

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,890
 Hey, where is everyone? 

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,920
 They were all gone when I came out of the shower. 

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,170
 No sign of them, right? 

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,530
 No. We're in trouble. It's almost midnight. 

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,890
 - Are you in pain?
- I need to poop. Don't come. 

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,970
 Hey, you're from Garam High School, aren't you? Stop right there! Nice, nice. 

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,090
 Oh, this is where she transformed. But where did she go? 

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,560
 Who's that grandma? 

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,760
 Ms. Han! Ms. Han! 

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,670
 Ms. Hae Na still hasn't returned? 

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,990
 - Where is she?
- What is this situation? 

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,270
 Please answer if you can hear me. 

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,870
 Ms. Han, hold on just a minute. I'll save you. 

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,750
 - Please save me!
- Ms. Han! 

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,340
 Grab my hand. 

30
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,130
 - Are you okay?
- Yes. 

31
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,270
 What a relief. I was worried. 

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,270
 Mr. Jin, I no longer like Mr. Bo Gyeom. 

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,700
 Sir... 

34
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,020
 Han Yoo Na's sister? How entertaining. 

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,880
 Does he know his girlfriend is a monster? 

36
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,140
Man, where can I find a good source?

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,310
"A woman who turns into a dog every night"?

38
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,340
 

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,380
This crazy bastard wrote bullshit so thoroughly.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,730
He looks like a familiar face.

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,500
Who could it be?

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,950
Isn't that Jin Seo Won?

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,630
 You piece of trash! I never liked the way you looked! 

44
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,120
S-So the woman who turns into a dog is...

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,790
Wait, then she's the dog?

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,900
 

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,490
 I no longer like Mr. Bo Gyeom. 

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,580
 It just ended up like that. 

49
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,460
 Anyway, I just wanted to let you know. 

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,870
Hey, it's time for class. Get inside.

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,890
- Ms. Han-
- Mr. Jin-

52
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,020
- You can speak first-
- You can speak first-

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,270
Did you have a good rest?

54
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,410
Yes, thanks to you.

55
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,550
What about you?

56
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,800
- I also-
- Hey, get inside, will you?

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,980
Go!

58
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,700
I'll go ahead to class.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,950
Mr. Jin, aren't you going to class?

60
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm on my way.

61
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,740
 I'm a reporter. 

62
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,040
 I'd like to talk about this story on my channel. 

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,980
 Please give me a reply. 

64
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,920
 

65
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,110
 

66
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,150
 This is Hwan from "Curiosities." 

67
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,930
 I'm going to reveal the shocking personal life of an actress, 

68
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,320
 who's loved by the public for her pure and clean image. 

69
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,890
Where's Mom?

70
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,820
Yoo Na took her out because she couldn't eat anything all day.

71
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,400
I told you not to touch Uncle like that.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,100
Your uncle really likes it.

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,400
- Don't you?
- Uncle...

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,240
don't wag your tail.

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,270
Is Uncle all right?

76
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,210
The bloody stool was from the pancreatitis,

77
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,240
and he's been lethargic for the past few days.

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,650
He's feeling better after receiving IV fluids, so don't worry.

79
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,320
He doesn't have much time left, does he?

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,240
Human time and dog time pass differently.

81
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,590
I'm going to tidy up outside.

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
Hae Na.

83
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,900
You know you also have to lift the curse soon, right?

84
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,220
Uncle, why do you keep getting sick?

85
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,960
You're worrying Mom.

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,310
Uncle,

87
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:18,810
I can now imagine how you felt and how hard it must've been for you.

88
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,980
My feelings have become so precious that I want to protect them.

89
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,870
But in order to protect them,

90
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,390
I need to tell him now.

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,560
But I'm so scared.

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,410
What should I do, Uncle?

93
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,590
I've just now become closer to him.

94
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,970
We confide in each other and joke around, too.

95
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,170
Do you think I'll be able to tell him?

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,680
You're right.

97
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,360
I'll tell him within 30 minutes and show him my transformation.

98
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,280
All right. I'll definitely tell him today.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,570
 

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,290
Oh, Seo Won!

101
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,170
You still live here?

102
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,130
We're not on good terms to ask each other how we're doing, no?

103
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,960
Is that right?

104
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,920
I came because I was worried about you as a friend.

105
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,550
- I have no business with you-
- Hey, come on!

106
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,800
Are you still sulking about what happened in the past?

107
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,300
Narrow-minded much?

108
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,020
Oh, and I saw your picture on the internet.

109
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,550
Your girlfriend is so pretty.

110
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,860
What?

111
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,090
I vaguely heard about what you do for a living.

112
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,630
Making trashy content.

113
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,700
You must not be so busy.

114
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,380
You have a lot of time on your hands.

115
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,330
Looks like you f***ing grew a pair.

116
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,740
I always had a pair.

117
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,090
Why don't you try to behave now?

118
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,380
You're an adult.

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,580
Woof, woof!

120
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,730
Grrr... Woof!

121
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,150
Woof, woof!

122
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,710
Woof, woof!

123
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,450
Woof! Woof!

124
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,100
Someone might file a complaint.

125
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,200
How does it feel to hear that after so long? Does it bring back old memories?

126
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,990
Hey, you know what this is, right?

127
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,810
You're a big shot now! You even have a girlfriend.

128
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,240
Now that you have a girlfriend, you must do things every night like...

129
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,900
a dog in heat, right?

130
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,340
Stop with the bullshit and leave.

131
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,940
Fine. I'll go if you want me to.

132
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,900
See you again, buddy.

133
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,500
Damn it!

134
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
What the hell?

135
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,750
 

136
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,790
Hello, Mr. Jin.

137
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,670
I couldn't get your call because I fell asleep early last night.

138
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,620
 It's fine. Did you get home safely? You left in a hurry. 

139
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,360
- Sorry?
 - After work. 

140
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,640
 I wondered if you got home safely. 

141
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,800
Oh, of course. I got home in no time.

142
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Have a good weekend, Mr. Jin. I'll be in touch.

143
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,680
Are you sure it was here?

144
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,450
Did someone take them in that short time?

145
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,510
I hid them carefully.

146
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,370
Gosh, I really liked those clothes.

147
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,800
Those were my clothes.

148
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,720
So I was going to get them with you last night, but you were at a club.

149
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,940
Are you serious?

150
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,300
What?

151
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,160
- Mom!
- What about Mom?

152
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,300
- Mom's at our house.
- Why in the world?

153
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,020
Well, you know how you kissed the sleeping math teacher, but the curse didn't lift?

154
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,790
So, I asked Mom what the problem was

155
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,910
and she asked who got cursed and got suspicious.

156
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,600
- What do I do?
- Let's go home.

157
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,680
- I'm screwed.
- We have to go. Hurry.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,410
Mom!

159
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,210
Why did you come without any notice?

160
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,700
Where did you go this early in the morning?

161
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,000
- Well, a w-walk!
- Yeah.

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,490
We love taking morning walks.

163
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,400
They're so refreshing.

164
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,430
Why?

165
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,420
You weren't looking for the clothes you left on the street last night?

166
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,720
- What are you talking about?
- No.

167
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,800
Spill it. Which one of you is it?

168
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,570
- What?
- Which one of us is what?

169
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,340
You'll play innocent?

170
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,380
Fine, I'll just wait until midnight then.

171
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,760
- M-Mom!
- Mom!

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,680
It's you!

173
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,870
Who is it? Did you get a boyfriend? When?

174
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,740
No, Mom. What boyfriend?

175
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,610
I'm tired, so I'm going to bed.

176
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,190
- Stop it, Mom.
- Who is it? Tell me.

177
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,320
It's really not like that.

178
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,830
Who is it? Tell me! Who is it? Tell me!

179
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,090
Who is it?

180
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,140
I knew it.

181
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,650
- Mom-
- You!

182
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,350
You know, don't you? Who is it?

183
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,180
- No, I don't-
- Bring him here first thing tomorrow.

184
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,610
- Bring who?
- Who do you think? Her boyfriend!

185
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,980
What?

186
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,170
She kissed someone who's not even her boyfriend?

187
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,090
No! Of course, he's her boyfriend!

188
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,000
I have a lot of questions to ask him,

189
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,520
so tell him to come here tomorrow. Got it?

190
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,070
- What is this?
- What?

191
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,250
Is this a party celebrating my first kiss

192
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,130
or my last supper?

193
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,430
Hey, take a bite.

194
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,700
- How is it? Perfect, right?
- What are you planning, huh?

195
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,780
Don't worry about it. I took care of everything.

196
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,470
Yul!

197
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,280
Ms. Han!

198
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,530
How did you know where I live?

199
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,440
And what's with your get-up?

200
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh, my! Jaebu*, you're here?
(Term used by a woman to address her little sister's husband.)

201
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,280
Jaebu? Hey, get out of here. This is a mistake.

202
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,120
- Hey, hey, go!
- Mom! Mom, Mom! Jaebu's here!

203
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,720
No! Don't-

204
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,590
I'm just...

205
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,660
Welcome!

206
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,780
Come in.

207
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,180
Mother.

208
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,680
Nice to- It's a pleasure to meet you.

209
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,520
Welcome.

210
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,300
Oh, here you go.

211
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,540
You shouldn't have.

212
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,790
Oh, my! How did you know to get our mom's favorite?

213
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,980
Gosh, that's amazing! Jaebu, you're so thoughtful.

214
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,440
- Thank you.
- Sure.

215
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,140
Come this way.

216
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,620
Are you crazy? Unni, are you crazy? You're insane!

217
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,970
- What else could we do?
- Are you crazy?

218
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,200
I could land behind bars. He's a minor!

219
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,520
Who said this is real? We're just acting.

220
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,820
Even if that's the case!

221
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,930
And why is he sitting there?

222
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,200
Come and eat.

223
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,120
Is the food to your liking?

224
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,120
It's very delicious, Mother. School lunches don't-

225
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,560
School lunch?

226
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,050
Jaebu works at a company that delivers school lunches.

227
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,280
You're sick of eating school lunches, aren't you?

228
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,210
It can't be helped.

229
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,290
A company that delivers school lunches? What do you do there?

230
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,660
Geez, Mom. It's rude to ask such things these days.

231
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,700
You're so nosy.

232
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,830
Young man,

233
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,800
you said your name is Yul, right?

234
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
Yes, that's right.

235
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,280
How old are you?

236
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,610
Jaebu, you were...

237
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,470
born in the year of the dog, right?

238
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,200
- Year of the dog?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,160
- The same age as you?
- The same age as me.

240
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,040
Thirty?

241
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes.

242
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,070
Gosh, you don't look that old.

243
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,320
You're really baby-faced, Jaebu.

244
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,070
I am, aren't I?

245
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,670
He looks at least 10 years younger than you.

246
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,030
 Would you believe it if I said there's a line to make your love confession a 100% success? 

247
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,820
 You can't because you lack the courage? 

248
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,430
 History won't write itself. 

249
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,060
 There's no future for singles who forget history. 

250
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,260
 We make our own history! You often talk about the weather on dates, right? 

251
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,560
 You start by talking about the weather. 

252
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,150
 "What lovely weather." 

253
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,050
 Then, this is what the woman next to you will think inside. 

254
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,940
 Say this line when they're least expecting it! 

255
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,730
Sit comfortably.

256
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,050
Yes.

257
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,510
How did you meet my daughter?

258
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,410
- Oh, at school...
- School?

259
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,250
- Since he distributes school lunches-
- All right, you stay quiet.

260
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,920
How long have you known my daughter?

261
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,250
Since the beginning of the semester, so...

262
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,670
You're dating her knowing her situation, right?

263
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,180
Yes.

264
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,990
What do you think about a human turning into a dog?

265
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,270
It's so freaking fascinating!

266
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,210
Oh, and she's very cute.

267
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,750
It doesn't bother me. I'm fine with it.

268
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,480
I'm sorry for suddenly inviting you and questioning you.

269
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,230
It's no problem.

270
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,180
As a parent, being worried about their child is a given.

271
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,780
And my children are a bit different from everyone else.

272
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,670
It could be nice during the good times,

273
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,640
but if something goes wrong and you end up breaking up on bad terms,

274
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,560
there are more than a few things to worry about on our end.

275
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,720
Beyond being worried, I'm scared.

276
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,820
What if you go and expose my children's secret?

277
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,250
What if you suddenly appear and harass her after she's found a good man?

278
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,040
Relationships are complicated and not easy.

279
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,440
I feel like I've passed on too huge of a disability to my kids.

280
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,930
That's why even if you say it's okay,

281
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,380
I can't just blindly trust you

282
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,910
and say, "I see!"

283
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,280
I understand what you're saying.

284
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,120
But I said I'm fine because I'm truly fine.

285
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,780
I'm being sincere.

286
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,730
Turning into a dog is fascinating,

287
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,960
but it isn't strange.

288
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,210
I don't want Ms.-

289
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,110
Hae Na to feel daunted.

290
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,030
She once asked me, "Who would like someone like me?"

291
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,960
She shouldn't worry.

292
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,720
She's warm, fun, and cute.

293
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,310
She deserves to be loved more than enough.

294
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,750
â™«  I will stand by your side  â™«

295
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,930
You must really love my Hae Na.

296
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,920
Love...

297
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,670
Oh, my heart...

298
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,320
is suddenly...

299
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,350
Are you okay?

300
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,590
Oh, yes.

301
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,240
 I like the weather, and I like you, too. 

302
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,490
 Game over! You can start dating. 

303
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,040
 You can also do it. If you like and comment on my video, 

304
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,730
 I'll teach you more dating tips- 

305
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,170
 
 

306
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,260
 Happy birthday, little brother! I was going to visit Korea, 

307
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,810
 but I just can't make the time. I think I can take a vacation next month. 

308
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,560
 - Is Yul doing okay?
- All right. 

309
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,830
 Come at your convenience. Yul is doing well. 

310
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,460
You're getting a call.

311
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,350
Please excuse me for a moment.

312
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,950
- You can take the call in there.
- Okay.

313
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,890
Oh, gosh, my leg.

314
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,470
Hey, Uncle. What is it?

315
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,400
 - What time are you coming home?
 - I don't know. Why?

316
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,360
 I thought we could go out for dinner. I'll eat alone if you'll be late. 

317
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,680
Are you kidding me, Uncle? You shouldn't eat a birthday dinner alone.

318
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,940
-  Okay. Call me when you're on your way. 
- Okay.

319
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,500
Mother.

320
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,790
You must be very close to your uncle. Hae Na's the same.

321
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,300
Yes, we're close.

322
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
There's something I want to confirm.

323
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,360
Sure.

324
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,950
You two really love each other, right? You're really dating?

325
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,850
I-It seems so. Yes.

326
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,330
But why is Hae Na still under the curse?

327
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,810
- Sorry?
- You two kissed, didn't you?

328
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,780
- Yes!
- Even when she was a dog?

329
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,380
T-That's...

330
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,400
- Stay the night here!
- Sorry?

331
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,630
I will have no regrets only if the curse is lifted tonight.

332
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,760
M-Mother, that's-

333
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,560
I beg of you.

334
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,350
Mother-

335
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,660
Mother! Mother!

336
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,880
You truly love my Hae Na, right?

337
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,230
Then, please just close your eyes tonight...

338
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,870
Mom! Mom, I really don't think this is right.

339
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,020
What do you mean?

340
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,930
- Mom, I have something to tell you.
- Stay put.

341
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,610
I'm sorry, Mom.

342
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,780
The man I kissed is someone else.

343
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,950
He has no clue.

344
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,660
Huh?

345
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,040
Then why is he...

346
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,220
- Gosh, I'm so sorry.
- Please don't be.

347
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,460
- I'm so very sorry.
- It's really fine.

348
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,050
I'm so sorry I don't know what to do.

349
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,270
Aigoo! My gosh. Anyway...

350
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,900
I didn't raise my daughters right.

351
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,780
I didn't raise my daughters right.

352
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,420
I didn't!

353
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,180
- Ms. Han, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- I'm really sorry, Yul.

354
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,100
You can go home now. I'm really sorry.

355
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,200
Anyway, I'm really sorry and grateful for today, Yul.

356
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,100
What have I done to you? I can't bear to face you.

357
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,500
No, Ms. Han. I'm really fine.

358
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,990
It was fun!

359
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,270
And I enjoyed it, too.

360
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,710
She's my sister, but I don't know what she was thinking bringing you here.

361
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,240
I really enjoyed it, though.

362
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,360
Do you want to ride a taxi? Can you go alone?

363
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,630
Ms. Han, do you think I'm a child?

364
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,220
Whoa. Then do you think you're really 30 or 45 years old?

365
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,690
Take the taxi home. I'll give you the fare.

366
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,620
I really have a lot of time today.

367
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,290
Oh, right! It's Uncle's birthday today.

368
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,220
Uncle suggested we eat out for dinner.

369
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,700
Oh, I see.

370
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,180
- Would you like to join-
- Can I also join-

371
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,480
Sounds good!

372
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,600
Wouldn't I be imposing on a family dinner?

373
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,570
Ms. Han, I thought you needed to lift your curse.

374
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,510
Lift it tonight.

375
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,730
Fine!

376
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,250
Then I'll go get changed, so wait just a moment.

377
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,790
Okay.

378
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,230
Take your time and hurry.

379
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,830
Yes!

380
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,730
 

381
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,170
What the?

382
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,240
They go to the same school?

383
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,160
 

384
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,620
List of faculty...

385
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,590
Uncle!

386
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,140
Ms. Han!

387
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,710
What brings you here?

388
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,570
Oh, I ran into Yul right around the corner.

389
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,280
And my plans just happened to get canceled.

390
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,500
Oh, I see.

391
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,540
By the way...

392
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,050
what's with your get-up?

393
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,110
This is considered hip these days.

394
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,140
Where should we go?

395
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,670
Enjoy the meal.

396
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,730
I'm living the life, thanks to you. Enjoy your meal as well.

397
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,330
Uncle,

398
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,600
if it weren't for Ms. Han, it would've been the two of us again this year.

399
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,890
I know, huh?

400
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,810
Ms. Han, thank you.

401
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,480
It feels like an actual birthday party with you here.

402
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,820
I was sick of eating with just him every day.

403
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,340
Gosh, if I had known it was your birthday,

404
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,810
I would've prepared a gift...

405
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,420
Whoa, I did! Ta-da!

406
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,550
I bought it in a rush on the way here. I'll get you something better next time.

407
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,590
I like it.

408
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,000
There's something else I prepared.

409
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,410
â™«  Happy birthday to you!  â™«

410
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,260
â™«  Happy birthday to you!  â™«

411
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,790
â™«  - Happy birthday, dear Sir!  â™«
- Uncle!

412
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,480
â™«  Happy birthday to you!  â™«

413
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,090
Happy birthday! Have a great time!

414
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,480
Happy birthday.

415
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,830
Thank you!

416
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,850
Uncle, make a wish.

417
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,620
â™«  Even if you act like you're nonchalant, you make it obvious  â™«

418
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,830
â™«  Don't act like you don't know, it's love  â™«

419
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,550
â™«  Don't walk on eggshells, tell me everything  â™«

420
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:03,380
â™«  Who cares what other people say  â™«

421
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,390
â™«  What does it matter?  â™«

422
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,880
â™«  You're too shy, too shy  â™«

423
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,350
â™«  - Let's not waste any more time  â™«
- You're good!

424
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,000
â™«  It's the perfect timing for us to love  â™«

425
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,520
â™«  It's the perfect timing even at a glance  â™«

426
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,000
â™«  You don't need to lie to know the answer  â™«

427
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,020
â™«  Before time passes, now is the timing  â™«

428
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,810
Did you see that?

429
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,270
â™«  I want to stop time  â™«

430
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,490
â™«  One minute, one second is precious  â™«

431
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,120
Come on!

432
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,220
Let's do this!

433
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,010
- How did it come out?
- We're so cute.

434
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,690
It came out nice.

435
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,460
â™«  A perfect opportunity like this isn't common  â™«

436
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,520
â™«  Before time passes, now is the timing  â™«

437
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,160
â™«  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, perfect timing  â™«

438
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,820
â™«  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, killer timing  â™«

439
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,090
â™«  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  â™«

440
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,130
Look at your expression.

441
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,920
â™«  Now is the timing  â™«

442
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,100
Too slow, Mr. Jin.

443
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,010
Whoa, hold on. Hold on! Whoa!

444
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,720
 You lose! 

445
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,000
Wow, I don't know how long it's been since I had fun like this.

446
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,650
Me, too.

447
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,460
Man, I'm hungry.

448
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,970
We just ate. How are you hungry already-

449
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,820
I guess it's time to eat.

450
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,890
Then we should...

451
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,010
- Do you want to eat here, Ms. Han?
- Yes, I'd love to-

452
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,080
But it's inappropriate to go with Yul.

453
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,050
Right, I guess it is a bit...

454
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,760
- Forget it. I want to go home.
 - Do you? 

455
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,130
No, Yul. You should stay. Mr. Jin, let's look for another place.

456
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,410
Yes, somewhere we can go with Yul.

457
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,250
I'm leaving.

458
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,220
Be safe!

459
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,510
Call me when you get home!

460
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,900
Han Pan Dong.

461
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,850
Wow, this is quite a harmonious family.

462
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,550
A woman who turns into a dog...

463
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,690
How should I catch this wild horse?

464
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,760
 

465
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,070
Do you think Yul is sulking?

466
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,900
He doesn't like hanging out with me anyway.

467
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,630
Thank you for today.

468
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,090
I had a fun birthday, thanks to you.

469
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,960
No, I'm the grateful one.

470
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,190
I had so much fun today.

471
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,740
- I-
- Well-

472
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,380
You can go ahead.

473
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,090
It's not that important.

474
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:48,690
I just wanted to apologize since I couldn't get you a proper birthday gift.

475
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,350
I really like this.

476
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,980
To be honest,

477
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,700
I was going to contact you separately.

478
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,340
Why?

479
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,090
There's something I want to tell you.

480
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,930
What is it?

481
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,260
The thing is, I...

482
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,710
Ms. Han, I really...

483
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,280
I really thought long and hard about saying this.

484
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,260
I...

485
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,760
like...

486
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,440
Ms. Han,

487
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,090
Oh, hold on!

488
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,540
Sorry?

489
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,970
May I tell you something first?

490
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,380
Sure.

491
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,080
Let me use the restroom first.

492
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,380
Mr. Jin.

493
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Please listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

494
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,460
Don't be too shocked.

495
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,740
Please listen and make your decision.

496
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,400
I...

497
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,660
turn into a dog.

498
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,940
That's too depressing. Geez.

499
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,700
Yes! I turn into a dog. So what?

500
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,300
That's just picking a fight.

501
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,250
Have you ever seen someone turn into a dog?

502
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,390
That's me, you see.

503
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,010
I look like a crazy bitch.

504
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,330
Just be honest...

505
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,150
and brave.

506
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,670
I turn into a dog.

507
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,710
I...

508
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,150
like you, Mr. Jin.

509
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,230
Aigoo, she came out.

510
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,850
She came out.

511
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,640
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,890
Mr. Jin,

513
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:15,230
there's something I'd like to tell you.

514
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,730
Okay.

515
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,200
The thing is, I...

516
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,500
Let me just drink this before telling you.

517
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,100
Well...

518
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,550
Mr. Jin,

519
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,430
I...

520
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,790
The thing is, I...

521
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,190
I...

522
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,720
In all honesty...

523
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,380
- turn-
- If it's hard to say,

524
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,610
you don't have to.

525
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,350
You see, I'm not...

526
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,410
an alien.

527
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,020
Nor a ghost. No way.

528
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,060
Ms. Han, where did you say your house is?

529
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,970
Whoa.

530
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,200
So pretty.

531
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,630
â™«  I suddenly think  â™«

532
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,340
Hydrangeas...

533
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,130
change colors depending on where they're planted.

534
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,090
Hydrangea,

535
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,440
what color will you turn into?

536
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,350
Let me see what color you turn into.

537
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,170
â™«  In that moment I met you  â™«

538
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:06,140
â™«  I was just being careful  â™«

539
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,180
â™«  I was afraid  â™«

540
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,140
It's not changing.

541
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,060
â™«  I don't know what to do  â™«

542
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,820
What color do you think I change into?

543
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,790
â™«  When I thought of you, everything was great  â™«

544
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,770
Whichever color it is,

545
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,070
you'll be pretty.

546
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:35,620
â™«  When we made eye contact, my heart fluttered  â™«

547
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,270
â™«  I couldn't hide it  â™«

548
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:46,000
â™«  You were always great to me  â™«

549
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
â™«  I fantasized every day  â™«

550
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:02,100
â™«  I was happy by myself without even realizing it  â™«

551
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,140
Welcome! Welcome!

552
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,670
I'd like to order one chicken to-go.

553
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,550
Which one would you like?

554
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,690
The most popular one, please.

555
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,400
Our 3-variety is delicious.

556
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,100
Then, please give me the 3-variety.

557
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,920
Okay, one 3-variety.

558
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,450
- One 3-variety, to-go!
- Okay!

559
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,600
That'll be 21,000 won.

560
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,580
How's business these days?

561
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,260
We get by.

562
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,980
Don't your children help out?

563
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,590
Gosh, they're busy living their own lives.

564
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,060
Well, I guess I don't pay attention to my parents. You must have a son.

565
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,550
I have two daughters, but they're a pain in the neck.

566
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,490
- Why?
- I don't know, they just are.

567
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,040
They must be incredible beauties if they take after you.

568
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,850
Aigoo, you handsome young man. You have a good eye.

569
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,690
Do you have any photos?

570
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:12,450
Don't doting fathers of daughters usually set them as the wallpaper?

571
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,030
You want to see?

572
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,680
Uhm... yes!

573
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,260
My daughters are really beautiful!

574
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,470
I'll show you since you're a handsome young man.

575
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,500
My daughters' photo-

576
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,560
Why do you want to see our daughters' photos?

577
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,950
I asked because they must be beauties if they take after you.

578
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,650
That's true.

579
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,390
- Good luck with your business!
- Thank you.

580
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,270
- Take care.

581
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,130
- Beautiful madam!
- You're so thoughtless.

582
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,610
Anyhow, your second daughter is in big trouble!

583
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,130
- What's wrong with our daughter?
- Shit!

584
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Why are you packing that?

585
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,270
I'll take it to your brother at Woo Taek's hospital.

586
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:06,230
He's old now. How do you expect him to chew on that with his weak teeth?

587
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,500
Would he eat it if I soaked it in water and mixed it in his dog food?

588
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,190
Would he?

589
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,780
Her brother?

590
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,900
Hey, Yo Seob, let's do a job.

591
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,550
 

592
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,280
Yeah, I'm here.

593
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,370
Are you sure this is all right? I'm-

594
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,770
All right. Why are you cursing?

595
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,310
Okay, I'll call you.

596
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,560
- How may I help you?
- Oh, hello.

597
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,710
He keeps gagging, so I'd like to have him examined.

598
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,630
Oh, is that so?

599
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,990
- I'll take a look.
- Okay.

600
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,520
Let's see...

601
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,180
- It's okay.
- Let's go.

602
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,260
I'll take a look.

603
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,980
Gosh, how pretty.

604
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,830
What are you doing here?

605
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,220
There's something here.

606
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,070
What?

607
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,690
I don't know.

608
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,320
I feel some sort of presence.

609
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,130
Why do you keep dropping the honorifics? You're younger than me.

610
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,530
What's wrong with being young?

611
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,210
By the way,

612
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:57,300
how did you know I was being called on and forced on my knees?

613
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,740
I just saw it.

614
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,180
What you said before...

615
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,260
About there being trouble if I get into it too much when It's not even real.

616
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,420
Was there trouble?

617
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,310
Okay, good luck with that.

618
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:20,340
If you were a skilled shaman, you'd tell me how I could fix things.

619
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,720
Can you unlock this?

620
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,350
Move aside.

621
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,520
I'll ask Mr. Bo Gyeom.

622
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,770
Mr. Lee.

623
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,780
What are you doing here?

624
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,440
This isn't fun.

625
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,980
Let's go.

626
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,580
Why hold my arm...

627
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,180
- Students, can I ask you-
- No!

628
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,500
- Not buying it.
- We're good.

629
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,580
Hey, they're after the MZ generation-

630
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,610
Generation Alpha or something, right? Rude bastards.

631
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,520
There's something like that?

632
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,980
Gosh, you're so-

633
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,700
It's that side, gosh.

634
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,180
Hey, hey, hey!

635
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,040
Students, may I ask you something?

636
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,790
Do you know Ms. Han Hae Na?

637
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,070
Yes, why?

638
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:41,370
I'm a reporter, and I'm here to collect some information.

639
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,940
Could I get Ms. Han Hae Na's contact information?

640
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,490
 

641
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,910
- What information are you collecting?
- Society!

642
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,870
- And the economy...
- Yes, the many aspects of society-

643
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,170
What are you girls still doing here?

644
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,240
- Hurry home.
- Goodbye.

645
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,210
Sure, good work.

646
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,270
Get home safely.

647
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,950
Who are you?

648
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,240
We're-

649
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,560
I-I'm her...

650
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,440
uncle.

651
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,220
Whose uncle?

652
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,250
T-The one with the long hair...

653
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,600
Which one with the long hair?

654
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,500
Hey!

655
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,060
- Hey!
- Hey, you know...

656
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,330
Mr. Jin! Mr. Jin!

657
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,000
Hey. Girls, what did that man say to you?

658
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,200
He asked about Ms. Hae Na.

659
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,600
- Give it to him.
- Oh, here.

660
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,130
 What is this? You're going to sue me? Go ahead and sue me! 

661
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,130
 I won't be charged anyway. 

662
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,700
 The worst that can happen is probation. 

663
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,770
 Oh? The food is here. 

664
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,900
 

665
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,410
 

666
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,110
Block! Block well, or your bones will break!

667
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,040
Block us!

668
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,260
Who is it?

669
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,730
Hey, Jin Seo Won. How did you know to find me here?

670
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,720
Wow, you're one scary bastard.

671
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,000
Did you tail me or something?

672
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,100
Come in for now.

673
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,670
I'll give you a cup of cocoa or something.

674
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,280
Don't ever come to our school again.

675
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,430
You came all the way here to tell me that?

676
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,250
Hey,

677
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,920
I wasn't there to see you.

678
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,170
I was there to see your girlfriend.

679
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,170
I don't know what you're up to, nor do I want to know,

680
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,700
but if you ever appear in front of me again,

681
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,200
I won't sit back.

682
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,890
Geez, that bastard.

683
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,830
He's a lot more fun now.

684
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,560
You only have a few days left now.

685
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,890
- How many days does she have left?
- Ten days.

686
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,140
Man, time flies.

687
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,430
It's already been 90 days?

688
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,300
Seriously, what will you do now?

689
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,600
Should we call Yul and hold an emergency meeting?

690
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,760
I don't want him to get mixed up in this because of me.

691
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,750
Then what are you going to do?

692
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,300
I have a plan.

693
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,490
Although, it's going to be difficult.

694
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,760
- What is it?
- I'll have to confess.

695
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,890
Is he someone you can trust?

696
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,860
 Whichever color it is, 

697
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,870
 you'll be pretty. 

698
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,930
Yeah.

699
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,110
If it's him, I think it'll be fine.

700
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,570
I'm scared...

701
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,570
that you might go through the same thing I did.

702
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,020
I'm here. Which room is it?

703
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,770
You'll really lift the curse for me today, right?

704
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,260
Oppa, I really don't have much time left.

705
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,740
Okay.

706
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,320
Oppa!

707
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,890
What the? He said he was in the room.

708
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,160
I put in more than what you're expecting.

709
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,860
Please give my daughter a proper kiss.

710
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,420
And I'm asking just in case...

711
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,220
If you have any secret recordings of her,

712
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,200
you'd better delete them.

713
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,350
If you don't,

714
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:33,350
I'm going to chase you to the ends of hell and tear you apart.

715
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,430
My baby...

716
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,950
Yoo Na, it's okay.

717
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,620
- Mom...
- It's all right. It's all right.

718
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,180
Shit! Sang Su, that son of a bitch!

719
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,500
Hey! You're insulting the dogs.

720
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,400
They're daughters, not sons.

721
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,710
Don't worry, he's not talking about you.

722
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,440
- Don't you worry!
- No, no.

723
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,120
- Not you guys.
- I'm not talking about you guys.

724
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,770
Wow.

725
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,080
This was for real?

726
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,770
Hi, I'm the reporter who contacted you last time.

727
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,880
Do you happen to have any videos?

728
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,980
I'd like to buy them from you.

729
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,940
Mr. Hwan?

730
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,230
But you know, how much do you get for making these kinds of videos?

731
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:45,280
I'm not sure. It varies each time.

732
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:50,960
I'd feel more assured with a bigger advanced payment.

733
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,770
Since I am being threatened.

734
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,730
Then we'll get a recording of you first. Assistant Manager?

735
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,420
Start recording.

736
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,940
Me?

737
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,490
Yes, you.

738
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,090
Yes.

739
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,410
Just a moment.

740
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,120
- Please alter my voice.
- Of course.

741
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:17,000
You can go ahead.

742
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,820
Turning into a dog is that family's specialty.

743
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,270
Let's leave. I feel like I'm going to catch a disease.

744
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,040
Oh, my. Hyungnim!

745
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,290
Thank you.

746
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:34,080
Why are you so bent on exposing them

747
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,160
by even using this much money?

748
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,170
 If you ever appear in front of me again, 

749
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,530
 I won't sit back. 

750
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,310
It just...

751
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,830
seems like fun.

752
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,240
 Hey. 

753
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,930
 I wasn't there to see you. 

754
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,100
 I was there to see your girlfriend. 

755
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:46,090
   â€‹

756
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:53,450
â™«  Thinking about you made everything feel great  â™«

757
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:59,200
â™«  Everything we did together was great  â™«

758
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:05,570
â™«  When our eyes met by chance, my heart fluttered  â™«

759
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,320
â™«  I couldn't hide my feelings  â™«

760
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:15,930
â™«  You were always great to me  â™«

761
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,650
 

762
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:23,410
 Jin Seo Won, that bastard must not know yet. Seeing how you're still cursed. 

763
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,870
 Jun Seo, why didn't you hand in your cellphone? 

764
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,700
 I will after I feed Cocoa. 

765
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,850
 Be honest. Where's Cocoa from, and who's her owner? 

766
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,900
 That person wouldn't seek out Mr. Jin, would he? 

767
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,320
 - I should go before he-
- No! 

768
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,160
 Just worry about yourself for now. 

769
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,910
 Isn't he that guy from last time? 

770
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,890
 Have you ever heard of a person turning into a dog before? 

771
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,030
 Come to that place from yesterday right now. 

772
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,510
 Or I'll just kill this bastard. 

773
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,920
 Today is finally here. 

774
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,190
 Let me introduce that person. This is her!
