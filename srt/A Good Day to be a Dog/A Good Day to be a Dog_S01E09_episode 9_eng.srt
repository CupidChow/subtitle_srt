1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:10,420
   ​

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,630
 

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,030
 

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,730
 

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,470
 

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,440
 
 I must really be turning into a dog. 

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,700
 One that wishes for nothing more 

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,150
 than being loved by him. A puppy like that. 

9
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,710
 What the? 

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,470
 - Dad?
- Is he the one? 

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,780
 I'm sorry about earlier. 

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,370
 I couldn't even properly say goodbye because I was out of sorts. 

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,120
 I'm fine since I got to see you briefly. 

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,860
 See you tomorrow at school. 

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,950
 Unni! What do I do? 

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,200
 Let's first go and see. 

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,100
 We need to find out who it is and how much they know. 

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,120
 Jin Seo Won, that bastard must not know yet. 

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,450
 Seeing how you're still cursed. 

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,300
 Why should I give you money? 

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,170
 Then you must be okay with me sharing all the video clips I took. 

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,200
 - I'm sorry.
- Stop with the feeble nonsense. 

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,380
 Everyone take the day off tomorrow. 

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,380
 Did Ms. Han not come to work? 

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,770
 She took a sick day today. 

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,010
 Yul, Jun Seo was feeding Cocoa with his phone earlier. 

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,070
 Be honest. Where's Cocoa from, and who's her owner? 

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,110
 That person wouldn't seek out Mr. Jin, would he? 

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,330
 - I should go before he-
- No! 

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,810
 Just worry about yourself for now. 

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,490
 What will you do if you go out and get harassed? 

32
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,300
 What did I say I'd do if you showed up in front of me again? 

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,690
 Tell me where it is this instant. 

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,670
 Wherever that bastard, Eun Hwan, lives or works. 

35
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,950
 Hey, isn't he that guy from before? 

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,880
 I'm going to deliver some unbelievable news soon. 

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,420
 Would you believe there's a woman who's a teacher by day and a dog by night? 

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,810
 I told you, didn't I? 

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,020
 I said I will not let you be. 

40
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,280
 Why on Earth are you going this far? 

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,520
 Because she's family. 

42
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,020
 Do you remember where this is? 

43
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,720
 You always got beat up powerlessly whenever you were brought here, right? 

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,480
 H-Hyungnim, I just received a picture. 

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,010
 I think it's your home. 

46
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,100
 Come to last night's spot right now. 

47
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,220
 If you don't, I'll kill this f***er, okay? 

48
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,220
 Today is finally here. 

49
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,790
 Let me introduce that person. This is her! 

50
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,580
 Ms. Han, are you okay? 

51
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,970
 Ms. Hae Na! 

52
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,000
 - Ms. Han!
- One moment, please. 

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,080
 Stay away for a moment, please. 

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,690
 I was really going to tell you everything. 

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,060
 I do want to get closer to Cocoa. 

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,450
 If it's really you, I won't be scared. 

57
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,180
 You should know when to stop. 

58
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,640
 It's over now. 

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,070
 You'll forget about everything. 

60
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,630
 Mr. Jin, the kiss. 

61
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,450
 Can we do it one more time? 

62
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,690
 As a human to another human. 

63
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,950
The food's here!&lt;

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,930
It looks delicious!

65
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,300
Ta-da!

66
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,800
 
Good job! Good job!

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,890
Let's drink it up!

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,820
- Thank you!
 - Congratulations! 

69
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,620
 Congratulations! Congratulations on escaping life as a dog! 

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,190
Congratulations!

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,780
 

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,700
Are you really dating the math teacher now?

73
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,650
Hey, who are you calling "math teacher"? It's Jaebu*.
(Term used by a woman to address her little sister's husband.)

74
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,320
 Gosh! He said Jaebu! 

75
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Hey, watch your smile.

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,000
You said you're keeping it a secret at school.

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,130
 

78
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,980
What's with "Mr. Jin Seo Won"? You should change it.

79
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,000
Hello?

80
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,330
Aigoo, aigoo.

81
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,070
Gosh!

82
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,160
Han Hae Na must be so happy.

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,580
She lifted the curse

84
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,560
and has a beautiful relationship.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
Only good things await her.

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
Hey.

87
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,600
If you just stare at it, will the chicken gizzard walk into your mouth?

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,340
Eat it.

89
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,940
Aigoo.

90
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,670
Hey, look at this.

91
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,720
- What's that?
- Doesn't it look like chicken gizzard?

92
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,800
Sorry.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,270
I really thought it was a chicken gizzard!

94
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,610
They look exactly the same! Totally confusing.

95
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,610
Wait, I'm still saved as Ms. Han?

96
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,200
But we've already been dating for...

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,450
Oh, it's already been 22 hours.

98
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,410
I should change it, too.

99
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,550
What will you change it to?

100
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,800
A heart after "Ms. Han?"

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,500
That sounds really nice,

102
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,620
but isn't there something more

103
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,410
secretive and special?

104
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,850
Special...

105
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,280
Cocoa?

106
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,830
Geez, what's with Cocoa?

107
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,520
Do I still look like a dog to you, Mr. Jin?

108
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,020
 How about something like... 

109
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,460
Bong-meo and Seo-liet?

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,100
I see. You were envious, huh?

111
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,690
No, not envious...

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,160
Yes, I was envious.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,950
Then I guess we can be the Seo-Hae couple.

114
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,270
Seo-Hae?

115
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,930
Oh, Seo-Hae couple, as in, Seo Won and Hae Na? I like it.

116
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,190
 Then what about our names? 

117
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,860
Names?

118
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,440
How does Hae Dong Dong sound?

119
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,460
What's Hae Dong Dong?

120
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,980
You were cute when you were pacing around.
("Dong Dong" means to pace around in Korean.)

121
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,540
 Cocoa. 

122
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,070
I like Hae Dong Dong.

123
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,550
Mr. Lee.

124
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,680
What are you doing here right now?

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm making this.

126
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,170
You can enjoy your hobby at home.

127
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,180
How dare you spend school time-

128
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,470
You must be having fun playing Vice Principal.

129
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,590
Whoa!

130
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,250
Wow! This came out really nice!

131
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,640
They shouldn't be mixed.

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,030
Oh, that's right.

133
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,000
Wow, it's drenched in the scent of a tiger.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,530
Normal beasts won't even be able to come close.

135
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,430
Let's see...

136
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,740
by the way,

137
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,220
can't you end things here

138
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,480
and return now?

139
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,060
Gosh, the human world is so gray

140
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,530
and there's no greenery.

141
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,290
Can't you...

142
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,470
return back to the mountains?

143
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,660
You've done more than enough.

144
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,200
You know? This!

145
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,410
This is really uncomfortable. And what's this?

146
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,590
It's like a leash! Geez...

147
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,740
What I'm saying is...

148
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,070
If I was going to end things here,

149
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,970
I wouldn't have abandoned the mountains and come out in the first place.

150
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,460
Don't you miss it?

151
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,980
It's still our home.

152
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,700
our home.

153
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,270
No.

154
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,550
I can't stand the sight of it.

155
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,500
Who on earth is that woman for you to go this far-

156
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,610
I apologize.

157
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,940
Those two must lose what I've lost as well.

158
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,530
Those two must feel...

159
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,960
what I've felt as well.

160
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,790
 Seo-Hae couple, D+2. 

161
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,840
 There's a whole hour left until we meet. 

162
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,090
 I miss you. 

163
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,440
Uncle, are you dating Ms. Han?

164
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,950
Huh?

165
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,350
Yeah.

166
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,680
Do you know about that, too? Her secret?

167
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,230
Let's eat.

168
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,060
This looks good. It got a little burnt.

169
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,380
- Does that mean her curse is lifted?
- Yeah.

170
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,310
That's great!

171
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,530
 There's still 58 minutes left. 

172
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Are you two really dating?

173
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,850
Yeah.

174
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,460
Uncle?

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,770
If you want to date Ms. Hae Na,

176
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,970
there are some things you need to know.

177
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,730
First,

178
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,200
you can't ask her to be puppy-like.

179
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,900
Ms. Han is human now.

180
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,350
"Hand,"

181
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,120
"foot,"

182
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,590
"bang!"

183
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,950
You shouldn't command her to do these tricks.

184
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,390
When you go to a cafe, don't order coffee.

185
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,460
Order her a cocoa.

186
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,990
When you're attentive to her,

187
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,890
she'll act like she doesn't like it when she does.

188
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,600
So don't be too obviously attentive.

189
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,180
When it's been 100 days,

190
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,280
go to her desk and offer her a chocolate.

191
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,550
She'll be so happy.

192
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,790
And finally,

193
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,300
Ms. Han isn't aware of...

194
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,130
just how adorable,

195
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,430
affectionate,

196
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,130
and lovely she is.

197
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,030
So,

198
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,480
frequently remind her.

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,140
♫  Going home, I-  ♫

200
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,750
Aren't you going to school?

201
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,090
Hello.

202
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,870
What's that?

203
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,750
The Vice Principal bought it at a temple.

204
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,990
It's some sort of talisman.

205
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,250
Talisman?

206
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,130
Hey.

207
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,030
Hey, Ms. Han,

208
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,330
here's one for you, too.

209
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,200
Thank you.

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,570
It's great to wear on your dates.

211
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,590
It holds the perfect balance of yin and yang,

212
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,450
so there's no chance of breaking up.

213
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,150
- Go ahead.
- Oh, sure, sure.

214
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,990
Oh, it looks good on you.

215
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,780
Oh, right.

216
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm not sure if you heard about the school next door,

217
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,850
but teachers were kissing at school and were caught by the students.

218
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,650
Complaints about them reached even the Board of Education.

219
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,430
Married couples aren't allowed, either!

220
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,020
It's a mess these days.

221
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,130
Teachers should act like teachers.

222
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,660
Decent behavior and actions are a given, aren't they?

223
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,100
The display of affection at school is strictly prohibited.

224
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm going to enforce it myself, so be aware.

225
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,100
- Didn't he just about the balance between yin and yang?
- Well, you know...

226
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,140
If any of you happen to catch anyone,

227
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,250
you must report it to me right away.

228
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,410
Yes! I understand.

229
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,720
I just don't get it.

230
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,130
Right?

231
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,870
Going as far as to enforce...

232
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,100
No, not Vice Principal.

233
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,820
- Huh?
- That couple.

234
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,170
Was their love so overflowing that they had to act like that at school?

235
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,710
Why not? It's thrilling.

236
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,450
I always wanted to try it.

237
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,720
Holding hands behind people's backs and giving a smack on the lips?

238
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,540
Something like that?

239
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,180
Anyway, this has absolutely nothing to do with us.

240
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,480
Of course. It's been over 100 years since my love cells died out.

241
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,580
- Right?
- Yeah...

242
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,820
Ms. Han.

243
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,560
Hey.

244
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
Huh?

245
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,650
He's calling you.

246
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,600
Yes?

247
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,300
Can I have a tangerine?

248
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,950
No.

249
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,650
Hey! What's wrong with you? There's plenty.

250
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,490
Go ahead! Go ahead.

251
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,450
Hey, did you see today's lunch menu?

252
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,600
It's all grass. I'll become a cow at this rate.

253
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,260
What's that?

254
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,980
- What?
- Did you see that?

255
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,850
Am I the only one who saw that? Just now!

256
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,010
Gosh, no way.

257
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,850
 

258
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,710
Hey, hey! Ms. Hae Na, Ms. Hae Na! It's Ms. Hae Na!

259
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,100
Where?

260
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,870
No one's there.

261
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,960
What's wrong with you since earlier? You're scaring me.

262
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,930
Let's go.

263
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,260
 

264
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,600
 

265
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,100
"Dear Math Teacher.

266
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,980
To you who teaches the Euler's Formula.

267
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,480
The most beautiful formula in this world

268
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,330
isn't Euler, it's you."

269
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,610
Jin Seo Won!

270
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,580
"To you who teaches conditional probability.

271
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,490
What is the probability that you will love me unconditionally?"

272
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,660
Zero percent.

273
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,200
"To you who teaches mathematical induction.

274
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,540
My passionate heart and rushing blood

275
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,810
are only deduced by love for you.

276
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,270
To you who teaches the Pythagorean theorem.

277
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,890
Get rid of all the temptations around you

278
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,270
and forget about them.

279
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,790
This whole class is insane.

280
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,680
Ms. Han?

281
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,650
There are a few things you should know

282
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,050
if you want to date Uncle.

283
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,180
My uncle...

284
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,560
always draws a face

285
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,530
when he makes fried eggs.

286
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,930
Eat the face at the end,

287
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,920
or he'll get miffed but subtly.

288
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,930
At times, he'll close his eyes in the elevator

289
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,730
and open them right when he arrives at his floor,

290
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,240
and secretly be proud of it.

291
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,590
You must pretend not to know.

292
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,210
He'll get serious and say he didn't.

293
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,910
And...

294
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,950
he likes solving math problems.

295
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Please buy him a lot of new workbooks.

296
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,230
♫  Going home, I fret-  ♫

297
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,680
Sure, thanks, Yul.

298
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,250
 

299
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,850
"Can I see you for a moment?" Yes, of course!

300
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,370
Mr. Jin, acting like this at school is troublesome.

301
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,570
- What do you mean?
- We're at school,

302
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,960
but you keep flirting with me and seducing me!

303
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,890
Then I guess you don't need this, either.

304
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,160
What's that?

305
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,390
It's nothing.

306
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,920
What the?

307
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,070
 

308
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,140
The Yellow Sea*? This is our book.
("Seo-Hae" sounds like the Korean term for the Yellow Sea.)

309
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,270
I'm sorry for constantly flirting with you and seducing you.

310
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,220
It's okay.

311
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,360
You can seduce me all you want.

312
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,300
Vice principal. Vice Principal!

313
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,660
- Oh. Oh, thank you.
- What?

314
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,670
I just saw something weird.

315
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,000
Come. Come with me for a moment.

316
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,660
- Come with me!
- What did you see?

317
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,120
They're gone.

318
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,450
Just now, Ms. Hae Na and Mr. Seo Won were...

319
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,490
- Did they hug?
- No.

320
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,980
Kiss?

321
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,490
Did they hold hands and intertwine fingers?

322
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,650
Huh? Like this?

323
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,290
No...

324
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,310
- He gave her a book.
- Sorry?

325
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,240
But the atmosphere was-

326
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,860
The atmosphere can't be used as evidence, Ms. Yoon!

327
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,350
Okay?

328
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,440
Did you finish grading exams?

329
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,630
No.

330
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,750
Can you stand in line for me in tomorrow morning's assembly?

331
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,550
- That will be difficult.
- I see.

332
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,490
♫  Whatever I say, it's for you  ♫

333
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,870
♫  Learning all the love songs I taught you  ♫

Oh! Why'd you bring me here?

336
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,690
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

337
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,240
What is it?

Whoa!

341
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,290
A rainbow.

342
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,630
- What do you think?
- It's so pretty.

343
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,690
It's been a while since I saw a rainbow.

Hey, hey! You're too loud, you punks.

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,970
Stop chatting.

351
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,910
- Hey, Class Pres., start by opening the curtains.
- Okay!

352
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,890
Guys, follow Min Jae and grab your rackets and birdies.

353
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,150
 Okay! 

354
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,460
I thought we were playing dodgeball today!

355
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,340
Here you go.

356
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,170

- Three. Here's three.

358
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,060
Hey, guys, quiet down.

359
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,590
Ms. Han...

360
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,560
It's beautiful.

361
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,920
Are you okay?

362
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,880
I heard you suddenly fainted. What's wrong?

363
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,600
Were you possessed by something?

364
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,350
Why was my face on the wall?

365
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,570
Come on, Min Ji Ah...

366
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,770
You're not Min Ji Ah.

367
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,150
Come on!

368
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,720
You evil spirit!

369
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,430
Begone!

370
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,420
That scarf...

371
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,750
- Satan!
- seemed like mine.

372
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,440
Begone!

373
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,060
In the name

374
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,610
of faith,

375
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,720
hope, and love,

376
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,300
I shall drive you away.

377
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,130
That memory...

378
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,690
Could that be my memory, too?

379
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,490
Ms. Spirit, do you see that light?

380
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,920
Please follow it.

381
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,660
Shoo!

382
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,090
Shoo!

383
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,610
Is it my past life or something?

384
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,710
Hey.

385
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,650
Are you okay?

386
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm just worried.

387
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,770
Why would you be worried?

388
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,200
Well,

389
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,230
you said you were sick for three years.

390
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,140
Shamanic illness is still an illness, so you must've been in pain.

391
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,900
I'm all right now.

392
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,340
Then why did you faint earlier?

393
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,190
I must still have some homework left.

394
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,250
Homework?

395
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,820
Once I finish that,

396
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,810
I'll be able to learn more about myself.

397
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,750
Gosh, you were so cute as a dog.

398
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,650
Why?

399
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,610
Are you craving one?

400
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,320
No.

401
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,760
As if.

402
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,100
- Hey, you know...
- Yeah?

403
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,070
Never mind.

404
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,890
Hey.

405
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,950
Never mind.

406
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,500
What is it? Huh?

407
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,470
Huh? What is it?

408
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,390
Well, it's been

409
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,570
too long ago for me.

410
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,990
Yeah?

411
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,230
Appetite and lust are two different things, right?

412
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,680
They probably are.

413
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,720
Yes, right.

414
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,980
Wait, elaborate.

415
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,860
So appetite is desire for food.

416
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,450
And lust is...

417
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,160
desire to "do it," right?

418
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,910
Well...

419
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,470
Yeah?

420
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,400
- I was enjoying some chicken gizzard.
- Okay.

421
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,220
Then, I suddenly saw something and wanted to kiss it.

422
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,140
What did you see?

423
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,760
You don't need to know.

424
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,720
What did you see?

425
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,230
What was it?

426
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,820
What was it?

427
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,020
- Woo Taek's lips!
- Gosh!

428
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,590
Unni, are you crazy?

429
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,040
It was my appetite. My appetite momentarily turned into lust.

430
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,980
This is all because of the chicken gizzard. Chicken gizzard!

431
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,080
Do you want to eat it?

432
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,530
No.

433
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,970
Then what about this?

434
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,130
Aren't you curious?

435
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,560
♫  I need your love  ♫

436
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,400
♫  You can get some  ♫

437
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,620
Want to try this?

438
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,760
No!

439
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm not curious at all!

440
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,430
I guess you don't really like it.

441
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,120
No!

442
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,460
I like it.

443
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,190
 Don't come home. 

444
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,670
 I invited Woo Taek. I'm going to confirm. 

445
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,150
You're treating me to fried chicken? What gives?

446
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,470
I was hungry...

447
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,870
so I might as well.

448
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,160
You feel bad about something, huh?

449
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,070
Woo Taek.

450
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,300
Yeah?

451
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,430
You're quite a great...

452
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,250
friend.

453
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,820
What are you saying?

454
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,310
Woo Taek.

455
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,120
Can't one kiss be allowed between friends?

456
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,570
between friends?

457
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,600
I feel nothing. Eat up.

458
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,300
Whoa!

459
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,390
My appetite is out of control. Wow!

460
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,240
Eat up.

461
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,100
I should be the one dropping you off.

462
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,040
It's okay. I have a lot of time today, anyway.

463
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,820
I can go home late.

464
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,870
Your sister is still at work?

465
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,170
Yes, it seems so.

466
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,350
Whoa, we're here.

467
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,870
I came here so often as Cocoa.

468
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,710
Would you like to come in?

469
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,290
Sorry?

470
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,860
Stay until your sister gets home.

471
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
Yul's not home?

472
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,850
He said he was sleeping over at a friend's house.

473
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,820
It's been a while since I came as a human

474
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,550
and it feels very different.

475
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,020
- Does it?
- Yes.

476
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,190
Would you like a drink?

477
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,610
Yes.

478
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,840
 Confirmed. You can come home now. 

479
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,270
Is that your sister?

480
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,470
Yes.

481
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,790
What did she say?

482
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,130
Well...

483
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,210
she says she's going to be a while and for me to take my time.

484
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,840
- Would you like some fruit?
- Yes.

485
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,690
Aren't you...

486
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,320

Yes.

492
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,470
Can I use your bathroom?

493
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,420
Yes, it's over there.

494
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,520

No, I just looked in the mirror. The mirror.

00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,720
this isn't school.

505
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,710
That's right.

506
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,180
Then...

507
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,310
can I do...

508
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,730
whatever I want?

509
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:38,300
♫  Dancing down to their red silhouette  ♫

510
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:47,440
♫  Walking towards me, happy, but I'm sad  ♫

511
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,110
 Jin Seo Won! 

512
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,650
- What the?
- What are you doing?

513
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,400
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing here out of the blue?

514
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,600
I came because I wanted to see you, man.

515
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,330
Actually, I think I left something here the last time I was here.

516
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,900
- Let me get it.
- Okay.

517
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,830
Hey, Yul. How could you not come out-

518
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,440
The door's locked...

519
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,540
It's adolescence.

520
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,420
We should leave him alone.

521
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,010
Adolescence?

522
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,640
I'll be quiet.

523
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,820
 Ms. Han, just come outside. 

524
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,580
 If we tell him... 

525
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,010
 Mr. Jin! My shoes! 

526
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,210
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

527
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,530
My noona asked me to send these to her.

528
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,560
Tell her to buy new ones.

529
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,580
The delivery fee will cost more.

530
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,940
Exactly.

531
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,550
You're right.

532
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,300
Are they her favorite pair?

533
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,510
Hold on.

534
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,530
- Uncle, what's wrong?
- Why are you here?

535
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,950
Well, it was more boring than I expected.

536
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,500
Didn't you go to study?

537
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,170
O-Of course! I absolutely didn't go to play games.

538
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,710
- Go back.
- Huh?

539
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,480
Mr. Bo Gyeom is over right now.

540
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,680
- And?
- And...

541
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,110
he must be going through something. He's...

542
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,210
crying.

543
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

544
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,150
The situation is pretty bad.

545
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,960
It's that bad?

546
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,780
Gosh, Hyung.

547
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,980
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

548
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,300
Huh?

549
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,770
Yul was at his friend's house. That's right.

550
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,700
- Huh?
- That's right.

551
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,490
Wait...

552
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,230
Mr. Lee, it's all right.

553
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:39,100
Life is full of ups and downs.

554
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,380
Hyung, you look better now.

555
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,490
- Y-Yeah, yeah...
- Right?

556
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,090
Fighting!

557
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,560
Fighting.

558
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,460
What's wrong with this?

559
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,090
 What the? 

560
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,020
The door won't open, right?

561
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,880
It wouldn't open earlier.

562
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,190
Really?

563
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,060
It must be broken.

564
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,150
I see.

565
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,430
What's wrong with this?

566
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,670
L-Let's open it next time.

567
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,030
But... But it's my room.

568
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,140
You'll get hurt.

569
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,470
Give it a hard push.

570
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,810
Want to watch a movie?

571
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,840
What movie?

572
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,000
There's one I wanted to watch.

573
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,520
Let's watch that.

574
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,720
Sure, sure. Let's watch a movie.

575
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,280
Which movie?

576
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,910
 Met you on a marsh or something. 

577
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,240
Fun, right?

578
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,190
 I reckon that's a patty. 

579
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,760
 Well, that's still not bad for a city fellar. 

580
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:43,510
 This town certainly takes me back to the time when I was just a little ol' shirttail boy in Kentucky. 

581
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:15,680
♫  I miss you whenever and wherever  ♫

582
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,990
♫  It's really a weird thing  ♫

583
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,470
♫  When you look at me  ♫

584
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:31,750
♫  It feels like the whole world is closing in on me  ♫

585
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:38,080
♫  Step by step, closer to you, should I get closer to you?  ♫

586
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,770
♫  I won't let go of you  ♫

587
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:47,870
♫  Someday, sometime, someone, that's you  ♫

588
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:52,980
♫  I like that we've become "us"  ♫

589
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:58,540
♫  Someday, that day, full of love  ♫

590
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:04,190
♫  I want to stay with you forever  ♫

591
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:27,140
♫  It's blinding, I sink in your smile rather than the sunlight  ♫

592
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:38,700
♫  It feels like you've entered my calm heart  ♫

593
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:45,090
♫  In this nice breeze, my heart flutters  ♫

594
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:48,820
♫  Everything feels new  ♫

595
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:56,100
♫  Someday, sometime, someone, that's you  ♫

596
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,060
♫  I like that we've become "us"  ♫

597
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,640
 

598
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:04,100
 Can't one kiss be allowed between friends? 

599
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,270
No!

600
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,440
Why do I keep thinking about that?

601
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,040
Let's work. Work!

602
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,310
- Unni!
- Yeah.

603
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,470
How is Uncle?

604
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,220
He's receiving dialysis in the treatment room.

605
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,490
His condition suddenly worsened.

606
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,440
According to Woo Taek,

607
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,730
we should be prepared for the worst.

608
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,090
Is your Uncle all right?

609
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,620
Yes, he's admitted for now.

610
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,500
And he finished his dialysis, too.

611
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,090
So, he couldn't turn back into human because he couldn't lift his curse?

612
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,420
Yes.

613
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,350
It was when I was little.

614
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:50,020
I think it's been about 18 years.

615
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,650
But...

616
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,460
no one knows how this curse all started?

617
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,700
Yes.

618
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:05,030
Wouldn't you be able to find out how to end it if you figure out how it started?

619
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,080
End it?

620
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,750
Then your uncle, your sister,

621
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,940
and you can all become happy.

622
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,460
I don't think we've ever thought about it like that. We just...

623
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,990
always thought this was a given

624
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,110
ever since we were born.

625
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,510
Nothing is a given.

626
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,340
Ms. Han.

627
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,290
I'll be by your side no matter what happens.

628
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,730
Do you have a conundrum?

629
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,640
Ms. Yoon,

630
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,370
I also saw everything you saw.

631
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,280
I'm also aware of everything.

632
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,620
Ms. Yoon.

633
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,030
Yeah?

634
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,900
Love is so futile, isn't it?

635
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,730
I know.

636
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,330
It'll be futile.

637
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,410
It is futile.

638
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,110
I fainted a couple of days ago.

639
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,920
In the historical archives room.

640
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,450
I need to know

641
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,330
why that happened.

642
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,450
Did you take your anemia medication?

643
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,070
You shouldn't forget to take it.

644
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,250
You must be hiding something.

645
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,000
Mr. Lee, would you like a reading?

646
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,880
Choose three cards.

647
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,030
You're quite a distinguished person.

648
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,190
Although no one recognizes you.

649
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,600
Everyone thinks this is a chicken, but it's actually a phoenix.

650
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,090
Although you smile,

651
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,260
your intentions lie elsewhere.

652
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,230
A bleak wind blows.

653
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,700
This black portion just looks like an empty mountain.

654
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,920
But it was originally a painting of a field covered with silver grass.

655
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,930
You must feel unsettled at even the slightest breeze.

656
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,490
You hover around the door to the afterworld

657
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,420
yearning for someone who's dead.

658
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,160
That's why you abandoned it.

659
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,480
You abandoned your green forest for that dead woman.

660
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,070
To sword dance like some mangnani*.
("Mangnani" means executioner in Korean.)

661
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,220
When the dead woman doesn't even expect you to.

662
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,660
 This has... 

663
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,060
nothing to do with us, right?

664
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,690
Where did it go...

665
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,960
Yeah, Hyung.

666
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:50,160
Hyung.

667
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,410
Hyung?

668
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,600
Is he not in?

669
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:41,380
   ​

670
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:55,590
♫  I space out all day thinking about you  ♫

671
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:00,610
♫  I'm like this every chance I get, it makes me laugh  ♫

672
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:05,460
♫  My head is full of sweet words  ♫

673
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:10,760
♫  Everything, I like everything about you  ♫

674
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,560
♫  For a while, my heart felt as if something was covering it up  ♫

675
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,330
♫  No opening for the light to shine, there were no  ♫

676
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:24,500
 

677
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,490
 Have you noticed Bo Gyeom acting weird these days? 

678
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,870
 He seemed unfamiliar, as if he was someone else. 

679
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,140
 It's this puppy, huh? 

680
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,540
 The puppy with a story you're entangled with. 

681
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,560
 That's odd. Dogs usually like me so much that they race up to me. 

682
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,210
 But I feel like they're avoiding me these days. 

683
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,300
 Your fever is above 39°C! 

684
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:49,380
 They say a piece of metal that's had a taste of blood will continue to thirst for blood. 

685
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,800
 Who are you?
