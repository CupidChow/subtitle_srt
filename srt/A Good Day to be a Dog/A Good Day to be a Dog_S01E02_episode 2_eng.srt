00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,468
 

3
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:15,928
 

4
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:37,648
 

5
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:43,558
 

6
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,558
Stop right there!

7
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:53,458
Stop!

8
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,658
Stop!

9
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,148
Move!

10
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:05,908
Are you okay?

11
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:07,828
I am okay.

12
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:05,518
 

13
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:07,928
Ms. Han.

14
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,208
 

15
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,138
Where did she go?

16
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:39,058
 No way, right? 

17
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,168
 It can't be. No way. 

18
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:44,318
 How could he be scared of me? I'm so small. 

19
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:57,038
 No. Calm down. 

20
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,648
 I can't run to him like a zombie. 

21
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,758
 I need to show him that I'm cute. 

22
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:05,528
 I won't hurt you. I won't bite you. 

23
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:09,648
 I pay taxes and make donations. I'm a good dog. 

24
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:11,928
Isn't this it?

25
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:13,818
It was definitely around here.

26
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,618
She must've changed already.

27
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:17,628
Did she break the curse?

28
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:19,228
Gosh, seriously...

29
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,568
 Gosh, I'm going crazy. 

30
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:25,468
What are you doing over there?

31
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:27,728
Hyung.

32
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,278
 - Mr. Bo Gyeom? 
- Are you drunk?

33
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,358
What are you doing up there?

34
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:33,608
There's a rat.

35
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,588
 A rat? A rat? 

36
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,998
A rat?

37
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,798
My gosh.

38
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,868
All right, let's see.

39
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:46,878
Where did you come from?

40
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,698
Gosh, you're so cute.

41
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:49,928
Where's your owner?

42
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:52,508
 You're my owner. 

43
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,778
Is it the owner's dog?

44
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,048
 No, you can have me. 

45
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,588
Jjong!

46
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,848
Gosh, where were you?

47
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,458
Gosh, where did you lose your collar?

48
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,608
Well, I'm not sure, but it looks like things are resolved.

49
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:16,948
Right, Jjong?

50
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:19,098
Let's go.

51
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:27,318
Hyung, a rat this big was jumping up and down here.

52
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:30,718
He was going to eat me. It came from there.

53
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,958
What do you mean, a rat?

54
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,548
How much did you drink, anyway?

55
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,468
Why did you drink so much you lost your mind?

56
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:41,848
Which one was the math teacher?

57
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,328
The one that was perched up.

58
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:44,388
How do you know?

59
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:47,208
She was drooling over the one that was standing.

60
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,498
He's a Korean history teacher.

61
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,908
Do they hire teachers based on looks these days?

62
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,278
Unlike vets, right?

63
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:55,828
Seriously...

64
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,928
Where did Ms. Hae Na go, by the way?

65
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,348
Huh?

66
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,728
 

67
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,358
Mr. Jin Seo Won is calling.

68
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,768
Don't answer for now.

69
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,478
Don't answer. Don't answer.

70
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:23,648
I should text him, at least.

71
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:29,208
Mr. Jin, I'm sorry, but something urgent came up.

72
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,498
 I'll see you later. 

73
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:35,998
The first attempt was a total failure.

74
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,108
Don't count my attempts.

75
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,938
There won't be second or third ones.

76
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,958
I'll make sure to get it done next time.

77
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,318
You don't have control over it.

78
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:47,818
Isn't Mr. Jin kind of weird?

79
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:50,738
Why is he afraid of such a tiny dog?

80
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,928
I suppose he had a traumatic experience.

81
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:56,758
But I'm so ridiculously cute.

82
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,238
What do I do now?

83
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,318
What do you mean, what do you do?

84
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:06,718
You have to kiss him and break the curse.

85
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,968
So how am I supposed to kiss him?

86
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,018
He hates dogs so much.

87
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:12,558
Just do it while he's sleeping.

88
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,628
- How?
- You can just date him.

89
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,748
Who said she would? Does Hae Na want that?

90
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,608
Come on. I have Mr. Bo Gyeom.

91
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:23,638
Yesterday, Mr. Bo Gyeom was like, "You're so cute."

92
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:27,608
He held me like this. Like this. Did you see that?

93
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:31,078
It's because you were a dog. He won't do that to a human.

94
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:36,348
Uncle, don't worry.

95
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,368
I'll make sure to get it resolved.

96
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:41,048
I'm sure you would.

97
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,158
The situation got worse now.

98
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:44,418
What do you mean?

99
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:45,778
You kissed him by mistake.

100
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:47,918
You said you'd treat him to a meal to apologize, so he went out,

101
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,488
but you dashed without paying.

102
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,908
- The math teacher thinks you're-
- A dine and dasher.

103
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:54,058
- Yes, a dine and dasher.
- Yes, you dined and dashed.

104
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:55,328
That's exactly it.

105
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,778
He'd think you're basically a scum.

106
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:58,808
That's right. A scum.

107
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:01,208
I'd be annoyed just to see her face.

108
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,968
Dine and dasher.

109
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:08,588
Come here, come here!

110
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,968
Stay calm!

111
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,358
 Did she see that? 

112
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:54,058
Hello.

113
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,928
Good morning.

114
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:57,518
Hello.

115
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:01,498
Won, you didn't forget about us hanging out after work today, right?

116
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,928
What are you hanging out for?

117
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:06,458
He made me come out and drive last night.

118
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,698
So I want to make him pay for it.

119
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,788
Mr. Seo Won, did you drink?

120
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,038
Yes.

121
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:21,158
What did you talk about with Ms. Hae Na that you drank so much?

122
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:24,518
Did you drink with Ms. Hae Na alone?

123
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,058
Why?

124
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,278
There was a bit of a situation.

125
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:29,968
What situation?

126
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,518
Ms. Hae Na forced you to drink with her, right?

127
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:39,768
I see her all the time since we both teach Korean literature. So I know.

128
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,568
She's kind of immature.

129
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:45,588
It's kind of tiring to be with her.

130
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,358
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

131
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:52,978
I'm not sure about talking behind her back when you don't know her well.

132
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:56,818
Right? I don't normally say stuff like this, either.

133
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,468
I should get ready for the class.

134
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,328
You said Ms. Hae Na suddenly disappeared last night.

135
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:06,298
Did something happen?

136
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,568
I'll go to the printing room.

137
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:11,168
Okay, okay.

138
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:24,678
Did you take care of the urgent situation last night?

139
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,978
Yes, my sister suddenly called me.

140
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,808
I'm so sorry.

141
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,968
Did anything else happen by chance?

142
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:34,028
L-Like what?

143
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,728
Never mind.

144
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,218
Give me your bank account number.

145
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:45,118
I said I'll treat you, but I ended up dining and dashing.

146
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,398
Send it to Mr. Lee. He's the one who paid.

147
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:49,578
Right, why did he suddenly come?

148
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:51,488
- Did you see him?
- No.

149
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:52,888
I didn't.

150
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:55,118
You said he paid, so...

151
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:02,258
I see. You called him to set us up, didn't you?

152
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,508
Yes.

153
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:07,848
If so, since you decided to help me,

154
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:12,028
how about we meet regularly so I can get tips from you?

155
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,828
- Regularly?
- Yes.

156
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,938
Is that too much?

157
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:17,688
Yes, it is.

158
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,358
Just think of it as a charity and doing good deeds.

159
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,378
Please help me out.

160
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:34,838
I'll just help you once, then.

161
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:36,358
Really?

162
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:41,618
I'm going somewhere with Hyung tonight.

163
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,008
Do you want to go instead of me?

164
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,148
Aren't you coming with us?

165
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,878
- Of course not.
- Why not?

166
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,758
Why do I have to go?

167
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:51,718
If it's just the two of us, it'd feel too much like a date.

168
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,248
I thought you wanted to go on a date. No?

169
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:57,248
Well, yes, but...

170
00:10:57,248 --> 00:11:03,408
What if I die of a heart attack while hanging out alone with him?

171
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:10,448
I didn't know you liked him that much.

172
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:14,488
Well, I'm just wondering, what if?

173
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,808
Okay.

174
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,618
I'll come with you, but

175
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,868
feel free to do whatever afterward.

176
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:34,838
Thank you.

177
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:53,818
Two men are meeting at a place like this?

178
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:56,198
Ms. Hae Na.

179
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,688
- Ms. Chae Ah.
- What brings you here?

180
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,028
How about you?

181
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,338
Did Mr. Bo Gyeom invite you?

182
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:04,388
No, Mr. Jin did.

183
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,598
Did he invite you, too-

184
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,938
No, Mr. Bo Gyeom did.

185
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,118
- Ms. Hae Na.
- Yes.

186
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,918
You're interested in Mr. Bo Gyeom, right?

187
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,448
Pardon? Well...

188
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:18,128
It's just the two of us. You can tell me.

189
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,778
Well, um...

190
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:21,498
I'll help you so you two work out.

191
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:23,518
No, it's okay.

192
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:27,138
Why not? You make a nice couple since you both look like puppies.

193
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,698
Mr. Seo Won.

194
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,438
This place looks so fun.

195
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:36,148
Have you been to an escape room before?

196
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:37,308
No.

197
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:40,488
Ms. Chae Ah said she wanted to come, too.

198
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:42,158
Did you invite Ms. Hae Na?

199
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,358
- Yes.
- I see.

200
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:46,348
I thought you two weren't very close.

201
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,128
You're wrong. We're very close.

202
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,908
Right?

203
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,218
Yes.

204
00:12:56,258 --> 00:13:01,318
Put these on, put your hands on each other's shoulders, and follow me.

205
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:03,378
Do we put it on like this?

206
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:09,168
Walk slowly.

207
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,268
- Are we doing okay?
 - During the set amount of time, solve the mystery 

208
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:19,108
 using hidden clues and escape the room. 

209
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,618
It's scary.

210
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:27,398
The code can't be just 1234...

211
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,168
No.

212
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:31,828
Let's look.

213
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,568
There must be a clue.

214
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,308
Should we look?

215
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,628
Are these clues?

216
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,728
Are they? Try solving the problem, Mr. Jin.

217
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:55,688
You're definitely a math teacher.

218
00:13:56,998 --> 00:14:00,438
Over here. I think there's something here.

219
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,488
But it's too high up.

220
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,378
Seo Won, could you prop me up?

221
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:09,838
I think there's something up there.

222
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,198
I don't want to. You're heavy.

223
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,488
Forget about the math problem. I think we need to open this. Right?

224
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,378
- This is definitely it.
- Yes.

225
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:20,408
Could you prop me up, then?

226
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:25,138
Well...

227
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:26,308
Ms. Hae Na.

228
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:27,678
Yes?

229
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,468
Oh? There's something.

230
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:39,278
Let this go!

231
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:42,368
Hold on, hold on.

232
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,378
Are you okay?

233
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:47,058
We found it. We found it.

234
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,208
 

235
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,388
 You have five minutes left. 

236
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,428
We really don't have much time left.

237
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,898
We need to hurry. Hurry.

238
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,408
Ms. Hae Na, is there anything there?

239
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:22,428
No, there isn't. I really have no idea. What do we do?

240
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,788
We're trapped.

241
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:27,078
No, it's four.

242
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:44,978
It opened.

243
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,488
We're escaping. We're escaping.

244
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,638
We're escaping!

245
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:50,048
What?

246
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,358
I think I could stretch it to midnight.

247
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:58,468
I'm breaking the curse today. Just wait and see-

248
00:15:58,468 --> 00:15:59,998
Ms. Han.

249
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,488
Why are you coming out alone?

250
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,388
They went to the bathroom.

251
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,318
I'm so sorry about earlier.

252
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,198
I was so scared.

253
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,468
It's okay.

254
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:15,258
Should I buy you fried chicken and beer to make it up to you?

255
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,508
Deal?

256
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:19,468
The three of you should go. I'll get going.

257
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,458
Huh? Why?

258
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,108
I'm a bit tired.

259
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,228
Just sit with us for a bit and leave, then. Okay?

260
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:28,808
No, I'll get going now.

261
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,568
No.

262
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:33,608
Just one beer, please?

263
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,088
I actually don't like drinking that much.

264
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,538
You get better as you drink. Please?

265
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:41,078
- No, I don't like it, I said.
- Don't be like that. Just a tiny bit.

266
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:43,428
Drink just a tiny bit, please?

267
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:46,328
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

268
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,608
How many times did I say no just now?

269
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,078
I just wanted to get close to you-

270
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,598
Why all of a sudden?

271
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,588
Because of Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom?

272
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,228
Yes, you said you'd set us up.

273
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,668
That's why I came all the way here.

274
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:11,538
Yes, you must've done a lot for us from your perspective.

275
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,708
I happened to hear it before.

276
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,828
That you feel uncomfortable with me.

277
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,438
You said there's a reason why.

278
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:23,878
Why do you feel uncomfortable with me, anyway?

279
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,618
I didn't mean it like that-

280
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:30,238
What are you, a nutcracker?

281
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,038
And am I a walnut?

282
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,358
You keep crushing me over and over and over again.

283
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:44,228
I need to know why so I can do something about it.

284
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,498
Never mind. I'll get going.

285
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:03,158
Ms. Han, the thing is...

286
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,758
Bye, then.

287
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,368
Why did I have to flip out, then?

288
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:41,588
I've been clinging to him a lot lately.

289
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,978
He must've thought I was like a leech.

290
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,208
Huh? Why are there three glasses?

291
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:58,968
Wow, he told me he was tired.

292
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:02,028
Does he feel energized because I left?

293
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:04,138
 Ms. Hae Na, why did you leave? 

294
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,248
 Come back if you change your mind. 

295
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:10,228
It's not about how I feel.

296
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,578
Huh? Hold on.

297
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:18,018
Excuse me.

298
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:29,368
â™«  Nature is complete, enchanting night for our love  â™«

299
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:36,388
â™«  We will be in sweet meadows in the enchanting night  â™«

300
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:39,848
â™«  Graceful together  â™«

301
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:47,988
â™«  Timeless memories that love will sustain from now  â™«

302
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:55,268
â™«  Forever dancing in each other's minds  â™«

303
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:56,858
â™«  But a loving...  â™«

304
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,978
 

305
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:03,988
â™«  Forever hearts, timeless melodies  â™«

306
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:08,828
â™«  As the sun rises, the sun will remain  â™«

307
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:11,218
â™«  It will transcend  â™«

308
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:13,728
 The math teacher is so harsh. 

309
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:15,328
Why is he playing so hard to get?

310
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:18,138
Even the neighborhood dogs would get pissed off if rejected repeatedly like that.

311
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:19,498
Right?

312
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,188
Why does he hate me so much?

313
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,808
I really have no idea.

314
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:27,008
I really didn't do anything wrong to him.

315
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:30,108
Didn't do anything wrong...

316
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:35,638
Did you say he's afraid of dogs?

317
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:39,158
I don't know if it's because of the curse, but since you were kids,

318
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:43,278
the dogs in the neighborhood used to follow you.

319
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:46,558
Right. Why do dogs like us so much? We don't do anything for them.

320
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,468
I know. But you said he's really afraid of dogs.

321
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:55,118
But I'm sure all dogs in the area flock around her.

322
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:59,018
Let's just say you're really afraid of pigeons.

323
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:04,478
But imagine someone with ten pigeons on his shoulders is next to you.

324
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:07,938
Sometimes, one of them comes up on his head and flaps its wings.

325
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,968
Sometimes, it poops, too.

326
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,038
Daebak.

327
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,098
Come to think of it, back then...

328
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,798
Let's see. Tteokbokki...

329
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:23,868
Gosh, we forgot soondae.

330
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,858
What? Where did he go?

331
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,048
 And in that moment, too. 

332
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:36,868
I heard the mango one is good.

333
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:41,518
But that one looks good, too.

334
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,788
What do we do?

335
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:51,528
Right. It happened then, too.

336
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,138
I'll leave now.

337
00:21:57,278 --> 00:21:58,598
That's it.

338
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:02,208
He's so afraid of dogs, but I keep attracting them.

339
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:07,738
He can't always do that since people can see him.

340
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,868
Woo Taek, you're a genius.

341
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:13,258
No, no. Go ahead and eat.

342
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,038
Genius.

343
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:23,568
You guys aren't allowed to approach me anymore.

344
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:35,088
Let's go to Kona.

345
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,308
I love it, I love it.

346
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:38,558
- Did you form your music group?
- We have a performance assessment?

347
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,388
I told you, you dummy.

348
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:41,618
Huh?

349
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,128
What's with this smell?

350
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:45,268
They're smoking.

351
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:48,388
Gosh, in their school uniform? How confident.

352
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,128
Let's go.

353
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:54,108
Ms. Han, Ms. Han!

354
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:55,688
Ms. Han, Ms. Han, Ms. Han!

355
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,058
Ms. Han, please yell at the Gyeonghoon High School students.

356
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:01,478
They're smoking in front of our school.

357
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,908
- Really?
- They do this all the time.

358
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:06,648
The cigarette smell drives me crazy.

359
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:07,988
Okay. I'll talk to them.

360
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,598
Really?

361
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,058
It's them, right?

362
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:34,568
Guys.

363
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,508
What kind of students smoke in front of a school?

364
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,268
Just keep going where you were going, Ahjumma.

365
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:49,188
I'm a teacher at Garam High School.

366
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,358
What? You're not even a teacher at our school.

367
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,158
You guys go to Gyeonghoon High, right?

368
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:55,858
What year and class are you in? Put out your cigarettes right now.

369
00:23:55,858 --> 00:24:00,568
I'll just smoke this one and put it out, Ma'am.

370
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:05,688
Gosh, you punk. Hey.

371
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:07,978
Are you crazy?

372
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:10,208
- What, you idiot?
- Are you smiling?

373
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:14,158
She's about to cry because you mocked her.

374
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:17,328
You can't make a woman cry. Right? Right?

375
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:20,008
Ma'am, are you crying?

376
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,178
What are your names?

377
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,648
Why don't you wear your name tags?

378
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:29,408
Ma'am, you just touched my chest, didn't you?

379
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:31,238
Gosh, isn't this sexual harassment?

380
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:34,558
Is it okay for a female teacher to touch male students' chests like that?

381
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,238
Should we report her?

382
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,188
Daebak.

383
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:43,408
No, let's just touch her and call it even.

384
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:47,428
Excuse me for a second, Ma'am.

385
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,558
She asked what your names are just now.

386
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,118
You'd better let go of this.

387
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:28,398
What's your name?

388
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:31,358
Sir.

389
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:37,178
They're Seo Chang Soo, Min Gyeong Seok, and Do Jae Min.

390
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:49,938
Move. Move!

391
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:00,818
Are you okay, Ms. Han?

392
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,398
Huh? Yes.

393
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,618
Kids these days aren't afraid of teachers.

394
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:08,768
Yes. Thank you.

395
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:11,258
See you later at school.

396
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:12,548
Okay.

397
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,438
Ms. Hae Na.

398
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,908
Is something going on? Why do you look so upset?

399
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:41,818
What? What's wrong with you?

400
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,668
Hello.

401
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:53,938
Is it because I went to bed late last night? I don't feel so good.

402
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:57,588
Why did you go to bed so late?

403
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,958
Why did you suddenly disappear yesterday?

404
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:09,338
Because of you, I just ate chicken talking about the weather.

405
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:10,868
I'm sorry.

406
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:17,438
If you're sorry, get me a souffle cheesecake.

407
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:19,298
Okay.

408
00:27:19,298 --> 00:27:23,438
I love souffle cheesecakes, too.

409
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:26,708
I'll get you one.

410
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,248
You like tiramisu.

411
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,888
Ask for it now.

412
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:34,288
I'm okay.

413
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,308
Hello.

414
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:45,578
Hello.

415
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,388
Hello.

416
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,578
"Peace Under Heaven" is a full-length novel.

417
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:38,668
Back in the day, full-length novels were published with subheadings.

418
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:41,538
Page 243. The third paragraph.

419
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:44,488
"It's Ho who destroyed the Qin dynasty."

420
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:48,048
Wow.

421
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:53,738
It's so hard to become a dog every night.

422
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,188
Mr. Jin.

423
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:22,808
What are you doing here at this time of day?

424
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:25,218
I don't have a class now, either.

425
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:29,118
Are you feeling better now?

426
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,888
I was a bit in shock this morning,

427
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,978
but I'm okay now.

428
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,198
It's so pathetic.

429
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:39,888
What kind of teacher is afraid of a student?

430
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:41,788
No.

431
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:44,148
It was enough to be afraid of.

432
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:48,728
Whoa, the kids were watching, and I had to discipline them.

433
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:50,588
But I wasn't sure what else to do.

434
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,188
I would've peed my pants if it were a dream-

435
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:59,748
Anyway, I'm okay now.

436
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:02,878
If it were a dream,

437
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:05,748
I would've peed my pants, too.

438
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,598
Right. Sorry about last night.

439
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:28,658
I'm sorry I suddenly lost my temper.

440
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:31,198
I'm sorry, too.

441
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:35,518
Thinking about it, I could see why you were mistaken.

442
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:41,840
Because of the situations that occur whenever I'm with you...

443
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:47,258
I gave you the impression that I'm avoiding you.

444
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,568
But...

445
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,018
To be honest, I...

446
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:07,738
Show him what you got.

447
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:12,768
Block properly. You'll break your bones otherwise.

448
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:29,378
Mr. Jin.

449
00:31:32,118 --> 00:31:33,928
I'm sorry.

450
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,568
I don't know what it is,

451
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:39,438
but you don't have to tell me if it's too difficult.

452
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:42,278
You're trying so hard to explain.

453
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:46,048
So I don't think it's because you dislike me. And...

454
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:50,928
everyone is in unique situations

455
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:55,568
and it's natural to have at least one secret of their own.

456
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:05,968
I'll get going now, then.

457
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,958
Ms. Han.

458
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:15,608
Thank you for understanding.

459
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,378
Sure.

460
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:22,348
And...

461
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:28,538
I'll do my best trying to set you up with Hyung, too.

462
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,208
Okay.

463
00:32:34,348 --> 00:32:35,658
Fighting.

464
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:38,108
Fighting.

465
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:46,958
Mr. Jin, I have a question.

466
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:51,418
You figured out the passcode in the first room. How did you do it?

467
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:58,878
 Another word for King is Imgeum*. So "Im" as in Imgeum. 
(King in Korean)

468
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,628
 The character for the dragon in Earthly Branches is "Jin." 

469
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:05,508
 Reverse a word. W.A.R. 

470
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:06,988
 It spells "war." 

471
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:12,508
So you're left with the clue "Imjin war."

472
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:15,808
Gosh, daebak. Imjinwoeran.*
(Japanese invasions of Korea)

473
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:21,318
By the way, they really made you want to escape the room.

474
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:25,158
Why did Hyung want to go to a place like that with just me?

475
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:27,068
It gives me the chills.

476
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:33,498
Jeonggye Monument at Mt. Baekdu

477
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:37,388
is a monument to create a border between the Joseon and Qing dynasties.

478
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:40,238
The monument says the Western side of it is the Yalu River

479
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:43,168
and the Eastern side of it is the Tumen River.

480
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,118
This might be in the exam. So make sure to memorize it, okay?

481
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:49,098
 Okay. 

482
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,758
That's it for today's class.

483
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:55,868
We'll have a fun debate in the next class.

484
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:01,798
The theme is, "If you can go back in history and reverse something,

485
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:05,128
when and where would you travel to?"

486
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,398
Okay?

487
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,958
Sir, are we being graded for this?

488
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,698
I'll make sure to grade you, at least.

489
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,538
I'm in trouble. What do I do?

490
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:14,228
Sir, how about you?

491
00:34:14,228 --> 00:34:18,508
When and where would you travel to?

492
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:22,098
I'd choose...1592.

493
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,438
Why?

494
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:28,328
Because a tragedy you can't escape from started then.

495
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,358
 

496
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:33,168
Catch him!

497
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:47,718
How should I make it?

498
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:13,558
So, have you picked the date to meet yet?

499
00:36:13,558 --> 00:36:16,248
Not yet, but I should.

500
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:19,938
Did you get to talk about dogs at all?

501
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:29,368
But...I think he wanted to hide that he's afraid of dogs.

502
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:30,848
Why?

503
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:36,638
I saw Mr. Jin smiling today.

504
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:44,378
I've never seen him smiling before.

505
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:47,898
Why make such a big deal out of it?

506
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:55,378
Hey, you'd better get close to him and break the curse.

507
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:03,258
Yes, hello?

508
00:37:03,258 --> 00:37:06,718
Hey, why is it so hard to reach you?

509
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:21,238
 Everyone is in unique situations 

510
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:25,808
 and it's natural to have at least one secret of their own. 

511
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,908
We ran out of ramen.

512
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:47,228
Uncle, I'm going to a convenience store. Do you want something?

513
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,568
What? Where did he go?

514
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:55,308
I'm getting expelled if I get caught smoking again.

515
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,648
Just get expelled, you idiot.

516
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,438
Geez.

517
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,208
Do some research on that bastard.

518
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,118
I want to beat him up with the kids sometime.

519
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:04,608
Should we mess up a kid from Garam High?

520
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:07,358
Don't just talk about it and do it.

521
00:38:09,898 --> 00:38:12,378
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

522
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:17,018
Geez, they're all pictures of themselves.

523
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:20,298
Wow, she's so pretty.

524
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:25,568
Huh? Is this it?

525
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,328
It's this bastard, right?

526
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:31,108
Doesn't he look kind of like me?

527
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,128
- Hello.
- Welcome.

528
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:36,658
Huh?

529
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:46,378
What?

530
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:50,408
Hey, buddy.

531
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,368
You want to come over here?

532
00:38:52,368 --> 00:38:55,278
Please call the police.

533
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:13,078
Yes. Hello?

534
00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:16,668
 Is this Ms. Han Hae Na of Garam High School? 

535
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:19,248
Yes, this is she.

536
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:21,588
 This is Hyeonseo Police Station. 

537
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:24,208
Yes, I see.

538
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:27,458
 You're Choi Yul's homeroom teacher, correct? 

539
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:32,808
Police Station?

540
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,848
What do we do with this?

541
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:43,628
Gosh, seriously.

542
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,148
I told you to call your parents.

543
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,488
Why won't you answer?

544
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:53,358
You should answer when an adult is talking to you.

545
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,348
Don't you have parents? Are you an orphan?

546
00:39:55,348 --> 00:39:58,558
Ma'am. Ma'am. Please calm down.

547
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:02,208
Apparently, your son and his friends started it first.

548
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,258
You should be apologizing to him.

549
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:07,888
I didn't hit him. I just dodged the punches.

550
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:09,898
He fell on his own because he tripped.

551
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:11,778
Stop lying.

552
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:17,268
My baby. What do we do with your face?

553
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:18,578
Baby?

554
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:21,378
Gosh, you're embarrassing me. That's enough, Mom!

555
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,438
You'd better stay put.

556
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:27,088
Hey...

557
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:28,378
where are your parents?

558
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:29,948
Where are they?

559
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,618
I don't have them.

560
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,688
See?

561
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:37,748
The ones who weren't disciplined at home always stick out.

562
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:41,488
You beat people up because you weren't taught at home.

563
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:44,808
Excuse me.

564
00:40:45,698 --> 00:40:47,648
You're being too harsh.

565
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,118
Ms. Han.

566
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:56,538
You're a young female teacher, and you can't seem to discipline the kids.

567
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:57,958
You'd better teach them well.

568
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,038
Don't cause harm to other kids.

569
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:03,918
I know. I guess he thought I was easy because I'm a young female teacher.

570
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:07,218
I was threatened by him this morning.

571
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:12,168
It's a civil offense, and I can bring criminal charges, right, Officer?

572
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:13,718
Yes, that's correct.

573
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:16,678
I caught your son smoking this morning.

574
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:20,468
I think that's why he took revenge on my student.

575
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,528
If you find it so unfair,

576
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:25,688
should we settle through the school violence committee?

577
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,608
School violence committee, my foot.

578
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:30,488
Is there any evidence? Is there?

579
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:38,188
Excuse me for a second.

580
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,628
He still has what he smoked this morning.

581
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,548
Kids can do stuff like that.

582
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,348
They should not.

583
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:55,328
And it's the teachers' and...

584
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:57,408
parents' job to teach them that.

585
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:05,108
 How could you do that, punk? 

586
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,058
 Why did you hit me? 

587
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,028
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

588
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:17,008
You didn't get hurt, right?

589
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:18,758
I'm okay.

590
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:21,028
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

591
00:42:21,028 --> 00:42:22,298
It's okay.

592
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:26,488
I feel bad that you got dragged into this because of me this morning.

593
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:30,998
But why didn't you call your parents?

594
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:33,348
Were you afraid you'd get scolded?

595
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:36,028
Well, it's because I really can't reach them.

596
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:38,248
They live in Australia.

597
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:39,768
Why didn't you tell me?

598
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,868
You should've told me during our counseling session.

599
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:44,268
Well, I don't know...

600
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:46,878
Do you live alone, then?

601
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:50,928
No, I live with a relative.

602
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:53,948
Why didn't you call them, then?

603
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,278
I'm sure he'd flip out.

604
00:42:55,278 --> 00:42:57,678
He'd make a big deal out of nothing.

605
00:42:57,678 --> 00:43:00,618
But you still should've.

606
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:02,278
Next time.

607
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,558
How do you get home from here? I'll drop you off.

608
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,768
The buses must've stopped running.

609
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:16,868
Gosh, when did it get so late?

610
00:43:18,068 --> 00:43:20,388
I'm so sorry, but you can go on your own, right?

611
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:22,438
I forgot I have something to do at home.

612
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:25,098
I'll get going now. Bye.

613
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,768
Ms. Han.

614
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:32,318
D-D-Don't come.

615
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,788
Don't come.

616
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:35,438
Bye.

617
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:42,998
Pick it up.

618
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:45,838
Hello? Oppa, I'm in trouble right now.

619
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:47,758
Ms. Han, what's going on?

620
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,218
I'm sorry.

621
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:53,678
Your phone... What do we do?

622
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:54,928
I'll take it out real quick.

623
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:57,808
No, it's okay. I threw it away on purpose. I was going to.

624
00:43:57,808 --> 00:44:00,718
You were talking on the phone just now. I'll take it out real quick.

625
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:03,718
I'm really okay. I never liked this phone.

626
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:06,068
I was going to get a new one. What a relief.

627
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:08,108
But if you throw it away here like this-

628
00:44:08,108 --> 00:44:10,388
No, it's okay.

629
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:13,528
You should go home now.

630
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:15,598
Bye.

631
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:16,768
It looks fine, though.

632
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:18,188
Bye.

633
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,768
See you.

634
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:25,218
Why won't she say anything?

635
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:27,988
Your sister is totally drunk.

636
00:44:27,988 --> 00:44:30,478
Come pick her up, please!

637
00:44:30,478 --> 00:44:31,948
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

638
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:34,958
It's midnight... Why are you so heavy?

639
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,718
- Gotta go. Gotta go.
- Go home. Hurry up and go home.

640
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:40,138
No, no. She's a friend.

641
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,668
Why are you still here?

642
00:44:49,668 --> 00:44:50,818
Ms. Han, I got your phone.

643
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:53,088
W-What time is it?

644
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:55,748
It's 12.

645
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,978
Dog... Ms. Han...

646
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:32,238
Gosh, I wanted her to take her sister. Why won't she...

647
00:45:32,238 --> 00:45:34,578
Gosh, it's past 12.

648
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:39,618
I don't want to kiss.

649
00:45:40,598 --> 00:45:44,658
But my lips are sticking out.

650
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,968
Did you eat pickled garlic?

651
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,708
 Yul, wake up. 

652
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:57,518
 Wake up. 

653
00:45:58,618 --> 00:46:00,448
 Are you awake? 

654
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,348
 Let's run away for now. 

655
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:09,058
It's a dog.

656
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:12,358
Ms. Han is a dog?

657
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:16,498
Hold on!

658
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:19,968
Ms. Han, hold on.

659
00:46:22,428 --> 00:46:24,608
Hold on, Ms. Han.

660
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,668
I caught you.

661
00:46:27,668 --> 00:46:29,798
 These damn stubby legs. 

662
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,838
It's definitely a dog.

663
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:42,788
She's a dog.

664
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:46,528
How could a person turn into a dog?

665
00:46:48,468 --> 00:46:51,828
No, I was mistaken.

666
00:46:51,828 --> 00:46:54,508
 Yes, you were mistaken. 

667
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:57,388
No.

668
00:46:57,388 --> 00:47:00,248
She definitely changed in front of me.

669
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,718
Is this really Ms. Han, then?

670
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:09,398
Is it you?

671
00:47:09,398 --> 00:47:11,068
 No. 

672
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:15,058
No. This makes no sense.

673
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:17,928
This is just a dog. It's not her.

674
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:20,098
 Yes, I'm a dog. Ruff ruff. 

675
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:23,808
 So please just let me go. 

676
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:32,968
What do I do?

677
00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:36,988
Do I have to go to the police station?

678
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:40,888
No, they'll think I'm crazy.

679
00:47:40,888 --> 00:47:43,038
Should I call 911?

680
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:44,528
A hospital?

681
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:47,628
A lab?

682
00:47:53,598 --> 00:47:57,088
Ms. Han, what do I do?

683
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:01,148
Say something.

684
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:04,248
 You can just let me go. 

685
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,798
What a well-behaved dog.

686
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,028
Yes.

687
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:30,788
It knows how to open the window.

688
00:48:56,528 --> 00:48:59,158
Hold on a second, Ma'am.

689
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:05,668
Just wait a moment.

690
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:18,328
 How do I get out of here? 

691
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:28,038
She's still at my place.

692
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:29,968
I should get her some tea...

693
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:33,578
Do dogs drink tea?

694
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:48,038
Won't you have any?

695
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:51,308
 I don't want it. 

696
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:03,858
Ma'am, do you live alone?

697
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:07,768
Your family must be worried.

698
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:09,908
Should I call them for you?

699
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:13,708
I brought all of your stuff.

700
00:50:14,948 --> 00:50:18,348
Your clothes, purse,

701
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,708
and your phone.

702
00:50:27,518 --> 00:50:29,368
It's locked.

703
00:50:45,148 --> 00:50:47,318
I-It unlocked.

704
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,698
M-Ms. Han.

705
00:50:53,698 --> 00:50:56,278
I-It's really you.

706
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:01,768
Ms. Han.

707
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:05,008
How did you turn into a dog?

708
00:51:06,328 --> 00:51:10,608
What if you could never go back to normal?

709
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:16,128
Say something. Please?

710
00:51:16,128 --> 00:51:21,548
Ms. Han!

711
00:51:39,058 --> 00:51:40,588
 

712
00:51:41,488 --> 00:51:42,788
Hello?

713
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,828
W-Why is a man answering?

714
00:51:48,828 --> 00:51:50,638
Ms. Han.

715
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:57,088
Is she asleep?

716
00:52:18,558 --> 00:52:20,468
She's so cute.

717
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:23,848
There's a puppy on my bed.

718
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:26,768
A photo.

719
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:37,398
No. This is Ms. Han.

720
00:52:38,428 --> 00:52:41,768
It's illegal to take one without permission.

721
00:52:44,388 --> 00:52:46,158
But it's just one photo.

722
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,958
It's such a cute dog,

723
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,898
but this is Ms. Han.

724
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:02,738
She must be tired.

725
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,398
 Pretend to be sleeping 

726
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:21,018
 and get out of here when Yul falls asleep. 

727
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:53,068
 What? 

728
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:54,818
 Is he asleep? 

729
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:17,908
 My gosh... 

730
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:03,788
 What do I do? 

731
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:12,528
 Okay. Nice. 

732
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:37,008
 My best trait is that 

733
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:39,488
 I give up quickly. 

734
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:01,558
 I'll wait until it's six in the morning 

735
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,278
 and leave when I turn into a human. 

736
00:56:06,378 --> 00:56:10,128
 Never, ever fall asleep. 

737
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:13,448
 Never fall asleep... 

738
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:00,178
 Who's that? 

739
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:05,160
   â€‹

740
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:09,468
Ms. Han?

741
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,868
Is this a dream?

742
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:18,278
â™«  Please don't pretend not to know  â™«

743
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:21,968
â™«  I know exactly how you feel  â™«

744
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:26,838
â™«  Even if you act like you don't, don't, don't, don't, don't care  â™«

745
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:28,888
â™«  It's so obvious  â™«

746
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:33,058
â™«  Don't play ignorant, our love won't die  â™«

747
00:58:33,058 --> 00:58:36,728
â™«  Stop acting cautious, tell me everything  â™«

748
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:41,578
â™«  No matter what other say  â™«

749
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:43,748
â™«  Why does it matter?  â™«

750
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:48,068
â™«  You're too shy, too shy  â™«

751
00:58:48,068 --> 00:58:52,678
â™«  Let's not waste time anymore  â™«

752
00:58:54,348 --> 00:58:58,388
 

753
00:58:58,388 --> 00:58:59,648
 You got caught? 

754
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:01,228
 By a student of yours? 

755
00:59:01,228 --> 00:59:04,148
 Not only that, he's the math teacher's nephew. 

756
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:05,768
 What's with the dog? 

757
00:59:05,768 --> 00:59:09,318
 Man Deuk will hang out here just for a day. 

758
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:12,598
 Huh? Man Deuk went home? 

759
00:59:12,598 --> 00:59:14,738
 Ms. Han, are you free this evening? 

760
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:17,138
 Didn't you say you haven't graded the performance assessment yet? 

761
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:19,308
 Did you wait for a long time? 

762
00:59:19,308 --> 00:59:20,738
 Thank you for today. 

763
00:59:20,738 --> 00:59:23,338
 I know you helped me in many ways. 

764
00:59:23,338 --> 00:59:24,958
 What's with those two? 

765
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,588
 Are you saying there's nothing going on? 

766
00:59:26,588 --> 00:59:28,668
 You have no feelings at all?
