1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:10,500
   ​

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,320
 

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
 

4
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,730
 

5
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,620
 

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,090
 
 Are you going to ride in Bo Gyeom's car? Do you want to ride in my car, then? 

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,330
 Ms. Han, get off! Uncle has never been on the freeway before! 

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,040
 - Rerouting.
- Are you okay? 

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,570
 - I think we're late.
- Should we run, then? 

10
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,560
 I've got a weird feeling. You've had a change of heart. 

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,900
 You should all see the beach since you're here. It's close. 

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,560
 Even though I was watching the tides come and go, I didn't realize it. 

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,580
 The fact that the ocean is being pulled by that tiny moon. 

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,330
 You'll grow distant faster than you think. 

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,410
 I gave it some thought. 

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,370
 I think you should get some help from that student. 

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,740
 You said they live together. 

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,830
 No need to be nervous. I'm a dog now, anyway. 

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,930
 I've been happy, my heart fluttered, and 

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,270
 I kept thinking about him. It must've been due to the curse, right? 

21
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,590
 What? Why am I not changing? 

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,880
 Are you okay, Uncle? 

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,820
 - Why won't it work? How come?
- I think you're screwed. 

24
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,350
 What do you mean? It doesn't work? 

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,100
 You have to do it when the other person's awake. 

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,900
 There's only one solution. 

27
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,510
 You're still wearing this around. 

28
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,000
 Mr. Jin, your fear of dogs. 

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,780
 I'll help you overcome it. 

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,800
 How would you help me? 

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,000
 Would you like to see me outside of school first? 

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
 

33
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,010
Mr. Jin. Try imagining...

34
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,830
this is our house.

35
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,060
The most comfortable and safest place in the world.

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,540
This is the roof.

37
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,130
♫  You'd be thinking of me  ♫

38
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:19,040
♫  There's not a day without  ♫

39
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,220
 Ms. Han, thank you for today. 

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,950
Han Hae Na, you've got a message.

41
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,350
Just let her sleep.

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,750
It's the sweet Korean history teacher.

43
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,820
 Who? 

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,260
Shall we take a look at what he sent you at this late hour?

45
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,460
 Hey! Don't look at my phone! 

46
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,160
I don't want to! I don't want to!

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,740
Hey, going through someone's phone without their permission

48
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,690
is a violation of the Communications Secret Protection Act.

49
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,320
What is this dog?

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,950
Is it Hae Na?

51
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,340
They do look similar.

52
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,450
Wait, you were found out by the Korean history teacher, too?

53
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,400
Whoa. Oh, my gosh.

54
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,830
 - No! 
- Are you serious?

55
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,440
When did he find out, huh?

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,430
 I said no. I didn't get caught! 

57
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,050
Gosh, there's not a day that goes by without you causing trouble.

58
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,240
 No! Be quiet. Snack. Walk! No! 

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,420
You weren't? Then what's with this picture?

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,450
Why would he send you a picture of a dog at one in the morning?

61
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,730
 I know, huh? 

62
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,970
Shit, Han Hae Na!

63
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,220
Explain yourself with that mouth of yours.

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,290
- She can't speak with her mouth.
 - He's right. 

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
"Ms. Han, look at this.

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,540
He's sulking because he wasn't given a treat. Lol, isn't he so cute?

67
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,680
Are you like this when you sulk, too?"

68
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,970
Whoa, whoa. What's with this green light?

69
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,870
He's flirting with her.

70
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,810
"I'm still awake at this hour, thinking about you."

71
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,170
Why now, of all times?

72
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,660
Think about it.

73
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,490
Hae Na keeps hanging out with the math teacher to lift her curse.

74
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,610
But the way the Korean history teacher sees it, "Huh? What's this?

75
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,340
Someone who liked me has eyes for someone else."

76
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,650
Something awakened within him.

77
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,410
I see...

78
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,690
She unintentionally stimulated his jealousy.

79
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,100
Exactly.

80
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,550
Gosh, are you happy now?

81
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,010
 Hands off my butt! 

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,840
She likes men to a fault.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,320
Wow, this is nice.

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,850
 
Selected by the Office of Education as a school without campus violence

85
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,900
as well as the winner of the video contest hosted by the Department of Education! Wow!

86
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,000
There hasn't been a whisper of violence since I took office.

87
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,490
Gosh, Vice Principal.

88
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,490
You haven't even been in office for that long.

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,470
It's crooked there! Pull it up higher!

90
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,350
A little more!

91
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,000
Aigoo.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,870
Hey! Pick up the trash!

93
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm sorry!

94
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,550
Why is the Vice Principal angry?

95
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,390
Who knows?

96
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,170
It's Ms. Hae Na. Ms. Hae Na!

97
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,800
Didn't she see me?

98
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey, maybe it's because of you.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
- Because of me?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,260
There's something between you two these days.

101
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,200
What are you saying?

102
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,780
You really have no clue, Hyung?

103
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,820
About what?

104
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,900
You're so oblivious.

105
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,350
Me?

106
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,920
Let's hurry and clean up.

107
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
Me?

108
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,440
Wait.

109
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,050
Why am I running away?

110
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,310
Hey, you guys. Come on, take off your makeup, will you?

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,060
- Hey, Hyun Jae Hee! Come here.
- Yes?

112
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,230
- Me?
- Yes!

113
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,840
I've been watching you...

114
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,350
since you were a child actress.

115
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,010
- Selfie?
- Sure.

116
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,800
Okay...

117
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,810
Guys, congratulations.

118
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,110
I saw the banner. I knew you'd win.

119
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,290
Oh, thank you.

120
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,610
I'm your fan.

121
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,740
I subscribed, liked, and turned on notifications for your videos.

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,840
- What will you upload next?
- The teachers' ideal type world cup.

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,040
Whoa, that sounds fun! Am I in it, too?

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,450
The male teachers will go first.

125
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,770
Have you seen Mr. Seo Won and Mr. Bo Gyeom?

126
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,150
They're in front of the school gate.

127
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,810
Let's go.

128
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,400
Hold on.

129
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,880
Mr. Lee!

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,540
We're uploading an ideal type world cup to YouTube. Can you help us out?

131
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,340
- An ideal type world cup?
- Yes.

132
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,340
- Okay, sure. That sounds fun.
- Yay!

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,020
You should join, too.

134
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,600
- I'm not sure.
- Mr. Jin, can't you help our channel out this once?

135
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,800
- Come on, Mr. Jin.
- Please?

136
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,540
Mr. Jin.

137
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,330
- Hey, why are you carrying everything?
- It's okay...

138
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,720
Please, Mr. Jin. Can't you help us out this once?

139
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
Just this once!

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,130
 Just this once! 

141
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,090
 Just this once! 

142
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,700
 Just this once! Just this once! 

143
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,020
 Ms. Yoon Chae Ah and... 

144
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,270
So, does it seem like the math teacher will overcome his fear of dogs anytime soon?

145
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,930
So, does it seem like the math teacher will overcome his fear of dogs anytime soon?

146
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,000
- Huh?
 - Who will be the winner? 

147
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,130
 The winner Mr. Jin Seo Won chose as his ideal type is... 

148
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,200
 Ta-da! Ms. Yoon Chae Ah! 

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
 - My gosh! Applause! 
- No way.

150
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,500
Geez!

151
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,290
 She really is quite the beauty. Agreed? 

152
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,280
 Next. What should we do? 

153
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,730
It doesn't make sense.

154
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,990
 This is just a game, so no one should get jealous. All right? 

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,790
Yul, do you know a student named Kim Ji Won?

156
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,990
- Who?
- She's in the Video Productions Club.

157
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh, I don't know.

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,470
Uncle, why did you choose Ms. Chae Ah?

159
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,410
Didn't you have something going on with Ms. Hae Na?

160
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,300
What are you talking about?

161
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,850
 Ta-da! Ms. Yoon Chae Ah! 

162
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,090
 My gosh! Applause! 

163
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,350
 She really is quite the beauty. Agreed? 

164
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,500
 Congratulations! 

165
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,840
Thanks. Isn't it a given?

166
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,450
Seriously.

167
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,450
 

168
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,100
- Ms. Chae Ah! Congratulations.
 - Congratulations! 

169
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,550
- Do you need help?
- No.

170
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,880
You should go help Ms. Yoon Chae Ah.

171
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,900
Your ideal type who just passed by.

172
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,250
You watched it, huh?

173
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,740
Only the first place is given a prize here, too.

174
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,050
This dirty world only remembers first places.

175
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,790
Second places are meaningful, too.

176
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,340
Aigoo!

177
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,060
So meaningless.

178
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,790
- You'll hurt yourself. Let me help.
- Aigoo.

179
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,510
So meaningless.

180
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,210
So meaningless...

181
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,130
 Ji Won, you need to grow tall, okay? 

182
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,060
Hey, come on.

183
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,470
Oh, my gosh!

184
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,360
- Poor Ji Won.
- Here's a gift.

185
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,810
 There's no more milk? How regretful. 

186
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,150
 

187
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,700
Gosh, she stinks.

188
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,840
- What are you all doing?
- Mr. Jin.

189
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,800
Surprised, huh? We were just practicing acting.

190
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,300
We're going to make a series about preventing school violence.

191
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,660
Hey, you're okay, right?

192
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,940
Ji Won, we told you to take it easy on the acting.

193
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,670
Yeah, she's so good at acting.

194
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,700
Give me the video.

195
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,090
We didn't record anything since it was just a rehearsal.

196
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,590
We'll be sure to show it to you later.

197
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,570
Ji Won, are you okay?

198
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,830
I knew this would happen!

199
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,100
I said let's not pour the milk during the rehearsal.

200
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,870
- Chae Rin, I said not to pour the milk.
- Ji Won, I'm sorry.

201
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,540
- Let's clean up.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,360
Hey, here's a wet wipe.

203
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,110
Let's clean up.

204
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,030
Ji Won.

205
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,260
Are they telling the truth?

206
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,140
Yes, they are.

207
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,200
Ji Won, come here.

208
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,060
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on, I'll wipe you off. It's fine.

209
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,850
I'll do it myself.

210
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,690
She's drenched.

211
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,170
Sorry.

212
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,520
- You're okay, right?
- Are you all right?

213
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,870
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

214
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,410
Can I speak with you?

215
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

216
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,940
Outside.

217
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,410
Gosh, Mr. Jin is a bulldozer.

218
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,610
A real go-getter.

219
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,730
- Go-getter, my foot.
- Why? Are you offended?

220
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,130
Because you lost the finals?

221
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,140
Who?

222
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,520
Me?

223
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,950
Yes, you.

224
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,720
Ms. Han, I chose you.

225
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,740
Whoa, lucky you!

226
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm jealous!

227
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,550
Really?

228
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,690
All of the kids in the club don't cause trouble. They're good.

229
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,920
I'm aware.

230
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,480
I could be mistaken, but you should still look into it.

231
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,030
Of course.

232
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,230
- I'll have a talk with them.
- Okay.

233
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,240
Thank you for looking out for the kids in our club.

234
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,070
Mr. Jin.

235
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,010
I talked to Ji Won and

236
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,220
she said they were really recording a video against school violence.

237
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,590
You don't need to worry too much.

238
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,680
- Did you look into it properly?
- Sorry?

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,640
Did you watch the video?

240
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,390
No, I didn't...

241
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,090
She might be keeping quiet for fear of retaliation.

242
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,490
I'll speak with her.

243
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,530
Mr. Jin.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,400
I briefly overheard, and you seem to be acting like this over a mere suspicion.

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,090
We have our division of tasks, and Ms. Yoon is taking care of things.

246
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,600
Why are you meddling in someone else's class?

247
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,930
Someone else's class?

248
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,550
Is that really what's important here?

249
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,550
What did you say?

250
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,010
Go on.

251
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,660
Hey!

252
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,640
What was that back there?

253
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,990
You're acting strange today.

254
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,340
Do I seem strange to you, too, Hyung?

255
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,660
Everyone else seems unfazed. Isn't that weirder?

256
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,720
Well, as for that...

257
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,710
it's not something that can be resolved by being touchy.

258
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,750
We can't take action without solid evidence, and

259
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,250
there's an order to these things.

260
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,050
What if something worse happens?

261
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,270
Are you saying we should wait until then?

262
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,140
Why are you so riled up today? It's unlike you.

263
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,270
Or do you have personal feelings about this situation?

264
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,580
It's not like that.

265
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,160
Let's see. Where did I put the key?

266
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,710
- Great job today.
- Where did I put them?

267
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,310
Ta-da!

268
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,650
- Thank you.
- Go on.

269
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,660
Sir.

270
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,370
Ms. Hae Na!

271
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,400
Which key did you just hand to Ji Won?

272
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,050
The key to the gym storage. So she can organize the equipment.

273
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,290
- Did you ask her to?
- No.

274
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,080
She volunteered to collect more points for her transcript.

275
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,430
I see. Great job today.

276
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,810
- His father was there, too.
- - He was totally crushed.

277
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,550
- Crushed?
- Yeah! He bled all over the place.

278
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,350
Where the hell is she?

279
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,310
Hey, are you sure she didn't leave yet?

280
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,800
- What if she ran off already?
- Geez, what a hassle.

281
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,930
- What are you guys doing here?
- Ms. Han!

282
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,570
We're waiting for my dad. He's picking us up.

283
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,150
He said he'd be here soon.

284
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,900
He's almost here.

285
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,400
- Take care, Ms. Han.
- Goodbye.

286
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,300
- Bye now.
- Gosh, she scared me.

287
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,970
So what happened in the end?

288
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,750
- Oh, right.
- I'm telling you it was crazy!

289
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,270
He fell all over the place, and everyone looked.

290
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,020
He really bled. You could even see his bone.

291
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,600
- No way.
- How is that possible?

292
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,170
- What bone?
- Really, you could see his bone.

293
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,470
Mr. Jin, aren't you going home?

294
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,060
Go ahead.

295
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,960
Take care.

296
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,040
 

297
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,820
 

298
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,070
Why isn't she coming out?

299
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,430
Jae Hee, she's not picking up?

300
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,310
 

301
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,900
 Ji Won! 

302
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,720
 

303
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,240
 

304
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,760
 

305
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,390
Yes.

306
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,660
Did our magical girl Ji Won hide well?

307
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,220
 Where is she? 

308
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,780
 Ji Won. 

309
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,110
 - Where's our Ji Won?
- Ji Won. 

310
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,720
 Is she hiding? 

311
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,250
 - Ji Won.
- Ji Won! 

312
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,700
 Ji Won! 

313
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,100
 Come out, come out, wherever you are. 

314
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Oh, Ji Won.

315
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,290
Hey, she must've gone home.

316
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,510
You said you saw her.

317
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,720
I didn't really know, either.

318
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,010
What a waste of time.

319
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,800
Someone commented...

320
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,300
that my acting was better than Jae Hee's.

321
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,970
That's when all of this started.

322
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,900
Pathetic, right?

323
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,140
She only watches.

324
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,840
When the kids harass me,

325
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,200
she only watches to see my facial expression.

326
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,180
Then she'll say one thing.

327
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,300
"This is boring."

328
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,300
Then the kids will hit me more to buy Hyun Jae Hee's favor.

329
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,100
She records all that with her phone

330
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
and she says if she gets caught,

331
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,080
 she'll say it's a video for school violence prevention. 

332
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,110
She said that'll do.

333
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,310
Thank you for telling us, Ji Won.

334
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,220
I'll help you.

335
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,280
It's okay now.

336
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,430
Thank you.

337
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,380
Hey, smile a little.

338
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,630
 

339
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,470
 

340
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,620
Mr. Jin,

341
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,430
this is the video the kids made.

342
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,780
Should we make a big deal solely based on the student who claims to be a victim?

343
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,180
I heard Hyun Jae Hee is claiming innocence and crying her eyes out.

344
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,590
Jae Hee's mother is also worried that other kids are framing Jae Hee.

345
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,100
It's not framing.

346
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,650
The original footage of Jae Hee bullying Ji Won should be on her phone.

347
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,890
Do we have to open the School Violence Committee?

348
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,490
What's Committee!

349
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,160
We just need to make that student leave the club.

350
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,720
Things will be fine as long as we separate them.

351
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,830
No, things won't be fine.

352
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,550
The bully won't be remorseful, and the victim will continue to suffer from anxiety.

353
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,850
Much harsher things happen when they go out to the real world.

354
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,300
- This much isn't even a problem.
- This much?

355
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,950
Aren't you being too complacent just because we're inside a school?

356
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,620
Who are you calling complacent right now?

357
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,380
It hasn't been that long since we were selected as a clean school without school violence.

358
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,280
Vice Principal, it makes me wonder

359
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,420
if you're trying to keep our school violence-free

360
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,080
or one that's pretending to be clean and not to have violence.

361
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,350
I'm just not sure.

362
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,990
Do you know how hard it is to recover

363
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,370
a school's reputation once it's damaged?

364
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,220
What about that child's heart, then?

365
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Are you okay?

366
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,060
Yes.

367
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,870
Can I sit here for a moment?

368
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,180
Ji Won took up courage and told us.

369
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,510
But things aren't going the way we'd like them to.

370
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,080
Since the School Violence Committee is a sensitive issue,

371
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,160
wouldn't the school and the other teachers

372
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,350
just trying their best to be fair and cautious

373
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,270
in resolving the matter?

374
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,300
I think that's what I can't do.

375
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,420
Being fair.

376
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,530
When I see Ji Won,

377
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,480
I feel like I'm watching my young self.

378
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,260
And that's why...

379
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,630
Seo Won!

380
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,170
We're going to the PC Cafe. You want to come with us?

381
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,140
I have to go pick up my nephew from kindergarten. Sorry.

382
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,500
Hey, let's just go. Your classmates want to hang out with you.

383
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,290
I really have to go.

384
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,140
Hey, Jin Seo Won.

385
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,180
I saw something funny yesterday.

386
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,770
You were trembling in fear on the street because of a tiny dog.

387
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,610
Gosh, stop lying. That's about the size of a rabbit.

388
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,540
No, it was really a mini Maltese about this big.

389
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,010
And?

390
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,000
Isn't it embarrassing when you're all grown up?

391
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,360
Whether I fear dogs or not, what does it have to do with you guys?

392
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,280
Whoa! He's scared of dogs but not scared of people.

393
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,400
I don't care, but...

394
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,150
you just bug me, asshole.

395
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,390
Step on him.

396
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,900
- I didn't like you from the get-go!
 - There were many witnesses. 

397
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,900
- Asshole, from the way you look...
 - Some joined along... 

398
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,200
Hey! You saw nothing, okay?

399
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,370
 some turned away and stayed silent. 

400
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,990
Go home now.

401
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,180
Hey. Hurry up and leave.

402
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,700
Don't look back and just go, okay?

403
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,940
I hate the way you look...

404
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,410
Woof, woof! Woof!

405
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,220
Hello.

406
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,430
Yul, see you tomorrow. Take care.

407
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,370
Please take care.

408
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,910
You waited a long time, right? I'm sorry.

409
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,390
Uncle, give me a lift.

410
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,200
Shall I?

411
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,460
Uncle, are you okay?

412
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,050
Yes, I'm okay.

413
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,010
Yul,

414
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:33,540
I don't think I can do that today.

415
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,400
Yul...

416
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,510
I'm sorry, Yul...

417
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,260
Uncle, don't cry.

418
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,570
 When I can't handle the pain, 

419
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,450
 I try to become indifferent to it. 

420
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,520
If I don't,

421
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,120
I don't think I can live on.

422
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,340
Just because she says she's okay,

423
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,830
it doesn't mean she's really okay.

424
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,500
Mr. Jin...

425
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,220
when you want to cry, it's okay to cry a little.

426
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,170
I'll let you be alone.

427
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,420
Just a second.

428
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,640
Can you just stay for a second?

429
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,700
 

430
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,780
Hey, Unni.

431
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,710
We start the mission in five minutes.

432
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,170
- Hello?
- Jae Hee, I'm leaving first.

433
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,570
Hello?

434
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,370
Mom, I'm done at the academy.

435
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,360
You'll be late?

436
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,700
I'll just wait, then. It's okay. Okay.

437
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,080
Just message me when you're here.

438
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,660
Okay.

439
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,510
All right.

440
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,690
F***! Damn it!

441
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,000
Shit!

442
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,870
Hey! Hey, you son of a bitch!

443
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,800
Give me back my phone! Hey!

444
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,280
Hey! You f***ing son of a bitch!

445
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,750
Hey!

446
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,570
Damn, you son of a bitch!

447
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,250
This is the original file of the school violence video. Please check it out.

448
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,400
Mr. Jin, why would I harass Ji Won?

449
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,430
She's not worth it.

450
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,100
Oh, right...

451
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,490
She must have a victim's mentality toward me.

452
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,390
- Victim's mentality?
- Yes.

453
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,150
She must believe her poor acting is because of me.

454
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:13,370
It's ridiculous, but I must bear it since I'm a public figure.

455
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,840
You sure you're not the one who feels inferior?

456
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,800
Sorry?

457
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,960
Me?

458
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,190
Mr. Jin, I told you it wasn't me.

459
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,850
The reason I'm here is because

460
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,830
I hope you can sincerely reflect on yourself

461
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,410
and apologize to Ji Won.

462
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,690
Regardless of the outcome of the School Violence Committee,

463
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,410
I hope you can look back on your actions.

464
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,640
Must we hold a School Violence Committee over a video we don't even know the origin?

465
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,650
It was recorded in our club room, so we must still investigate it.

466
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,490
What?

467
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,080
You shouldn't worry too much-

468
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,960
Just close the door and come inside.

469
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,640
Mom.

470
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,200
It wasn't me.

471
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,290
It wasn't.

472
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,950
It won't be controversial.

473
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,030
I can still join the movie.

474
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,660
- Why meet her if you're so busy?
- Forget it!

475
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,340
Hello?

476
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,090
Mom?

477
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,580
Jae Hee, are you okay?

478
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,210
How did you lose your phone?

479
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,900
That f***ing asshole.

480
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,900
What should I do about Jin Seo Won, that f***er?

481
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,760
F***! This is driving me nuts.

482
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,300
He should've just f***ing stayed put!

483
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,220
Why the f*** did he have to make this into a big deal?

484
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,930
That f***er!

485
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,580
Hey!

486
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,090
This is bullshit. Hey, you tell me.

487
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,820
Must I hold myself back?

488
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,360
No, but the situation is a bit...

489
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,390
Wouldn't it be smart to lay low during the investigation?

490
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,930
Yeah, let's not create more trouble.

491
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,870
You useless morons.

492
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,750
Jae Hee...

493
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,480
Why didn't I think of that?

494
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,150
There's a way!

495
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,940
- Hello!
- Hello.

496
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,730
What should a male teacher

497
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,460
be most careful about when it comes to a female student, guys?

498
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,940
 Meet me at the convenience store at the intersection after my academy. 

499
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,860
 Let's come up with a scenario. 

500
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,930
Aren't you enjoying turning into a dog a bit too much?

501
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,930
Just make sure to put this on me later.

502
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,870
Just because you turn into a dog

503
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,620
doesn't mean you're a hero like Ant-Man or Spider-Man.

504
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,130
Hey, I'm asking out of curiosity

505
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,660
Do you get special powers if you turn into a dog?

506
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,420
We just have a heightened sense of smell.

507
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,950
I guess you can easily find delicious restaurants.

508
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,540
Eat up since you'll be running around like a dog.

509
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,820
I added plenty of duck meat.

510
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,760
Get that out of my face.

511
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,550
Popo, let's eat.

512
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,270
Let's eat! Take a bite.

513
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,590
It's delicious. Eat.

514
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,390
- Hello?
 - Mr. Jin. 

515
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,130
 This is Jae Hee. Can we meet right now? 

516
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,960
 I have something to tell you. 

517
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,570
Right now?

518
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,040
If you have something to say, let's talk tomorrow at school.

519
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,230
It's pretty late.

520
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,160
 I'm not going to school starting tomorrow. 

521
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,420
 I'm sincerely reflecting upon myself, and there's something 

522
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,240
 I want to tell you for the last time. 

523
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,390
- Only you came out pretty!
- No, you came out pretty, too.

524
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,930
No, let's post the fourth one.

525
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,470
- I don't like the fourth one...
- You're pretty! You came out nice.

526
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,220
 - Jae Hee's not there. 
- It's Jae Hee.

527
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,930
 Geez, the perfume smell... 

528
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,880
 
Hey, Jae Hee!

529
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,530
Where are you guys?

530
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,160
We're waiting in front of the convenience store.

531
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,480
 - Oh, I'll meet Jin Seo Won today. 
- Okay.

532
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,940
 - Come to the Han River Botanical Garden. 
- Jae Hee! What? Talk to me.

533
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,620
- So what's the plan? Talk to me.
- Hey, she was talking to me!

534
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,440
Jae Hee, what did you say? Where?

535
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,900
We're meeting at the Han River Botanical Garden. Head on over.

536
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,110
Oh, Han River Botanical Garden? Okay, I got it.

537
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,430
 Just make sure to film it well, okay? 

538
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,810
 It's game over once we reveal the video crying, "Mr. Jin sexually harassed me!" 

539
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,360
 - What? Those little... 
- Okay, all right.

540
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,820
Ouch. What the hell?

541
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,190
What the? That scared me! Gosh!

542
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,680
- Gosh.
- So cute!

543
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,500
- What is it?
- There's a puppy here.

544
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,750
A puppy?

545
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,450
 I'm screwed! 

546
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,000
It just left. We'll head on over now with the guys.

547
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,840
Hey, was that a camera on the hat?

548
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,090
I don't know. I didn't see it.

549
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,420
Is it working?

550
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,500
Oh, it's working!

551
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,940
 Yeah. Where? 

552
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,610
 I'll meet Jin Seo Won today. Come to the Han River Botanical Garden. 

553
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,170
 Oh, Han River Botanical Garden? 

554
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,500
 Just make sure to film it well, okay? 

555
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:55,850
 It's game over once we reveal the video crying, "Mr. Jin sexually harassed me!" 

556
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,090
This kid is taking things too far.

557
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,680
Hurry up and call the math teacher.

558
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,270
 

559
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,300
Gosh, why isn't he picking up?

560
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,900
 

561
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,370
Hello?

562
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,980
Who's this?

563
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,620
Uncle's not here.

564
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,440
Why? Is my uncle in trouble?

565
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,300
I feel like we're investigators.

566
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,310
- Woof, woof!
- Let's go.

567
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,880
 It's game over once we reveal the video crying, "Mr. Jin sexually harassed me!" 

568
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,280
- Sexual harassment?
 - Okay, all right. 

569
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,540
Gosh, Han Jae Hee's insane.

570
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,980
She dares to mess with my uncle?

571
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,290
Gosh, teaching is such an extremely tough job.

572
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,950
Noonim.

573
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,230
You never know, so keep this on.

574
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,150
You're a walking CCTV now.

575
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,280
Is this the right place?

576
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,530
- That's Uncle's car!
- This one?

577
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,260
Yes.

578
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,550
That means he's here.

579
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,850
How do we find them?

580
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,780
Let's split up.

581
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,720
 The perfume smell. 

582
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,270
 This way. 

583
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,060
Uncle, where are you?

584
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,000
By the way, what were you talking about on the phone?

585
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,770
Huh?

586
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,970
You said something about a puppy.

587
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,730
There was a puppy when we were on the phone earlier.

588
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,220
A puppy?

589
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,800
Yeah.

590
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,870
Was it a white puppy about this big?

591
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,420
Yeah.

592
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,310
How did you know?

593
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,060
That's crazy.

594
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:03,050
The puppy that stole my phone looked like that, too.

595
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,090
Really?

596
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,800
The dog was wearing a camera.

597
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,340
- What?
- You don't think it recorded us, do you?

598
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,270
Hey, why would a dog be wearing a camera?

599
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,220
Exactly. Camera, my foot.

600
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,890
Damn it...

601
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,750
Mr. Jin.

602
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,000
What is it you want to tell me?

603
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:42,230
I've been dropped from all my movies because of you.

604
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,860
My life is screwed.

605
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,150
How will you take responsibility?

606
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,560
You called me here to say that?

607
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,750
I'm only 18 years old, Mr. Jin.

608
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,900
As an adult...

609
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,120
At least, a teacher shouldn't be...

610
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,960
stepping on the budding life of a student. Right?

611
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
Don't you think so?

612
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,270
I was wrong, Mr. Jin.

613
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,460
I'm really...

614
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,300
I'm really sorry.

615
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,940
I'm so sorry...

616
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,520
Please forgive me this once.

617
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,800
 I found them. 

618
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,880
 Huh? What are they doing? 

619
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,810
 Mr. Jin! 

620
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,090
 Let's run. 

621
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,610
Hey! Catch that dog!

622
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,250
Run, run, run!

623
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,100
Stop right there!

624
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,960
Mr. Jin!

625
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,380
What the?

626
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,320
What are you doing here?

627
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,100
I'm here to help you, Uncle.

628
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,500
Hey!

629
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,160
Stop right there!

630
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,740
Hey!

631
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,120
Did you find them?

632
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,290
- They weren't there, either?
- Where the heck are they?

633
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,960
Oh, my gosh! That scared me!

634
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,940
What is that? The light suddenly turned on!

635
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,510
The light suddenly turned on!

636
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,660
So what if it turns on? Why are you so loud?

637
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,510
Gosh, that scared me.

638
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,040
Geez, you're so loud.

639
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,500
Little puppy!

640
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:53,110
Puppy, where are you?

641
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,660
Mr. Bo Gyeom!

642
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,550
What is our school's celebrity doing at a place like this?

643
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,780
I came to meet someone, but I took a wrong turn.

644
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,280
Who?

645
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,040
Seo Won?

646
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,040
They say kids these days are clever,

647
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,980
but your threats are on another level.

648
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,040
You shouldn't look down on teachers like that. It upsets me as a teacher.

649
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,860
What are you going to do about it?

650
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,780
I'm not sure.

651
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,690
What should I do? Huh?

652
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,850
Wow, look at this.

653
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,900
How about corporal punishment?

654
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,220
But that's not allowed these days.

655
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:33,850
Imagine a teacher hitting a student in this day and age.

656
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,540
They'd get disciplined and even suspended from teaching.

657
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,810
But you know...

658
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,160
I still hit them.

659
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,280
Students who only learn from a beating.

660
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,340
Mr. Lee, are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

661
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,780
How do you feel?

662
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,850
Are you scared you might get hit?

663
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,490
You're scared since you don't know what I'll do next, right?

664
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,920
I asked how it feels.

665
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,690
The feeling of the strong becoming the weak?

666
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,990
Why are you doing this to me, Mr. Lee?

667
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,970
Why did you do that to Ji Won?

668
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,510
Was she given a reason when she got hit?

669
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,370
What's she doing there like that?

670
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,050
That is a great hiding spot.

671
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,390
Does she need to pee?

672
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,790
♫  Going home  ♫

673
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,710
It's Jun Seo's dog.

674
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,400
He put a walk camera on Cocoa.

675
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,280
A walk camera?

676
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,010
It's good for them if you record

677
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:37,480
their walks from their point of view and show it to them at home.

678
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,110
And he played the recording and saw the kids from the club.

679
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,080
He called me right away when he heard them say "sexual harassment" and whatnot.

680
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,250
You came here alone? On a taxi?

681
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,880
Of course. Who else would I come with?

682
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,500
The situation is over now, right?

683
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,550
Oh, babe!

684
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,820
There are so many people in the parking lot!

685
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,350
- What's gotten into you? So gross.
- Let's go somewhere else.

686
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,680
- I know a lot of great spots.
- What's with you? You're scaring me.

687
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,900
- Babe, you're really oblivious today.
- Let's go home now, Uncle.

688
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,940
♫  If you'd still love me, too  ♫

689
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,420
♫  Now I'm going home  ♫

690
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,300
What a long day.

691
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:28,700
♫  Inside, real me, yes, I am going home  ♫

692
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,750
♫  My heart remains true, now I am going home  ♫

693
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:42,440
♫  Still I hear you, I'm here for you, together  ♫

694
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,640
Come on down now.

695
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,410
Hurry up! It's time for the gym.

696
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,610
Jun Seo!

697
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,510
Mr. Jin, hello!

698
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,120
Thanks for yesterday.

699
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,740
Sorry? For what?

700
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,670
I want to thank Cocoa, too.

701
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,620
How do you know Cocoa?

702
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,150
- I heard from Yul.
- I see...

703
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,660
All right.

704
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,440
Guys, turn in your phones.

705
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,110
That's right.

706
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,370
Keep it coming.

707
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,260
That's right.

708
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,640
I can't! I need to feed Cocoa.

709
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,350
Geez!

710
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,210
No! Cocoa!

711
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,010
He should worry about his own food.

712
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,150
Hey, did you read the forum? Something must've happened.

713
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,380
What was it? Tell me.

714
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,020
I don't know, either. Do you?

715
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,500
- I don't know. I'm sleepy.
- W-What is it?

716
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,960
Stop slacking!

717
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,690
Sorry.

718
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,020
I really don't want to do this!

719
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,840
Why do I need to do on-campus volunteer?

720
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,630
This is all because of Hyun Jae Hee.

721
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,950
This is because of Kim Ji Won.

722
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,570
Why are you f***ing dropping everything?

723
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,210
Let's make Kim Ji Won do this. Why should we do this?

724
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,990
It's her fault we fell out with Jae Hee, and we were just used.

725
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:30,780
Hey, didn't you say your dad has connections to our school?

726
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,540
Hey, tell your dad to work his connections for us.

727
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,630
Yeah, ask him for a favor.

728
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,820
You think you're the only one with a dad?

729
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,500
My dad is the Chairman here. Volunteer service won't cut it for you guys.

730
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,700
- Ms. Yoon!
- We were just...

731
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,220
We were just joking-

732
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,810
- Hi, Dad.
- Ms. Yoon.

733
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,230
- Ms. Yoon!
- Ms. Yoon, we were just joking!

734
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,100
- I'm sorry.
- Ms. Yoon...

735
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,750
Thank you.

736
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,140
I'm the one thankful.

737
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,390
Let us know if you run into difficulties in the future, Ji Won.

738
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,400
Ji Won!

739
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,800
You have another shoot?

740
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,800
Yes, the ideal type world cup that Mr. Bo Gyeom and Mr. Seo Won did last time.

741
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,590
We're doing it for the other teachers as well.

742
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,440
Will I do it, too?

743
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,680
Of course. I'm going to interview you soon.

744
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,640
Sure, I'll be ready whenever.

745
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,640
They're waiting for you. Go on.

746
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,450
Let's go.

747
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,740
Well, Ms. Han.

748
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,650
I never chose Ms. Yoon Chae Ah.

749
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,950
Bo Gyeom said he selected you as his first choice

750
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,290
and that it would look weird if one person got all the votes,

751
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,580
so I told them to do whatever they wanted.

752
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,350
Are you making a move so you're not the first one I disqualify?

753
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,370
No, I'm just telling you the truth-

754
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:08,260
You said the second place is meaningful, too. But I guess you're also getting greedy.

755
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,970
That's not- I'm just telling you the truth-

756
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:15,030
I'm just telling you the truth! Ms. Han!

757
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,020
Ms. Han!

758
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,400
You went through the trouble even though it wasn't your responsibility.

759
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,360
So I'm grateful.

760
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,700
I'd like to treat you to a simple meal.

761
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,570
Ms. Han was the one who went through the trouble.

762
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,570
Then how about we all get together for a drink tonight?

763
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,550
Next week is the school trip,

764
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,060
so we can get to know each other while we're at it.

765
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,140
The school trip is next week?

766
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,990
Oh, okay. Goodbye.

767
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,180
Hey, Yul.

768
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,280
I'm pressed for time right now.

769
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,570
Uncle, just this once!

770
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,230
We'll be quiet. Just this once! Please? Please?

771
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,430
- You want to bring over Cocoa?
- Yes.

772
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,000
Just overnight.

773
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,090
I don't know if their house is haunted, but she barks all night.

774
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,460
Someone filed a complaint, and the police even came.

775
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,790
- Are you sure she'll be okay at our house?
- Of course!

776
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,170
He asked us to take care of her for a few nights before they moved.

777
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,070
Uncle, who is Cocoa?

778
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:45,430
She's the one who rescued you from your life's greatest crisis.

779
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,970
But instead,

780
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,270
she must sleep with you in your room.

781
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,810
You can't bring her out. Got it?

782
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,830
Of course!

783
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,640
Is it here?

784
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,980
- It's him!
- Oh, okay.

785
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,180
Ms. Han!

786
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,000
The plan is simple. Slightly wake up the math teacher at 3 a.m.

787
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,160
- Wake him up.
- And when he's half-asleep, then smooch!

788
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,030
Smooch.

789
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,430
- Then retreat.
- Retreat.

790
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,820
Return the dog at 5 a.m. upon failure. Got it?

791
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,600
- Yes, understood!
- Be quiet!

792
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,160
Here.

793
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,630
- Hae Na, good luck. You can do this!
- Stay calm.

794
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,040
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

795
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,300
- Gosh, I'm so worried.
- Me, too.

796
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,610
- I'm worried.
- Me, too.

797
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,860
- Oh, fighting! You can do this.
- Fighting!

798
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,980
I'm so worried!

799
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,570
Be quiet! I'm more nervous because of you.

800
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,180
 

801
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,360
 Gosh! Unbelievable! 

802
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,880
Hey, Yul.

803
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,320
Where are you going this early?

804
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,090
♫  Please don't pretend not to know  ♫

805
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,780

01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,000
 

815
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,430
 You have no desire to get along with a dog, do you? 

816
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,460
 She's a returning student who's three years older. She's a shaman. 

817
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,150
 She's super clairvoyant. 

818
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,860
 Watch out. You keep getting mixed up with a dog with a story. 

819
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,080
 Make sure to stay alert over there. 

820
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,210
 Don't let anyone catch you. 

821
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,310
 Looks like they'll work out, huh? 

822
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,920
 I think she even switched night duty time slots to partner with him. 

823
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,990
 Han Yoo Na's sister? Interesting. 

824
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,490
 - Ms. Hae Na isn't back yet?
- Ms. Han! 

825
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,310
 We have to find her quickly. This is bad! 

826
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,020
 Mr. Jin!
