1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:09,910
   â€‹

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,060
 

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,030
 

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,750
 

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,680
 

6
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,550
Hey, Yul.

7
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,480
Where are you going first thing in the morning?

8
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,840
Get some ice cream on the way back.

9
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,970
By the way,

10
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,820
you shrunk a bit overnight.

11
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,160
Drink your milk so you grow.

12
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,970
 

13
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,980
Ms. Han.

14
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,750
Where did she go?

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,000
What the heck?

16
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,910
Didn't you leave just now?

17
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,140
Hey, Uncle, did you see Cocoa?

18
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,040
She should be in the room.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,570
Oh, that's right. Jun Seo came and took her back earlier.

20
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,240
Hold on.

21
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,440
This isn't what you were wearing earlier, was it?

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,070
What do you mean?

23
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,880
 
 Ms. Han, do you want to have lunch with me today? 

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,210
You helped out in many ways with Ji Won's case and overcoming my fear of dogs.

25
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,920
This is a little lacking as repayment, isn't it?

26
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,630
Not at all. It's delicious.

27
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,660
By the way,

28
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,560
about what time do you go to sleep?

29
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,630
Well, about 11:00 p.m.

30
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,460
Sometimes I stay up until early morning, preparing class material.

31
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,870
You can't!

32
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,850
You really shouldn't.

33
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,000
You need to go to sleep early for your health.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,540
You need to ventilate your room well, too.

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,630
You don't lock your room and stuff, do you?

36
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,980
No. But I lock it these days because of Cocoa.

37
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,480
Wait...

38
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,680
why?

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,820
Just to be on the safe side.

40
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,040
It's not like the dog knows how to open the door,

41
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,540
so locking the door is unnecessary, isn't it?

42
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,550
That's true.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,150
Cocoa contributed a lot this time,

44
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,070
so you don't have any desire...

45
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,350
to get along with a dog, do you?

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,340
She was cute, though.

47
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,850
You saw her?

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,300
Yul's door was open at dawn,

49
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,050
so I saw on the way to the bathroom.

50
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,990
And you think she's cute?

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,790
Cocoa's cute, huh? I mean...

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,180
I wouldn't know if she's cute or not since I never got to see her.

53
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,900
She's cute, huh?

54
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,140
- What's this line for?
- You know, Min Ji Ah. The transfer student.

55
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,640
Her Highness Ji Ah. She's a returning student who's three years older.

56
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,050
She's a one-month-old shaman.

57
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,320
She's super clairvoyant.

58
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,490
- What should I ask her?
- Gosh, my goodness!

59
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,180
She's daebak! Hurry up and line up.

60
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,000
You got that anew when you were younger, huh?

61
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,120
Really?

62
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,470
What did she say? What? Heart?

63
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,740
You gave up on studying because of its owner.

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,470
Things you want to do,

65
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,970
places you want to go, and all the fun you want to have.

66
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,880
There sure is a lot.

67
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,980
Is she next to me right now?

68
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,080
She's not a bad kid.

69
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,250
You just do what you want in life,

70
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,970
so she can enjoy it with you before she goes.

71
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,920
Well...

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,630
when would she be leaving?

73
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,060
About 10 years from now.

74
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,770
Around then, you'll start studying, too.

75
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,700
- Oh, I see.
- Hey, I got goosebumps.

76
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,170
Please tell her I'm thankful for her heart.

77
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,610
She knows, too.

78
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,940
Oh, how much would it be?

79
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,340
I don't accept money.

80
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,040
My deity told me not to be greedy for wealth because I'm still a student.

81
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,600
I-In that case, please accept this.

82
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,990
 

83
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,210
No!

84
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,020
-  Man! 
- She's crazy.

85
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,560
See you later.

86
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,320
Are these all yours?

87
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,290
Can I have one?

88
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,430
Thank you.

89
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,120
You'll be taken somewhere pretty soon.

90
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,180
Where?

91
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,490
Looks like it'll be a tough situation.

92
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,970
I see you kneeling down.

93
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,910
Oh, really?

94
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,980
Watch out.

95
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,650
It's not even real. If you get into it too much, there will be trouble.

96
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,390
You keep getting mixed up with a dog with a story.

97
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,720
Huh?

98
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,860
- Hey, did you go see that transfer unni for this?
- What, what?

99
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,800
- No.
- She's daebak. Super clairvoyant.

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,600
- She sees everything.
- Gosh! Everyone cut in line! So, I couldn't.

101
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,820
Hey, hurry up! It's worth the wait.

102
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,350
- She gets it all. Daebak. Hurry.
- Really?

103
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,780
Did you see her footwork?

104
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,900
- Wow!
- Jun Seo.

105
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,300
Hello, Mr. Jin.

106
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,280
Cocoa snored a lot when she was sleeping.

107
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,080
Is she okay?

108
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,360
Cocoa did?

109
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,300
You didn't know?

110
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,890
No.

111
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,700
Bye now.

112
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,250
Take care.

113
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,260
Who is Cocoa, by the way?

114
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,050
Jun Seo's dog. The one that helped me last time with the walk camera.

115
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,060
Oh, really?

116
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,440
But how did you know she snores?

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,350
She's staying at my place every night because of some situation.

118
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,010
Oh, I see.

119
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,750
How come...

120
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,100
you're such a heavy sleeper?

121
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,870
You're not the one to ask me, Ms. Han.

122
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,330
Tomorrow is the school trip, Yul.

123
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,630
Today is the last day.

124
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,250
 Wake up! I said, wake up! 

125
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,900
 Fine. It's time for a head-on breakthrough. 

126
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,510
 What do I do? 

127
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,690
 Is he still scared of me? 

128
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,830
 I mean, I even trained him last time- 

129
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,140
 I guess not. 

130
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,990
 Well. 

131
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,930
 Should I appeal my cuteness? 

132
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,310
 Is this not it? What about this, then? 

133
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,030
 My ultimate move! 

134
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,450
 It's not working. 

135
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,740
 Cocoa contributed a lot this time, 

136
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,810
 so you don't have any desire... 

137
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,750
 to get along with her, do you? 

138
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,160
 That's right! 

139
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,830
 A little more. 

140
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,480
 Just a little more. 

141
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,780
 Be brave. I won't bite. I'm cute. 

142
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,870
 A little more. 

143
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,930
 Just a little. 

144
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,200
 Huh? 

145
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,150
Hello.

146
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,000
Hyung, are you really going to sleep over?

147
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,910
Yeah, we're supposed to gather early in the morning.

148
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,020
 What the? Mr. Bo Gyeom? 

149
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,610
 What's this? What's going to happen now? What do I do? 

150
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,670
Gosh, seriously!

151
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,460
Gosh, why isn't she coming out?

152
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,890
Dog thief?

153
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,280
N-No, I'm the owner.

154
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,990
Aigoo.

155
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,910
S-So you're Jun Seo's noona, huh?

156
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,590
Y-Yes, I am.

157
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,430
It's so early in the morning. Why don't you come in and have some tea?

158
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,220
No, it's okay. I have to get to work early.

159
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,180
So I have to bring Cocoa home quickly and go.

160
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,090
Please take care.

161
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,500
You're doing so much work for just a dog.

162
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,800
Yes, because we're family.

163
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,350
Oh, yes.

164
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,280
Be careful...

165
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,540
not to lose that family.

166
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,470
Sorry?

167
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,050
There are many dogs in this world, but there's only one Cocoa.

168
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,780
That's why some people do all kinds of things to find their lost dog.

169
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,280
Make sure to spend the remaining time meaningfully.

170
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,280
Sorry?

171
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,640
Because dogs don't live longer than people in the end.

172
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,070
Hey!

173
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,090
You said you only had to bring Hae Na. What took you so long?

174
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,740
There was someone inside.

175
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,840
- Get in the car.
- I think she was caught.

176
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,980
Get in.

177
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,630
Aigoo.

178
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,530
I've got such a bad feeling.

179
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,130
He started talking to me at this hour.

180
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,820
Make sure to stay alert over there.

181
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,120
Don't let anyone catch you.

182
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,640
By the way, the Korean history teacher...

183
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,150
Yes?

184
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,390
Forget it.

185
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,260
Have a good time and be careful.

186
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,280
And make sure to have the blanket with you at night.

187
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,360
â™«  I space out all day thinking about you  â™«

188
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,400
â™«  I'm like this every chance I get, it makes me laugh  â™«

189
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,270
â™«  My head is full of sweet words  â™«

190
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,750
â™«  Everything, I like everything about you  â™«

191
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,370
â™«  For a while, my heart felt as if something was covering it up  â™«

192
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,540
â™«  No opening for the light to shine, there were no  â™«

193
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,990
â™«  But to you, rock on  â™«

194
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,160
â™«  It was possible because it was you, knock on  â™«

195
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,340
â™«  I want to fill my day with your blinding smile  â™«

196
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,990
Unpack your stuff and gather by one o'clock.

197
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,700
 Yes! 

198
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,940
â™«  I'm falling in love  â™«

199
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,630
â™«  Can't nobody, can't nobody, can't nobody, only you  â™«

200
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,890
- Where's our room?
- Isn't that our room?

201
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,970
Okay.

202
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,980
Are you in our room, too, Unni?

203
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,600
Get up.

204
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
I-I'm fine.

205
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,670
You brought so much stuff. Are you moving, Ms. Chae Ah?

206
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,370
What do you mean?

207
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,530
Ms. Hae Na! Why aren't you coming?

208
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,070
Oh, you can go up ahead. I'll wrap things up here.

209
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,300
Excuse me.

210
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,850
Do you have an extra room?

211
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,050
Sorry?

212
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,200
- We don't.
- Storage room is okay, too.

213
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,350
- Sorry?
- A storage room.

214
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,690
I'm fine with a storage room, too.

215
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,260
Ms. Han!

216
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,900
You brought all of this?

217
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,430
Of course. I wanted to buy these things so badly.

218
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,610
Also...

219
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,520
Ta-da! This, too.

220
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,610
You can't hear it, right?

221
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,990
It's a dog whistle. Only dogs could hear it.

222
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,540
Neat, huh?

223
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,920
You really can't hear it, though?

224
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,540
I can't hear it.

225
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,010
Oh, okay.

226
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,920
You don't need to lay that out.

227
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,710
Why?

228
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,080
Are you going to pee outside?

229
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,270
Oh, is it okay for dogs?

230
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,160
Anyhow...

231
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,650
thank you.

232
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,760
Come on, it's nothing.

233
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,500
Your curse couldn't be lifted because I'm a heavy sleeper.

234
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,010
This is the least I can do.

235
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,410
Not at all. I'm really sorry and thankful to you.

236
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,740
No, no.

237
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,800
All right, then. Bye, Cocoa. Woof!

238
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,300
Hey, you-

239
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,920
Hey, I-I'm not going to use this!

240
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,870
All right, here we go.

241
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,450
- Mr. Jin, take it with us.
-  Come take it with us. 

242
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,190
- Take it with us.
- Hurry, hurry!

243
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,930
All right, please get closer together. Here we go.

244
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,480
One, two, three!

245
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,810
Looks like it'll sting too much.

246
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,910
- You didn't bring any socks?
- No.

247
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,080
- Ouch! It stings, right?
- It's okay.

248
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,070
- Follow me, kids.
- I'll put a band-aid on.

249
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,520
What is it?

250
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,630
I came back from the bathroom.

251
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,630
 

252
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,060
Gosh, night duty is so exhausting.

253
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,600
What are you reading?

254
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,990
You'll have to be on the other side to see the rear side.

255
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,540
Right?

256
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,260
Mr. Jin, did you know we're on night duty together again tomorrow?

257
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,890
Ms. Hae Na asked me to switch with her.

258
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,000
 

259
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,990
I wonder if it's because she wants to be on duty with Mr. Bo Gyeom.

260
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,090
I'm going to go make a round.

261
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm so tired.

262
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,390
Walk, complete.

263
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,750
Hey, you know Mr. Seo Won?

264
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,530
Huh? What about Uncle?

265
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,730
Why is he so worried about Cocoa these days?

266
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,140
Oh, yeah?

267
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,260
Earlier, he even told me to clean Cocoa's anal glands.

268
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,460
Anal glands?

269
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,460
He even looked it up overnight, seeing her skiing on her butt.

270
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,740
It's not me!

271
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,420
Does this game have a community feature? I can't find it, though.

272
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,670
Geez, what are you saying?

273
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,640
She's so cute.

274
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,760
I think you have to stop feeding her.

275
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,740
Why? She's so cute. She's looking more and more like you.

276
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,510
I forgot my sunblock!

277
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,140
- Aigoo.
- Hey, h-hey!

278
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,310
This place looks fun.

279
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,420
Night market?

280
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,960
Should we go out later? We can just make it quick in the evening.

281
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,240
- What if we get caught?
- We'll only get some penalty points.

282
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,440
But isn't it too far? It says it's at least an hour away.

283
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,190
Let's go, please. Please? Let's go.

284
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,690
- How do we even get there?
- This is a great photo spot.

285
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,420
Good lighting.

286
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,680
Didn't you bring your camera, too?

287
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,660
- Shall we get off now?
-  Yes! 

288
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,460
Uncle!

289
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,600
Uncle, can I have some spending money?

290
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,940
Don't waste it.

291
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,040
Hurray! I won't waste it.

292
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,590
- Is that Cocoa?
- Huh?

293
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,930
Oh, well...

294
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,590
You didn't bring her by any chance, did you?

295
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,260
What?

296
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,140
Was it yesterday? I think I saw a similar-looking dog.

297
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,700
Jun Seo, wait for me!

298
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,190
Did everyone get off?

299
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,910
Man, it's so nice.

300
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,960
- Wake up.
- Huh? Why?

301
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,000
- Are we moving?
- Why are you snoozing all day like a sick chick?

302
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,980
Gosh, what would you know?

303
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,050
I'm sure you slept soundly on a comfortable bed.

304
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,010
What are you saying? Do you mean to say you slept on the streets, then?

305
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,050
Let's go ride the boats since we came all the way here.

306
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,610
The boats?

307
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,720
That sounds great!

308
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,020
Shall we go, then?

309
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,650
This way. Take one each.

310
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,070
- Isn't it deep?
- Not at all.

311
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,930
Aigoo!

312
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,180
You can sit over there.

313
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,540
You can ride with me.

314
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,520
- I'll ride this one, then.
- Yes.

315
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,350
Have a fun ride.

316
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,880
Oh, looks fun.

317
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,160
Looks like they'll work out, huh?

318
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,840
Ms. Hae Na doesn't even look at Mr. Bo Gyeom these days,

319
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,190
so I thought she gave up.

320
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,940
But I guess she didn't.

321
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,040
I think she even switched night duty time slots to partner with him.

322
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,790
Ms. Han, you switched night duty shifts, right?

323
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,660
Oh, it's because I can't wake up early in the morning.

324
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,050
Come on, wasn't it because you wanted to be on duty with me?

325
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,100
No, not at all.

326
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,400
â™«  Don't think I'd be smiling  â™«

327
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,770
I called you at dawn this morning.

328
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,170
Why?

329
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,530
One of the students had a stomach pain.

330
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,620
You have the first aid medicine.

331
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,090
Gosh, I'm sorry. Is the student okay?

332
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,120
Yes, he is fine. I got it from another teacher.

333
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,980
By the way, Ms. Han,

334
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,810
you don't really wake up once you fall asleep, huh?

335
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,420
Would you even know if someone kidnaps you?

336
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,930
â™«  I felt we knew each other well  â™«

337
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,570
â™«  That's why I thought it was love  â™«

338
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,540
Looks like you'll have to be careful in this dangerous world.

339
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,140
â™«  You will tell me someday  â™«

340
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,360
â™«  That you love me  â™«

341
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,950
There's a pine caterpillar!

342
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,650
Ms. Han, you're going to fall into the water!

343
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,210
- That's it.
- It's okay. It's just a small bug. It's fine.

344
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,080
Gosh, it's so big! I can't sit back down right now!

345
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,600
It's okay.

346
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,960
Ms. Han, jump in the water!

347
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,750
Hey, you guys!

348
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,540
What are you doing?

349
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,350
It's okay!

350
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,590
You want to switch tomorrow's night duty shift, too?

351
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,160
I can't. I switched with you today, too.

352
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,980
There's a reason why I really can't do it in the early morning hours.

353
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,140
Tomorrow's shift for you is with the head of the department. I don't want to.

354
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,290
I'll make all the questions for the final and edit them, too.

355
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,350
I still don't want to.

356
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,020
Just thinking about being alone with him at that time. Gosh, I don't want to.

357
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,940
Come on, Ms. Yoon.

358
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:53,170
Is there an exceptional reason Ms. Hae Na can't take the night shift?

359
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,080
Or maybe she wants to take the shift with me again?

360
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,600
That's it, right?

361
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,090
- It's a cat.
- Huh? A cat?

362
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,370
I don't see a cat.

363
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,300
Wait, my straw.

364
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,930
My straw's gone.

365
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,600
Hey, I must've dropped my straw.

366
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,900
Go to sleep early, you guys.

367
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,670
Unauthorized leave is prohibited. You got that?

368
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,370
It's a swallow.

369
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,800
A welcome guest...

370
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,950
Or a reunion.

371
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,800
Hello.

372
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,710
- Mi Young, Jun Hee...
- Yes.

373
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,810
- Hyun Young.
- Yes.

374
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,740
The deer is looking in another direction.

375
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,070
They met but didn't recognize each other.

376
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,530
Hello.

377
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,570
All four of you are here, right?

378
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,820
Song Da Eun, Chu So Yeon, Kwon Ri Ae...

379
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,800
What? They're sleeping already?

380
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,860
Ms. Han.

381
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,790
Did you raise a dog as a child?

382
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,690
Huh?

383
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,010
I see a puppy.

384
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,590
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

385
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,700
Goodnight.

386
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,310
Hey!

387
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,300
Hey, where is everyone?

388
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,940
They were all gone when I came out of the shower.

389
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,130
Where did they all go?

390
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,650
- Hey, take mine, too.
- Let me show you.

391
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Try it.

392
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,240
Hey, we must be caught already!
 

393
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,260
- Just decline it for now.
- hang up.

394
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,480
I hung up! I hung up!

395
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,420
 The customer is not answering the phone. Please try again later. 

396
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,200
These brats!

397
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,250
Ms. Song Yi! I'm sorry, but please take my shift.

398
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,460
My students went AWOL.

399
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,030
- I leave it to you!
- Ms. Han!

400
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,250
Are you going somewhere?

401
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,480
It's bigger than I expected.

402
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,710
Should we split up?

403
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,260
Please give me an iced tea.

404
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,300
Pardon me.

405
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,390
I'm sorry.

406
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,400
Ms. Han!

407
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,660
No sign of them, right?

408
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,410
No.

409
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,240
We're in trouble. It's almost midnight.

410
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,850
What?

411
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,440
I'll look for them over there.

412
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,350
I think we're better off moving together.

413
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,850
What?

414
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,680
We'll find them faster if we split up.

415
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,770
If they scatter after spotting us, we can't catch them alone.

416
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,360
They won't run away. We're not the police.

417
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,020
We basically are in their eyes.

418
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,110
Then let's go that way.

419
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,720
Let's go together!

420
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,540
Ow!

421
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,300
Are you in pain?

422
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,030
My stomach hurts.

423
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,410
- Should I call an ambulance?
- No!

424
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,000
I need to poop.

425
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Don't come.

426
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,370
Guys!

427
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,650
Ms. Han!

428
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,190
What the? Where did she go?

429
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,820
Ms. Han?

430
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,180
Geez, why isn't she picking up?

431
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,120
- Ms. Hae Na still hasn't returned?
- No.

432
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,980
I guess she still hasn't found her students.

433
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,570
Still?

434
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,190
She ought to find them quickly. This is big trouble!

435
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,590
Mr. Shim, you should go.

436
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,610
Then you stay in the lobby.

437
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:26,390
- I'll call you as soon as I find Ms. Hae Na-
- Okay!

438
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,370
- Daebak!
- It's not hot.

439
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,270
Let's do that next.

440
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,760
That one?

441
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,360
Hey, you're from Garam High School, aren't you?

442
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,670
It's Teacher!

443
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,080
Hey, you brats! Stop right there! Stop!

444
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,040
Hey! You brats!

445
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,770
- Whoa, Mr. Seo Won! Nice, nice.
- Hello.

446
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,510
Do you know how much trouble I went through to find you?

447
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,800
Geez!

448
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,940
You brats. You've got some nerve.

449
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,780
How dare you sneak out?

450
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,930
Be prepared! This is worth disciplinary action.

451
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,250
Ms. Hae Na isn't picking up?

452
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,590
No.

453
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,660
Please head back first. I'll look for her.

454
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,590
All right. Let's go back.

455
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,770
Why isn't she picking up?

456
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,490
 

457
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,910
Cocoa?

458
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,380
 Yes! 

459
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,970
 Oh, right. 

460
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,420
 Huh? What's going on? 

461
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,220
 Huh? Huh? 

462
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,670
 Mr. Jin! 

463
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,400
 Help me! 

464
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,180
 Where am I? 

465
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,330
 Who's that grandma? 

466
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,370
 Broth? 

467
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,250
 Hey, no way. 

468
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,130
 Rice wine that's good for removing meat odor? 

469
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,110
 No, it can't be. 

470
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,610
 Sauce? 

471
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,120
 What is this situation? 

472
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,960
Ms. Han.

473
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,940
Ms. Han, it's me.

474
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,450
Oh, this is where she transformed.

475
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,540
I told her to be careful.

476
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,460
But where did she go?

477
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,720
 

478
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,000
 Let's run away. 

479
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,980
Popi.

480
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,880
Popi!

481
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,060
Popi...

482
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,910
Popi!

483
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,780
Popi!

484
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,630
Ms. Han!

485
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,280
Ms. Han!

486
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,290
Where is she?

487
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,770
Ms. Han!

488
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,740
Ms. Han!

489
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,270
Where on earth are you, Ms. Han?

490
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,060
Please answer if you can hear me.

491
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,840
Ms. Han?

492
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,190
Where?

493
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,770
 Yul! 

494
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,320
Geez.

495
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,830
Ms. Han! Hold on, Ms. Han.

496
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,050
What should I do? Ms. Han, I'll climb down. Hold on.

497
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,870
 Huh? No, you shouldn't. 

498
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,520
 No! You'll get hurt! 

499
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,110
No, no...

500
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,660
 Yul! 

501
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,250
Damn it. I can't reach you, can I?

502
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,630
Ms. Han, hold on.

503
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,310
I'm a genius.

504
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,300
Ms. Han, here.

505
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,100
Bite down on this.

506
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,590
Bite this.

507
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,220
Ms. Han, bite this.

508
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,090
Be careful.

509
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,710
Good job.

510
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,680
That's right.

511
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,300
That's right.

512
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,400
Ms. Han, are you all right?

513
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,040
Ms. Han, hold on just a minute. I'll save you.

514
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,560
Please save me!

515
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,230
E-Excuse me!

516
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,280
It's six o'clock.

517
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,380
Is anybody there?

518
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,390
Who is it?

519
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,670
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your laundry rope?

520
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,360
Ms. Han!

521
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,680
Mr. Jin! Mr. Jin!

522
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,970
- I'm over here, Mr. Jin!
- Ms. Han!

523
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,470
Grab my hand.

524
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,320
Are you okay?

525
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,690
You came all the way here to find the students?

526
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,080
Yes.

527
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,480
What about your cell phone? You didn't pick up.

528
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,250
I lost it.

529
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,990
Thank God you don't have any serious injuries from a drop like that.

530
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,920
What a relief.

531
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,720
I was worried.

532
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:58,780
â™«  When I'm with you, I lose track of time again  â™«

533
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,990
She met Uncle.

534
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,100
That's a relief.

535
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,060
I was looking for the kids and

536
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,230
ended up going to some strange place without realizing it.

537
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,850
 
 

538
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,600
What is it?

539
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,390
I realized I had a huge misunderstanding last night.

540
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,660
Sorry?

541
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,930
Never mind.

542
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,030
I should treat Ms. Song Yi to something delicious.

543
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,550
She took both of our night shifts.

544
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:48,000
I thought you were trying to take a shift with Hyung last night.

545
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,180
It's a shame that didn't work out.

546
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,600
Oh, that's not it.

547
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,920
The reason I was trying to change shifts was because at midnight, I-

548
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,950
Anyway,

549
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,050
it's not like that.

550
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,920
Mr. Jin,

551
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,840
the favor I asked you a while ago.

552
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,560
A long time ago...

553
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,590
how I asked you to set me up with Mr. Bo Gyeom.

554
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,480
It wasn't that long ago, was it?

555
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,190
You no longer need to do that.

556
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,960
Why not?

557
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,250
Because I'm not helpful?

558
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,140
That's not it.

559
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,780
I no longer like Mr. Bo Gyeom.

560
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,460
â™«  There's not a day without  â™«

561
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,140
It just ended up like that.

562
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,580
That's right.

563
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,230
In order to grow distant,

564
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,450
you must get closer first.

565
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,580
 Sir... 

566
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,760
You're a teacher here, right?

567
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,610
I don't think I saw you at school.

568
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,850
A random grandma drags you away, so you just go?

569
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,310
Well, you know. I had no choice.

570
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:55,320
You're going to get yourself in trouble one day by trusting just anyone.

571
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,350
Could it be my students?

572
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,510
You guys!

573
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,860
You didn't get hurt anywhere, did you?

574
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,900
Fine. It's a relief,

575
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,380
but if you guys do that one more time-

576
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,190
- We're sorry, Ms. Han.
- We're sorry.

577
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,430
We won't do it again.

578
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,980
Measures will be taken according to policy once we return to school.

579
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,360
Keep that in mind.

580
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,330
All right. Go on.

582
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,780
- You tell her.
- You tell her!

583
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,310
Geez.

584
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,660
What is it now?

585
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,910
Oh, it's there? Thank goodness. I'll go and get it later.

586
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,290
Okay.

587
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,770
Ms. Han.

588
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,940
Everyone's waiting. Shall we go inside?

589
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,190
My student left her wallet behind.

590
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,000
She left her wallet?

591
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,620
Yes, at some food truck.

592
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,640
I guess you'll have to go retrieve it.

593
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,590
The students are free until 10:00 p.m., so I'll have to make a quick trip.

594
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,160
Would you like to go with me?

595
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:21,230
Since you might fall into another ditch if you go alone.

596
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,940
Of course, I'll go.

597
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,910
Huh?

598
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,390
Grandma!

599
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:44,220
Grandma, I think I found Popi.

600
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,820
Popi! Aigoo!

601
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,890
Aigoo, my baby...

602
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,690
Aigoo, you punk.

603
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,370
Aigoo! Where have you been? Come here?

604
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,950
Popi!

605
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,630
Aigoo, this is my Popi. This is Popi.

606
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:10,350
Gosh, thank you.

607
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,100
Popi, where have you been?

608
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,910
Here's the wallet.

609
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,310
- Thank you.
- Take care.

610
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,220
Yul was complaining about not bringing his hat earlier.

611
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,030
Then should I buy him one?

612
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,350
I'm greatly indebted to Yul.

613
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,460
To Yul?

614
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,450
He's very nice.

615
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,790
He's helpful with collecting the cellphones, too.

616
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,510
Should I buy one for you, too?

617
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,960
Something like this.

618
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,280
This one.

619
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,920
How many are you going to stack up?

620
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,950
I'm sorry.

621
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:13,560
Shit, I lost all my game money today, too. F***...

622
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,800
This one.

623
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,440
Or something like this?

624
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,900
I think this one looks good.

625
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,720
 

626
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,150
Apologize to my unni.

627
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,660
How could someone's feelings change just like that-

628
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,210
Why should I apologize? Your unni is strange, no matter how you look at it.

629
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:56,730
Do you think we wanted to be born like this? Do you?

630
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,270
"Us"?

631
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,870
I see. You're like her, too?

632
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,960
Han Yoo Na's sister?

633
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,900
How entertaining.

634
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,630
Is he her boyfriend?

635
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:17,960
Does he know his girlfriend is a monster?

636
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,900
Thank you.

637
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,950
Ta-da!

638
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,070
We need to hurry back, but we can clear cotton candy in no time.

639
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,570
Gosh, it's been so long since I had cotton candy.

640
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,710
Oh, did you watch that short?

641
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:45,030
If you give a raccoon food, it'll always wash it in water first.

642
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,370
So someone gave a raccoon cotton candy

643
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:50,020
and it washed it in water. And as soon as it did,

644
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,640
the cotton candy disappeared right away.

645
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,790
So the raccoon paddled through the water

646
00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:00,160
and had the world's most devastated expression.

647
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,070
You should've seen it-

648
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,650
I never watched it.

649
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,790
Geez.

650
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:49,590
   â€‹

651
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:03,850
â™«  I started having less expectations and the side of me I wanted to hide  â™«

652
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:08,810
â™«  The coincidences brought us together  â™«

653
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:14,940
â™«  They shined just as brightly as the dark times  â™«
