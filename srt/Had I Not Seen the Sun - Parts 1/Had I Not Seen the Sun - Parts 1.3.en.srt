1
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,323
PIN-YU

2
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,369
What is it?

3
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,039
Shen, it's me.

4
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,208
Listen. Tonight…

5
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,046
…I saw that same girl again.

6
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,299
Which girl?

7
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,721
Hey?

8
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,889
Pin-yu?

9
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,933
Yun-chen, is that you?

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,437
Hsiao-tung?

11
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:41,119
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

12
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,330
This isn't right.

13
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,042
We had an agreement.
They can't just change it on a whim.

14
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,752
Yes, I understand,

15
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,297
but I'm just passing on
what the prisoner said.

16
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,522
Why accept the interview?

17
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,502
I thought you agreed this was done?

18
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,798
Why can't you just disappear and die?

19
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,164
Can I ask, do you have a plan?

20
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,716
Hsu Ta-wei, answer me.

21
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,302
Tell me, what is your plan?

22
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,768
You know.

23
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,228
We wait.

24
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,230
For how long?

25
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,359
What if we wait until his execution
and he's still not talking?

26
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,194
What happens to the film?

27
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,035
Really? This isn't
your first documentary, is it?

28
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,745
Huh?

29
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,456
A shitty thing like the interviewee
refusing to cooperate,

30
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,417
it's happened before.

31
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,627
We can film around it. What's the problem?

32
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,053
Ta-wei, you don't have
any financing in place yet,

33
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,764
so there's no breach of contract
if you stop.

34
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,018
Take on a commercial project.
You might recoup your cash.

35
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,983
Remember, we have Chou-yu's wages,
and what we owe here.

36
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,527
You're so stubborn.

37
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,279
Shooting films that make no money.

38
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,614
Are you finished, Liu Chien-yi?

39
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,117
This subject just keeps coming up!

40
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,245
If this job is too hard,

41
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,580
if it's money you want,

42
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,333
then maybe you shouldn't
be making pictures.

43
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,128
Whole job's a gamble.

44
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,674
Now you listen to me!

45
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,218
Who do you think
keeps this company together?

46
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,056
I've sunk all my money into this place.
Have you thought about that for a moment?

47
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,769
Don't forget what you said
when you first walked in here.

48
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,315
The commercial projects
are useful to pay for the art.

49
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,608
And what now?

50
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,152
I'm the one who does all the paying work!

51
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,405
You get to do all your pet projects.

52
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,656
Fuck!

53
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,078
Be a director… instead of
this goddamn fucking freeloader.

54
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,165
-All right, why don't you two--
-Be quiet.

55
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,668
-I haven't even begun on Chou-yu yet.
-Me?

56
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,298
At the time, you said
we'd hire someone to work for both of us.

57
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,843
And now? She's your personal assistant.

58
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,721
I'm out there alone,
shooting films that make money.

59
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,058
I find locations,
run errands, take lunch orders.

60
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,811
How dare you slam the door and go?

61
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,439
I deserve the right to do the slamming.
My bag.

62
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,777
I'm not slamming the door
and leaving. I… I just walked over here.

63
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,742
-Ta-wei, maybe you should--
-Enough! I don't wanna hear it.

64
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,666
Leave it!

65
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,178
-Get the gear.
-Okay.

66
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,514
We're gonna film something else.

67
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,455
HSIAO-TUNG

68
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,950
Hurry up.

69
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,581
Hey. Isn't this
where Li Jen-yao used to live?

70
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,292
Yeah, before the correctional school,
he lived here.

71
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,337
Oh, are we shooting scenery?

72
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,507
-No. It's an interview.
-Who are we interviewing?

73
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,592
Oh, hey, Mrs. Li.

74
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,012
Hi. It's been a while.
How you been? Let me.

75
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,766
Have you been well?

76
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,628
Get in here.

77
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,046
I'm coming!

78
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,839
Quickly.

79
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,174
All right.

80
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,054
Here.

81
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,601
You ready? Give me the tablet.

82
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,986
Hey? Mrs. Li?

83
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,322
Here, take a look.

84
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,368
It's what you asked me to film.

85
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,784
Last question.

86
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,496
You've been in here for years.

87
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,957
Do you miss your mother?

88
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,589
Then,

89
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,093
is there anything
that you want to say to her?

90
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,668
So, Mrs. Li,

91
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,420
this is what you asked me to do for you.

92
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,175
So, do you think
that we can start the interview?

93
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,429
Can…

94
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,515
Can I see it again?

95
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,974
Oh yes, of course.

96
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,899
Psst!

97
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,208
So, Mrs. Li,

98
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,210
you mentioned earlier

99
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,797
that Jen-yao's relationship with his dad
wasn't very good, right?

100
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,759
Can you say more
about what kind of person his dad was?

101
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,973
Uh…

102
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,391
Uh…

103
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,852
My husband,

104
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,895
the thing with him,

105
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
he wasn't really bad at the start.

106
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,777
He looked after us when he was well.

107
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,696
He would

108
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,658
take us on drives to the seaside,

109
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,910
and then we'd go out to eat.

110
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,913
Work was, well, not as great,

111
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,957
so he started drinking.

112
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,295
He drank more and more,
which of course led to worse behavior.

113
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,007
I couldn't say when he began

114
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,508
beating me.

115
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,178
But at the start, you must know,

116
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,138
he never hit Jen-yao.

117
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,725
After a while,

118
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
Jen-yao couldn't bear it.

119
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,021
He wanted to protect me.

120
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,942
That's probably when he got angrier,
and started hitting him.

121
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,573
Uh, Mrs. Li,

122
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,451
the statement that you gave the police

123
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,289
said that you were both
subjected to domestic violence for years.

124
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,710
Uh, in all that time,
didn't you ever fight back?

125
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,715
Fight back?

126
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,678
How could I?

127
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,308
A woman alone,

128
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,602
I had no chance.

129
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,483
It wasn't even possible to run away.

130
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,071
There were no options, so I

131
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,990
was always at his mercy.

132
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,243
He could do what he wanted.

133
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,955
I thought that he'd leave Jen-yao alone
if he could beat me.

134
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,957
Jen-yao wouldn't listen.

135
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,458
He had to resist.

136
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,544
He'd even fight back sometimes.

137
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,130
But how could he do that? He's his son.

138
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,049
Should a son beat his dad?

139
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:06,303
So I would grab on to Jen-yao
and stop him.

140
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,639
I let his father beat me.

141
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:13,269
When he sobered up, I thought
everything would go back to being normal,

142
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,062
and everything would be fine.

143
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,482
It's wrong for sons to beat their fathers.

144
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,464
Do you suppose…

145
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,303
he's in there

146
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,722
because of me?

147
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,184
He was so well-behaved.

148
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,270
A good son.

149
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,232
Considerate.

150
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,155
I don't know how he turned out like this.

151
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,992
So, Mrs. Li,

152
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,578
have you asked Jen-yao

153
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,622
why he behaved that way?

154
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,087
No. No.

155
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,636
I haven't seen him since that day.

156
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,889
Why don't you visit him?

157
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,039
Take care of yourself from now on.

158
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,712
I won't come back.

159
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,733
Mrs. Li, are you okay?

160
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,319
You all right?

161
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,329
I haven't taken my medicine.

162
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,706
I don't feel well.

163
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,378
Good. So, Mrs. Li, that's no drama.

164
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,257
If you're not feeling well,
then let's finish for the day.

165
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,468
When you're feeling better,
then we can come back.

166
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,554
Wasn't this enough today?

167
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,307
-Uh--
-W… What else do you need to know about?

168
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,185
-You don't--
-Uh, you know what, it's really all right.

169
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,229
So, if you don't wanna talk,

170
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
we'll end filming there.

171
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,695
Now, if you want to talk more about this
to anyone in the future,

172
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,906
or you think
you can continue with the documentary,

173
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,991
then just call me.

174
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,620
Did you catch that?
Pack up the gear. I'm going for a smoke.

175
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,913
I'll bring the car around.

176
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,933
What are you doing?

177
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,147
Mrs. Li?

178
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,649
Mrs. Li?

179
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,611
Do you know the girl in this photo?

180
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,404
No, I don't know her.

181
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,239
-I don't know.
-What is it? Let's go

182
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,324
-Hang on.
-Okay?

183
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,950
What about this CD?

184
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,327
Is this Li Jen-yao's?

185
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,831
After Li Jen-yao was arrested,

186
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,002
I went to tidy up his place in Taipei
and found this.

187
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,881
Why are you going through our belongings?

188
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,469
We… We didn't. We're going. Let's go.

189
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,387
Finish packing up.

190
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,306
I'm sorry, Mrs. Li.

191
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,559
Come on. Quickly.

192
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,984
Come here. Come on. What's up with you?

193
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,196
Young lady,

194
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,156
we're making a documentary.

195
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,116
We're not police.

196
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,953
I'm just trying to find out
about the girl in the photo--

197
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,205
So, who is this girl? Do you know her?

198
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,251
I'm not sure it counts as knowing her.

199
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,258
So, do you know this girl?

200
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,183
Hey, come on, that's littering.

201
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,227
You're so annoying.

202
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,243
So I'll only ask you once.

203
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,705
-It's true what you said?
-Mm.

204
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,456
All this about your place

205
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,254
being previously occupied
by a ghost who's possessing you

206
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:41,091
and looking up stuff on Li Jen-yao?

207
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,009
It's all true?

208
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
I promise.

209
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,889
Why would I lie to you?

210
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,144
What I can't figure out
is why the ghost came to me.

211
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,148
But I just realized
that they went to the same high school.

212
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,068
-It's starting to make sense.
-Get to the point, please.

213
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,408
All of Li Jen-yao's victims,
besides Wang Yu-hsiang's family,

214
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,452
were students at his high school.

215
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,912
So… So now you think

216
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,666
that this ghost
was killed by Li Jen-yao too?

217
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,381
I don't know yet.

218
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,263
Okay, then.

219
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,475
You go back to Taipei.

220
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,771
You tell Chien for me.
I'll be here a bit longer.

221
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,230
Why?

222
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,568
I'm going to find out the identity
of this ghost that you're seeing.

223
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,365
And you are going back to the prison.

224
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,951
Ask Li Jen-yao to his face
if he knows her.

225
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,634
TO CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

226
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:20,357
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, AGENCY OF CORRECTIONS

227
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,568
But I thought
he didn't want to be interviewed.

228
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,531
Use your brain.
He only said we couldn't film him.

229
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,367
He didn't say
we couldn't meet him face to face.

230
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,547
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

231
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,930
Why did you change your mind
about the film?

232
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,228
No reason.

233
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,564
I just did.

234
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,361
Don't come here again.

235
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,488
I won't see you.

236
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,122
If you wanted to,

237
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,542
you could have declined.

238
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,129
Why did you meet with me?

239
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,219
Because

240
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,431
I want to say goodbye to you.

241
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,021
I don't have anyone left to say bye to…

242
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,279
Chou Pin-yu.

243
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,117
Bye-bye.

244
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,045
That was all.

245
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,755
I should go.

246
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,382
Wait. One more question.

247
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,015
A few days back, I visited your mom.

248
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,811
I found this picture
when I was looking in your room.

249
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,277
What was your relationship?

250
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,413
Something tells me

251
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,667
the reason you did all of this

252
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,670
had something to do with her.

253
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,802
What a wild theory.

254
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,180
I barely knew her.

255
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,187
Her name escapes me.

256
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,902
Did you kill her?

257
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,881
What was your relationship?

258
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,176
Did you kill her?

259
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,272
What happened in 2007?

260
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,276
From what we know, in 2007,

261
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,153
you stabbed Ouyang Ti.

262
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,283
Can you tell us
about the nature of your conflict?

263
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,916
Did you kill her?

264
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,215
What is it you wanted to say?

265
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,219
What if he didn't kill that girl?

266
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,973
But why would he hide their relationship?

267
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,604
What if the girl isn't dead?

268
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,482
Then why would she haunt me?

269
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,943
Oh, god dammit!

270
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,529
What am I missing?!

271
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,789
Chiang Hsiao-tung, focus.

272
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,958
One, two, three, four.

273
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,920
Extend, two, three, four.
And one, two, three.

274
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,923
Push on your toes. Two, three, four.

275
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,171
Why did you bring me here?

276
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,715
I didn't bring you.

277
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,300
You came yourself.

278
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,391
Didn't you?

279
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,319
I want to know who you are.

280
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,447
How are you and Jen-yao connected?

281
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,369
Are you sure you wanna know?

282
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,621
Mm.

283
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,221
Li Jen-yao!

284
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,440
Did you not see me waving at you?

285
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,951
I know you saw me.

286
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,953
Why'd you ignore me?

287
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,836
Hsiao-tung.

288
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,879
Yun-chen.

289
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,631
What is it?

290
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,721
Yun-chen, what are you doing?

291
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,515
How did you meet Li Jen-yao?

292
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,562
We…

293
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,898
We made plans to eat lunch on the roof,

294
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,984
but you were busy that day

295
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,196
and he happened to be there,
so we started getting to know each other.

296
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,407
Why?

297
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,409
You look so serious.

298
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,370
Because I am serious.
You should stay away from him.

299
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,289
Li Jen-yao isn't who you think he is.

300
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,291
What are you saying?

301
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,461
You know Ouyang Ti,
the boy that you keep rejecting?

302
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,130
Yeah. Why?

303
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,509
In freshman year,
Ouyang Ti and his friends

304
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,720
had some issue with Li Jen-yao.

305
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,430
They got into a fight.

306
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,182
Li Jen-yao went psycho.

307
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,810
One of the boys was sent to hospital.
He had to get stitches.

308
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,896
Seriously?

309
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,272
Yes, seriously.

310
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,024
It was a whole thing.

311
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,487
Li Jen-yao was given a demerit.
He was almost expelled.

312
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,034
But all we know is they fought.

313
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,952
We don't have the whole story.

314
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,829
Who's to say what really happened?

315
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,873
Maybe Li Jen-yao didn't start it.

316
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,334
You should stay away from him.

317
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,961
Pretend you don't know him.
He's only trouble.

318
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,297
Don't you have enough on?

319
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,050
Why are you wasting your time with him?

320
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,677
Yun-chen,

321
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,013
in all the time I've known you,

322
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,516
you've never said a bad word about anyone.

323
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,643
Why do you hate Li Jen-yao?

324
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,645
Did he do something to you?

325
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,815
Or is it just these rumors?

326
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,949
Forget it. I'm going to class.

327
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,951
You should hurry or you'll be late.

328
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,494
Hey, Lai Yun-chen!

329
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,502
OCEAN DRAGON SEAFOOD

330
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,756
Here are your fried clams. Enjoy.

331
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,177
Come in, take a seat.

332
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,891
I'm very depressed.

333
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,103
Your mother and I, we had an arrangement.

334
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,897
-Boss
-I thought she'd pay me today.

335
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,025
And now look.

336
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,530
It's past four o'clock.

337
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,199
She hasn't shown. She won't pick up.

338
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,326
Why?

339
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,245
Is she standing me up?

340
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,789
Huh? She's as bad as your father.

341
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:11,085
Or does she think
all gangsters are saints, huh?

342
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,256
If you're after money, I can't help.
You should leave.

343
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,799
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

344
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,762
You don't need to be scared of me.
You're always trying to get rid of me

345
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,809
Actually, I feel sorry for you,
growing up with a useless dad like that.

346
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,354
So I came here today to help you out.

347
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,441
I want to make you an offer.

348
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,570
A chance for you
to clear the debt completely

349
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,947
and say goodbye to your dad for good.

350
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,618
From now on at school,

351
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,661
sell amulets for me.

352
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,371
Keep your classmates safe.

353
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,415
It's up to you.

354
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:53,920
You can sell them individually
for 50 bucks, or the lot for a grand.

355
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,963
If you're ready for this,

356
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,135
tell you what, I'll be Mr. Nice Guy,
spot you the outlay. Huh?

357
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,723
I won't sell drugs for you.

358
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,358
Hey! Back off! I'll call the cops.

359
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,152
Hey, relax.
I got a little something for you.

360
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,571
Smoke it out back. Go on.

361
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,536
I can be the guy that hurts you,

362
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,914
or the one person that saves you.

363
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,208
Your choice. Hmm?

364
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,542
Here.

365
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,882
To keep you safe.

366
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,717
Right?

367
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,055
You let me know.

368
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,602
-Wang, come on!
-All right.

369
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,024
Move it.

370
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,580
MAY YOU BE SAFE

371
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,969
Now, listen, you're an excellent worker.

372
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,806
-But those guys are--
-Boss, it's okay.

373
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,270
I won't make this hard.

374
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm resigning.

375
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,902
Thanks for everything you've done.

376
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,413
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

377
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,886
Ah, Li Jen-yao, you're here.
Why aren't you at work?

378
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,263
Where are you going?

379
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,349
Oh.

380
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,767
Taipei.

381
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,063
I'm going there to help out a friend
for a few days. Uh, here.

382
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,482
Some cash. Oh.

383
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,569
Here.

384
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,613
Take this.

385
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,659
Don't stay up, and remember to eat, okay?
Go easy with the money.

386
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,289
Are you going alone?

387
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,624
Uh…

388
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,459
Of course.

389
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:43,172
I don't know where your dad's got to.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

390
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,386
I gotta go now.

391
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,512
The bus is coming.

392
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,932
All right, take care of yourself, okay?

393
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,054
Hello?

394
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,682
Is that Jen-yao?

395
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,059
What's wrong?

396
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,521
You're lying, aren't you?

397
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,941
What are you talking about?

398
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,694
I'm not lying to you.

399
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,658
You're lying.
You're not visiting a friend.

400
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,412
You're not coming back.

401
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,164
You're leaving me.

402
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,758
I'm not leaving permanently.

403
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,387
I really have to go to Taipei
to be with my friend.

404
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,931
I won't be long.

405
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,308
Come on now, don't worry.

406
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,311
Where are you?

407
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,313
Can't you come home?

408
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,023
Who's that?

409
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,608
Jen-yao?

410
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,819
Don't tell him anything.

411
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,864
What if he lets slip where we're going?

412
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,784
Have you thought about me?

413
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,911
Do you know what they'll do to me?

414
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,747
How could you be so selfish?

415
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,458
Jen-yao.

416
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,712
Don't be like this.

417
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,882
Please listen to me.

418
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,676
If they turn up,

419
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,345
just tell them we're not home.

420
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,014
Don't even open the door.

421
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,808
They won't do anything to you.

422
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,020
Ma?

423
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,942
I'm begging. Please come back.

424
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,824
Just leave him, please.

425
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,493
Come back.

426
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,412
I'll take you away.

427
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,330
Anywhere you want.

428
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,291
I can support us.

429
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,210
Just leave him, Ma.

430
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,462
I beg you.

431
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,173
Listen to me.

432
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,344
Just this once, listen.

433
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,712
What is it you want him to know? Huh?

434
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,297
W… W… Well…

435
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,425
Well, I don't think this is right.

436
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,469
-We should go back.
-Are you crazy?

437
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,889
Huh? Don't forget,
your name's on that IOU as well.

438
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,726
If we go back now,
then Big K could even kill us.

439
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,980
Running away is better than your son
arranging our funeral, right?

440
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,783
So if we're not there,

441
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,827
they won't hurt Jen-yao, will they?

442
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,580
Just relax. The boy won't get hurt.

443
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,384
FROM TAICHUNG TO TAIPEI
