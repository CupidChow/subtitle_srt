1
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,891
Just tell me the truth.

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,227
I need to know.

3
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,188
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung…

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,399
Hey, Pin-yu.

5
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,113
Pin-yu?

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,708
Didn't we make a promise
that we'd keep this

7
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,502
a secret?

8
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:18,138
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

9
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,136
Hi. When did you get back?

10
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,346
Oh. Yesterday.

11
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,726
Pin-yu said you were
staying in Taichung for a while.

12
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,649
TO LI JEN-YAO

13
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,532
This is for today.

14
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,621
You've got mail.

15
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,935
TA-WEI

16
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,020
Hey, where are you?

17
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,190
Ta-wei, I'm so sorry. I overslept.

18
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,233
You overslept.

19
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,319
Yeah, I'm not feeling very well.

20
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,363
I hardly slept last night.

21
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,867
Fine. No use yelling at you now.

22
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,120
There's a bunch of stuff to do.
Just get into the office now.

23
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,002
She doesn't sound well.

24
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,088
Is she feeling unwell?

25
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,675
No, no. She said
something about sleeping in.

26
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,927
-She'll be in soon.
-Mm.

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,889
Hey, listen, I have to get going.

28
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,352
Can you tell her there are some videos
here I want her to look over?

29
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,145
Where are you going?

30
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,819
Well, Li Jen-yao wants to meet with me.

31
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,697
Li Jen-yao?
But he said he wouldn't talk to anyone.

32
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,739
Oh yeah.

33
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,907
You won't believe it.

34
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,993
After that, I wrote a letter.

35
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,954
I made sure to throw
the name Chiang Hsiao-tung in there.

36
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,956
He turned 360.

37
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,165
Why's that?

38
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,168
I'm gonna find out why. All right?

39
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,504
-I'll see you soon.
-Wait.

40
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,008
There's something I haven't told you.

41
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,094
When you were staying in Taichung,
I got a phone call.

42
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:08,016
Someone heard about the documentary
and they want to invest in it.

43
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,809
-Huh?
-Yep.

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,894
But on one condition.

45
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,067
She wants Li Jen-yao to explain exactly
what the motive was for killing her son.

46
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,529
Who… Who is it?

47
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,115
She's the mother of one of the victims,

48
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,283
Ouyang Ti.

49
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,755
Uh, thank you for talking to me.

50
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm only here to let you know,

51
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,303
no matter what you want,

52
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,472
I won't help you make this film.

53
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,849
Yeah, I know.

54
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,812
That's why I wrote that letter to tell you

55
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,524
that if I'm going
to finish this documentary,

56
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,614
I really have to use someone else
to help you tell the story.

57
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,159
Ah, hold on.

58
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,461
Chiang Hsiao-tung? How'd that be?

59
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,509
Huh.

60
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,844
Well, from your expression,

61
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,555
it looks like this is the one.

62
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,558
I've just been to Taichung.

63
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,813
I saw Chiang Hsiao-tung's school friends
and teachers.

64
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:41,901
Because of all the things you did
in the past, they all know you.

65
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,194
And remember you.

66
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:48,574
When they spoke about you,
well, not one said anything nice.

67
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,536
But mention Chiang Hsiao-tung to anyone,

68
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,789
whole other story

69
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,000
Hsiao-tung was always so optimistic.

70
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,129
Um, I'm a dancer too,

71
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,924
and whenever I saw her dance,
I was completely mesmerized.

72
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,926
So many years had passed…

73
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,386
She was on another level.

74
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,388
…but not only did they remember her…

75
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:15,184
Back when we were classmates,
I never saw her lose her temper.

76
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,019
She was always very kind.

77
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,980
…when they spoke about her,

78
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,025
they kept saying
what a good girl Chiang Hsiao-tung was.

79
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,236
-She deserved it.
-They couldn't help smiling.

80
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,113
-That's right!
-She was…

81
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,451
They had no trouble remembering
good times they'd had with her back then.

82
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:36,205
Chiang Hsiao-tung was the most talented
and hardworking student I'd ever taught…

83
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,875
When they spoke about Chiang Hsiao-tung,

84
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,920
they'd remember how special she was,
like she was still with them.

85
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,757
The way they remembered her,
and the stories they told…

86
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,009
She could've become…

87
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,179
…it was like
it had all happened just yesterday.

88
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,556
I got chills.

89
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,601
Everything seemed so close.

90
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,146
But then I asked

91
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,274
about what happened
to Chiang Hsiao-tung later.

92
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,859
Then things got quiet.

93
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,154
They couldn't speak for a long time.

94
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,364
That kind of silence,

95
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,701
that's something I've seen a lot of.

96
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,882
I think I know,

97
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,510
better than anyone,

98
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,971
what that silence means.

99
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:49,362
I have to say, there's one thing
I find really, really strange.

100
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,823
Whenever I asked
about you and Chiang Hsiao-tung,

101
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,742
not one person knew.

102
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,205
They all said they'd never
seen you two together at school.

103
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,625
No one realized
you two had ever crossed paths.

104
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,379
Uh,

105
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,089
by the way…

106
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,803
…that video online of Chiang Hsiao-tung,

107
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,722
you've watched it?

108
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,810
Wow.

109
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,770
You have watched it.

110
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,606
Look, I'll be honest with you.

111
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,358
If I were her boyfriend,

112
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,611
I would fucking kill those bastards
without thinking, you know?

113
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,497
Do you know
who the people who filmed it are?

114
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,916
Who nearly killed Chiang Hsiao-tung?

115
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,086
There's something I wanna fucking know.

116
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,256
You were obviously
so close to Chiang Hsiao-tung,

117
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,759
yet no one else at school
ever knew about it.

118
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,678
You won't talk about it.

119
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,683
Gee…

120
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,476
You were her boyfriend.

121
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,938
Those things that happened
to Chiang Hsiao-tung,

122
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
how much did you know?

123
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,859
If you knew all about it, huh,

124
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,070
then surely you'd want
to get revenge for her?

125
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,948
Huh? Tell me!

126
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,336
I admit

127
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,340
that I knew Chiang Hsiao-tung.

128
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,267
The Chiang Hsiao-tung I knew
wasn't like that.

129
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,978
But if you've seen the video,

130
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,314
there's no question
it's Chiang Hsiao-tung.

131
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,109
-It's just so hard to believe.
-I'm back!

132
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,739
Hi. How's it going?

133
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,824
Not too bad.

134
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,245
Chiang Hsiao-tung's file
is pretty much complete.

135
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,750
Ta-wei.

136
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,543
-Mm?
-How about you?

137
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,545
I heard from Chien

138
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,215
that you interviewed Li Jen-yao.

139
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,179
Li Jen-yao?

140
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,932
He said that he knew Chiang Hsiao-tung.

141
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,142
What did he tell you?

142
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,356
He told me he did know Chiang Hsiao-tung.

143
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,775
But not in the way I expected.

144
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,072
He said, Chiang Hsiao-tung
was his girlfriend's best friend.

145
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,454
-His girlfriend's best friend?
-Yeah.

146
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,915
It was a girl in his class called

147
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,960
Lai Yun-chen, I think.

148
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,131
He said they'd broken school rules
by dating

149
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,341
and were given demerits by the teachers.

150
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:02,138
They had to write
some letters of contrition, or a pledge.

151
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,305
Really?

152
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,974
That can't be right.

153
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,559
I didn't believe it, did I?

154
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,895
I even called their teacher
from those days.

155
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,106
I asked him straight out, "Is this true"?

156
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,900
He actually said yes.

157
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,946
He also said
he still has the letter that they wrote.

158
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,365
Damn that old man.

159
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,951
I wish I'd known all of this earlier.

160
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,833
All this time has been wasted.
All these bad leads.

161
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,335
Ta-wei,

162
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,214
do you believe what Li Jen-yao said?

163
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,968
The Chiang Hsiao-tung incident
had nothing to do with him?

164
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,222
Look at this.

165
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,641
Here.

166
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,686
How many times have I filmed Li Jen-yao?

167
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,565
If he was telling the truth
or he was lying, wouldn't I know?

168
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,444
I think

169
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:05,326
this relationship between Li Jen-yao and
Chiang Hsiao-tung was more than he says.

170
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,453
I'm convinced

171
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,998
there's something more
he's not telling me.

172
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,640
Thanks. I'll have it later after practice.

173
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,851
Practice for what?

174
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,812
The solo is yours without a question!

175
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,730
Don't get carried away.

176
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,984
What's going on?
Why are you trying so hard?

177
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,404
I'm expecting someone to be there.
I don't want to disappoint.

178
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,949
Who is it that you're expecting?
Your boyfriend?

179
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,784
Do you have a boyfriend?

180
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,203
-Who has a boyfriend?
-Hey! No, hey.

181
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,162
I never said that!

182
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,039
Tell us who it is!

183
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,749
Are you stupid?

184
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,295
I just bought that powder.
You spilled it everywhere.

185
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,212
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,673
I don't care how sorry you are.

187
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,259
-You want a slap?
-She's so mean.

188
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,062
What are you looking at? Bitch.

189
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,511
Hey, buddy. Sure you can manage?

190
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,971
It's okay. I've got it.

191
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,265
Well, if you've got it,
then get a move on.

192
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,560
There's still a lot to unload. Hurry up.

193
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:37,895
Sure.

194
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,654
Buddy, good job.

195
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,367
-Thanks.
-Be here on time tomorrow.

196
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,576
-Sure.
-Good.

197
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,803
Jen-yao, where are you?

198
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,930
Come home soon, won't you?

199
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,724
I've taken care of things. Just come home.

200
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,269
Whatever it is, we can talk about it.
Don't make me worry.

201
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,024
You should write "trash."

202
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,403
-Write "loser!"
-Can you even spell?

203
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,906
Hey, dumbass,
you wrote "Gen-yao," not "Jen-yao."

204
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,033
-Moron.
-I'll write "trash."

205
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,035
Shit, what's that you're writing?

206
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm making it thicker
and longer. Like me, you know?

207
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,291
-I'm, like, 12 inches.
-I should jizz on it.

208
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,419
What the fuck? I sit right here.

209
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,171
-I don't wanna smell that shit.
-You should jizz on it.

210
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,090
-That's small.
-Whatever.

211
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,761
I gotta hand it to you, Ouyang.
It really worked.

212
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,389
You really got Li Jen-yao
kicked out of school.

213
00:16:55,472 --> 00:17:00,477
Yeah, it was badass. But the truth is,
I'm disappointed that it's over now.

214
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,147
-It was too easy.
-What did you want?

215
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,775
If you want to keep fucking with him,
we should bring him back again.

216
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,320
All right. How do we do that?

217
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:32,152
Your call will be
sent to voicemail. Charges may apply.

218
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,309
Who are you calling trash?

219
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,020
You're trash.

220
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,529
Why are you here?

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,247
It's all right.
I don't care what they say about me.

222
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,086
But thanks.

223
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,131
I didn't come here to clean it.

224
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,177
I saw it and it set off my OCD,
so I had to clean it.

225
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:22,930
Oh.

226
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,942
It's so windy.

227
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,777
They got knocked over.

228
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,864
I mean it.

229
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,382
Got plans later?

230
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,260
Call Jung-tai, see if they're done yet.

231
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,470
Tell him to come over to mine.

232
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,139
Hey. Isn't that your girl?

233
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,560
What's she doing with Li Jen-yao?

234
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,520
Wei-ting.

235
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,230
Shut it.

236
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,450
Come on.

237
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,120
Okay.

238
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,792
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

239
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,517
Jen-yao, you're here!
I was going to search for you in Taipei.

240
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,771
Ma, here's some money.

241
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,734
Take care of yourself.
I'm going back to Taipei.

242
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,652
I'll visit when I can.

243
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,030
Uh, Jen-yao, the thing is…

244
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,868
Whether you come back or not,
it's your decision,

245
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,788
but your mom will have money,
because my debt's been settled.

246
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,415
Keep your cash.

247
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,626
Here.

248
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,182
It's true.

249
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,727
We're safe from the debtors.

250
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,110
Your dad went to Taipei
to borrow money from a friend.

251
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,531
He put the money on a bet
and actually won!

252
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,871
Oh, the winnings were enough
to pay off the whole debt.

253
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,958
Your dad squared things with Big K
a few days ago.

254
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,169
He won't torment us anymore.

255
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,672
That's why I called about returning.

256
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,305
So, the debt's paid?

257
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,556
It is.

258
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,767
They have dropped the debt.

259
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,560
Jen-yao,

260
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,814
I'd like you to come back.

261
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,736
I know that

262
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,364
we've let you down.

263
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,243
But your father has really changed.

264
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,914
He's working again.
He's got a job as a carpenter.

265
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,751
His old boss took him back.
He's drinking less now too.

266
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,713
Please just trust me.
He has changed for the better.

267
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,468
Huh?

268
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,719
Ma,

269
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,306
let's talk about something else.

270
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,446
Congratulations. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

271
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,239
Here. Hey.

272
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:14,244
Today, I was gonna have a guy
slaughter a pig and send it over.

273
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,788
Happily ever after!

274
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,999
Into the sunset!

275
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,917
I can't believe I saw you guys.

276
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,712
Hey, let's drink.
Come on, a drink for these two.

277
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,425
Oh, I can't believe it.
How could I forget?

278
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,219
You're not even old enough to drink yet.
What am I thinking?

279
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,429
Don't worry. Ma'am.

280
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,848
Here. I'll drink to you.

281
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,310
Looks like you don't
have to run away anymore.

282
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,687
You can give those old legs a rest!

283
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,106
I can't believe it.

284
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,194
It seems your husband's debt
is finally paid.

285
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,613
Huh? So badass!

286
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,740
So here's to you. Cheers.

287
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,408
Mm!

288
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,001
Hey.

289
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,504
I've finished my drink.

290
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,839
Why haven't you?

291
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,926
You disrespecting me?

292
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,942
Ma, let's go home.

293
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,360
Hey, buddy.

294
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,907
You got a lot of potential, kid.

295
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,159
We could work together.

296
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,245
No?

297
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,913
That's a shame.

298
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,431
Ma.

299
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,519
-I'm going--
-Did you have enough to eat?

300
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,022
Would you like noodles?

301
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,732
I've got fresh oysters.

302
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,819
And white shrimp.

303
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,280
Is that still your favorite?

304
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,532
It won't take long.

305
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,209
Mm-hmm.

306
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,532
Oh.

307
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,284
Hello?

308
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,245
Where am I?

309
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
I'm getting high at the hangout.

310
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,248
Yeah.

311
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,543
Uh-huh. You coming?

312
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,796
Get over here.

313
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,297
Oh, okay.

314
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,971
Eat that. You need more greens.

315
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,065
Hey! Young boss.

316
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,902
Hey, my friend's coming over.
I'm gonna need to replenish my stock.

317
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,822
Not now, okay? It's not good timing.

318
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm not asking you to do it.

319
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,076
Send a lackey, motherfucker.

320
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,080
Come on!
You're the boss's son. I would if I could.

321
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,501
It's just that, uh,
a little bee got caught just yesterday,

322
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,753
so now they wanna know
who he's working for.

323
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,632
I'm telling you,
just wait until this blows over, okay?

324
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,300
Who gives a fuck?

325
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,391
Fuck.

326
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,185
Do I need to worry?

327
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,356
Relax. My guys
know to keep their mouths shut.

328
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,193
My dad.

329
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,781
How much does my dad know?
Does he know about this?

330
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,451
He doesn't know anything.

331
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,078
But I did talk to your mother
about some things

332
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,913
in case we need to call in a favor.

333
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,211
How much does my mom know?

334
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,797
Listen, I didn't tell her
that you're using.

335
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,801
I just said that you're getting gear
from me to sell to some friends.

336
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,890
Then what?

337
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,725
She was pretty pissed.

338
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,896
She said to hurry up and find a fall guy,
and not to tell the boss.

339
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,939
She thinks he'll fucking kill you.

340
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,197
Listen. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

341
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,950
But you need to behave.

342
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,204
The boss is getting ready
for the election.

343
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,791
If there's a scandal, hey,
don't worry about it, you're fine.

344
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,751
It'll all blow over.

345
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,962
Me? You'll never hear from me again.

346
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,470
If you're looking for a scapegoat,

347
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,889
I have someone.

348
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,307
He's perfect.

349
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,650
-How's life in Taipei?
-It's okay.

350
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,238
Has your grandma tried to find you?

351
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,406
Yeah.

352
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,868
But my mom wouldn't let her see me.

353
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,833
I heard them arguing.
My mom said she'd fight her in court.

354
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,594
SHE SAID SHE'D SUE GRANDMA FOR ABUSING ME

355
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,519
She said Grandma mistreated me.

356
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,188
My mom knows
Grandma cares about appearances

357
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,982
and wouldn't want it to escalate.

358
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,735
Eventually, she compromised
and said I could stay with my mom.

359
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,530
I can decide my own future
when I'm old enough.

360
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,159
That's great.

361
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,456
By the way, I wanted to tell you,

362
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,458
my mom wants me to have a fresh start,

363
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,419
so I've changed my name.

364
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,297
I've taken my mom's maiden name.
I'm Shen Mu.

365
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,010
Is it okay if I still call you Yun-chen?

366
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,973
Okay.

367
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,808
Only you can.

368
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,525
There's something I wanna tell you.

369
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,236
What is it?

370
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,842
I think

371
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,679
that I like Li Jen-yao.

372
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,192
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT LIKE HIM?

373
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,291
I knew you did. It's super obvious.

374
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,754
Really? Is it that obvious?

375
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,632
Do you think Li Jen-yao knows?

376
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,095
Are you going to tell him how you feel?

377
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,058
I'm not sure how he feels about me.

378
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,478
If I tell him, I might get rejected.

379
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,492
Maybe he'll be happy about it.

380
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:18,371
No matter what,
you should be with the person you like.

381
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,125
If he rejects you or breaks your heart,

382
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,210
I'll come back and blow his head off!

383
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,385
You're the best. I love you.

384
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,541
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

385
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,681
Jen-yao, are you awake?

386
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,356
You're awake!

387
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,650
I bought breakfast.

388
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,527
Wash your face and we'll eat.

389
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,042
The flatbread shop in the alley was open.

390
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,796
I also got a bowl of milkfish congee
for you. There.

391
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,512
How is it? Is it good?

392
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,680
It's all right.

393
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,770
Jen-yao. Here.

394
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,403
Hmm.

395
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:19,117
Ah. A lady who I work with

396
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:25,706
said her son had a poor attendance record
and was given a demerit by the school.

397
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,375
He was nearly expelled.

398
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,087
They spoke to the school
and he could return.

399
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,923
I was thinking,

400
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,926
your case isn't so different.

401
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,222
We can go to the school
and talk to the teachers,

402
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,599
and see if they'll let you come back.

403
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,644
You should

404
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,231
finish your schooling, huh?

405
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,568
I won't come back here.

406
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,696
And I'm not going back to school.

407
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,866
I'm going back to Taipei.

408
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,451
Jen-yao. Jen-yao!

409
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,457
Let him leave. So what if he goes?

410
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,929
You need to air this place out.
It's so musty.

411
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,473
-Dad!
-Hmm?

412
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,853
This place has been empty for months.
She should put it on the market.

413
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,314
Your aunt doesn't need the money.

414
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,609
Stop pressing it. The fan isn't broken.

415
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,237
When your aunt went to Canada,
they turned off the utilities.

416
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,074
If the fan worked, it would mean
there are ghosts here.

417
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,077
Check it out.

418
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,871
How do I look?

419
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,581
Do you think I could be in a K drama?

420
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,874
Huh?

421
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,086
You know, I think,
from this side, I look like Hyun Bin.

422
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,087
Ah.

423
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,590
From this side, I'm more like Won Bin.

424
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,591
Can you see it?

425
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,426
You look like a has-been.

426
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,305
Stop goofing around
and help me with the cleaning! Hurry up.

427
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,725
-Stop goofing around. You're so lazy.
-You stop goofing around!

428
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,101
-No, you--
-Hsiao-tung!

429
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,519
Take those bags out.

430
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,648
-Oh.
-Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

431
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,567
That towel you're wearing
is a cleaning rag.

432
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,486
-No, it isn't.
-Get to work!

433
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,588
Hello?

434
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,465
Hey.

435
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:44,095
I'm… going back to Taipei.
I wanted to tell you.

436
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,140
Going back to Taipei? So soon?

437
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,058
Mm.

438
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,438
Have you bought a ticket yet?
What time do you leave?

439
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,983
I haven't bought a ticket.

440
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,401
Why?

441
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,863
Mm, if you haven't bought a ticket
and you're not in a hurry,

442
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,575
why don't we meet up before you go?

443
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,911
I was thinking maybe we could get dinner?

444
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,081
All right.

445
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,000
What should we eat?

446
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,045
Let's go to the night market.
I'll pick something there.

447
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,839
Okay.

448
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,343
Let's meet at 7:00.
I'll see you by the alley.

449
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,846
Hmm. See you there.

450
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,222
See you there.

451
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,493
Come here. Get in!

452
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,790
You seem like you're pretty happy.
Where are you off to?

453
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,461
-I was gonna play cards.
-Oh.

454
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,546
Big K,

455
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,673
what's the problem?

456
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,092
Didn't I already pay you back?

457
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,179
Yeah. You paid me back.

458
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,349
But I heard you cheated in Taipei.

459
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,726
Huh? I heard you made a ton!

460
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,898
Now, those people from Taipei
are looking for you. I was thinking…

461
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,484
We're friends, aren't we?

462
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,154
Here. We're very close.

463
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,032
If anyone's gonna pick on you, it's me.

464
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:33,329
So I took charge
of all the money that you owe.

465
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,004
So now you owe me.

466
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,632
When are you gonna pay?

467
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,730
Jen-yao, you're here.
I made dinner. Let's eat together.

468
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,067
No, thanks. I'm here for my luggage.
I'm going to Taipei.

469
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,528
I'll come see you in Taipei.

470
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,824
Anyone home? Police.

471
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,493
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

472
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,870
Here you are.

473
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,831
-My badge.
-Okay.

474
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,416
Li Jen-yao live here?

475
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,501
This is Li Jen-yao.

476
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,003
You're Li Jen-yao? Here's the thing.

477
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:28,884
There's been a report that Li Jen-yao was
involved with drug use and trafficking.

478
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,805
Are you sure? My son wouldn't do that.

479
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,224
It's okay. We're just here to take a look.

480
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,352
-Do you mind if we conduct a search?
-Oh, okay. Okay, sure.

481
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,236
You must be mistaken.

482
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,907
He wouldn't do anything like that.
You need to investigate further.

483
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,162
I know my son, and… and this
is impossible. He wouldn't do that.

484
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,039
What's this?

485
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,126
That's not mine.

486
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,337
No wonder I kept smelling
burning plastic, huh?

487
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,216
You were doing drugs in there,
as well as dealing. You piece of shit.

488
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,259
I did not.

489
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,510
Okay, let's go.

490
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,472
-We'll talk at the station.
-It wasn't me.

491
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,931
-Who then?
-Come on.

492
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,975
You picked up some bad habits in Taipei.

493
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,020
-Li Jen-yao, come with me.
-And now this. I'm gonna beat you!

494
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,899
Hey, stop! Stop!

495
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,990
-Stop!
-Stop! Come back!

496
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,494
Stop!

497
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,873
-Stop!
-Stop running!

498
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,548
Look over there.

499
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,598
Go.

500
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,539
Hey, Jen-yao. It's Ouyang Ti.

501
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,123
I hear you're laying low.

502
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,627
-You set me up.
-You're smarter than I thought.

503
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,797
Hey, selling drugs is a felony.

504
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,467
Even as a minor,
you can still go to prison,

505
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,761
but your dad didn't even hesitate.

506
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,972
Half a mil.

507
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,934
Your dad sold you out for just half a mil.

508
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,313
Jen-yao, why is your life worth so little?

509
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,816
It's sad, really.

510
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,026
I feel sorry for you.

511
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,989
Why did you do this?

512
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,826
I hate you.
Beating you up just wasn't enough.

513
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,202
So now,

514
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,456
I'm crushing your future.

515
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,126
Everything you care about

516
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,503
underneath my foot

517
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,630
while I watch you suffer.

518
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,716
So miserable.

519
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,884
Nobody believes you.

520
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,679
No one will help you.

521
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,348
This is so much better.

522
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,393
I wish I could see your face right now.

523
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,480
Hey, why don't I come and see you
right now? Hmm?

524
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,524
Jen-yao, you there?

525
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,067
Hello?

526
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,446
Hey, by the way,
don't try to go to the police.

527
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,700
Because I've got photo evidence
of you getting high,

528
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,119
and when you come out of hiding,

529
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,330
I'll just send them those pictures.

530
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,665
Here, smile.

531
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,796
Yes!

532
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,559
Your call will be sent to voicemail.

533
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,978
Charges may apply.
If you don't want to leave--

534
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,444
Your call will be sent to voicemail.
Charges--

535
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,242
Why isn't he answering?

536
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,478
My dad played me.

537
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,606
My mom believes him.

538
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,860
They say I'm dealing drugs,

539
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,612
but it's not true.

540
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,869
No one believes me anymore.

541
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,164
I have nowhere to run.
