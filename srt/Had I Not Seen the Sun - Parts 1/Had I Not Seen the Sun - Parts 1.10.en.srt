1
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:31,007
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

2
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,967
EMERGENCY ROOM

3
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,720
Be gentle.

4
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,473
-Excuse me. Earlier, there was a--
-Mrs. Chiang.

5
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,317
He's on the fourth floor. I'll take you.

6
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,709
You told me
to speak to Hsiao-tung's teacher.

7
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,254
And then you tried to run them over!

8
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,006
What is wrong with you?
Have you gone insane?

9
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,301
You want to kill them and end up in jail?

10
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,439
If you go to prison,

11
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,775
what'll happen to me?

12
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,403
What'll happen?

13
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,388
Hello. Are you Mrs. Chiang?

14
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,521
Mrs. Chiang's here.

15
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,113
Mrs. Chiang,

16
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,242
we need to discuss your husband's actions.

17
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,621
The other parents want to press charges.

18
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,207
But I'm a Buddhist.

19
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,045
I believe that revenge
only breeds revenge.

20
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:32,962
That's why…

21
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,508
I want to give you options.

22
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,053
This matter

23
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,723
could be a case of attempted murder.

24
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,018
Or it could be a random traffic accident.

25
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,148
Mrs. Chiang, it's up to you.

26
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,943
You're saying to drop the charges?

27
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,660
Mrs. Chiang,

28
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,828
both of us are mothers.

29
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,373
I understand how you feel right now.

30
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,043
Your daughter has suffered terribly.

31
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,213
It's only natural for you to seek justice.

32
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,173
But has it occurred to you,

33
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,592
if you press charges…

34
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,471
Our children are still minors.

35
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,139
It's a first offense.

36
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,977
If they go to jail, it won't be for long.

37
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,482
And with our connections,
they'll be given an early release.

38
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,112
Then I can send my son overseas
where he can start over,

39
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,321
but what about

40
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,365
your daughter?

41
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,411
Do you think that she can start over? Huh?

42
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,497
You think that you're above the law
because of your husband?!

43
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,457
Mrs. Chiang,

44
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:57,297
every court appearance will only elicit
the same pain you're feeling now.

45
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,719
Negotiating with the parents
at the school was hard enough, wasn't it?

46
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,388
Think about your daughter.

47
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,809
Is she ready to face such a cruel reality?

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
If this goes to court,

49
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,773
it's your daughter who suffers the most.

50
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,611
She already has to deal
with the judgment of others.

51
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:26,117
And in court, she'd be forced
to relive those events again and again.

52
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:30,955
How much could she endure
before she has a mental breakdown?

53
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,376
Not to mention her father could
go to prison for trying to avenge her.

54
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,338
Mrs. Chiang,

55
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,466
is it really worth the cost?

56
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,309
If she were my daughter,

57
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,813
I'd do all I could to prevent her
from having to go through all of that.

58
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,192
I'd rather seek compensation.

59
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:05,531
I'd try to give her the resources
she needs to start a new life.

60
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,659
To give her a chance at a better future.

61
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,375
If I were you…

62
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,923
I wouldn't accept what's being offered.

63
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,885
I'd want a much higher figure.

64
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,678
I'd ask for more.

65
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,276
Hey, handsome.

66
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,903
You're here.

67
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,492
Easy. Easy. I'll get it. Careful.

68
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,452
Go on, sit down.

69
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,706
Seeing you like this is very upsetting.

70
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,001
At first, I thought
I'd beat you so hard I'd crippled you.

71
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,547
Can't have that. You're too cute, right?

72
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,301
Listen, I've been there.

73
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,469
In your position.

74
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,973
No one dares
go against the Ouyang family here.

75
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,851
If I was a betting man,

76
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,771
I'd say her folks will settle.

77
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:20,982
No way.

78
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,359
They won't let him off.

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,571
Well, we'll see.

80
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,159
Now you listen.

81
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,287
You take care of yourself.

82
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,873
Boss has got the election coming up.

83
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,791
He doesn't have time for you.

84
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,003
After the election, who knows?

85
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,880
But if I were you,

86
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,715
I'd get out of here.

87
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,550
You hear what I'm saying?

88
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,099
Milkfish.

89
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,018
They were out of bass!

90
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,189
Come on. You need your strength, huh?

91
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,161
BY-ELECTION CANDIDATE
OUYANG HSIANG

92
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,671
BY-ELECTION CANDIDATE
OUYANG HSIANG

93
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,999
Your dad tried to run them over.

94
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,922
He was injured, but he'll live.

95
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,257
He's in hospital.

96
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,095
The boys were lucky to dodge the car.

97
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,305
They only have minor injuries.

98
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,893
But they're holding this
over your dad now.

99
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,772
So he might be charged

100
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,108
with attempted murder.

101
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,321
There's another option.

102
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,864
Settlement.

103
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,159
Nobody presses charges.

104
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,330
I think we should settle.

105
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,362
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG
FROM CHUNG-NAN MIDDLE SCHOOL

106
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,823
WINS FIRST PLACE
IN THE DISTRICT INDIVIDUAL BALLET FINALS

107
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,952
PARTY A WILL PAY PARTY B FIVE MILLION

108
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,871
Once you've signed,
I'll return it to them…

109
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,167
…and they'll give me
the car accident settlement.

110
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,175
What does it say?

111
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,594
They're gonna pay us off?

112
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,138
Why shouldn't they?

113
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,561
They owe you this.
You deserve compensation.

114
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,481
We have to take it.

115
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,609
This money can give you a new life.

116
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,778
You can't walk away with nothing.

117
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,299
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

118
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,066
PARTY A, NAME: OUYANG TI
PARTY B, NAME:

119
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,491
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

120
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,213
You asked her to sign this?

121
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,515
How could you?!

122
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,561
Are you not ashamed to take their money?

123
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,108
Our daughter was raped.

124
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,694
What kind of parents
wouldn't seek justice?

125
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,992
How can we seek justice?

126
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,371
We have no way of defeating them in court.

127
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,250
And what happens to Hsiao-tung if we lose?

128
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,963
Even if we win,
they'll be given a few years at most.

129
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,260
And their rich parents
will just scrub this from their records.

130
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,387
They get to start over.

131
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,601
What about Hsiao-tung?

132
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,605
This is going to follow her forever.

133
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,620
I've failed Hsiao-tung.

134
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,165
I've failed her.

135
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,255
I've failed her as a mother.

136
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,633
There's no way for me to give her justice.

137
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,802
Hsiao-tung?

138
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,557
Hsiao-tung, I'm home.
I brought you your favorite.

139
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,353
Hsiao-tung?

140
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,224
It's okay.

141
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,102
I'm okay.

142
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,190
As long as I can dance,

143
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,984
everything will be okay.

144
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,449
It's okay.

145
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,952
I'm okay.

146
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,121
As long as I can dance,

147
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,917
everything will be okay.

148
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,976
It's okay.

149
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,270
I'm okay.

150
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,941
As long as I can dance,

151
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,027
everything will be okay.

152
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,791
It's okay.

153
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,711
I'm okay.

154
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,799
As long as I can dance,

155
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,677
everything will be okay.

156
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,567
You dance so beautifully!

157
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,361
Look at me. Look at me!

158
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,822
Look at the camera! Look at the camera!

159
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,369
Oh! That didn't count.

160
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,121
-Right?
-Two more. Come on.

161
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,040
-That's enough.
-Let's go home.

162
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,958
-What's that?
-But I was…

163
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,586
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

164
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,797
Just one more. Che-li!

165
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,882
We'll play again tomorrow.

166
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm so tired.

167
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
Hey, don't ignore me.

168
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,640
Let's not play with him again.

169
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,058
-He really sucks.
-Yeah.

170
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,560
-We only lost because of him.
-Yeah, I know.

171
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,296
You've looked everywhere
you can think of. Where are you going now?

172
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,297
At least tell me.

173
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,634
I don't know yet.
She's been gone the whole night.

174
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,554
I can't just sit here.
Stay here. I'm taking another look.

175
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,598
Wait a minute. I'll go and look.
Let me go this time.

176
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,433
You can't go like that.

177
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,406
Hsiao-tung.

178
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,389
Why are you looking at me like that?

179
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,142
Like you think I'm going to jump.

180
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,646
I don't think that.

181
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,610
Are you sure?

182
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,989
What if I said…

183
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,327
that I want to?

184
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,829
What would you do?

185
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,715
If that's what you want,

186
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,343
I understand.

187
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,303
I will too.

188
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,030
I told you.

189
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,077
No matter what happens…

190
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,959
I'll be by your side.

191
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,713
Uh…

192
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,976
No need to explain.

193
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,687
I'm just glad you're home.

194
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,654
Come on.

195
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,372
What's wrong?

196
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,875
Can…

197
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,755
Can I give up?

198
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,302
Can I leave this place?

199
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,304
Can I stop worrying?

200
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,966
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

201
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,939
I WANT TO SEE YOU. CAN I?

202
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,507
Hey. Li Jen-yao.

203
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,023
Tomorrow…

204
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,861
we're moving to Taipei.

205
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,409
When you're in Taipei,

206
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,536
will you still speak to me?

207
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,918
Or… can I

208
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,087
call you sometimes?

209
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,059
I'm hoping,

210
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,270
when I get to Taipei,

211
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,774
I'll have a fresh start.

212
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,571
Have faith

213
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,784
that next time we see each other,

214
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,289
by then I'll be doing much better.

215
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,673
Why are you so quiet?

216
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,467
You don't believe me.

217
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,012
It's not that.

218
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,225
I'm just wondering…

219
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,020
when is the next time

220
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,399
that we'll see each other?

221
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,407
Didn't we say
that we'd celebrate Christmas?

222
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,660
How about

223
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,955
we meet back here at Christmas

224
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,165
five years from now?

225
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,792
Is that all right?

226
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,143
All right.

227
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,407
In Taichung, former legislator,
Chin Chung-nan

228
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,200
has resigned from his position

229
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,996
after causing an accident
while under the influence of alcohol.

230
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,249
This has prompted a by-election
to be held this weekend.

231
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:15,295
Ouyang Hsiang is leading in the polls
with 43% approval,

232
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,964
compared to Cheng Chang-chiu's 36%.

233
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,342
20% of voters remain undecided.

234
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,013
However, based on
Speaker Ouyang Hsiang's local reputation,

235
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,723
cultivated over many years,

236
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,226
the outcome of the election
appears to be already determined.

237
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,647
Though there is still time for the
situation to change before election day.

238
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,407
TO COUNCILLOR CHENG CHANG-CHIU

239
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,806
It's true, I mean it.

240
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:12,101
I'm telling you, ballerinas
can spread their legs real wide.

241
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,938
-How high can they go?
-There she is. You saw her, right?

242
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,607
-She's so hot.
-Wait till she comes on stage!

243
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,525
Yeah!

244
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,071
A career? I'm not sure yet.

245
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,698
I was five when I started ballet.

246
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,744
My whole life,
dancing has been a part of me.

247
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,414
I don't know who I am without dancing.

248
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,875
Hey, Li Jen-yao!

249
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,558
I think the one who came out last
was the cutest.

250
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,185
-The one on the left, so fine.
-I know, right?

251
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,478
I liked the one on the right.

252
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,106
Why didn't you tell me
they perform in underwear and stockings?

253
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,066
I had a hard-on the whole time.

254
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,443
Fuck, are you serious?

255
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,071
You idiot! Those are ballet clothes,
not stockings and underwear.

256
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,990
-It's like lingerie.
-Horn dog.

257
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,408
I can't get rid of it.

258
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,118
-You're still hard?
-Yeah.

259
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,078
-Let's see it!
-No way.

260
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,290
-What if the teacher sees it?
-He'll probably sterilize you!

261
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,710
Hey, Jen-yao! What are you doing here?

262
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,109
Oh, fuck!

263
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,361
Wh… What the hell?

264
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,572
-It wasn't me. Ah, fuck!
-Stay away from me.

265
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,783
Shit, you're such a bitch.

266
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,077
Come on.

267
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,379
Help me.

268
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,632
Please help.

269
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,206
Don't.

270
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,639
Don't.

271
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,272
Jen-yao?

272
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,940
I'm home.

273
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,068
I bought chicken and rice.

274
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,653
Come and eat.

275
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:17,013
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF
JEN-YAO

276
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,186
Breaking news
from the central region this afternoon

277
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,481
where a stabbing incident
has occurred on a local campus.

278
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,567
The victim is reportedly
the son of Ouyang Hsiang,

279
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,528
one of the candidates
in the Taichung by-election.

280
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,407
His opponent, Cheng Chang-chiu,
has called a press conference,

281
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,868
with sources speculating
he may have evidence

282
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,871
of corruption involving
Speaker Ouyang Hsiang.

283
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,915
We cross now to our reporter in--

284
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,633
JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER

285
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,696
Are you getting used to being here?

286
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,162
I've heard…

287
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,750
people have been giving you trouble.

288
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,157
Did you send

289
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,577
that letter to Cheng Chang-chiu?

290
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,706
You were trying to draw attention.

291
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,418
You want the media
to focus on the drug case.

292
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,212
That's why you stabbed my son

293
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,924
at the school with all those witnesses.

294
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,597
You were trying to drag him down
so he'd join you in jail.

295
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,266
I don't know what you mean.

296
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,979
I just know Ouyang Ti tried to frame me.

297
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,940
He got what was coming to him.

298
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,859
Thanks to you,

299
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,237
we lost the election.

300
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,240
We were meant to win.

301
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,410
Tell me,

302
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,537
why did you stab my son?

303
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:52,126
Was it really because he framed you
as a drug dealer?

304
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,794
That's not enough?

305
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,508
Listen to me.

306
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,177
When I get out,

307
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,929
I'll do it again.

308
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,433
Do you think because you're a minor

309
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,229
that your sentencing will be lenient

310
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,856
no matter what your crimes are?

311
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,151
You're wrong about that.

312
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,115
You may have hurt him once,

313
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,202
but I want you to know,

314
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,456
my son is not someone
who you can hurt again.

315
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,021
Hey, want a smoke?

316
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,482
Huh? Really? We're on duty.

317
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,860
Ah, relax. It's one cigarette.

318
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,113
We'll only be five minutes!

319
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,615
Nothing's gonna happen. Come on.

320
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,372
The lady wants to say hello.

321
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,499
Hello!

322
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,383
What? What?

323
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,018
Let's see.

324
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,438
It didn't leave a mark.

325
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,816
I told you I'm not strong enough.
You do it.

326
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,246
By the way, the lady's instructions

327
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,290
were that beating you up
would be too easy.

328
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,835
We have to find other ways
to amuse you, like this.

329
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,047
They'll extend your sentence
for causing trouble.

330
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,722
He's hitting us! He's hitting us!

331
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,766
-Someone help!
-Let go!

332
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,935
-Help! He's beating us up!
-Hey! What are you doing?

333
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,562
Squat down, all of you.

334
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,942
What's going on here? Squat down!

335
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,862
It hurts!

336
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,074
-Ow!
-Oh, it hurts so bad.

337
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,162
Save us.

338
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,663
Are you okay?

339
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,458
Oh, that looks painful.

340
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,308
Have faith.

341
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,937
The next time that we see each other,

342
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,274
by then, I'll be doing much better.

THEY ALL CAME IN HER?

347
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,788
FUCK! I WENT TO YI-X SCHOOL

348
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,833
JERKED OFF.
HOW MUCH IS BANGING HER?

349
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,126
HER FAMILY HAS A BBQ STALL

350
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,294
I EVEN KNOW HER MOM

351
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,089
SHE SEEMS UNWILLING, BUT I CAME ANYWAY

352
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,633
THIS GIRL WAS CLEARLY RAPED

353
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,385

356
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,212
I've cut ties with your dad.

357
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,174
After the divorce,
I never called him again.

358
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,511
You have to believe what I'm saying.

359
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,351
Let's go home.

360
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,689
I've made pork knuckle noodles for dinner.
It brings good luck!

361
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,779
Ma, you should head home.

362
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,865
I need to go somewhere.

363
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,705
Hey!

364
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,248
Hey!

365
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,926
When is the next time
that we'll see each other?

366
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,637
Didn't we say

367
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,056
that we'd celebrate Christmas?

368
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,518
How about

369
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,938
we meet back here at Christmas…

370
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,943
five years from now?

371
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,612
Is that all right?

372
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:19,034
8 MONTHS LATER

373
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,963
Hsiao Li, you finished eating?
We've got work to do.

374
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,486
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

375
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,765
I'm sorry.

376
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,894
I thought you were someone else.

377
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:11,980
Oh.

378
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,386
Do you want any help?

379
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,892
I feel like

380
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,770
you might need a hand.

381
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,440
I host a radio program.

382
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:59,486
The taxi dropped me here,
but I need to get into the station.

383
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:04,074
My show is about to start
and I'm not sure where the station is.

384
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,952
Just tell me the address.

385
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,703
I'll take you.

386
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,876
The GPS says it's here.

387
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,919
Okay.

388
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:20,465
Um, is there
an accessible entrance to the building?

389
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,928
-Mm.
-Could you please take me to it?

390
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,388
Okay.

391
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,525
Looks like we got here early.
You'll make it in time.

392
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,027
Thanks.

393
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,620
Sorry.

394
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:52,956
Can…

395
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,500
Can I ask what your name is?

396
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,339
You said you host a radio show.

397
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,633
I'd like to listen.

398
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,678
Oh.

399
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,264
I'm Hsia Tien-ching.

400
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,643
Three days each week,
I host a show on Rising Radio.

401
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,062
Give it a listen if you have time.

402
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,528
All right.

403
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,325
How about you?

404
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,079
What's your name?

405
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,635
I'm Li Jen-yao.

406
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:53,975
Oh.

407
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,522
Your show's about to start.

408
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,317
Ah, yeah, I should probably go.

409
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,154
Oh, l… let me get that.

410
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,243
What did the kid do wrong?
You could have spared him.

411
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,996
Maybe

412
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,916
I was always a monster.

413
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,214
IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW NEEDS SUPPORT,
THERE IS HELP.

414
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,632
