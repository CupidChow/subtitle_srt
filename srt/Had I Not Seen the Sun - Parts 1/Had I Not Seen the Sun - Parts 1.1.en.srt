1
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,433
Thanks. Here you go.

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,559
Thanks, sir.

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,353
Have you had dinner?

4
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,233
Just make sure to eat.

5
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,027
Don't be so picky.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,404
Mm.

7
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,781
BEEF NOODLE SOUP AND ASSORTED SIDE DISHES

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,242
Take a seat. There's a menu on the table.

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,120
I have a customer.

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,916
Sorry for the wait. Can I take your order?

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,755
A large beef noodle soup.

12
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:53,261
LIN'S EATERY

13
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,946
This noodle shop
has been here for 50 years.

14
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,073
Amid puddles from last night's rain,

15
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,493
police have cordoned off
the scene of a shocking crime.

16
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,912
The shop's owner
was found on the premises,

17
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,248
the victim of a gruesome murder.

18
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,669
Initial leads suggest the motive
may be linked to financial disputes.

19
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,588
The victim, Mr. Lin,
whose parents are deceased,

20
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,215
was raised by his grandmother.

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,011
Neighbors described Mr. Lin
as a polite and devoted grandson.

22
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,805
His grandmother must now face the…

23
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,142
Popular influencer Lisa,
real name Chang En-ya,

24
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,352
has been missing for over two weeks.

25
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,771
Police have been reviewing
surveillance footage

26
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,649
only to find
several cameras have been vandalized.

27
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,484
The victim, Ouyang Ti,

28
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,903
is the son
of former speaker Ouyang Hsiang.

29
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,573
The police have identified a suspect.

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,201
Seven years ago, the suspect
had an altercation with the victim,

31
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,537
during which Ouyang Ti was stabbed.

32
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,205
This is a developing story.

33
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,877
Authorities in central Taiwan
are investigating a horrific crime.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,880
The dismembered remains
of a 25-year-old man,

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,174
identified by the surname Chuang,

36
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,509
were discovered inside a plastic barrel.

37
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,263
Police are describing
the scene of the murder as a bloodbath.

38
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:04,475
Not only was the body of a businessman
named Wang smashed to pieces,

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,518
a young child…

40
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:10,273
After months of public unease, the police
have captured The Rainstorm Killer.

41
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,485
The suspect has been named as Li Jen-yao,
25 years old.

42
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,656
Li Jen-yao murdered his own father
before turning himself in to police

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,075
and confessing to multiple homicides.

44
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:51,666
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

45
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,905
No. Please don't hurt me.

46
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,771
I've gotta stop reading these before bed.

47
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,859
That's why I'm having nightmares.

48
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,831
Oh!

49
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,796
Can I call in sick over nightmares?

50
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,205
-Did you get your groceries?
-Yeah. Scallion's so expensive!

51
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,832
It's outrageous, isn't it but…

52
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,460
I think that's her. Let's go and ask.

53
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,212
-Hi there.
-Hi.

54
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,589
Did you just move in on the 18th floor?

55
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,133
-Mm.
-Yeah.

56
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,801
I just moved in last week.

57
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,845
Sorry I didn't introduce myself.

58
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430
Oh, that's okay.

59
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,224
Are you renting, or did you buy?

60
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,725
Uh, why?

61
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,519
Uh, since moving in,

62
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,149
have you heard the sound of high heels
clacking back and forth at night,

63
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,610
or has your doorbell been ringing nonstop?

64
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,446
No. Why?

65
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,822
Before you moved in,

66
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,575
you should have come
and spoken to the neighbors

67
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,034
to see if it was haunted.

68
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,786
Then you wouldn't have got duped.

69
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,413
-Huh?
-That's right.

70
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,665
-My apartment is haunted?
-Mm.

71
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,668
But it gets so much sunlight.

72
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,255
A beautiful young woman
used to live in that apartment,

73
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,966
but she was murdered in the mountains.

74
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,260
You're saying she was murdered?

75
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,219
Mm.

76
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,014
But not in the apartment.

77
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,183
It can't be haunted then.

78
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,935
Anywhere can be haunted
as long as there are ghosts.

79
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,730
Remember all the reporters
that were out on the street?

80
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,772
Yeah.

81
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,982
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

82
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,568
HAUNTED HOUSE SEARCH,
SEARCH FOR AN ADDRESS

83
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,157
What are these Xs for?

84
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,159
Where are the numbers?

85
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,076
Hmm.

86
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,787
Is my apartment haunted?

87
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,709
Jumpy, aren't you?

88
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,085
Were you moonlighting?

89
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,422
I was just… looking something up.

90
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,676
Mm. Come here. I need to talk to you.

91
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:37,183
Hsu Ta-wei's isolating another three days,
so how's that story developing?

92
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,644
If there's no progress yet,

93
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,647
I want you to help me
with some preproduction work.

94
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,941
I've got some commercial jobs that I need…

95
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,193
What's that look?

96
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,736
Tell me.

97
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,745
It's just Ta-wei asked me
to follow up on his cases.

98
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,539
He specifically said

99
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,165
you can't steal me.

100
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,836
We both hired you.

101
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,630
So you just work for him now?

102
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,012
Has Li Jen-yao agreed to meet you?
Didn't he refuse before?

103
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,057
Mm. Ta-wei wouldn't accept it.

104
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,227
So he asked me to write to Jen-yao.

105
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,439
He told me, "Try to use phrases
that make you sound feminine."

106
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,109
Well, here's hoping that works.

107
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,487
The thing is, the prison said
that he's agreed to meet me.

108
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,114
What?

109
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,074
Hmm.

110
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,996
-Hello?
-Listen, come out in 15 minutes.

111
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,290
Bring the gear too. I'm coming for you.

112
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,042
Wha… It's only been two days.

113
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,794
Can you leave quarantine?

114
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,421
What was the test result?

115
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,798
What are you worried about?

116
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,009
It's just a cold, that's all.

117
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,178
Be ready in 15.

118
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,431
Ta-wei, what do you think you're doing?

119
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,768
I know the rules are strict,
but you have to follow procedure.

120
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,686
You can't just--

121
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,897
If you don't tell
and I don't tell, who's gonna know, right?

122
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,067
Hsu Ta-wei, are you tired of this life?

123
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,194
Do you have a death wish?

124
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,157
Okay, I'll grant you your wish.
I'll be your assistant today.

125
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,243
I'll be out front and you better be there.

126
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,166
Anyway…

127
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,754
Chou-yu, uh, did you hear what I said?

128
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,173
You go in alone this time.

129
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,468
Explain the process to them clearly, okay?

130
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,137
You can do this. I believe in you.
Go for it.

131
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,667
-Miss?
-Huh?

132
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,502
Something wrong?

133
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,713
Nothing.

134
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,104
1027, you got a visitor.

135
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,564
1027
LI JEN-YAO

136
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,487
Hello. I'm from We Film Productions.

137
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,825
Our director is Hsu Ta-wei and…

138
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,716
Hello.

139
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,721
Um, I'm here from We Film Productions.

140
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,892
Um, Hsu Ta-wei is the director.

141
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,185
I'm the PA.

142
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,187
My name's Chou Pin-yu.

143
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,855
But Chou-yu is fine.

144
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,441
"Yu" like in "yuzu."

145
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,988
Actually, it's more like
the "Yu" in "Zhou Yu."

146
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,200
Today, I…

147
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,578
I was hoping we could discuss--

148
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,582
Don't be nervous. I don't bite.

149
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,334
You can relax.

150
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,631
Sorry.

151
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,344
I don't usually get nervous.

152
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,265
For some reason,
it feels strange meeting you.

153
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,142
You seem oddly familiar.

154
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,104
But we've never met before.

155
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,107
Uh, what am I doing?

156
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,025
The point is,

157
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,277
when I wrote to you,

158
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,781
I told you our company
wants to make a documentary on you.

159
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,119
About the crimes that you committed.

160
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,371
Why choose me?

161
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,833
Uh…

162
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,629
You'll have to ask
our director, Hsu Ta-wei.

163
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,507
I don't know the reason.

164
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:49,471
But probably because
there's a lot about your case

165
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,516
the audience would be curious about.

166
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,936
Anyway, we hope you'll agree to the shoot.

167
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,278
Is it important to you, this job?

168
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,743
Mm.

169
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,789
All right.

170
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,542
Count me in.

171
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,712
You're in?

172
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,632
-Mm-hmm.
-You'll really do it?

173
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,387
But if I don't like the questions,

174
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,931
I won't answer.

175
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,767
All right. We can respect that.

176
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,773
I'll take you through what happens next.

177
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,899
Mm.

178
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,527
Essentially, there are three stages.

179
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,698
Preproduction, production,
post-production.

180
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,285
But you are only involved
for the production period.

181
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,371
That's when filming takes place.

182
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,331
You'll do your own introduction,

183
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,209
then we'll ask you a number of questions.

184
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,879
When the time comes, we'll go over the…

185
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,390
We're almost out of time.

186
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,642
That's all for today.

187
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,019
Thank you.

188
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,109
Next time…

189
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,613
will you be coming?

190
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,284
Next time, I'll be here.

191
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,375
Li Jen-yao!

192
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,886
Why did you accept this interview?

193
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,514
You said no to everyone else.

194
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,392
It cut off.

195
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,436
Did you hear me?

196
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,808
Maybe it's because it's my first time
seeing a death row inmate…

197
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,771
but I have this feeling

198
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,315
I don't know how to describe.

199
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,776
A death row inmate? Who's that?

200
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,236
Have you heard of Li Jen-yao?

201
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,531
He's a serial killer.
He killed his own dad.

202
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,617
Do you remember that?

203
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,954
Yeah, of course.

204
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,000
Those murders were all over the news.
I remember.

205
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,965
Even inside a prison,
he's still dangerous.

206
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,676
You should probably stay away from him.

207
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,807
Before I actually met him,
I thought he would be terrifying.

208
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,477
But,

209
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,688
after meeting him today,

210
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,608
he really doesn't seem

211
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,569
as bad as the media says.

212
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,953
Seeing him up close,

213
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,039
he doesn't look like a murderer.

214
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:48,919
Hey.

215
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,923
-Do you think he's hot?
-Of course not!

216
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
Then why are you defending him?

217
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,220
-Don't pull that crap.
-All right.

218
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,807
You done moving?

219
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,851
Need help with anything?

220
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,815
I said I'd help you find a place,
but you did it alone.

221
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,526
And look what you got.
A haunted apartment.

222
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,029
Don't be like that.

223
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,825
I've told you many times.
I can take care of myself.

224
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,161
You're not my mother.

225
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,537
Hmm.

226
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,456
Even your mom's not this bossy.

227
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,460
Anyway, the apartment was just bad luck.

228
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,588
-Bad luck?
-Mm.

229
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,381
You jumped at the price.

230
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,425
Rent for under 10K?

231
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,760
Didn't you think that was weird?

232
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,889
I didn't think about it that much.

233
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,768
From what the neighbors said,

234
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,855
she didn't die there, so it isn't haunted.

235
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,648
What are you afraid of?

236
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,903
-What if she's homesick?
-Huh?

237
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,655
What if she wants to come back?

238
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,325
What if she suddenly appears?

239
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,747
I saved some fruit for you!
Take it to school. Don't forget it.

240
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,957
-Here, take it--
-Uh, no, thank you. Uh…

241
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,834
Sorry. Sorry.

242
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,795
Is that your fruit stall?

243
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,134
Uh, that's right. We set up here recently.

244
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,511
Come see us if you want some fruit.

245
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,765
Here, it's very sweet. I picked it myself.

246
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,100
-Go on, take it.
-All right, all right, that's enough.

247
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,854
Sorry. My wife just seems to like you.

248
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,690
She's harmless. Apologies.

249
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,567
All right, let's go.

250
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,110
Hey, don't be late for school.

251
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,702
-Come on.
-Hey.

252
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,372
Shen, do you remember them?

253
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,667
I've seen them before.
Their stall was outside your apartment.

254
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,252
It's like…

255
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,964
It's like they found out where I live.

256
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,803
And that lady seems to think
I'm someone else.

257
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,221
It's weird.

258
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,349
Hey. You're so paranoid.

259
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,686
Taipei fruit sellers
always move their stalls around.

260
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,854
It's just a coincidence.

261
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,065
-Mm.
-Come on.

262
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,462
Hey, how did you find this apartment?

263
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,840
I told you already.

264
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,092
I found this place online.

265
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,096
Ms. Chou, a delivery came for you earlier.

266
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,723
I didn't order anything.

267
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,359
Who is it from?

268
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,528
Chi-chi sent it.

269
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,156
It's a housewarming gift.

270
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,673
Don't freak me out.

271
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,425
What did you see?

272
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,887
There really is a ghost.

273
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,307
A ghost would never live in this mess.

274
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,852
Hey, how long have you been here?

275
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,146
Why haven't you unpacked?

276
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,358
And why are these socks here?

277
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,988
Hey, is that pile of clothes
clean or dirty?

278
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,323
And where do you sleep?

279
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,118
Uh, wherever.

280
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,829
Seriously,

281
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,833
you shouldn't be living alone.
You should move back in with me.

282
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,005
I don't want to talk about it.
Come on, sit down.

283
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,467
Here. I'll give Chi-chi a call.

284
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,643
Hi, Chi-chi!

285
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,269
I received your gift!

286
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,604
Thank you.

287
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,855
Hey there.

288
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,275
You haven't invited me over.
How have you been?

289
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,318
I'm fine.

290
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,237
Things have been good.

291
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,864
Yeah, right. I can tell something's off.

292
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,450
Hey. I'm your best friend.

293
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,077
Don't keep secrets from me.

294
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,162
We're supposed
to tell each other everything.

295
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,623
Are you gonna tell me or not?

296
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,668
Are you gonna tell me,
or do I need to come over?

297
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,962
It's nothing. Don't worry.

298
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,588
We'll talk more later.

299
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,048
Fine.

300
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,008
All right, see you. Bye-bye.

301
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,514
Hey, stop tidying!

302
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,015
I'll do it. Stop it.

303
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,269
You're acting like
I brought you here to clean up.

304
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,438
I feel guilty.

305
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,356
It's no big deal.

306
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,734
I mean, I washed your clothes
when we lived together.

307
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,070
All right, just sit down. Just sit down.

308
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,575
Huh?

309
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,549
How did my phone get in my bag?

310
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,012
Ta-wei.

311
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,722
Oh.

312
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,016
Okay, hold on.

313
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,184
So…

314
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,313
Next week, we film Li Jen-yao.

315
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,274
All right. I'll get everything ready
and call you back.

316
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,067
Okay. Bye-bye.

317
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,218
FIRST MEETING WITH LI JEN-YAO

318
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,789
Is that rain?

319
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,739
Hsiao-tung, are you there?

320
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,783
Can you hear me?

321
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,869
Can you hear my voice?

322
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,207
Hsiao-tung, you need to wake up.

323
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,254
What's wrong?

324
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,716
Did something wake you up?

325
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,135
I'm fine. It's nothing.

326
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,769
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

327
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,064
What the hell was that dream?

328
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,498
Pin-yu?

329
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,583
Are you okay?

330
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,796
Uh, I'm all right!

331
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,423
I'm just on the toilet!

332
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,154
-Shen Mu!
-What is it?

333
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,411
In the mirror just now, I saw a girl.

334
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,080
You're tired. It was just your reflection.

335
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,082
No, it was definitely someone else.

336
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,959
Take a look. I'm scared.

337
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,374
-Ma'am, please just calm down.
-What is it you want?

338
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,961
I'm not breaking my lease.

339
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,922
I just want some answers.

340
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,840
What happened in the apartment?

341
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,343
Why is the rent so cheap?

342
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,761
Listen to me.

343
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,764
If you're gonna
go around attracting ghosts,

344
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,641
don't blame it on my apartment.

345
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,644
If you want to move out, fine, move out.

346
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,897
But don't think for a second
that you're getting your deposit back.

347
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,359
Hey!

348
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,947
-Come on!
-Sorry.

349
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,494
We got a big day of filming
and you're jabbering away?

350
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,540
Okay. If you're ready, we'll begin.

351
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,960
Uh, I've done some background research.

352
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,671
I've seen some pictures of you
from high school.

353
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,215
Hey, you were such a good-looking kid.

354
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,551
The girls must have loved you.

355
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:49,472
So, do you wanna tell us
what life in high school was like?

356
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,686
Were there any big memories or incidents
you think you could share?

357
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,024
Uh…

358
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,734
What about friends?

359
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,903
We all made friends back then.

360
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,322
Friends who were important to us.

361
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,908
Uh, did you have
any close friends you could…

362
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,913
No.

363
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,039
No friends.

364
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,374
Really?

365
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,585
Not Ouyang Ti?

366
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,048
Wasn't he your friend?

367
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,933
Now let me see.

368
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,145
Ouyang Ti.

369
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,856
Chen Che-li.

370
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,859
Chuang Jung-tai.

371
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,944
Wang Yu-hsiang.

372
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,654
Fan Wei-ting.

373
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,033
Lin Meng-hung.

374
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,289
Ah! Wasn't there another person?

375
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,750
The pretty girl!

376
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,668
Here.

377
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,795
Chang En-ya.

378
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,176
These here,

379
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,303
they're the ones you murdered?

380
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,556
And you all happened to go
to the same high school.

381
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,228
So when you say nothing happened,
you see, no one's buying that, you know.

382
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,357
You could take this moment to explain

383
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,943
what really occurred

384
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,779
between you and these kids.

385
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,727
-Uh, Chou-yu?
-Hmm?

386
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,396
You ask the next questions.

387
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,439
Me?

388
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,400
Looks as if I've been talking to myself!

389
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,068
Okay, come on.

390
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,696
Go on then. You ask away.

391
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,156
Go ahead when you're ready, okay?

392
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,119
I'll pick up where we left off.

393
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,788
Um,

394
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,375
what happened in 2007?

395
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,630
From what we know,
in 2007, you stabbed Ouyang Ti.

396
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,011
Can you tell us about

397
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,763
the nature of your conflict?

398
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,045
What we want to know
is what led to these crimes.

399
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,129
Not to litigate,

400
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,591
but so the victims' families
can understand

401
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,802
the reason that
they lost their loved ones.

402
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,062
The rain.

403
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,654
Because I hate the rain.

404
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,081
Ta-wei, are you all right?

405
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,084
This is your car.

406
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,546
He hates the rain!
What kind of bullshit is that, huh?

407
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,632
He hates the rain?

408
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,509
That's not an excuse for murder.

409
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,221
You know what?

410
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,765
I really wish that was a joke.

411
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,809
So then we could just think
he was a bad liar.

412
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,771
But that look he had on his face.

413
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,689
He was deadly serious.

414
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,487
Ta-wei, why did you
want to make this documentary?

415
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,746
Why do you think?

416
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,374
Why do I think?

417
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,167
Um…

418
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,378
Because…

419
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:37,343
Because this case
got a lot of media coverage,

420
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,888
so if you can discover his motive,

421
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,558
which he never revealed to the media,

422
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,311
then this documentary
will make you famous.

423
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,277
That's for sure.

424
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,195
You're so right.

425
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:00,992
That makes more sense
than his excuse about the fucking rain.

426
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,035
You're right.

427
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,662
So Hsu Ta-wei,

428
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,914
he's shooting a serial killer

429
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,376
because he wants to be fucking famous.

430
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,469
Damn it.

431
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,014
Speaking of rain, it's pouring down.

432
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,974
What a pain in the ass.

433
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,619
USELESS, TRASH, IMBECILE, CURSED

434
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,785
-Hey, you're back.
-Hey.

435
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,161
The rain's so heavy.

436
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,621
It's fine.

437
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,249
-Get changed and come and eat.
-Okay.

438
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,549
Hey. I thought you were gonna get changed.

439
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,010
Ah, on my way back.

440
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,053
I bought some cake for Wen-ling.

441
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,723
Oh. Okay. Hurry up.

442
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,830
-Oh, Ta-wei!
-What?

443
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,208
It's late. We should
get back to the office.

444
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,418
Why are we here?

445
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,962
You gotta make the most of God's gifts.

446
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,213
What do you mean?

447
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,802
Didn't our hero say
he kills people because he hates the rain?

448
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,637
The Lord gave us rain.

449
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,640
We can get some scenic footage, okay?

450
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,977
And then, we can use it
as reaction shots in the documentary.

451
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,356
It'll be great.
We'll never have money for a rain machine.

452
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,067
We capture it now, or we never will.

453
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,649
Let's promise
we'll come back here together.

454
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,653
All right. We'll come back.
The three of us will come here together.

455
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,279
We'll get here earlier.

456
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,626
Smile. Smile.

457
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:27,133
Smile. Smile. Smile.

458
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,816
Chou Pin-yu.

459
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,610
I'm getting wet here.

460
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,535
There's a girl over there.

461
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,459
A girl? Where?

462
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,874
Get away! Get away!

463
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,169
Why have you come here?
It wasn't my fault!

464
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,754
Leave me alone!

465
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,464
It wasn't my fault.

466
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,758
I'm sorry.

467
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,678
Get away!

468
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,597
Get away!

469
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,725
Get away!

470
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,686
Get away! Get away!

471
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,398
I'm sorry!

472
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,242
Before the eggs had even hit the shelves,

473
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,246
lines of over 20 people
were forming outside PX Mart.

474
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,791
Demand for the imported eggs
has been overwhelming.

475
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,919
Hsiao-tung?

476
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,213
Hsiao-tung?

477
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,798
We're back.

478
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,429
Hsiao-tung, have you eaten yet?

479
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,307
If not, I'll cook something.

480
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,006
Chou Pin-yu.

481
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,050
I'm getting wet here.

482
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,470
There's a girl over there.

483
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,387
A girl?

484
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,264
Where?

485
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,034
Hey, Shen.

486
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,452
Listen.

487
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,873
Tonight, I saw that same girl again.

488
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,589
Are you looking for me?
