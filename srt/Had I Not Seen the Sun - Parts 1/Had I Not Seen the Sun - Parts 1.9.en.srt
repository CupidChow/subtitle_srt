1
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,034
Whatever happens in the future,

2
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,244
I'll always be with you.

3
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,085
I won't let go of your hand
so easily again.

4
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,756
You said it.

5
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,844
After all these annoying things are over,

6
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,224
let's forget all the unhappy stuff…

7
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,103
and start over.

8
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,887
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG, YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL

9
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:10,333
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

10
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,926
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

11
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,101
Hsiao-tung, we're home.

12
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,231
Hsiao-tung?

13
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,943
Hsiao-tung, are you asleep?

14
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
You went to bed so early today.

15
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,285
Hey, where are you going? Give me a hand.

16
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,914
Just put the stuff down somewhere.

17
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,125
I'm going to call Hsiao-tung.

18
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,837
What's wrong?

19
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,423
She's not home
and not answering her phone.

20
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,674
Your call will be…

21
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,552
Hello? Chen?

22
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,762
Is Hsiao-tung at your place?

23
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,765
Okay, thank you.

24
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,435
Hey, it's late. Where are you going?

25
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,396
I'm going to ride around
to see if she's on her way home.

26
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
I'm home.

27
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,705
You should go.

28
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,333
Stop following me.

29
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,127
What happens to me now

30
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,880
is not your concern.

31
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,841
Please go, okay?

32
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,266
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

33
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,939
What's up with you?
Why aren't you home yet?

34
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,484
Why are you here with this boy
so late at night? What for?

35
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,113
Why are you injured?

36
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,407
What happened?

37
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,660
Tell me.

38
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,829
What is going on?

39
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,961
It's all my fault.

40
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,965
Explain it to me!
What do you mean it's all your fault?

41
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,466
What does that have to do with you?

42
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,637
I told you, it's not your concern!
Didn't you understand?

43
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,183
It's my business. Stay out of it.

44
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,312
Leave.

45
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,898
Leave right now.

46
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,497
Hey, Hsiao-tung, where were you?

47
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,208
Why are you all drenched?

48
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,086
How did you get injured?

49
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,797
It's so late. Where were you?

50
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,424
I'm exhausted now.

51
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,344
Can you not ask any questions
and let me shower first?

52
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,596
Wait a minute.

53
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,307
Explain clearly.
What exactly happened to you?

54
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,394
Speak up. Chiang Hsiao-tung, tell me!

55
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,812
What exactly is going on?

56
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,317
I accidentally hurt myself a little.

57
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,486
Don't lie to me!

58
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,656
Look at you. How can you possibly be okay?

59
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,451
Be honest with me.

60
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,496
Did the boy out there do something to you?

61
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,413
No.

62
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,749
It has nothing to do with him.

63
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,834
Can you go outside and see

64
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,253
if the boy who came back with her
is still there?

65
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,756
Hsiao-tung.

66
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,757
What boy?

67
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,384
-Who is that boy?
-Gosh, I don't know!

68
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,263
Just go outside and see if there is
an injured boy who is covered in blood.

69
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,223
Bring him inside.

70
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,141
I'll force him to talk instead.

71
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,353
Please don't go.

72
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,812
It wasn't him.

73
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,107
What happened to me today
has nothing to do with him.

74
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,076
So…

75
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,414
did someone really do
something bad to you?

76
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,297
Hsiao-tung.

77
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,175
Tell me who bullied you.

78
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,678
Who was it?

79
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,808
Hurry up and tell me who it was!

80
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,060
What's his name? Tell me!

81
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,978
Who was it?

82
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,694
Hey, hold her tight!

83
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,612
Let me go!

84
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,826
Let me go!

85
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,035
Stop moving around.

86
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,288
-Let me go! No!
-Come on, Hsiao-tung, smile.

87
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,123
Smile.

88
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,124
Smile.

89
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,542
Let me go!

90
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,965
Chuang Jung-tai.

91
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,012
Fuck.

92
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,139
Fan Wei-ting.

93
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,521
Lin Meng-hung.

94
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,737
Wang Yu-hsiang.

95
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,494
Chen Che-li.

96
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
Ouyang Ti.

97
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,883

BILLING AND REGISTRATION

100
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,832
We may ask for some info in a bit.
Is this to be examined as well?

101
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,916
Yes.

102
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,668
Okay, we'll bring it in later.

103
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,794
This way, please.

EVIDENCE! FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

107
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,931
Miss, please step onto the white paper.

108
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,268
Hsiao-tung.

109
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,564
The doctor is speaking to you.

110
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,528
Take off your shoes
and step onto the white paper, all right?

111
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,545
Before we begin examining your injuries,
we need to reconfirm your identity.

112
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,260
What is your name, age, and date of birth?

113
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,973
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

114
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,684
Seventeen years old.

115
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,188
My date of birth is July 23rd.

116
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,731
We'll begin the examination.

117
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,191
First, I'd like to ask,

118
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,401
is everything you're wearing right now

119
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,446
what you wore when the incident happened?

120
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,996
Let me go!

121
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,207
Yes.

122
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,251
Then please take off all your clothes.

123
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,173
Come on, look at the camera.

124
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,424
Look at the camera.

125
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,677
Do I

126
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,054
have to take them off here?

127
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,390
I understand how you feel,

128
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,018
but this is required as part of the exam
and evidence collection process.

129
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,895
Please bear with me.

130
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,920
Come on, Hsiao-tung, smile.

131
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,423
Stop moving around.

132
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,066
Smile.

133
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,199
Over here.

134
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,467
Closer!

135
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,718
Record her face!

136
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,575
Trust me.

137
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,914
I will get justice for you.

138
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,251
Yes. Trust me.

139
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,673
I will make those who bullied you
pay the price.

140
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,050
Trust me.

141
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,095
Trust me.

142
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,952
FIRST FLOOR

143
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,770
Mr. Chiang, calm down.

144
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,147
Don't touch me!

145
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,114
How do you know my last name?

146
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,909
You know my daughter?

147
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,915
Are you the boy
who brought my daughter home?

148
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,458
What's your name?

149
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,419
What's your relationship with my daughter?

150
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,506
How could you bring her home
but let this happen to her? Speak!

151
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,720
I'm sorry.

152
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
This happened to Hsiao-tung

153
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,392
because of me.

154
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,186
I'm sorry.

155
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,147
If I had arrived earlier,

156
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,440
I could've saved her.

157
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,485
Don't say that kind of
useless stuff to me now!

158
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,111
Let me ask you.

159
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,198
Do you know them?

160
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,368
Yes.

161
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,956
So what's the connection
between you, Hsiao-tung, and them?

162
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,292
We go to the same school.

163
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,545
We are classmates.

164
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,775
Mr. Chiang.

165
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,319
I'm sorry.

166
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,697
I failed to protect Hsiao-tung.

167
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,783
What's the point of apologizing to me now?

168
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,077
What's the point of apologizing to me?

169
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,507
Get lost.

170
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,220
Don't ever come near us again.

171
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,815
Jen-yao!

172
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,234
Jen-yao!

173
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,944
Don't go.

174
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,947
Let's go home
and start over, yeah? Jen-yao.

175
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,242
Can you stop making
promises you can't keep?

176
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,329
Please let me go, okay?

177
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,246
I beg you.

178
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,664
Let me go, okay?

179
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,833
Jen-yao! No!

180
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,710
Jen-yao, don't.

181
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,087
I told the police

182
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,049
that your dad planted those drugs
to frame you.

183
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,342
They're looking into it.

184
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,135
Believe me. I'm telling the truth!

185
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,596
I've thought it through.

186
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,890
I will leave him. I'll divorce him.

187
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,351
From now on, he's no longer our concern.

188
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,229
We can have
a fresh start for real this time.

189
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,147
Yeah?

190
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,611
Jen-yao.

191
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,453
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

192
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,835
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

193
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,462
Jen-yao.

194
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:47,843
Sir,

195
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,428
how can I help you?

196
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,430
Excuse me.

197
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,390
I want to ask…

198
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,519
My daughter

199
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,563
was sexually assaulted.

200
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,856
I want to report it.

201
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,152
Could you tell me when this happened?

202
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,070
Do you know who hurt your daughter?

203
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,282
It happened a few hours ago.

204
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,617
We know who the perpetrators are.

205
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,454
They're my daughter's classmates.

206
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:21,168
Well, here is the name of the school
and the names of the students.

207
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,505
Sir, are you sure
all of them are perpetrators?

208
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,756
Very sure.

209
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,094
We came here right after the medical exam
to file a report.

210
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,888
Okay, give me a moment.

211
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,599
Due to regulations, this must go
to the Women and Children's Unit.

212
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,808
I'll be right back.

213
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,231
YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL, YEAR 2, CLASS 2

214
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,733
CHUANG JUNG-TAI,
FAN WEI-TING, LIN MENG-HUNG,

215
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,026
CHEN CHE-LI, WANG YU-HSIANG, OUYANG TI

216
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,530
Buddy, let me handle this case.

217
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,713
The officer said he wanted
to speak to us privately about something.

218
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,131
To be honest,

219
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,009
I have a daughter, too, just like you two.

220
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,180
So I feel obligated to tell you this.
If we proceed with filing a report,

221
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,892
it might cause your daughter
more harm than we can imagine.

222
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,436
For example, sir, you just said

223
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,355
you took her for a medical exam.

224
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,106
Then you must be aware

225
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,983
that the whole process

226
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,902
is very cruel.

227
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,613
If you were to sue,
she'd have to deal with it.

228
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,454
Honestly, I have handled
many cases like this.

229
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,959
I know very well
that it causes a lot of harm to a girl.

230
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,627
If it's not handled well,

231
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,046
that psychological trauma
will stay with her forever.

232
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,716
So I'd advise approaching this carefully.

233
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,010
Then,

234
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,805
sir, do you have a better suggestion?

235
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,265
I'd suggest…

236
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,849
I'm just suggesting

237
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,895
that maybe
you could go talk to the school first?

238
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,814
So

239
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,149
are you telling us not to sue them?

240
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,693
No, sue them! Why wouldn't you?

241
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,696
This is serious.
Of course you should sue those bastards.

242
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,531
But right now, the most important thing

243
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,783
is your daughter's physical
and mental state, isn't it?

244
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,578
This should be
the top priority now, right?

245
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,871
Think about it.

246
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,206
Once we take statements,

247
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,835
not only will the police and prosecutors
know about this incident,

248
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,212
but so will reporters.

249
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,423
You'd have to tell the story
more than once.

250
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,800
Once, twice, over and over again.

251
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,554
Even if we adults could bear it,
could a young girl?

252
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,774
Have you chosen
the outfit for tomorrow's campaigning?

253
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,319
I've picked a few here for you to see.

254
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,196
Is this your first election?

255
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,657
We'll be canvassing
at the market in the evening.

256
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,075
If you put me in those,

257
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,786
what will the folks there think of me?

258
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:08,168
There's a white suit
and a knit shirt in that closet.

259
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,544
I'll wear those.

260
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,430
But if you wear white to the market,
won't it get dirty easily?

261
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,349
Besides,

262
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,933
it'll be obvious if you sweat.

263
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,688
Dirt and sweat are exactly
what I'm looking for.

264
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,066
That way, everyone will see

265
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,401
how hard I'm working for my husband.

266
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,403
I'll look down-to-earth too.

267
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,992
Dirty folks will only feel close
to those who also get dirty.

268
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,953
It'll be pointless if I look clean.

269
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,215
Fang, what is it?

270
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,593
I've suppressed the report.
I told them to go to the school.

271
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,969
I thought

272
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,263
you could handle that part.

273
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,059
But if they decide to sue later

274
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,729
and go to the press,
I may not be able to keep it under wraps.

275
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,066
Well done.

276
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,943
Leave the rest to me.

277
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,534
Hsiao-tung.

278
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,166
Hsiao-tung, I cooked something.

279
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,585
Why don't you get up and eat a little?

280
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,588
You haven't eaten all day.

281
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,633
Eat a bit and then go back to sleep, okay?

282
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,521
Come on, get up.

283
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,231
Get up, quickly.

284
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,858
Eat something.

285
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,652
Do you want
to starve yourself to death? Get up.

286
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,030
Get up.

287
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,956
Hello?

288
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,751
Sorry.

289
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,461
We're not working today.

290
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,715
No, it's just…

291
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,804
Something happened at home.

292
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,223
So we may not do business

293
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,393
for a while. I'm sorry.

294
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,387
If you wanna frame someone,

295
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,725
you'd better get them
to willingly take the blame for you.

296
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,394
The same goes for
playing around with women.

297
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,607
They've told the hospital and the police
and are ready to sue you.

298
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,067
What's your plan?

299
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,909
If I hadn't had a guy in the police
to intercept the report quickly enough…

300
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,579
this time,

301
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,208
I might as well
have dropped out of the race

302
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,127
because of you, my loser son.

303
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,599
You fucking suck at hurting people.

304
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:56,104
But you're pretty good
at hurting your boss.

305
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,276
Boss.

306
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,652
Boss.

307
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,260
Get this straight.

308
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,765
I don't have to clean up
all your fucking messes.

309
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,851
I, Ouyang Hsiang,

310
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,312
have other sons besides you!

311
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,814
That's enough.

312
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,151
He just made bad friends
and was led astray.

313
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,194
You can't blame it all on him.

314
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,697
Besides, now is a critical time.

315
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,741
Don't turn this into something.

316
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,829
I know.

317
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,713
This one…

318
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,425
is on you to fix.

319
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,640
It's okay now.

320
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,906
Hsiao-tung.

321
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,201
Hsiao-tung.

322
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,747
Dad and I gotta go take care of something.
We'll be back in the afternoon.

323
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,001
I asked your aunt to come over.
If you want something to eat, tell her.

324
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,002
Okay?

325
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,385
Okay, I'm off.

326
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,318
Since you've never celebrated Christmas,

327
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,861
how about

328
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,738
we celebrate it together this year?

329
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,784
That's all I know.

330
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,161
I've told you everything.

331
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,913
Can I go now?

332
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,792
This is a serious matter.

333
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,669
You were there that day too.

334
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,005
Are you sure
you described exactly what you saw?

335
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,883
Save me!

336
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,886
Hurry, call the police! Save me!

337
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,516
Yes, I'm sure.

338
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:49,063
That day, I heard Hsiao-tung herself say
she wanted to stick around longer.

339
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,525
And she seemed to be enjoying herself.

340
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,284
Go and get some rest.

341
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,996
Next, Chang En-ya.

342
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,420
Don't be scared.

343
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,173
From now on, we're friends.

344
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,842
Some secrets between friends

345
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,886
are meant to be kept.

346
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,071
Idiot.

347
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,698
Damn.

348
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,283
Fuck, you scared her off.

349
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,546
It was Hsiao-tung
who asked us to hang out.

350
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,841
I have proof here.

351
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,927
She sent us a text.

352
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,513
It says,

353
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,307
"Let's meet at the entrance
after school today."

354
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,350
"Don't forget."

355
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,397
Just because she asked,

356
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,774
you think you can treat her that way?

357
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,109
Are you guys beasts?

358
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,120
After you all went out,

359
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,621
what happened?

360
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,874
Why did Chiang Hsiao-tung say
that you raped her?

361
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,633
Everything was normal at first.

362
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,177
We were all just singing karaoke.

363
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,804
Hsiao-tung suddenly said

364
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,974
that she heard we usually play hard

365
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,935
and wanted to see
how intense we could get.

366
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,230
Truth is, we're not who she thinks we are.

367
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,898
But

368
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,609
I didn't want to look lame
in front of her,

369
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,821
so I brought her
to hang out with Wei-ting and the others.

370
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,866
I also asked Meng-hung to bring some beer.

371
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,034
A few drinks in,

372
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,494
Hsiao-tung got drunk.

373
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,456
Then…

374
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,007
It's okay, Ouyang Ti.

375
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,467
Tell the truth.

376
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,384
Yeah.

377
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,723
Then Hsiao-tung said she felt hot.

378
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,643
She started taking off her clothes.
I didn't stop her.

379
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,188
I was afraid something might happen
if she got too drunk.

380
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,358
Later, I took her
somewhere she could rest.

381
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,486
Suddenly, she

382
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,863
hugged me

383
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,532
and kissed me.

384
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,208
I was also there to help hold her.

385
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,835
She kissed me too.

386
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,214
And the other students.

387
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,302
She was so forward.

388
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,720
And we all drank.

389
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,723
Of course, things happened later.

390
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,101
But we really didn't rape her.

391
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,186
What are you saying?

392
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,105
What are you saying?

393
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,066
My daughter didn't drink.

394
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,443
You hear me?
My daughter didn't drink at all!

395
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,488
You beasts

396
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,073
raped my daughter

397
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,366
and hurt her.

398
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,285
And now you're telling these lies
to blame it all on her!

399
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,620
Do you even have a heart?

400
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,038
I'll kill you, I tell you!

401
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,416
Hey, don't. Are you threatening us?

402
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,543
If you don't wanna talk,
we'll meet in court.

403
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,961
I'll sue your ass.

404
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,046
Hey, my son is such a good boy.

405
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,507
Clearly, your daughter seduced them,
so this happened.

406
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,676
What else do you wanna do to my son?

407
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,845
That's enough. Everyone, please calm down.

408
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,431
We're here today
to resolve the issue, not to argue.

409
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,099
Okay?

410
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,893
Everyone, sit down.
Miss, take the students outside.

411
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,895
Hey, all of you, let's go.

412
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,148
-It's okay. I'm here. No worries.
-Wait outside.

413
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,233
It's okay. I'm here.

414
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,401
No worries.

415
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,661
Mr. and Mrs. Chiang,

416
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,706
regardless of whether
Hsiao-tung initiated it or not,

417
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,292
we shouldn't have done this.

418
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,335
This is wrong.

419
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,589
Please forgive us.

420
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,632
I'm really sorry.

421
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,721
I think

422
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,764
we should all calm down first.

423
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,436
We also got the perspectives of students
who went with Chiang Hsiao-tung that day.

424
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,814
Both female students mentioned

425
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,485
Chiang Hsiao-tung wanted to stay behind
and told them to leave first.

426
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,612
They also asserted

427
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,449
that it didn't feel like
Chiang Hsiao-tung was coerced that day.

428
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,660
In fact, we pulled up
the security camera footage

429
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,873
and saw that Chiang Hsiao-tung
happily got into Ouyang Ti's vehicle.

430
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,875
She didn't seem coerced.

431
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,462
It was clearly consensual.

432
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,173
What? She sobered up and now regrets it,

433
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,301
so she turns around and blames it on us?

434
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,595
Consensual?

435
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,515
We took our daughter for a medical exam.

436
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,768
She's injured all over!
You call that consensual?

437
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,562
Your sons acted like beasts!

438
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,856
Now you're blaming it all on our daughter.

439
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm gonna sue them.

440
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,194
I'm gonna sue them
until they're all in jail!

441
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,446
Go ahead and sue! We didn't do anything!

442
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,781
I'm not scared!

443
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,742
How about my boy just compromises

444
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,035
and marries her?

445
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,578
Marrying a girl like that?

446
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,121
Forget it.

447
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,957
-That's right.
-Go ahead and sue!

448
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,709
Let the whole world know
how dirty your daughter is.

449
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,963
-That's right.
-Sleeping with a bunch of guys this young.

450
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,130
Shameless!

451
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,008
Let's see how she'll live from now on.

452
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,469
No one will marry her.
What's the point of living?

453
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,346
All you really want is money!

454
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,265
-That's right.
-You think I can't tell?

455
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,683
-What?
-You think we're fools?

456
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,059
What are you saying?

457
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,435
What's this? What did I say?

458
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,271
Get back! What's this?

459
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,897
What are you doing?

460
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,942
Enough, stop arguing.

461
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,070
If something has happened,
we will resolve it.

462
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,406
This matter

463
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,827
is something all of us parents here today
have to take responsibility for.

464
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,663
They are minors.

465
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,249
They shouldn't have had
the forbidden fruit to begin with.

466
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:11,297
But whether it was consensual or not,

467
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,342
it's always the girl who suffers the most.

468
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,470
Your daughter wouldn't want

469
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,639
everyone to know about this, would she?

470
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,018
If

471
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,854
you're willing to keep this quiet

472
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,314
and not take it to court,

473
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,151
we can compromise.

474
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,279
I'm willing to offer a sum of money

475
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,906
so that Chiang Hsiao-tung
can start a new life.

476
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,908
As for the amount,

477
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,577
well,

478
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,704
you can write whatever you want, yeah?

479
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,372
We don't want that kind of money!

480
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,501
Save it for your precious sons' coffins!

481
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,045
-Let's go.
-Say what?

482
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,088
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

483
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,550
-Mr. and Mrs. Chiang!
-I won't give you a cent! I'll sue you!

484
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,510
Stop arguing.

485
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,970
-What the heck?
-Sir.

486
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,726
-Did you guys see Hsiao-tung's dad?
-Yeah.

487
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,229
Fuck, his fists are huge. Who'd win
if you went head-to-head with him?

488
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,189
Damn, hard to say.

489
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,940
Depends on what you're going for, yeah?

490
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,152
Hey, but what we're doing…

491
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,570
-What?
-It doesn't feel right.

492
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,864
-What the hell are you saying?
-Go on, say it.

493
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,076
"My son is such a good boy."

494
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,206
Hey, don't. Don't pick on him.

495
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,625
Che-li is usually a good boy,
I know, isn't he?

496
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,711
-He's the best.
-Look at how neat his tie is, right?

497
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,339
Hey, Che-li.

498
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,298
Not mad, are you?

499
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,133
-No.
-No getting mad, okay?

500
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,218
-Hey!
-Stop it.

501
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,552
-Guys, look!
-It hurts.

502
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,847
Fuck.

503
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,016
Idiot, what's so damn scary?
We're a big crowd.

504
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,309
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

505
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,561
How come you look so awful?

506
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,397
Are you feeling pissy?

507
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,856
Why is your head green?

508
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,817
Hey, fatty, that's too much!

509
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,861
He finally got a girl,
but we all screwed her before he could.

510
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,946
Now you laugh at him.

511
00:44:59,029 --> 00:44:59,863
Hey, Jen-yao!

512
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,492
Wow, so fierce. I'm scared.

513
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,829
What?

514
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,205
You want to fight?

515
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,623
Six against one. No fear here.

516
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,458
Come on, fucking loser!

517
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,919
Li Jen-yao, your girl is such a good bang.

518
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,462
I had a dream about it today.

519
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,006
Have you boned her before?
We're brothers if you have.

520
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,598
