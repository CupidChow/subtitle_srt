1
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,024
From a very young age, I've known…

2
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,486
I've known that I'm different.

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,157
My family…

4
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,452
My family

5
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,495
doesn't have a dad,

6
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,122
or a mom.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,375
Only a grandma who I fear.

8
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,421
MENG-HUA, ALWAYS LOVE YOU
TAO-MING

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,553
That wicked woman

10
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,430
killed your father.

11
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,641
Yet, you keep trying to find her.

12
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,606
She abandoned you.

13
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,275
She won't love you.

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,072
No one in this world
will love you, except Granny.

15
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,157
I've always doubted

16
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,785
what my grandma tells me.

17
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,746
But apart from my grandma…

18
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,997
SHEN MENG-HUA, LAI TAO-MING

19
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,791
…I have no family left.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,794
So I have to believe that she loves me.

21
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,587
SUICIDE FOR LOVE, DAUGHTER LEFT BEHIND

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,005
WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN ABUSES WIFE

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,548
HUSBAND DIES, WIFE GETS MINOR BURNS

24
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,508
After I found out…

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,801
MARRIED MS. SHEN AND ABUSED HER

26
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,637
…what happened to my mom and dad,

27
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,098
I understood

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,892
why she treats me this way.

29
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,608
It's fine.

30
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,695
I never had hope for my life anyway.

31
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,389
Until…

32
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,724
Until I met you.

33
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,620
You live your life with passion,

34
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,206
and smile so brightly.

35
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,085
It's like the sun.

36
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,048
I envy you.

37
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,886
I really envy you.

38
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,930
I know we're different.

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,017
But when I'm close to you,

40
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,896
my world isn't so cold.

41
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,732
I can finally

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,650
feel warmth.

43
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,079
You love dancing.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,041
And I

45
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,627
love you.

46
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,748
I won't do it. You can give me a demerit.

47
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,252
Hsiao-tung, calm down. Think now.

48
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,463
Carry on like this and you won't
be allowed to compete anymore.

49
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,424
And what would happen
to your future studies?

50
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,928
Listen to the instructor.
Please sign the pledge.

51
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,721
You can't force me.

52
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,682
That's not how it happened!

53
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,724
I won't comply.

54
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,937
Hsiao-tung,

55
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,731
I don't think you know

56
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,777
how brave I can be for you.

57
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,112
Reporting.

58
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,043
Hsiao-tung,

59
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,296
where are you?

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,008
I miss you so much.

61
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:39,107
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

62
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,635
What happened?

63
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,681
Yun-chen.

64
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,892
Ah.

65
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,561
Yun-chen?

66
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,117
Yun-chen.

67
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,786
Come now.

68
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,204
Come here.

69
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,087
Oh!

70
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,423
Oh!

71
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,592
Why are you running away?

72
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,343
Come back here!

73
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,404
Yun-chen.

74
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,365
What's going on?

75
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,493
You can tell me.

76
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,058
Yun-chen, it's okay.
You can tell me what happened.

77
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,601
No matter what,

78
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,937
I'll always be on your side.

79
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,776
I'll protect you, okay?

80
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,131
The election's coming up,
so they're cracking down.

81
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,133
-You need to be extra careful.
-Hmm.

82
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,469
Also, if you're selling amulets
at the bar, keep an eye out, okay?

83
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,263
-Just sell to regulars.
-Okay.

84
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,556
There's the kid!

85
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,932
Get him.

86
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,144
-Stop!
-Stop! Hey!

87
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,896
-Fuck! Stop!
-What a loser.

88
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,983
You think I'm gonna let you get away?

89
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,818
Try and run.

90
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,822
I'm home!

91
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,286
It's all right. Come in.

92
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,873
You can wear these.

93
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,876
-Put your shoes there.
-Okay.

94
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,715
Yun-chen's come over.
She's staying here tonight.

95
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,508
Hello, sir.

96
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:39,680
Oh, so this is the famous Yun-chen.
We finally meet.

97
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,183
I'm always hearing,
"Yun-chen this, Yun-chen that."

98
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,102
I was wondering who you were. Now I know.

99
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,437
Stop it, Dad.

100
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,147
It's her first time here.

101
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,732
You're gonna scare her off.

102
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,901
That's right. Relax.

103
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,945
Our daughter's friend just came over.
It's embarrassing.

104
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,616
-So embarrassing.
-Calm down. Wait till I'm in heaven.

105
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:03,120
Then I promise to be very solemn
and serious. But that can wait.

106
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,080
Yun-chen,

107
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,498
don't worry.

108
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm just a proud father, huh?

109
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,753
Dad, stop watching idol dramas.

110
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,547
You can copy how they talk,
but you're not that good-looking.

111
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,550
-Hmm.
-Psst, he's not even close.

112
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,764
I'll have you know, I'm often told
I'm the Ming Dao of the barbecue world.

113
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,349
Don't listen! Cover your ears.

114
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,102
-In fact--
-Will you quit showing off?

115
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,853
Hsiao-tung, get the chopsticks.

116
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,980
All right. Sit where you want.

117
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,191
-Move.
-Yun-chen, welcome.

118
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,694
-Come on in, have a seat.
-Mm.

119
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,529
-Oh no.
-Thank you.

120
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,573
-We don't have enough food.
-We have heaps of food.

121
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,409
Last time, you ate half a chicken.

122
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,244
When did I eat half a chick…

123
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,205
I'll eat less today. Yun-chen can have it.

124
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,375
-Go on, eat up.
-Mm.

125
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,168
Well, you've clearly got an appetite.

126
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,670
-Here, have some more.
-Mm.

127
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,381
Hey, you're embarrassing me.

128
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,675
My mom's a really good cook. Isn't she?

129
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,301
Have some.

130
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,762
-Eat up.
-Have some eggplant. Here.

131
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,265
And beans. Here.

132
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,474
Go on, eat.

133
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,768
Mm.

134
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,612
This is new!

135
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,949
It's our first sleepover
in all the time we've known each other.

136
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,507
Yun-chen.

137
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:44,764
Did your grandma get the wrong idea
about you and Li Jen-yao?

138
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,057
Is that why she did that?

139
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,102
Or does she…

140
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,730
Does she do that

141
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,523
anyway?

142
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,862
She's always been very strict.

143
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,740
Keeping up appearances.

144
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,577
Today, the school called her.

145
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,162
She lost face.

146
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
So she took it out on me.

147
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,753
It's obvious you hate Li Jen-yao.

148
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,839
Why would the school
tell her you were dating?

149
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,301
I know that you did it for me.

150
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,013
But I can't figure out why.

151
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,104
Didn't you say

152
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,983
that you want that dancer
to see you perform?

153
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,032
If you end up being disciplined,

154
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,910
will they still let you dance?

155
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,833
I really want to see you perform.

156
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,627
So I had to make sure
they wouldn't stop you.

157
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,384
You did this
so I could perform at the recital?

158
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,431
I've told you…

159
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,936
how much I like you.

160
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,822
Your dancing.

161
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,080
Anyway, it's late. Good night.

162
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,540
Sleep well.

163
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,684
Thank you.

164
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,855
But I feel bad about it.

165
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,067
I don't want you to cry for me.

166
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,945
You'll make me cry too.

167
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,410
You'll never understand.

168
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,996
I can't protect myself.

169
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,082
But more than anyone,

170
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,168
I want to protect you.

171
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,478
Yun-chen,

172
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,814
are you still awake?

173
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,836
I need pepper. Barbecue sauce.

174
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,964
Yeah. Seven-spice powder.

175
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,174
The same one that I ordered before.

176
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,676
Okay, yeah.

177
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,804
And… Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going? It's late.

178
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,098
To the convenience store.

179
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,684
Get a ride from your dad. He's upstairs.

180
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,686
Oh, it's okay. I'll be back in a minute.

181
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,270
Hey, just…

182
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,108
Sorry. I was just talking
to my daughter. Sorry.

183
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,202
Li Jen-yao.

184
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,163
What are you doing here?

185
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,628
Uh, I'm just having dinner.

186
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,297
And you?

187
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,716
Why are you here at this hour?

188
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,885
I was feeling down.

189
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,263
I thought I'd get some air
and buy a drink.

190
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,851
Feeling down?

191
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,855
Because of Lai Yun-chen?

192
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,404
I've known Yun-chen forever,

193
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,074
but I've never seen her cry before.

194
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,494
I'm her best friend,

195
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,662
but I can't help her.

196
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,998
I feel useless.

197
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,876
Ultimately,

198
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,253
it was my fault she cried.

199
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
Did the school say

200
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,015
how you and Yun-chen will be punished?

201
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:26,188
We had to sign a pledge
promising to never be alone together.

202
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,027
We barely know each other,
so it doesn't mean much.

203
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,196
We both signed it.

204
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,450
But it was a misunderstanding.
You shouldn't have to sign a pledge.

205
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,830
I'll explain to the school
this had nothing to do with her.

206
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,838
I'm… not close with Yun-chen,

207
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,633
but she must have her reasons

208
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,511
for doing what she did.

209
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,557
If you tell the school,

210
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,978
everything she did would be for nothing.

211
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,325
Come on.

212
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,792
Thank you.

213
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,677
Where's the gear? I'm waiting.

214
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,183
You've got five minutes. Hurry.

215
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,273
-Here.
-Thank you.

216
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,334
Uh…

217
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,878
Oh, let me help.

218
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,631
Oh, thank you.

219
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,182
There.

220
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,033
So, where are we going?

221
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,495
Nowhere really.

222
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,915
Just getting some fresh air
before we go home.

223
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,667
Getting fresh air?

224
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:58,048
Whenever I'm feeling down,
I like to go for a ride.

225
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,550
I thought

226
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,345
it might help you feel better.

227
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,515
Really?

228
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,437
When you crashed your motorbike,
were you feeling down?

229
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,945
Just don't close your eyes, okay?

230
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,074
Don't worry.

231
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm not gonna do that.

232
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,876
When you closed your eyes back then,

233
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,337
what were you thinking about?

234
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,093
I was thinking

235
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,930
about the things that cause me pain.

236
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,516
Trying to let go of them.

237
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,314
And does that work?

238
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,110
I don't know.

239
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,864
Give it a shot.

240
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,803
Hey.

241
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,139
On nights like these,

242
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,600
when we're together,

243
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,644
passing through traffic lights,

244
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,065
don't you think
it feels like we're escaping?

245
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,861
Going somewhere nobody knows us.

246
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,114
Like we're going on a big adventure.

247
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,118
Do you get what I'm saying?

248
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,331
Yeah. I think I get it.

249
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,250
Do you feel any better?

250
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,420
Yeah.

251
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,589
I only wish

252
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,382
that the road

253
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,551
was a bit longer

254
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,929
and we never had to stop.

255
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,225
Just drop me at the intersection.

256
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,478
Thanks.

257
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,650
If you took me to my front door,

258
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,903
my dad would run out
and ask tons of questions.

259
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,991
You'd still be here in the morning,
listing your entire family tree.

260
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,627
All right. I'm going inside.

261
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,338
Mm.

262
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,173
Mm.

263
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,430
Bye-bye. Good night.

264
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,392
Good night.

265
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,548
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

266
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,884
I have dance practice. I can't skip class.

267
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,469
You can stay here.

268
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,681
But my parents are home this morning.

269
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,809
If you're worried it'll be awkward,
I can speak to my mom--

270
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,313
Can I borrow a uniform and some shoes?

271
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,737
I think I should go to school today.

272
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,322
You certain?

273
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,118
My grandma will come looking for me.

274
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,953
If she can't find me,

275
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,748
she'll come looking for you
and make a big scene.

276
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,750
I won't let her.

277
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,419
But…

278
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,503
Hey.

279
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,799
If you feel bad about it,

280
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,217
buy me breakfast.

281
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,929
I didn't bring any money.
Will you cover me?

282
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,308
No sweat. Leave it with me.

283
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,809
Let's get you dressed.

284
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,145
Ah.

285
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,490
We've got gym next. Better get changed.

286
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,950
-See you there.
-All right, let's go.

287
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,285
Get changed.

288
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,329
-Put the book down. Go get changed.
-Man, fuck gym!

289
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,999
Hey, Ouyang, go get changed.

290
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,838
Jung-tai, can you tell them I forgot
my gym clothes? I'll stay here and study.

291
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,881
Sure.

292
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,096
Li Jen-yao,
why aren't you getting changed?

293
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,223
You forget your gym clothes too?

294
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,062
Hey, I heard our class leader
was the one on the roof.

295
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,605
Seriously? It was her?

296
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,108
What's wrong? You don't want her anymore?

297
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,859
-Such a soy boy.
-Cut it out.

298
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,777
WANG YU-HSIANG

299
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,945
Hey, Yun-chen.

300
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,281
Did you guys get a hotel room last night?

301
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,743
Is that why
you both forgot your gym clothes?

302
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,830
-Huh?
-Oh-ho!

303
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,666
Our boy's so hot
he's banging the class leader.

304
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,751
So that's what happened!

305
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,795
Go on, tell us about it.

306
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,296
Did it feel good?

307
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,549
Was it good? Was it good?

308
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,092
Tell us everything.

309
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,678
Was it good? Was it good?

310
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,681
I bet it was so good, so good, so good.
Did it feel good?

311
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,941
Now that… felt good.

312
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,776
Fuck, you slapped me!

313
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,657
Hey, Jung-tai.

314
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,374
Get off him!

315
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,127
-Fuck, I'm bleeding.
-What d'you think you're doing?

316
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,922
You motherfucker!

317
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,435
-Hold him.
-Fuck!

318
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,270
Fuck!

319
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,148
You asked for it!

320
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,274
Psycho.

321
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,156
-You piece of shit.
-Step aside. He's mine.

322
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,869
Stop it right now!

323
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,512
Do you know why you're in my office?

324
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,393
Huh?

325
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,982
Ask Li Jen-yao. He started it.

326
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,277
We were just joking around
when he ran over and punched me.

327
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,030
Yeah. I saw him hit Yu-hsiang.

328
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,490
I tried to help,

329
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,367
and he attacked me.

330
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,452
See that? He hit me.

331
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,498
-We were trying to stop the fight.
-I don't wanna hear it!

332
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,167
These are excuses!

333
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,294
I don't care about your grudges.

334
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,713
I'm just deciding your punishment.

335
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,341
Hey, sir. You once told us

336
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,095
whoever throws the first punch
gets a major demerit.

337
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,889
Whoever fights back gets a minor demerit.

338
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,143
And bystanders who don't break it up
or tell the teachers

339
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,270
get a warning.

340
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,481
So Che-li and I should receive a warning.

341
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,985
I see. An excellent account.

342
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,319
Thank you.

343
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,531
Li Jen-yao,

344
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,659
if you're given a major demerit…

345
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,704
…you'll be expelled. Do you understand?

346
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,081
But what about this?

347
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,209
Before you get expelled,
you put in a withdrawal.

348
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,169
Then you could maybe come back.

349
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,090
Just expel me.

350
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,217
All right. We will expel you.

351
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,969
Who's gonna take you then?

352
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,054
Sir, what about me?

353
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,432
-Do you mind if I speak?
-Okay, let's hear it.

354
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,977
I slapped Wang Yu-hsiang. He retaliated.

355
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,522
Li Jen-yao stopped him.
That's how the fight started.

356
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,107
None of you said that.

357
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,818
Are you kidding, Lai Yun-chen?

358
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,612
You're just trying
to protect your boyfriend.

359
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,696
Yeah.

360
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,033
You found out he's my boyfriend,
so you were teasing us.

361
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,744
You spread a rumor we went to a hotel.

362
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,871
Sir, I'm the one who started it.

363
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,748
I should get a demerit too.

364
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,169
But when my grandma was here yesterday,
you gave your assurance

365
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,631
that if we kept our promise,
no one would speak of it.

366
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,883
So shouldn't the school
be held responsible?

367
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,092
I'll accept punishment,

368
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,887
but the punishment for them
should be worse.

369
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,729
All right. This is all over.

370
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,981
You're both at fault.

371
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,818
And you guys
will write a letter of repentance.

372
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,737
-Five hundred words.
-Sir. What?

373
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,572
Not now. Get going.

374
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,325
Any more trouble, you'll be on detention.

375
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,375
TAICHUNG MUNICIPAL YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL

376
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,726
Lai Yun-chen?

377
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,148
What you did…

378
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,068
Thanks.

379
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,991
What is this? We're not close.

380
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't thank me.

381
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,578
What happened back there
wasn't your business.

382
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,582
You're Hsiao-tung's friend,
but don't think that makes us friends.

383
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,918
Listen to me. I'll say this once.

384
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,880
The truth is,

385
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,841
I hate you

386
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,092
more than ever.

387
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,970
And I'm warning you.

388
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,016
No matter how bad your life is,
that's your problem.

389
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,892
Don't drag her into it.

390
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,687
If I find out you've caused her trouble,

391
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,565
I will make sure

392
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,192
you pay for it.

393
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,847
Ready?

394
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:25,772
I haven't been back for a day,
but my grandmother didn't send anyone

395
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,231
or try to contact me.

396
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,943
And she didn't come to the school
to pick me up.

397
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,446
She hasn't done anything.

398
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,572
It's not like her.

399
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,209
I told you already.
My daughter brought her friend over.

400
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,337
It was completely innocent.
You're treating us like kidnappers.

401
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,381
Hey, Chiang Hsiao-tung, right on time.

402
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,966
Tell me--

403
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,384
Uh…

404
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,011
Excuse me.

405
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,514
They're making a big fuss.

406
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,020
Her grandma said she was abducted.

407
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,563
Why would she do that?

408
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,025
That's what I'm asking you.
You'd better have a good explanation.

409
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:15,488
You said you'd spoken to her family.
Who did you speak to?

410
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,745
Apart from defying me,
and lying about having a boyfriend,

411
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,499
and running away from here
with that girl that day,

412
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,418
what else are you hiding from me?

413
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,463
What other shameful things have you done?

414
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,514
You can stay silent,

415
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,183
because I know now

416
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,353
exactly where you'll be if you ever go.

417
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,984
As for that bad student
who helped you run away,

418
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,403
their family has a roadside stall.

419
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,072
I wonder how they'll manage

420
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,118
with the police and health officials
arriving all the time.

421
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,875
Granny.

422
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,128
I know I was wrong.

423
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,965
I won't ever lie to you again.

424
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,926
I promise to do as you say.

425
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,928
Hmm.

426
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,598
It's all my fault

427
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,270
for spoiling and indulging you
too much in the past.

428
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,314
From now on,

429
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,525
things will be stricter around here.

430
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,803
YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL

431
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,891
What do you mean?

432
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,476
That's my turf.

433
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,686
I've never seen Jen-yao around there.

434
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,064
What can I say? I saw him, all right?

435
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,817
I asked the cashier,
and she said that he's there every night.

436
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,362
Do you guys think he ran away from home?

437
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,156
Fuck!

438
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,493
Hey, what is that?

439
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,538
Shit. Why do you have a baton?

440
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,375
Why do you think?
I'm gonna jump him. Who's in?

441
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,960
-Let's go.
-Sure.

442
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,007
Are you about done?

443
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,469
Come on. You're all being ridiculous.

444
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,306
You beat him up, and then what?

445
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,102
Shit. You think Li Jen-yao
will be scared of us?

446
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,478
No way.

447
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,564
Everything will be exactly the same.

448
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,608
It's a waste of time.

449
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,248
If we really want to get in his head,

450
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,042
we hit him where it hurts.

451
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,008
We have to make sure he's ruined.

452
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,553
Take away any chance of starting over.

453
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,224
So that every day,
when he gets up and opens his eyes,

454
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,436
the only thing
running through his head will be,

455
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,813
"Fuck,

456
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,857
I have nothing."

457
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,901
"My life is over."

458
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,654
"I should just kill myself."

459
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,992
"Why did I ever try to mess
with Ouyang Ti and his friends?"

460
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,914
"Why didn't I fall in line
like the lapdog that I am?"

461
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,960
Fuck!

462
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,338
Wouldn't that be more fun?

463
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,716
Damn. I am so hard right now.

464
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,884
So, what's your plan?

465
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,866
It's me.

466
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,203
I'm calling to ask for a favor.

467
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,222
Where's my phone?

468
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,396
Don't bother.

469
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,399
Looking for this?

470
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,777
And you won't be wearing that.

471
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,280
From now on, you won't be going to school.

472
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,785
Someone will arrange
your withdrawal for you.

473
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,036
What are you saying?

474
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,705
I've made arrangements here.

475
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,834
For now, you will be studying at home.

476
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,461
Gr… Granny?

477
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,922
Granny!

478
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,799
Open the door!

479
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,093
Granny!

480
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,719
Granny!

481
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,362
My face hurts.

482
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,448
Who knew your face could get more swollen?

483
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,075
Well, it did. Shit, it hurts.

484
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,327
Don't you owe us all breakfast?

485
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,330
Out of our way, trash.

486
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,915
Move it.

487
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,420
-Watch it.
-Trash.

488
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,089
Morning.

489
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,639
Hey! Hey! Hey!
The class leader is dropping out.

490
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,557
You serious?

491
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,771
She dropped out?

492
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,399
Mm. That's what I heard.

493
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,360
She's going to study in the US.
She leaves next week.

494
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,737
I don't get it.

495
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,822
Yun-chen never said a word about that.

496
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,782
I don't have any other details.

497
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,581
The number
you have dialled is not available.

498
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,753
The number you have dialled is…

499
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,896
The number you have
dialled isn't available. Please try again.

500
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:53,195
The number you have dialled
is not available. Please try again.

501
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:05,916
Hey.

502
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,179
Buddy.

503
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,266
Gum?

504
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,401
We just walked you home.

505
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,111
What are you scared of?

506
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,488
You're acting like we're gonna hit you.

507
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,616
Well, I should hit ya!

508
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,577
-What are you doing?
-Hold him.

509
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,578
Fuck you.

510
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,247
You sit still.

511
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,832
We need to talk.

512
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,959
-Huh?
-Okay.

513
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,464
This batch is for you.

514
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,090
Now don't worry.

515
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,051
It's already been paid for.

516
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,678
It's up to you
how much you sell each packet for,

517
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,555
but I want to collect 1,200 each.

518
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,141
-That's a total of…
-There's 18 packets.

519
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,185
Eighteen times 1,200… That's what?

520
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,519
Um, I don't know.

521
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,440
Get rid of it. I'm not gonna sell it!

522
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,822
I usually think your stubbornness
is kinda cute.

523
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,658
Oh, well.

524
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,618
Breaking up, are we?

525
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,454
We can't have that.

526
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,106
Now, with the good stuff,

527
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,274
if you really want to enjoy it…

528
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,695
…shoot it straight in the vein.

529
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,489
It hits strong and fast.

530
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,450
Hey, you should be grateful.

531
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,453
I got 20 years' experience.

532
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,706
For your first time, I'll be your hooker

533
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,041
so you're totally relaxed.

534
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,751
I'm making a house call for you.

535
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,552
For your first time,
there's two things you need to know.

536
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,471
One, needles are like condoms.

537
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,181
You only use them once.

538
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,143
You don't reuse a condom
when you're fucking a girl, right?

539
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,478
That's just cheap.

540
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:33,939
And…

541
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,738
two,

542
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:45,492
when I stick it in,
no matter how good it feels,

543
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,577
don't move around.

544
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,413
If this needle breaks inside you,

545
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,874
we're in trouble.

546
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,335
Are you ready?

547
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,462
Here we go!

548
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,208
Oh!

549
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,906
Here, smile.
