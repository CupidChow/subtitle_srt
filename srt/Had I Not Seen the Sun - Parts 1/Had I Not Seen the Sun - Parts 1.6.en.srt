1
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,569
Nice.

2
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,330
Hey, Jen-yao?

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,833
Jen-yao, smile.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,794
Smile. Smile!

5
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,463
Smile.

6
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,898
Jen-yao.

7
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,402
Your father and I aren't leaving.

8
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,574
I promise, from now on,
we'll take you with us.

9
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,954
We can be together, the three of us.

10
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:12,919
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

11
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,434
How was it?

12
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,560
Did it feel good?

13
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,778
Listen to me.

14
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,571
If I were you,

15
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,575
I'd leave this place,
and I wouldn't come back.

16
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,622
If you don't,

17
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,375
every time I see you,

18
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,711
I'll be like your nurse on call.

19
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,878
I'll keep hitting you up.

20
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,715
Getting you high.

21
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,341
Until you float away.

22
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,926
Okay?

23
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,919
Dinner's in the kitchen.

24
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,380
You can eat alone.

25
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,391
Yun-chen.

26
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,479
When you finish your dinner,
make me a pot of tea.

27
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,983
All right.

28
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
I'll do it now.

29
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,253
Granny?

30
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,592
Granny?

31
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,810
CURRENT SAVINGS PASSBOOK

32
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,372
Yun-chen.

33
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,398
I understand.

34
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,525
I do.

35
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,987
I know you better than anyone.

36
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,906
I know

37
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,658
every day you wonder

38
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,786
if you can take it anymore.

39
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,456
You hate living in this house with me.

40
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,918
It's miserable. It's unbearable, isn't it?

41
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,795
Well, you're wrong!

42
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,091
In this house,

43
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,847
the person who's miserable
and can't bear it isn't you.

44
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,182
Know what?

45
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,934
It's me!

46
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,187
The last time I saw your father,

47
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,814
I promised I'd take care of you.

48
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,443
But the more you grew up,

49
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,696
the more you became like her.

50
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,245
She's in your voice.

51
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,913
In your face.

52
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,833
In the way you look at me.

53
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,921
You're exactly the same.

54
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,049
When I look at you,

55
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,219
I remember…

56
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,890
that she took everything from me.

57
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,770
Why must I raise her child?

58
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,774
Why should I let you torture me?

59
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,568
Don't do this.

60
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,695
Why pretend?

61
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,407
Oh.

62
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,704
I hate you so much.

63
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,289
Please don't do this.

64
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,791
I know

65
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,210
you think

66
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,381
you're the only one who wants to leave.

67
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,008
Let me tell you.

68
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,344
I need to get out of here.

69
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,639
Living with you

70
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,808
makes me so miserable.

71
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,935
It's more than I can bear.

72
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,980
Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up!

73
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,529
It's okay.

74
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,656
Yun-chen?

75
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,491
I…

76
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,536
I'm begging you.

77
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,789
You're all the family I have left.

78
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,376
Please don't leave me.

79
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,172
Don't be like your father

80
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,257
who left me all alone.

81
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,302
I know you can't love me.

82
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,720
You hate me.

83
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,223
But please, you're the only family I have,

84
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,018
so please don't abandon me.

85
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,770
You must never,

86
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,272
never leave.

87
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,399
Stay with me, okay?

88
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,693
I'm begging you.

89
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,071
-Please don't.
-Yun-chen.

90
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,198
-Yun-chen.
-No, get off!

91
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,101
Yun-chen.

92
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,483
Hsiao-tung. I…

93
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,195
I… I… I don't know how it got to this.

94
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,198
I really don't know how this happened.

95
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,224
My plan was that after graduation,

96
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,770
I was going to go study in Taipei.

97
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,569
I didn't know my grandma would get so mad…

98
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,907
she'd pull me out of school

99
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,826
and take me to the States.

100
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,790
If I don't get away from her now…

101
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,671
I'm not going to get another chance.

102
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,006
So

103
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,718
that's why I put sleeping pills
in her tea.

104
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,973
Yun-chen,

105
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,435
where did you get the sleeping pills?

106
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,786
I've been seeing a doctor.

107
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,545
I've always felt miserable.

108
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,130
When I started junior high,

109
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,258
my condition got worse.

110
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,135
I struggle to get any sleep.

111
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,471
Hsiao-tung, please believe me.

112
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,891
All I ever wanted is to leave.

113
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,685
I don't know…

114
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,354
I don't know why.

115
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,606
I don't know why my hand…

116
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,402
I don't understand why this happened.

117
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,863
I don't know what's going on.

118
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:28,617
I don't know. I just don't know.

119
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,827
It's okay.

120
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,371
It's gonna be okay.

121
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,261
All right, kid. I've looked the bike over.

122
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,138
I can give you 12K.

123
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,223
-What do you think?
-That's your best offer?

124
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,559
Afraid so. I gotta turn a profit too.

125
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,894
Tell you what.

126
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,355
I'll let you consign it here
and try to get a better price.

127
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,523
What do you think?

128
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,485
That's okay. I'll take it.

129
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,072
Okay. I'll get the paperwork.
Give me a minute.

130
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,287
The bus to Taipei is departing.

131
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,457
Passengers for Taipei,
please get on the bus.

132
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,310
Take a seat.

133
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,741
I'll go get our tickets.

134
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,922
Excuse me, can I get two tickets
for the next bus?

135
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,423
Two students.

136
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,883
-Okay.
-Thank you.

137
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,553
How much is that?

138
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,347
Seven hundred and fifty.

139
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,143
Seven hundred and fifty.
All right. Thanks.

140
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,896
GRANDMA CALLING

141
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,492
You're not gonna answer it?

142
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,160
No point.

143
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,000
If she's still calling
and texting me to come back,

144
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,960
that means she's fine.

145
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,675
All right. Don't overthink it.

146
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,844
We're just going on a trip.

147
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,805
It's only a weekend. I got the tickets.

148
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,059
So, where are we heading?

149
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,106
You said, "Anywhere is fine,
let's just get out of here."

150
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,568
I wasn't sure,
so I bought tickets for the next bus.

151
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,237
To Kaohsiung!

152
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

153
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,210
Do you see that up there?

154
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,546
Is that a butterfly?

155
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,138
TAIPEI STATION

156
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,232
It looks like one,
but it's not a butterfly.

157
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,442
It's a moth.

158
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,531
Oh yeah, it's nighttime.

159
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

160
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,285
You ever wonder

161
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,663
why we only see moths at night
and not butterflies?

162
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,959
It's because moths are nocturnal.

163
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,630
They use the moon to navigate.

164
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,218
But the light is closer than the moon,

165
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,222
so they think the light is the moon

166
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,266
and they keep flying towards it.

167
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,437
They think if they keep flying
towards the light,

168
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,481
that they can escape.

169
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,484
That they'll get somewhere else.

170
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,445
They don't know,

171
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,365
no matter how hard they try,

172
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,744
they're just going in circles,
and they'll never get out.

173
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,254
Not like butterflies.

174
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,632
They only appear under the sun.

175
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,635
They go anywhere they want to.

176
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,514
They follow the wind,
and dance as they fly.

177
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,268
One dances under the sun.

178
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,354
The other

179
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,231
has never seen the sun.

180
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,154
That's why, while they may look alike,

181
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,447
we know which is which.

182
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,952
'Cause butterflies and moths

183
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,331
never appear in the same place
at the same time.

184
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,195
Who says they can't be together?

185
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,864
Look.

186
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,450
Aren't they together?

187
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,979
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

188
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,314
What are you…

189
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,484
What are you doing here?

190
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,701
YUNGHE SOY MILK,
BREAKFAST, LATE-NIGHT SNACKS

191
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,797
Why are you in Taipei?

192
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,928
I've been really stressed
from dance practice.

193
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,971
I needed a break and I asked Yun-chen.

194
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,765
We were gonna go to Kaohsiung,

195
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:16,603
but Yun-chen's never been to Taipei,
so we came here instead.

196
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,526
Try some.

197
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,112
Thanks.

198
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,121
And you? Why are you in Taipei?

199
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,257
And because he can't pay it back,

200
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,010
my mom packed their stuff
and ran off with him.

201
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,893
Are you running away?

202
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,570
Hmm. You could say that.

203
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,241
I can't go home,
but I don't know where to go.

204
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,785
So, what is your plan?

205
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,962
I don't know.

206
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,306
Come on. Stop looking so sad!
This trip was supposed to be fun.

207
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,058
Stop overthinking. Leave everything to me.

208
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,643
Let's go!

209
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,731
PHOTO STICKER BOOTH

210
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,025
-This one?
-Which one do you want?

211
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,651
This one. Ready?

212
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,780
Let's switch.

213
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,291
Li Jen-yao.

214
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,460
Li Jen-yao. Come take a photo.

215
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,963
Come on, get in.

216
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,007
Hurry up, hurry up.

217
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,968
Which one should we do?

218
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,304
This one! You ready?

219
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,348
Three, two, one.

220
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,856
Keep it.

221
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,041
Lai Yun-chen, why did you walk out?

222
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,420
I wanted to take a photo
with all three of us. What a bummer.

223
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,926
Now we're in Taipei. Where should we go?

224
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,720
Shilin Night Market or Gongguan?

225
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,016
Could we go to the beach?

226
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,936
Oh, Lai Yun-chen. The beach in Taipei?

227
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,729
You can do that back home.

228
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,567
I've never been.

229
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,527
You've never been?

230
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,320
Not even as a kid?

231
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,160
You know that my family is really strict.

232
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,414
My grandma never let me.

233
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,959
She never takes me anywhere.

234
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,669
So…

235
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,300
It's fine. Don't worry.

236
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,763
All right. Let's do it.

237
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,932
Let's go to the beach.

238
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,195
-Hsiao-tung.
-Hmm?

239
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,156
What'll you do after we graduate?

240
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,618
Mm.

241
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,205
The teacher thinks
I should apply for schools overseas,

242
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,708
but my family isn't wealthy.

243
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,712
My parents don't have
the money for me to go.

244
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,882
So I think I'll apply in Taipei.

245
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,220
There's a lot of dance troupes
I like here.

246
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,224
If I get into a college here,
I can go to auditions.

247
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,518
You do love dancing.

248
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,314
Do you think
you'll pursue a career as a dancer?

249
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,524
A career?

250
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,152
I'm not sure yet.

251
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,447
I was five when I started ballet.

252
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,785
My whole life,
dancing has been a part of me.

253
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,122
I don't know who I am without dancing.

254
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,957
You're different.

255
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,502
You always get good grades.

256
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,212
I can only dance.

257
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,173
Here's what I think.

258
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,718
I want to join a world-class dance troupe

259
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,137
so people can see me perform.

260
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,305
That's my dream.

261
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,517
I think you will.

262
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,980
And you, Yun-chen?

263
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,899
What'll you do?

264
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,029
I really don't know.

265
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,534
My grandma's always decided.

266
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,287
I never got a choice.

267
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,250
Since I was a kid,

268
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,378
whenever I was asked about the future,

269
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,464
I'd draw a complete blank.

270
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,510
The only thing I can think of…

271
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,808
Is escaping from that house.

272
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,784
The sea.

273
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,748
Yeah.

274
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,791
It's beautiful, right?

275
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,086
It's even better up close.

276
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,421
Come on.

277
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,173
Li Jen-yao!

278
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,639
Whoa, ho, ho, ho! Hurry up!

279
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,183
Come here!

280
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,061
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

281
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,273
-Wait for me!
-Lai Yun-chen, come on!

282
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,359
You're the one
who wanted to come here. Hurry up!

283
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,111
Woo-woo-hoo!

284
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,989
Woo-hoo!

285
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,493
Dance with me. Like this.

286
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,369
Arabesque.

287
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,915
-Is this right?
-Try it again. Follow me.

288
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,752
Hey, Li Jen-yao! Come here!

289
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,315
Ah, come on! Let's get in.

290
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,235
Uh-oh. Watch out!

291
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,322
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

292
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,426
Let's all come back here again.

293
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,684
Let's promise

294
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,938
that all three of us
will come back here together.

295
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,697
All right.

296
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,159
We'll come back.

297
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,704
The three of us will come here together.

298
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,251
Mm. We'll get here earlier.

299
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,463
That's settled. No take backs.

300
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,899
Here. One each. Here.

301
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,276
Thank you.

302
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,197
When we get back, where are we staying?

303
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,666
Hsiao-tung.

304
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,877
You should go home. I'll be fine.

305
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,421
What'll you do when I go back?

306
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,387
I finally got out of that house.

307
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,222
I'm not going back there.

308
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,183
I can't go home.

309
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,771
If I go back,

310
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,815
she'll never let me leave.

311
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,487
What if I speak to my parents?

312
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,990
-If they knew how your grandma treats--
-I know what I'm doing.

313
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,912
The truth is,

314
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,331
since the moment I left,

315
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,543
I've known where I'm going.

316
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,546
There's a question…

317
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,718
that I need to answer.

318
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,095
Oh, sorry, we serve alcohol.
We don't allow students.

319
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,142
Do you remember me?

320
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,229
I'm…

321
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,400
Lai Yun-chen.

322
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,943
I… I am your…

323
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,454
Why did you leave me all alone?

324
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,792
Why didn't you come for me?

325
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,127
I'm sorry.

326
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,047
Do you know…

327
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,882
Do you know

328
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,427
how much I missed you?

329
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,762
I missed you too.

330
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,163
Are you okay?

331
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,833
I'm fine.

332
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,459
Why do you ask?

333
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,421
Lai Yun-chen found her mother.

334
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,799
You won't see her as much.

335
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,427
Doesn't that make you sad?

336
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,231
Yun-chen wants to stay here

337
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,191
to live with her mom.

338
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,027
That makes me so happy.

339
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,530
Why would it not?

340
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,961
It's pretty simple.

341
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:17,341
Though I might get lonely,
'cause she isn't there and I miss her,

342
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,677
I want what's best for her.

343
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,305
I don't want to see her hurt.

344
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,974
'Cause she's my best friend.

345
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,685
If she's happy, I'm grateful.

346
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,607
And you're wrong.

347
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,234
Who says we won't see each other?

348
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:40,573
When I come to Taipei for college,
she and I can see each other every day.

349
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,702
That's why I have to dance
better than ever.

350
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,419
Flawless.

351
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,808
In this moment,

352
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,935
I suddenly feel

353
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,647
maybe my life isn't so bad.

354
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,486
Maybe I have another chance.

355
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,197
And this time,

356
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,866
maybe things will be different.

357
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,257
Are you sure that you won't come with me?

358
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,885
Mm.

359
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,887
I can't go home.

360
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,437
Chiang Hsiao-tung, don't worry.

361
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,026
Earlier, I was lost.

362
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,404
When I first got here, I was overwhelmed.

363
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,409
But today…

364
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,666
I think…

365
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,878
I figured it out.

366
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,091
For the first time in my life,

367
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,178
I can see a future.

368
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,807
I'm not going back.

369
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,101
That place where I lived,

370
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,105
where even my parents wouldn't stay,

371
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,025
I don't consider a home.

372
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,695
So I'm…

373
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,950
I'm going to look for work

374
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,328
and try to stay here.

375
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,332
Every day from now on,

376
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,418
I want…

377
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,011
to live for myself.

378
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,766
That's great.

379
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,684
You deserve it.

380
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,481
But I'm also a little sad.

381
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,905
Does this mean
that we won't see each other?

382
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,291
All passengers, please get on the bus.

383
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,793
We're about to depart.

384
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,169
I'm coming!

385
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,679
In May, we have our performance.

386
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,639
If I invite you, will you come?

387
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,396
It's okay.

388
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,649
It's too much to expect you to be there.

389
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,402
I didn't think it through.
Forget about it.

390
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,406
They're waiting for me. I should go.

391
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,242
Li Jen-yao,

392
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,244
see ya!

393
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,671
Do you like Chiang Hsiao-tung?

394
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,382
Coward.

395
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,219
You can't even tell her how you feel.

396
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,264
Don't be like me.

397
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,059
By the time I had the courage
to tell her how I felt,

398
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,605
she'd fallen for someone else.

399
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,486
Trust me,

400
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,863
you'll regret it.

401
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,493
Chiang Hsiao-tung?

402
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,412
I'll be there!

403
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,166
I'd love to go to your performance!

404
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,260
Li Jen-yao, I'll wait for you.

405
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,179
You have to come,

406
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,848
or I won't speak to you.

407
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,259
Excuse me, Ms. Chu, can I ask…

408
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,305
…do you know the girl
in this photo with Li Jen-yao?

409
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,098
I don't know who that is.

410
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,058
Ah, I see.

411
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:28,564
It's just… Okay, you don't know the girl,
but isn't Li Jen-yao from your class?

412
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,149
What did I just say?

413
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,153
I've got class. I'm leaving.

414
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,487
Uh, Ms. Chu?

415
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,447
Ms. Chu!

416
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,656
Get out of here!

417
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:38,991
But why?

418
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,035
He's your student, isn't he?

419
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,038
You did teach Li Jen-yao?

420
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,291
Oh, god dammit.

421
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,960
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

422
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,589
-Don't blame her.
-What?

423
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,718
No one wants this to happen
to their student.

424
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,973
When Li Jen-yao was caught,
the school was swamped by reporters.

425
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,559
Ms. Chu found it hard. So many questions.

426
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,691
Hey. Can I ask you a question?

427
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,070
When… When Li Jen-yao was a student,

428
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,031
uh, I wonder
if you were teaching here then?

429
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,991
Um…

430
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,412
-Yes.
-Really? Ah, okay.

431
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:32,127
Uh, can I ask
if this girl is familiar to you?

432
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,421
Uh, did she go to school here?

433
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,133
Well, yes, she did.

434
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,259
Ah!

435
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,553
She was the best student in my class.

436
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,141
That's Chiang Hsiao-tung.
She was a beautiful dancer.

437
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,436
-Chiang Hsiao-tung.
-Even now, I still think about her.

438
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:56,485
So, can I ask if you have a contact number
so I can ask her some questions?

439
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,072
Of course I want to help you. It's just…

440
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,454
Well, now, I shouldn't mention
a student's private life,

441
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,500
but the word is
Hsiao-tung disappeared suddenly

442
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,751
because

443
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:14,795
she

444
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,588
died.

445
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,965
Suicide.

446
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,554
If I was her, with all these
great options, and then I was…

447
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,098
Well, I'd do it too.

448
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:45,951
Pin-yu?

449
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,296
Where's your umbrella? It's pouring down.

450
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,965
Today, I met Chiang Hsiao-tung.

451
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,390
She showed me things.

452
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,894
When you two met,

453
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,855
your name wasn't Shen Mu.

454
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,151
It was Lai Yun-chen.

455
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,033
How…

456
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,368
How do you…

457
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,165
Shen, tell me the truth.

458
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,958
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung…

460
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,351
Nice!

461
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,272
Come on! Come on!
Are you… You getting this?

462
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,275
Give her a close-up.

463
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,528
Closer! Closer! Closer!

464
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,404
Smile for your close-up!

465
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,615
Yeah! Take it off!

466
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,867
Film her face! Film her face!
