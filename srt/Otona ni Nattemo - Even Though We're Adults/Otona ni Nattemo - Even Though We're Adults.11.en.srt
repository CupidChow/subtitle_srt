1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,174
Akari-san...

2
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:09,343
happy birthday

3
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:12,054
Hehe... thank you

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,849
Yes I made this a green car

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,060
This kind of travel sensation is suddenly felt

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,895
Right! Hehe...

7
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:23,274
If you get on, you'll arrive by lunchtime in about an hour.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,736
I'm looking forward to it, Akari's hometown

9
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,447
I wonder if it will be...

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,408
Well, let's go

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,034
Should I buy a sandwich before I get on?

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,078
That's good huh...

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,086
Let's make a fruit sandwich

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,765
♪～

15
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:02,772
～♪

16
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,817
I'd like to hear you've been very intrusive...

17
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:12,114
Rumors are spreading that the teacher is currently having an affair

18
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:17,244
I want to hear from the teacher directly...

19
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,584
Okubo-sensei?

20
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:29,173
What do you think? Is the teacher having an affair?

21
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,807
Umm...

22
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:57,576
It is true that I liked someone other than my husband.

23
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,674
He's already divorced from his husband

24
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:16,595
At an important time just before graduation...

25
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,224
It causes anxiety and distrust

26
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,227
I'm really sorry

27
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,452
Sorry teacher

28
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,706
What, why is Nitta apologizing?

29
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:51,839
Um... that's that...

30
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,676
I told a lot of people about the teacher...

31
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,637
Because it's my mother...

32
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,601
Ah... that's not true

33
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,937
First of all, it's the teacher's fault...

34
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,525
It's a bad idea to have a discussion without thinking about a place...

35
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,866
That's why please don't apologise to me or blaming my mom

36
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,671
The teacher who should be giving advice to everyone...

37
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,633
Sorry about this

38
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,260
Really

39
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,812
excuse me

40
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,613
Now, arrive!

41
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,702
Yes, this is my alma mater primary school part 1.

42
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,996
Yeah? Part 1?

43
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,207
My parents divorced and I went to the second grade

44
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,043
So next

45
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,378
What?

46
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,841
It will take about an hour to transfer to the train and bus.

47
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,050
Hehe...

48
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,236
I was here until I graduated from elementary school part 2.

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,030
Oh

50
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:26,702
And I was in the middle of the first year of junior high school.

51
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,079
So, to transfer again?

52
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,247
yes

53
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:34,710
The first one I stopped by was my father, and this was my mother's hometown.

54
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:41,258
...But neither of my parents have a bad agreement with their parents' home.

55
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,013
Eri's mother is there, they look alike

56
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,181
Huh?

57
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:52,936
My mother also has a codependent relationship with her grandma...

58
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,525
But I think my mother made a loud noise...

59
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,197
Ah, can I take a detour?

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,532
Yes

61
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,207
Are you okay? yes

62
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,376
Take care at your feet

63
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:25,219
When I was in the first year of junior high school, there was a girl I like in the same class...

64
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,221
I said goodbye here

65
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,682
It would be a good location

66
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,184
Right

67
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,313
Even if I move to the destination, it's only about two hours by train.

68
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,524
I can meet you at all

69
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,444
Still, schools are changing

70
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,533
You may meet up in front of a convenience store and leave the coastal street.

71
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,077
I guess it's going to disappear anymore...

72
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:55,165
When I thought about it, the two of us started crying...

73
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,628
Bittersweet memories

74
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,385
Hmm...

75
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,429
Let's eat lunch soon

76
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,347
yes

77
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,602
What do you want to eat?

78
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,271
Do you have any recommendations?

79
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,775
Hmm... I wonder if they're still doing it when I went there a long time?

80
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,657
Ah, hello

81
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,741
ah

82
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,243
Which one would you choose?

83
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,370
Huh? Thank you for the other day

84
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,249
Ah... uh, then...

85
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,334
Please blend

86
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,295
Is it okay to be hot? yes

87
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,505
Ah, if this is good, it's the same

88
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,884
Ah, is it okay? thank you

89
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,273
Thanks to you, I'm relieved to receive medicine from the doctor after that.

90
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,526
Ah, that's more than anything

91
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,487
Is it really stress the cause?

92
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,908
Hmm... it looks like it...

93
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:16,371
Actually, I got divorced a while ago...

94
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:21,168
I was a bit confused, so I wonder if that's the case...

95
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,839
That's right...

96
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,132
yes

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,510
Ah...

98
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,474
I didn't know...

99
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,435
Yeah?

100
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:44,024
No, I was curious about Okubo-san.

101
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,652
Huh?

102
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,114
But I was proposed to someone I was dating at the time.

103
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:57,246
I was wondering... Okubo got married first, hehe...

104
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,124
Ah, back then...

105
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,003
That's not to say that...

106
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,798
I'm being pushed too

107
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:13,428
And now they're having an affair and are currently in divorce mediation

108
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,222
What?!?

109
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,102
Eh... sorry, something...

110
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,104
Hehe... No

111
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:31,697
So, I'm my wife too... Ah, no, my ex-wife...

112
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,074
I mean, he was having an affair...

113
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,243
I've found someone I love over there

114
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,953
Huh?

115
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,123
It's an affair when the person you like is yeah

116
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,959
Just cheating, infidelity

117
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,086
Haa...

118
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:51,800
I'll get divorced, I'll definitely

119
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,393
Haa... it's going to be both of you

120
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,189
Well, I'm finished already

121
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:11,028
It's not over, I'm feeling a complete discomfort in my body

122
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,657
Well, I see... I see...

123
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,703
It will be removed, the sales side

124
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:30,464
Um... If I can get a divorce safely, why don't you go out drinking next time?

125
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,673
Huh?

126
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,551
Yes, please

127
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,970
Hehe... that was good

128
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,641
I'm going back soon

129
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,727
Thank you for the coffee

130
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,196
Woo...

131
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,210
Yes it's tasty!

132
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,253
Right! Yeah

133
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,845
Actually, I'm taking a very personal route, ignoring all the tourist attractions...

134
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,138
Is this fun?

135
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,641
Should I go around like a guidebook?

136
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,684
It's fun enough

137
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,730
How did Juri feel at that time?

138
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,983
I'm most happy to be able to hear it

139
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,404
I'll be complaining about that kind of killing soon...

140
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,655
Hehe...

141
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,203
If Akari and I had met at the same school...

142
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,580
Maybe we got along well...

143
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,333
Ayano-chan...

144
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,878
I think I belong to a different group

145
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,465
Ah, but if by chance we become friends...

146
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,260
What? Is that a possibility? for example?

147
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,637
What? Is that important?

148
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,265
Hmm...

149
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,102
I guess I'll pick up after all

150
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,311
Huh?

151
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,188
Ayano is a library committee member

152
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,648
What? Did you talk?

153
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,317
Uuuh, just like I imagine...

154
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,445
I'm a beautification committee member

155
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,614
Hey, library committee member

156
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,699
I?

157
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,327
Is there any recommended books?

158
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,955
Recommended? Hehehehe...

159
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,458
Something that would be good for writing a book review

160
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,878
Book review Hmm...

161
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,343
The reason for writing a book review... It's great!

162
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,678
That's good!

163
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,640
So, what is "hyun" in the first place?

164
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,268
What, "Hy"? Yeah

165
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,895
"Hyun"...

166
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:59,946
Ah, there seem to be various theories, so let's investigate again.

167
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,574
Yeah, it's like this

168
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,745
Let's get together little by little like this

169
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,292
Ayano answered all I casually asked

170
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,463
I'm starting to fall in love with you more and more

171
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,347
It might be cold, but since I'm going to have it, I won't be able to get to the beach?

172
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,182
I'm saying

173
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,773
Hehe...

174
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,656
What about the friend you parted ways with?

175
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,369
Ah... I've been in touch for a while...

176
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,248
On my days off I went back to play here too

177
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,293
I got a boyfriend over there and became estranged

178
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,592
Did me and Juri go that way too?

179
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,721
If you met in middle school or high school

180
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,058
Maybe

181
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,146
So I'm glad I met you as an adult

182
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,444
Isn't it good ha ha...

183
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,801
My hands are cold, sorry

184
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,393
Today it was fun to be able to go round together

185
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,897
I want to take a look at Ayano's memories this time

186
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,152
It's fine, it's close to my parents' house

187
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,695
I see

188
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,365
I'll invite my parents' house again this time.

189
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,701
What? Is it okay?

190
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,329
My parents like to call you

191
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,666
Well, it's the first time I've brought her in

192
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,753
she…

193
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:30,305
We... can we do well?

194
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,600
what? Suddenly

195
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,310
Ah no

196
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,939
I just thought about it somehow...

197
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,944
Even getting divorced, what's too late?

198
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,155
Juri-san?

199
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,449
Hehe...

200
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,410
Lies

201
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,538
Woo...

202
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,043
I was thinking the same thing too

203
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,467
I wonder how we can do this happiness...

204
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,563
Imagine the bad parts of Ayano's ex-husband...

205
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,568
There is also a reason for getting divorced...

206
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,279
I tried to get through it with my imagination...

207
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,824
It's really impossible

208
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,869
It's definitely impossible

209
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,999
It's me who's the wrong

210
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,171
That's right

211
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,970
Hehe... But that's fine

212
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,144
I guess I have no choice but to come to terms with this kind of unrest...

213
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,771
I'm an adult

214
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,446
Hey, teacher

215
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,701
What should adults do?

216
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:40,018
I'll get divorced, I'll definitely

217
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,655
Hmm...

218
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,131
It's tough to wear any more

219
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,631
Ahhh...

220
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:47,729
Yes, it's really cute

221
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,779
...I mean, the customers and me don't look a little similar?

222
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,906
Huh?

223
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:03,620
It's a huge change of image, so cute

224
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,962
It's glorified...

225
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,440
Haa...

226
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,403
Huh?

227
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,450
Ah, Eri-chan

228
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,910
Ah, it's impossible

229
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,830
Huh... why?

230
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,667
Ah... my head is messy

231
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,795
So I'll cut you

232
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,383
Of course, if Eri wants to grow...

233
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,927
I'll clean it up in that direction

234
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,434
But... the short is so cute and suits you

235
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,440
I think it's suitable for Eri's hair too

236
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:02,113
Just adjusting the ends of the hair will make it easier to set.

237
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,994
Yoshizumi Ichika

238
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,328
yes!

239
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,338
Congratulations on your graduation

240
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,382
thank you

241
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,075
Haa...

242
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:51,204
Haha... it was done It was done

243
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,248
The gymnasium on the day is a longer walkable distance.

244
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,501
Don't worry too much about stride length

245
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,336
yes

246
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,715
anxiety?

247
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,303
The principal also said it's okay to do it in the principal's office.

248
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,597
yes

249
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:20,316
Do you go to Professor Okubo or another school?

250
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,776
Huh?

251
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,906
Ah... after everyone has graduated

252
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,783
Until then, there's

253
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,956
Can I write a letter?

254
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,709
letter? That's good, I'm happy!

255
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,169
Hehe...

256
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,842
yes

257
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,519
Nitta-san

258
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,939
Huh? Nitta-san, why?

259
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:14,120
Yoshizumi-san's graduation ceremony practice won't come?

260
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,330
Because I'm doing it here

261
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,090
Um... um

262
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,886
Sorry, say something terrible before

263
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,142
That's because I did something terrible

264
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:47,111
Yoshizumi may not like me, but...

265
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,533
I wanted to get along well with Yoshizumi...

266
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,705
I was also happy that he called out to Tomoka...

267
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,793
I…

268
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,591
I once thought I disliked Nitta-san...

269
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,845
That's for Tomoka and Nitta-san...

270
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,640
Because I thought I was in a jam...

271
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,726
I don't think so!

272
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:31,572
Do something terrible and do something bad...

273
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,032
I'm really sorry

274
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,967
What's the situation?

275
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,555
Tomoka Let's go home together

276
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,682
Huh?

277
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,308
Yeah

278
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,562
Let's go home with three

279
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,273
What?!?

280
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,068
Yeah!

281
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,872
Hey, teacher

282
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,627
What should adults do?

283
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,099
me too

284
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,059
The two of us are close to home so I'm going

285
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,519
Ah, on the other hand...

286
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,120
Is it really good?

287
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,502
Ayano is... Is it okay?

288
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,672
yes

289
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,509
We...

290
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,638
Let's finish it already

291
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:28,522
