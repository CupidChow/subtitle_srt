1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,180
W-Wait, Akari.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,930
Oh... sorry.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,560
Actually, I came with my husband...

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,690
What?!

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,320
Oh... it is late, isn't it? 
Sorry.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,950
How did you get here?
Train? Taxi?

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,740
By taxi.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,040
And... I asked my husband to wait 
for me at the station for now.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,670
Geez...
You should've told me this before coming.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,010
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,050
No... I'm the one who's wrong.

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm sorry for acting so childish
 and causing you trouble.

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,490
Oh...

14
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,830
You came because 
you were worried about me, right?

15
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,790
Thank you.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,460
I'm fine.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,630
Please apologize to your husband for me.

18
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,600
What?! No, what are you doing? 
You're scaring me.

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm sorry for being dishonest.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,730
But I'm going to be honest now.

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,610
I'm really overwhelmed 
by my feelings right now.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,490
I don't know why I'm so drawn to you.

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,910
Even today, I couldn't sit still...

24
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,460
Come in.

25
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,000
Damn it,

26
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,590
you seducer.

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,720
No one has ever said things 
like that to me before.

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm actually quite reserved, usually...

29
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,720
Welcome!

30
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,510
Sorry for making you wait.

31
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,350
No, I was just having a drink anyway.

32
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,610
Did you talk to her?

33
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah.

34
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,210
Still in love with her, I take it?

35
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,970
Don't just stay silent. 
Deny it, at least.

36
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Thank you for letting me go.

37
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,610
It's nothing...

38
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,070
If something happened, I'd be the one
 who couldn't sleep at night anyway.

39
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,130
Why did it have to be a woman?

40
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,130
Of all things...

41
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,110
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,820
Please go ahead with the divorce.

43
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,220
You don't get to decide that.

44
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,590
I mean, you cheated, right?

45
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,600
You had an affair, right?

46
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,350
I won't divorce you.

47
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,120
Let's go. 
Let's go home.

49
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,610
Even Though We're Adults

50
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,030
- Ayano!
- Yes?

51
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,200
The boxes marked "clothes"
should all go to the second floor, right?

52
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,530
Yes, thank you.

53
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,620
- Mom, do you have scissors?
- Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,950
Excuse me,
is it okay if we bring in the furniture first?

55
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,500
So the day has finally come...

56
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,710
I really don't want to live with other people.

57
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,880
I'm sure my sister-in-law doesn't
 want to live together either.

58
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,760
She probably thinks
 it's going to be a pain.

59
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,390
I'm the most troublesome one... I guess.

60
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,900
Eri.

61
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,610
I'm ordering sushi later.
Where do you want to eat?

62
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,940
In here.

63
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,650
Got it.
I'll bring it to you.

64
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,730
You'll have some too, Ayano?

65
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,540
Yes, please.

66
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,090
Wataru, you help out too.

67
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,620
- Okay, okay.
- Ah, the clear soup.

68
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,180
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

69
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,180
- Use the kettle in the kitchen.
- Okay!

70
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,950
Is this for Eri?

71
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,820
Yes.
She doesn't seem up for joining us today.

72
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,200
Is it because I'm here?

73
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,040
No, not at all.

74
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,710
There are times when 
she can't handle even family.

75
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,540
And times when she can manage small outings.
It comes in cycles.

76
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,970
We've tried different ways
 to get her to go out more,

77
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,510
but now we're letting her do as she wants.

78
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,390
When she feels better,
please try to become friends with her.

79
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,270
Yes, I'd like that too.

80
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,610
Thank you.

81
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,620
Oh...

82
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,750
Oh...

83
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,050
The sushi was delicious, wasn't it?
I'll wash it.

84
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,090
Oh... it's mine, 
so it's okay.

85
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,520
Um... sorry I didn't help out today.

86
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,310
Oh... no, not at all.

87
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,190
I look forward to living with you.

88
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,860
Me too.

89
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,750
Eri.

90
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,670
Do you like herbal tea?

91
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,760
- Oh...
- What?

92
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,510
Um, well...

93
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,770
If it's okay with you, Eri.

94
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes?

95
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,690
Would you come with me to
 visit your father at the hospital?

96
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,440
What? M-Me?

97
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,990
Sorry for asking so suddenly. Um...

98
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,910
I wanted to tell him about our move.

99
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,410
But Wataru seems busy.

100
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,130
And if it's just me,
your father might feel awkward.

101
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,210
It would be a big help if you came along.

102
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,960
Of course, don't feel like you have to.

103
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,890
Hmm...

104
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,480
Hospital visit with Eri?

105
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,230
Did she actually talk to you?

106
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,690
Yeah. Was it too much to ask?

107
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,480
I don't think so.

108
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,610
Should we go on a day
 you can come too?

109
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,030
No...

110
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,740
At this point, I don't know what
 to talk about with Eri anymore.

111
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,000
Is that how it is 
with brothers and sisters?

112
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,000
Well... with Eri...
I don't know, it might be difficult.

113
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,170
I see.

114
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,510
It's totally fine if you can't make it.

115
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,180
Okay, got it.

116
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,090
- I'm leaving then.
- Okay, have a good day.

117
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,840
- See you later.
- Be careful.

118
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,610
Your father

119
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,150
seemed happy to see you, didn't he?

120
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,950
He was probably just surprised
since I never visited before.

121
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,660
I'm such an ungrateful daughter.

122
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Being a hermit and all.

123
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,620
He was worried about you,
so he was extra happy, I think.

124
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,830
We had the same issue at my home.

125
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,130
"The same issue"?

126
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,670
My sister Kaede also

127
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,300
quit high school and
became a hermit herself for a while.

128
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,220
Oh... I didn't know that.

129
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,850
Yes, she did.

130
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,560
I see...

131
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,490
Um.

132
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,410
Can we stop by the supermarket
on our way back?

133
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,040
Sure.

134
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,130
This will keep in the fridge
 for about three days.

135
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,430
Really? I didn't know that.

136
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,820
Oh...
What vegetables do you like?

137
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,100
Vegetables, hmm...

138
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,520
This time of year...

139
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,020
- I'd have to say chrysanthemum greens.
- Huh?

140
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,190
- Oh, welcome home!
- I'm home.

141
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,400
I'll go now...

142
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,490
- Thanks for today.
- Good night.

143
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,820
Good night.

144
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,160
- I'll start getting dinner ready.
- Thanks.

145
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,020
Did Eri make all of this?

146
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,400
Yes, isn't it amazing?

147
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,830
You two went to the hospital together?

148
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,330
Yes. Your father seemed to be doing well.

149
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,120
I see.

150
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,550
Hey.

151
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,600
If my mom asked you 
to do something about Eri,

152
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,270
don't feel like you have to
 force yourself.

153
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,890
I'm not forcing myself at all.

154
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,150
I've been wanting to talk with her.

155
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,110
I see.

156
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,700
Is it us who are forcing ourselves?

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,050
Welcome!

158
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, Morita.

159
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,880
Hello.

160
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,260
Huh? Are you sure 
it's okay for you to be drinking?

161
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,090
It feels like forever.

162
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,100
My husband can finally handle Mai by himself,
so I can go out now.

163
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,480
Besides, today is...

164
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,610
Right?

165
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,570
Akari, would you consider
 coming back to work at our salon?

166
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,030
What?

167
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,780
So everything's working out well...

168
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,620
Here's your order.

169
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,460
Enjoy.

170
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,120
...so what do you think?

171
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,290
That's way too sudden.

172
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,290
I know about it, you know.

173
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,380
That you two used to have
a complicated relationship.

174
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,760
What? Wait, hold on...

175
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,340
But that's resolved now, right?

176
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,390
Yukako is married now.

177
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,850
Sigh... You really never know 
when to shut up.

178
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,480
Hey, do you remember our customer Kijima?

179
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,110
Oh yeah.

180
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,940
He still comes in occasionally,

181
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,190
and he says, "If Hirayama comes back,
I'll become a regular again."

182
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,620
You're skilled, and it's such a waste.

183
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,510
When you put it like that,
I'm flattered, but...

184
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,290
...that's not what I meant!

185
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,380
It's not right to try to headhunt someone
 at their current workplace.

186
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

187
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,890
But if you're interested,
please think about it.

188
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,600
Excuse me.

189
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,940
Oh, yes.
 I'll be right there.

190
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,280
- Think it'll work?
- I think so.

191
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,650
Is this a turning point?

192
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,240
This bar where I met my new love.

193
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,830
Thanks to this, I feel like I've resolved
the awkwardness with my ex.

194
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,550
Gin and tonic, please.

195
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,630
Yes, coming right up.

196
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,050
Let me take your plate.

197
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,840
Thank you.

198
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,280
Hirayama!

199
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,820
Please.

200
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,490
Okay.

201
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,030
But...

202
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,120
this new love is going nowhere.

203
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,670
Thanks for your hard work today.

204
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,720
She'll never leave her husband anyway.

205
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,470
I'll never be her final choice.

206
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,100
I should move on, next, next.

207
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,440
Find a woman with 
no boyfriend or girlfriend.

208
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,060
Or maybe I don't even need
to cling to relationships anymore.

209
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,280
Okubo Ayano

210
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,290
Completely cutting ties—
delete? reject?

211
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,920
Which is it?

212
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,680
Hello?

213
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,180
Whoa... um...

214
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,220
Hello?

215
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,440
Hello, Akari? Are you okay?

216
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,190
I'm fine. Sorry about that.

217
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,950
I just wanted to hear your voice.

218
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,920
I'm happy
to hear your voice too.

219
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,800
Good night.

220
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,880
Good night.

221
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,120
Man, I really want to take a bath.

222
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
Right?

223
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,100
Excuse me.

224
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,310
Oh my.

225
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,730
I hope this goes well.

226
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,450
What's going on?

227
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,200
Hey.

228
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,840
Um...

229
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,260
- Excuse us. Goodbye!
- G-Goodbye!

230
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,780
I'm leaving now.

231
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,250
It didn't seem like bullying or a fight...

232
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,840
I had something similar happen to me once.

233
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,260
19 Years Ago

234
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,770
Ayano, squeeze me too.

235
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,570
Squeeze?

236
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,530
Yeah, hug me tight.

237
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,530
You mean a hug?

238
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,410
With both arms, like this.

239
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,050
Like this?

240
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,050
Yes.

241
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,470
And then what should I do...

242
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,180
Just stay like this.

243
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
Huh?

244
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,190
Nao?

245
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,570
I just want to be held like this.

246
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,130
Hey,
let's go on a Christmas date.

247
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,240
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

248
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,170
No, I don't, but...

249
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,420
Wear your long black coat.

250
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,930
Ayano!

251
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,220
Nao.

252
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,770
See? You look so cool.

253
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,520
Tall with short hair,
it suits you perfectly.

254
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,650
Squeeze me.

255
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,620
A-Again? We're outside.

256
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,080
What do you mean, "again"?

257
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,580
It's fine.
Everyone's doing it, so we won't stand out.

258
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,970
Ayano, is there someone you like?

259
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,310
Not really right now...

260
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,490
I wish you were a boy.

261
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,030
After that day, 
I grew my hair out until graduation.

262
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,320
It's great that everyone could make it.

263
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,040
Right?
When was the last time we all got together?

264
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,360
- When was it?
- Wasn't it at your wedding?

265
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,220
Huh?
Wasn't it at Kiyo's?

266
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,780
- When was Kiyo?
- Kiyo was three years ago.

267
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,880
- It's been three years already?
- Three years, huh.

268
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,590
- Nao!
- Nao's here!

269
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,960
Nao, congratulations on your marriage!

270
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,140
- You haven't changed at all.
- Not one bit.

271
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,640
- It's been forever.
- Seriously.

272
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,390
Congratulations!

273
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,400
Congrats!

274
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,270
Thank you.

275
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,820
There we go... 
Did everyone order already?

276
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
- Yeah, we ordered.
- Really?

277
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,070
Sorry, I got pregnant

278
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,450
at my age before marrying.

279
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,700
What?

280
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,540
- Seriously?
- No way!

281
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,960
That's news to me.

282
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,420
Oh, I thought I'd just tell 
everyone today.

283
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,380
That's so like you, Nao,
but still...

284
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,910
Sorry,
I'm always so impulsive.

285
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,680
Excuse me, here are your
grilled vegetables and steak.

286
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,390
Thank you.

287
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,940
- This looks delicious.
- Wow, that looks amazing.

288
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,780
That was a surprise.
Take it easy.

289
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,650
I'm totally fine.

290
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
What about you?

291
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,410
No kids yet?

292
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,290
Oh... yeah,
we're still having trouble conceiving.

293
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

294
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,960
No, it's okay.

295
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,960
How's your morning sickness?

296
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm fine.

297
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,090
Hey, when was the last time
 we saw each other?

298
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,590
It's been three years.

299
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,730
Really? That long? Wow...

300
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,310
- You haven't changed a bit, Nao.
- Not at all.

301
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,720
Who? Me? What?

302
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,060
Everyone!

303
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,060
Thank you all for your hard work this year.

304
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,330
Thank you!

305
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,090
Eat and drink as much 
as you want today!

306
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,750
Here's a hand warmer.

307
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,420
Thanks.

308
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,010
I'm really sorry about earlier.
That was so insensitive of me.

309
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,100
Don't worry about it at all.

310
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,020
I'm hopeless,
always being so thoughtless.

311
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,200
You're not thoughtless at all, Nao.

312
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,810
- Get in.
- Thanks.

313
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,480
- See you.
- Yeah, thanks. Bye.

314
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,570
Because Nao noticed
I was rejecting her,

315
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,410
that's why a distance grew between us
from that day on...

316
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,080
I wish you were a boy.

317
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,050
I was hurt back then.

318
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,840
Me being a girl, as a girl...

319
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,430
I wanted to squeeze Nao.

320
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,280
Nao was my first love.

321
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,620
Even though I know how painful it feels,
I buried my feelings for Nao.

322
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,250
And fell for Akari
without any real commitment.

323
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,710
I'm the insensitive one.

324
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,050
Akari

325
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,400
Okubo Ayano

326
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,320
- Um, boss?
- Yes?

327
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,660
Um...

328
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,530
I'd like to discuss next year with you.

329
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,040
Don't tell me you want to quit...
right?

330
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,130
Oh...

331
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,050
I'm sorry, Akari...

332
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,020
I want to see you...
