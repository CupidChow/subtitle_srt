1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,510
What do you want to be
 when you grow up?

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,930
A soccer player.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,930
Like you, teacher.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,310
Rich.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,890
A bride.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,390
A funny person!

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,980
I was the one that answered, 
"Like you, teacher."

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,320
That's because 
I wanted the teacher to like me.

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,350
Even Though We're Adults

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,780
Awesome!

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,940
Rock, paper, scissors!

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,110
And tag too!

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,570
Sounds super fun!

15
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,380
Oh, teacher!

16
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,910
- Can I help too?
- Yes, please.

17
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,020
Even as a child, 
once I made up my mind, I was resolute.

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,610
Mrs.?

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,780
Mrs. Okubo!

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,030
Oh, mom!

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,950
Oh, sorry. Please come in.

22
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,580
Excuse me.

23
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,840
Um, how is my child doing, honestly?

24
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,420
Is he fitting in class?
Is he doing okay?

25
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,340
There's nothing to worry about.
He's quiet at times,

26
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,850
but he's serious in class, 
listens, and follows along.

27
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,390
Let's see...
Kakeru...

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,820
When someone spilled milk,

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,520
he was the first to offer a towel 
and asked, "Are you okay?"

30
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,110
I see his kindness and awareness of others.

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,180
Thank you.

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,290
Please continue to support him.

33
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,740
I will.

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,950
Sorry to keep you waiting, 
please come in.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,550
Good job!

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,680
Wow, candy. Thanks!

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,100
Parent-teacher conferences are draining, right?

38
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,440
Parents tell us their worries, 
but they're also judging us.

39
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,190
What?! So much detail!?

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,840
Ah... Well, I want them to know 
how they're children are doing at school.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,950
You're so thorough.

42
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,990
Coming in on your off day too?

43
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,700
I'm trying to avoid that.

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,240
Go for it! 
But take it easy.

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,160
Okay.

46
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,040
Ah... I need to eat something to keep going.

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,540
Ah, blood sugar spike!

48
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,130
Alright.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,810
I did my best today.

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,150
A perfect score.

51
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,360
It's been a while, hasn't it?

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh, yes.

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,490
I haven't been able to come
 to this side of town with so little time.

54
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,620
Did you come from far away?

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,490
What?

56
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,160
Oh, you said, 
"haven't been able to come to this side..."

57
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,290
Ah... It's not that far, but...

58
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,580
- I've been swamped at work lately.
- I see.

59
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,530
- Thank you for waiting.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,090
I live around here.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,010
- Oh, you do?
- Yes.

62
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,680
Oh, yes.

63
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,850
Yes.

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,570
No good spots in your neighborhood?

66
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,070
There are, but near my work, 
so I have to be careful.

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,410
Ah, right.

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,520
Wait...
When did we leave the bar?

69
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,320
A while ago,
and even went to a second spot.

70
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,950
And now all the bars are closed.

71
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,830
No way, when?

72
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,330
The trains have stopped running, 
so what now?

73
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,370
Wait... when?

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,080
A taxi then?

75
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,800
Or maybe...

76
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,720
Pardon me...

77
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,970
- Want some water?
- Yes.

78
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,890
Oh, have a seat.

79
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,020
Oh...

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,660
- Here.
- Thank you.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,120
- By the way...
- Yup?

82
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,630
We just... kissed, right?

83
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,510
Right.

84
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,050
With someone I just met...

85
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,880
Who are you?

86
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,430
Huh?

87
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,800
You're so upfront 
even though you look reserved.

88
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,310
R-Really?

89
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,190
Uh, I'm glad, but...

90
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm an elementary school teacher.

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,150
What, really?

92
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,280
A pervy teacher.

93
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,200
Yes.

94
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,130
Hey, can I see you again?

95
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,840
I mean, I want to see you again.

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,720
I know it's weird since we just met, 
but stuff happens, right?

97
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,850
This is my first time.

98
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,560
Your kiss wasn't a first-timer's.

99
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,980
I'm flattered.

100
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,610
I'm Hirayama Akari.

101
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,030
I've been working at that bar 
we were at for a bit.

102
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,240
What?

103
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
I was off today and having a drink.

104
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,330
That's when you, Miss Teacher, came in.

105
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,330
I'm Okubo Ayano.

106
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,630
Beautiful name.

107
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,160
How's your hangover?

108
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,520
Oh.

109
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,190
She cares.

110
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,500
It's okay.
How about your's?

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,460
It's okay.

112
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,430
This sucks.

113
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,190
Okubo guest.

114
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,770
I wonder how Miss Okubo is doing?

115
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,030
I want to see her soon.

116
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,490
Thanks for the meal.

117
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,530
Thank you.

118
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,570
Thank you.

119
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,960
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

120
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,920
I'm Okubo and made a reservation for 7pm.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,250
Yes, we have your reservation.

122
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,230
It's been a while.

123
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,730
- It has.
- Thank you.

124
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,780
He's my husband.

125
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,570
- Did you say something?
- No, nothing.

126
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,200
- Please enjoy your time.
- Thank you.

127
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,370
Thanks.

128
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,260
I should've known. 
The usual heartbreak.

129
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,380
Thank you.

130
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,850
I fell for a married woman.

131
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,930
Honestly, this isn't uncommon for me.

132
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,570
My first love was my homeroom teacher, 
who wore a wedding ring.

133
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,440
A teacher...

134
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,160
I guess that's what attracted me too.

135
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,660
Hm, what's wrong?

136
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,700
Nothing.

137
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,290
But I wasn't careful enough 
because of that.

138
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,210
I checked for a ring in advance.

139
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,550
Let's eat.

140
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,510
Miss, I think you're my type.

141
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,140
What?

142
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,270
I always ask first with people I like.

143
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,860
Miss, are you into women?

144
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,690
I even probed her feelings.

145
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't want to pressure someone 
who's not interested.

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,700
I see.

147
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,790
I don't know if I'm into women,

148
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,840
but I think you're a very attractive person.

149
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,510
Ah, I drank too much.

150
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,440
You can hold your alcohol though.

151
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,100
No, not recently...
My eyes feel itchy.

152
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,940
Ah, don't rub them.

153
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,150
Hey.

154
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,240
Can I kiss you?

155
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,740
What?

156
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,660
Never mind.

157
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,680
Of course I'd fall for her.

158
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,270
Did she regret it after sobering up?

159
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,770
A moment of curiosity?
It could've been anyone?

160
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,110
- There's a bunch.
- You're right.

161
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,780
Hm...

162
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,890
Ah, it's been a while,
 but that spot was still good.

163
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,170
Yup, thanks for reserving.

164
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,440
- It just popped into my mind on the way home.
- I see.

165
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,300
It's getting popular and
 hard to reserve these days.

166
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,220
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

167
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,970
- We got lucky.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,230
And that paella was super good, wasn't it?

169
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,230
- Really good.
- Right?

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,250
Alright.

171
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,450
Hm?

172
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,290
Sorry, I'm sleepy.

173
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,490
Five years ago,

174
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,620
we turned our wedding rings into necklaces.

175
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,210
So we wouldn't lose them.

176
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,380
They looked like works of art even if we forgot to put them on, we laughed.

177
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,930
Of all times...

178
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,890
Why did I forget to wear it that day?

179
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,370
It's me, Okubo.

180
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,700
Apologies for being rude earlier.

181
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,710
I was looking forward to seeing you, Akari.

182
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,140
I was really looking forward to going alone.

183
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm sorry...

184
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,310
for not telling you the truth.

185
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,730
Hey.

186
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,780
Can I kiss you?

187
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,280
What?

188
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,410
Never mind.

189
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,450
I wanted to spontaneously kiss her.

190
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,890
It was a first.

191
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,840
How about now?

192
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,800
Do you still want to see me now?

193
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,480
I want to see you, truly.

194
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,400
Are you messing around? Dummy.

195
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,900
You're a married woman.

196
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,860
Oh no, I want to see you too.

197
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,930
That makes me happy, truly.

198
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,090
Dummy...

199
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,840
Dummy, dummy, dummy.

200
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:44,770
When can we meet?
Let's set it up.
What time does school end?

201
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,450
I'm so... stupid.

202
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,580
Welcome.

203
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,640
Hi.

204
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,770
One cafe latte, please.

205
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,310
Coming up.

206
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,100
Were you troubled while coming here?

207
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,940
Well...

208
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,020
It's hard to find 
and far from the station.

209
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,030
- Oh, you mean that?
- What?

210
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,160
Oh, nothing...

211
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,960
Today, I...

212
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,130
wanted to talk.

213
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,890
Oh, me too.

214
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,100
Of course you have things to tell me.

215
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,810
I do too.

216
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,270
Yes.

217
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,740
Look, people like you exist.

218
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,990
Some people like men, 
but also fall for women.

219
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,960
But when they can't choose 
and get in a bind...

220
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,170
They end up going with the option
 that's not me.

221
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,090
All the women I've dated in the past
 were like that.

222
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,810
Well, it just means I wasn't chosen.

223
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,350
I'm sorry for hurting you.

224
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,490
I'll talk to my husband

225
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,110
about my real feelings.

226
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,410
What?

227
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,710
Otherwise, I'll end up lying to both of you.

228
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,370
Hey, gimme a break here.

229
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,160
- What do you mean?
- Like that!

230
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,420
The usual coming from 
someone who can't commit.

231
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,670
"I've been dishonest,
so I'll be honest now"?

232
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,550
Sure, that might satisfy you,

233
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,720
but what about your husband 
who gets this one-sided confession?

234
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
It's not fair.

235
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,310
That's what I wanted to say.

236
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,440
I've dragged out relationships like this before.

237
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,320
Honestly, that's all I've done.

238
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,620
I'm turning 36 next month, 
and I'm tired of it.

239
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Um, I don't know when to say this,

240
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,760
but I'm 35 too! 
Turning 36 this year.

241
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,880
It's seriously not the time to say that.

242
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,130
I'm sorry.

243
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,340
I don't know why being the same age
 made me happy?

244
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,970
I've had plenty of classmates
 I didn't click with...

245
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,560
Actually, I didn't click with many.

246
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,690
Ayano, you're a teacher, right?

247
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,150
Yes.

248
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,600
Damn...
You're a good talker.

249
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,910
No, I'm not.

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,830
I wanted to see you as a teacher.

251
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,210
I like teachers.

252
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,300
That was...

253
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,430
my first time ever doing something
 like that on that night.

254
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,310
I don't want to use that as an excuse.

255
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,480
But I think...

256
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,490
it might've been
 because it was you, Akari.

257
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,660
But why did it have to be you?

258
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,750
Talking to my husband 
isn't about easing my conscience.

259
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,470
I truly do not know 
what to do with these feelings.

260
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,060
I want to tell someone and let it all out.

261
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,940
"Because it was you, Akari." 
So you're the kind of person to say this too?

262
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,400
A template of indecisive women.

263
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,740
It's probably time to end this.

264
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,200
These kind of situations are convenient
 when it's the same sex.

265
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,170
No one suspects an affair when we meet.

266
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,210
Have you had an affair?

267
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,130
What? Well...

268
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,130
I knew she had a boyfriend,

269
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,640
but I liked her enough to not care.

270
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,100
But she left me when she got married.

271
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,350
Anyway, someone 
who cheats won't be faithful, right?

272
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,650
That's true.

273
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,530
Oh, I'll leave you here.

274
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,450
What?

275
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,660
I can take a bus here that's closer to home.

276
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,910
Thank you for seeing me today.

277
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,750
What?

278
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,670
What's with the abruptness? 
Is she mad?

279
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,800
What?

280
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,420
That's it?

281
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,050
Damn... I'm already be messed with.

282
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,810
Trouble, trouble.

283
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,100
It's getting harder to leave.

284
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,360
What's happening to me?

285
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,090
Um... mother.

286
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,720
Emails five minutes in advance
 have no meaning.

287
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,260
I might not even be home.

288
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,390
It's fine, you're home.
I'm just stopping by.

289
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
There was no point 
in giving you advance notice.

290
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,860
Oh, where's Wataru?

291
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,520
Still sleeping.

292
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,360
The view here is always nice when I come.

293
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,490
And it's close to a park too.

294
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,040
No wonder your father 
said it was perfect for a family.

295
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,040
- Here you go.
- Thanks!

296
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,670
Oh, that's right.

297
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,250
Please take this if you'd like.

298
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,590
It's almost your birthday, right?

299
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,300
Ah, thank you.

300
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,630
It's cute.

301
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
- It's a sachet.
- Sachet?

302
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,930
A scented pouch 
that you hang on hangers.

303
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,930
And an aromatherapy candle.

304
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,480
It's beautiful.

305
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,770
Did you make it in class?

306
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,900
Right.

307
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,900
Ayano, you're turning 35 this year, right?

308
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,610
36.

309
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,780
36, huh...

310
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,250
Did you give up on kids?

311
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,930
2,000 yen in change.

312
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,420
Thank you as always.

313
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,100
Not at all.

314
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,230
Ah, Mr. Shimura!

315
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,690
Excuse me.

316
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,900
I'm so sorry!
Hello, this is Suzumoto of Reino Publishing.

317
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,770
Yes, yes.

318
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,380
Oh, the manuscript! Ah...

319
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,490
Yes, I understand.
I'll come pick it up soon.

320
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,410
Sorry... Oh, excuse me.
I mean sorry.

321
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,330
Thank you for coming.

322
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,170
Sorry to keep you waiting.

323
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,130
Yukako, huh?

324
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,760
What, huh?
Why are you here?

325
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,840
Well, I'm back.

326
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,670
You should've told me, Morita.

327
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,760
I thought it would be funny 
so I kept quiet.

328
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,430
Ugh, annoying.

329
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,560
Please.

330
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,110
What is this? A reunion of old friends?

331
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,700
More like wartime buddies.
They've known each other since their apprentice days.

332
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,740
Don't talk about me like that.

333
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,830
You still have beautiful jet black hair.

334
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,750
Impressive how you've taken care of it.

335
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,290
Thanks.

336
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,130
I heard you were managing a different place.

337
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,260
I was,

338
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,680
but I married, had a child,
 and things happened.

339
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,180
So I retired.

340
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,560
So Morita became the manager here
during that time.

341
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,480
Then he asked me to come back.

342
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,770
Oh, seriously?

343
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,450
It may sound weird now, 
but congrats on everything.

344
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,120
Yeah, thanks.

345
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,960
How old is your kid?

346
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,250
She's an elementary school student next year.

347
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,210
Oh, a girl?

348
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,130
Yes.

349
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,930
She's super cute.

350
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,640
I'm sure she is.

351
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,310
I felt like I might cry.

352
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,400
Morning.

353
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh, morning.

354
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,230
Did she come?

355
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Yeah, earlier.

356
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,610
Huh, just suddenly?

357
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,860
Can't help it.

358
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,870
What's this?

359
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,580
A sachet. A birthday present.

360
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,330
Oh yeah, your birthday is coming soon.

361
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,130
So she came to give you a sa-sachet? My mom?

362
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,720
What?

363
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,060
Um, it's nothing.

364
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,060
I married when I was 30.

365
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:58,490
Would I still have married him 
if I had been 25 back then?

366
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,290
Yes, yes, it looks good.

367
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,660
Wait a minute.

368
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,500
Oh, that's right.

369
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,050
Yukako's family is hosting a BBQ soon.

370
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,010
Why don't you come?

371
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,050
- You're inviting me?
- Yes.

372
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,440
Sounds fun, I'll come if I can.

373
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,310
- Great, let me know.
- Sure.

374
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,570
Yukako, my former colleague and former lover.

375
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,860
I liked and liked her so much,
 that I loved her.

376
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,700
- He's the complete package.
- Yes, he's wonderful.

377
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,330
Good morning.

378
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,580
Good morning.

379
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,750
Speak of the devil, Mrs. Okubo!

380
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,590
Huh, what's going on?

381
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,470
Child-free and a husband who treats you well.

382
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,440
I was explaining 
how your relationship is my ideal.

383
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,930
- I don't know about that.
- Good morning.

384
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,600
Some parents worry 
about teachers who don't have

385
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,940
parenting experience themselves.

386
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,860
If we worried to that extent...

387
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,860
then teachers can't date, be single, 
get pregnant, or be divorced.

388
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,450
It's all good as long as they're happy.

389
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,950
Maybe I should go on a matchmaking date.

390
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,160
What?!

391
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,540
Happiness...

392
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,880
- I made coffee, want some?
- Ah, yes.

393
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,810
Ah, thanks.

394
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,130
I got a compliment today at school.

395
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,380
Hm, why? Congrats.

396
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,010
Actually, you were complimented.

397
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,260
What, me? Yes!

398
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,220
Wataru, are you interested in anyone at work?

399
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,890
What?

400
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,270
What is this suddenly?

401
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,690
What level of "interested"
 are we talking about?

402
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,820
Do you like someone at school?

403
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,700
No, I don't.

404
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,160
Then what is this?

405
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,330
Not at school, but...

406
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,000
I do at a place I visit often.

407
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,380
A staffer,

408
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,720
a woman.

409
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,720
Are you going to laugh?

410
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,610
No, this isn't a laughing matter.

411
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,000
If you want to invite anyone to the BBQ,

412
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,420
we welcome surprise guests!

413
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,210
As if I'd go.

414
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,510
...or so I thought, 
but I'm hurting in a different way now.

415
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,390
Maybe the past has become the past 
thanks to that.

416
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,020
Someone I'd want to invite...

417
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Ayano

418
00:33:17,570 --> 00:34:26,610
