11
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,177
(Ayano) What?

悪意を持った子がいるなんて――>

00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,105


15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,900
(Inoue Kenta) Okubo Sensei?

16
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,280
(Ayano) Ah, I'm sorry, I'll take attendance

17
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,657


18
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,369
(Asada Sosuke) Yes! (Ayano) Yes

19
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,295
(Hirayama Akari) Okay

20
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,130
Sorry for the early rise

21
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,382
I'll wash it a little before heading home

22
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,968
(Morita Shunsuke) Thank you for your hard work (Kahoki Yukako) Good luck

23
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,262
(Juri) WII OK...

24
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,892
(Morita) Akari-san, you're suddenly excited

25
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,187
I run every day towards the mini marathon

26
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:48,067
(Yukako) When stressed, she starts running, Akari-chan

27
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,069
(Morita) What?

28
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,489

29
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,991

(Maebashi) Thank you

34
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,071
It's really helpful that you come here

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,074
Thank you so much, I'm working well now

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,994
I'll have a tea treat next time so the cake would be nice too

37
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,370
(Maebashi) Ah, hello (Okubo Eri) Ah...

38
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,666
(Juri) Ah, Eri-san... right?

(Juri) Ah, sorry

45
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,721
(Maebashi) Well, just do it a bit, hahaha...

46
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,931
Sweets Sweets!

47
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,604
(Juri) Ah...

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,610
Ah, sorry for suddenly getting in the same day

49
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,778
Please tell my mother too

50
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,406
(Eri) Ah, yes, this is it

51
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,284
Sorry it seems my brother couldn't help but invite me

52
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,535
(Juri) No no

53
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,206
(Eri) My family has a lot of forced people

54
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,667
My mother is like that too

55
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,835
(Juri) That's what happened

56
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,963
(Eri) Ah, I don't think he's a bad person.

57
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:37,343
Well, I'm not in a position to say anything about other people either...

58
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,844
(Juri) That's it

59
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,388
The rice that Eri prepared was really delicious.

60
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,266
(Eri) Ah, no... (Juri) You're self-studying, right? amazing

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,184
No no, no at all

62
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,102
(Juri) I was really impressed by how delicious they were

63
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,897
That's not true, I'm a NEET!

64
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,274
Huh?

65
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,235
Ah, no...

66
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,073
Um... I really have time, so ha ha...

67
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,117
He can cook at all...

68
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,081
(Juri) What? ah…

69
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,582
Hehe...

70
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,961
(Eri) Huh...

71
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,340
Ah, sorry! I still had work

72
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,591
Excuse me!

73
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,558
(The sound of the door closing)

74
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,942
(Locking sound)

75
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,782
(Okubo Yoriko) Oh, thank you for your hard work today, you were quite late

76
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,742
(Eri) Yes, this from Maebashi-san

77
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,828
(Yoko) Ah, thank you, shall we eat dinner?

78
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,039
(Eri) Ugh, I don't need it, I'll eat it tomorrow so I'll take it

79
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,416
(Yoko) Yes

80
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,675
82

81
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,515
<いっつも こう
私は人と適切な距離感が測れない>

82
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:11,437
<なんで親しくない相手に
ニートとか言っちゃうんだよ！>

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,772
<…てか
言わなくてもいいことでしょう>

84
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,775
<朱里さんも困って
苦笑いしてたじゃん>

85
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,903
87

86
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,952


87
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,164
<あんまり頻繁に
会う相手じゃないし>

88
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:35,502
(Rough nose)

89
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,338
(The sound of opening the lock)

90
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,429
(Juri) Ah, good morning

91
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,306
(Ayano) Good morning

92
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,396
(Ayano) What?

93
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,982
(Juri) Ah this?

94
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,234
I've been running recently towards a mini marathon

95
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,528
(Ayano) Ah, so...

96
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:08,077
Yeah? what happened? I'm not feeling well

97
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,413
What?

98
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,333
I don't think that's the case, but...

99
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,669
Ah, maybe...

100
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,090
Maybe the school kids were on my face...

101
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,051
(Juri) What? what happened?

102
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,805
(Ayano) Haa... Actually...

103
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,405
(Eri)<What kind of acquaintances do those two know>

104
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,995
(Ayano) Ah!

105
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,373
(Eri) Sorry!

106
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,874
Is it broken?

107
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,633
(Eri)

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,261
(Juri) I see...

109
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:13,058
(Ayano) What would Akari do when she can't find the answer?

110
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,853
Hmm...

111
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:20,023
If it were me... I might run for now

112
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,233
Huh?

113
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,862
(Juri) It was tough at first when I was running

114
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,906
There are moments when your thoughts suddenly become clearer

115
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,993
Once, it's like my mind is reset

116
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,077
(Ayano) Wow...

117
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,248
How about Ayano-chan with you too? What?

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,294
I'm not very good at sports...

119
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,629
I see

120
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,177
But in the end...

121
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,139
What would you like Ayano to do if she was in that position?

122
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,641
Isn't it?

123
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,399
(Juri) So, first!

124
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,027
(Ayano) Yes, come (Juri) Yes

125
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,571
(Ayano) Be careful (Juri) Yes

126
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,116
Woo...

127
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,788
(Eri) <Is it possible that your older brother's ex-girlfriends? >

128
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,166
<いやいや
だとしたら お兄ちゃん――>

129
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,711
<この前の食事会に
朱里さん誘ったのヤバくない？>

130
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,425
<お兄ちゃんのほうが もともと
朱里さんを好きだった …とか？>

131
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,097
Gosh!

132
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,438
be on one's mind…

133
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,901
(Door opening and closing sound)

134
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,365
Oh, what's wrong?

135
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,953
(Eri) Ah, a bit... for walking?

136
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,247
What a walk?

137
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,669
That's fine! Go on

138
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,632
(Yoko) Come on! (Eri) I'm coming

139
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,094
(The sound of the door closing) Haa...

140
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,976
That's a good trend! Eri is actually a capable child

141
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,852
Haa...

142
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:25,107
Right now I'm just going around

143
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,152
Haa... Haa...

144
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,779
That's right

145
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,623
(Sound of changing shoes)

146
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,089
What would you like Ayano to do if she was in that position?

147
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,633
Isn't it?

148
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,011
If it were me...

149
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,682
If it were me...

150
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,279
(Nagase Tomoka) What is it?

151
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,491
Sorry, I'm calling you secretly

152
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,120
Sorry to hear something strange all of a sudden...

153
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,876
Someone recently said something you don't like...

154
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:33,383
Have you ever received a strange letter or something like that?

155
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,351
(Tomoka) Wow... why does the teacher know?

156
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,565
this…

157
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,110
It was in my shoe cabinet

158
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,447
(Nitta Manatsu) That was also in the middle of summer!

159
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,576
I see...

160
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,501
(Tomoka) Are you going to tell everyone about this?

161
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,961
(Ayano) Yes, I won't talk

162
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,631
I don't want to find the culprit

163
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,885
However, if the two of them had a bad feeling...

164
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:21,056
If you have any problems, please consult with your teacher.

165
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,557
That's all

166
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,854
(Tomoka) Yes

167
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,858
(Ayano) Well, you can go now

168
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,779
(Midsummer Tomoka) Excuse me

169
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,538


170
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:56,383
<おしゃれ雑貨を買って カフェで
まったり過ごしてしまった>

171
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,260
(Juri) Huh?

172
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,887
Ah, it's Eri after all

173
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,556
(Eri) Ah... What... Hello

174
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,724
Training Thank you for your hard work

175
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,019
(Juri) Yes, I'll do my best! well

176
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,700
(Announcement) Everyone to the 6th Aoba Art Festa...

177
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,704
Thank you very much for coming

178
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,997
Introducing the performance

179
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,543
After this, we will be on the outdoor stage from 11am.

180
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:36,506
Aoba Higashi High School's light music club "Gal & Panda" and...

181
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,385

00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,636
(Maebashi) Yoiko Yoko (Yoko) Yes Yes Yes

183
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,222
(Speaking)

184
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,807
(Yoko) Sorry, I'll be out a little

185
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,020
(Announcement) Also, in front of the Aoba Jidosha Kaikan...

186
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,482
A little painting competition is underway

187
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,903
(Eri) Sorry, um... Please cooperate with the survey

188
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,155
(Eri) Which painting was the best (female)?

189
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,365
(Eri) Sorry

190
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,953
(Announcement) A mini marathon between stores will be held from 1pm

191
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,873
(Yukako) Ah... It's the one where Akari appears.

192
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,627
(Juri) It's already pressure, I want you to be released quickly

193
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,004
(Kahoku Mai) Mai I want to eat yakisoba!

194
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,173
(Yukako) You probably ate rice balls just now

195
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,884
Even if you buy yakisoba, you won't be able to eat it

196
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,636
(Mai) I can eat it!

197
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,722
(Yukako) It's no good to smell this baby sauce

198
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,057
(Juri) I understand

199
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,808
(Mai) I understand

200
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,229
(Yukako) Ah, let's make Mai Satakoyaki

201
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,190
So let's share it with mom and Akari-chan.

202
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,192
(Mai) That's fine! (Yukako) Hehehe...

203
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,529
(Yukako) Ah, sorry, please give me one

204
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,864
(Ayano) Yes, please wait a little.

205
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,617
(Juri) What!? Ayano-chan?

206
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,453
(Juri) What are you doing? In this place

207
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,706
(Ayano) My stepmother asked me to...

208
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,252
At first I was planning to help out at the backyard.

209
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,172
After all, there are not enough staff

210
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,759
(Juri) You're really nice

211
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,261
(Ayano) Hehehehe...

212
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,931
here you are

213
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
(Mai) Thank you very much

214
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,395
(Ayano) Yes, thank you (Yukako) Thank you

215
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,813
How many chopsticks do you need?

216
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,440
(Yukako) Ah, 3 pairs please! (Ayano) Yes

217
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,611
(Ayano) Yes

218
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,280
(Juri) It's hot so be careful

219
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,366
(Juri) Hehehehe... (Yukako) Let's have it

220
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,453
(Juri) Oh

221
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,997
(Juri) What do you think?

222
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,294
(Mai) It's pretty good (Juri) Yes!?

223
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,922
(Mai) The outside isn't crisp, but I'm not sure

224
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,717
(Juri) Hey, are you really a first grader?

225
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,968
(Mai) Hehe...

226
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,012
(Yukako) Ah, don't eat that quickly

227
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,638
Because it's getting burned

228
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,890
(Announcement) ...Reception has started

229
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:55,395
Two or two junior high school students are required to participate.

230
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,190
I'm excited to invite my friends and lover...

231
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,526
(Yukako) Is that person a friend?

232
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,696
(Juri) Ah, no, I'm a friend...

233
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,617
(Juri) Are you a neighbor now? (Yukako) Hmm...

234
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,078
Huh? But, you know, I introduced it during a barbecue.

235
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,539
(Yukako) Ahhh, is that the teacher who returned first?

236
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,582
(Juri) Yes

237
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,960
The atmosphere was different and I had no idea at all

238
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,549
(Yukako) I really love you, Akari-chan

239
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,429
I love you, it feels feminine

240
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,308
Also, he's a friendly and inclusive type

241
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,310
You weren't that type at all

242
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,355
Haha... I'm completely different though

243
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,192
Kayo-chan before me or Eririn after me

244
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,655
The atmosphere of Juri's ex-girlfriend is similar

245
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,947
noisy

246
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,949
Hehe...

247
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:57,666
(Yukako) But Akari-chan is actually the type who wants to be spoiled.

248
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,962
Juri-chan is so kind, everyone will be spoiled by Juri-chan

249
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,971
It's full of sauce already!

250
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,223
(Yukako) Was it tasty? (Mai) Yes

251
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,475
That's proof that it was delicious, huh...

252
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,769
(Juri)

253
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,690
<由香子のことが好きだったころを
思い出しちゃったじゃん>

254
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:26,486
<適当かと思ったら
急に芯を突いてくるところ>

255
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,446
(Yukako) So kind~ (Mai) Hehehe...

256
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,532
(Yukako) Hehehe...

257
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,578
(Announcement) The mini marathon will soon begin

258
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:40,166
Those who participate will be asked to make their bibs at the booth at the venue...

259
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,001
(Juri) Ah, it's starting!

260
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,255
So go then

261
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,298
Wooo...

262
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,093
(Attendant) ...We will ask you to refer to the starting position...

263
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,636
Those who were called...

264
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,762
Huh?!

265
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,847
Ah...

266
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,599
(Juri) Also here!?

267
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,520
(Ayano) Chi... It's not, there's a translation for this.

268
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,646
(Juri) Yes?

269
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,481
(Ayano) Ah...

270
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,608
(Okamura Sayaka) Okubo Sensei

271
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,486
Do you know about Art Festa's Mini Marathon?

272
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,405
Yes I know

273
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,616
I won't be coming, but my stepmother is on the committee

274
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,327
I'm a good person to interact with my neighbors

275
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,248
(Okamura) It's nice, but my parents' house is a liquor store.

276
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,834
It seems like they've gotten excited with the people they're selling.

277
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,504
But my parents were also consulted because they were old...

278
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:31,384
There's no choice but to let you know I was coming out, with momentum!

279
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,846
Will you be participating? Ah, I'll support you

280
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,431
(Okamura) What? Is it true? (Ayano) Yes

281
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,807
(Okamura) Uhhh but...

282
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,934
(Ayano) But...

283
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,273
(Ayano) What happened to Mr. Okamura!?

284
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,860
During physical education, I gave an example performance with a vaulting box.

285
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,029
When I jumped in the old way, I was so excited

286
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,656
hard…

287
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,618
Please let me know if there's anything I can do

288
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,703
Teacher, is it true?

289
00:17:58,787 --> 00:17:59,621
(Ayano) Yes?

290
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,124
(Okamura) Mini Marathon Can you please come out for me?

291
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,001
(Ayano) I think it's fine if you abstain...

292
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,462
That's right, my parents were so angry

293
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:11,007
They say there are regulations on the number of people and not to cause trouble when canceling at the last minute.

294
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,592
Haa...

295
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,428
So to my colleague's teacher...

296
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,973
I said I was given the chance to take on the role of my substitute...

297
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,559
Is that about me?!

298
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,186
sorry!

299
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,480
I've been causing trouble to my parents for a while now.

300
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:29,067
I've been a great year and don't want to disappoint you anymore...

301
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,195
(cry)

302
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,655
Eh...

303
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,949
What...

304
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,619
(Juri) So you're going to participate?

305
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:45,041
I mean, I was seeing her at that time, and she was in high school, but...

306
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,835
I can no longer leave it alone

307
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,922
(Ayano) My sister said that a long time ago

308
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:55,176
No matter how old I am, I want to be my parents to be proud daughter.

309
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,637
Even so, will it normally come out?

310
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,683
Hehe... Is it easy to get swayed?

311
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,060
Ah, but I'll do my best since it's coming out!

312
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,770
(Attendant) Yabe Shoten

313
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,438
Ah yes!

314
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,989
(Juri)

315
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,784
<大好き
ギュ～ッて抱きしめてほしい！>

316
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,828
do my best!

317
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,376
(Midsummer) Okubo Sensei Good luck!

318
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,713
(Ayano) Nitta-san! Nagase-san too

319
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,299
(Midsummer) My grandfather's house is nearby

320
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,969
Tomoka came to visit, so I came to support the teacher!

321
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,388


322
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,643
(Yukako) Akari-chan (Morita) Good luck

323
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,270
(Yukako Mai) Good luck

324
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,731
(Juri) Yes, I'll do my best

325
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,150
Wooo...

326
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,032
(Cat) About the location Preparation...

327
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,241
(signal gun)

328
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,831
(Support)

329
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,388
(Midsummer) You're gone...

330
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,473
(Tomoka) Let's go

331
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,268
(Midsummer) What? You don't look at the goal? I've come to support you...

332
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,270
(Tomoka) But it doesn't take about 30 minutes?

333
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,521
It's fine already

334
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,025
Eh, I've come to support you

335
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,361
Tomoka: Don't you like Teacher?

336
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,072
Hmm... I don't know

337
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,116
I'm still honestly fond of whether I like or dislike it

338
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:47,121
Teacher: You said you could talk to me if you had any problems.

339
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,707
Midsummers are in trouble right now

340
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,335
Let's talk about that...

341
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,854
(Ayano)

342
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:21,114
(Female) Do your best ~ (Male) Do your best!

343
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,826
(Women) Do your best ~ (Women) Do your best ~ Go!

344
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,787
(Men) Everyone is rooting for me ~ (Female) Do your best, do your best!

345
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,289
(Women) Do your best (Women) That's good, it's good

346
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,669
(Female) Do your best~ (Male) A little more!

347
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,053
351

348
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,890
<楽しいことも
過去の失敗も思い出す>

349
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,310
353

350
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,357
<そして それを
綾乃ちゃんに聞いてほしいと思った>

351
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,076
(Juri)

352
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,502
(Shimoda Ayako) Good morning

353
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,546
(children) Good morning

354
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,633
(Shimoda) My name is Shimoda Ayako

355
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,803
I look forward to working with you for the next year

356
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:29,057
(children) Thank you

357
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:38,107
(Juri) No good! That way you sweep won't make it all clean!

358
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,734
This is how I'm going to do it

359
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,653
(Shino) It's okay if you don't say that

360
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,530
Poor Yoko-chan

361
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,698
let's go

362
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,454
(Juri)<Looking at this point, I might have been a bit of a disgusting child>

363
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:56,334
<でも ものおじしない性格を
おばあちゃんが褒めてくれた>

364
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,713
<素直な性格だと
お母さんも褒めてくれた>

365
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,974
(Juri) Yoko was bad so I did it for her instead.

366
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,684
Juri isn't bad

367
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,520
(Shimoda) That's right

368
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:19,273
But what would you think if you suddenly got rid of Akari's belongings?

369
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,651
(Juri) No...

370
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,611
I agree

371
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,489
What would you think if it were Juri?

372
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,199
That's all it is

373
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:37,792
The teacher knows that Akari is a kind girl

374
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,050
(cry)

375
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,848
(Shimoda) It's okay

376
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:56,394
(Juri)<It was Shimoda-sensei who taught me how to balance it>

377
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,858
<先生のおかげで
学校に行くのが楽しくなったんだよ>

378
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:12,577
<先生　お元気ですか？
私のこと 覚えてくれていますか？>

379
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,708
383

380
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,627


381
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:29,427
<私は 綾乃ちゃんに 初恋の先生を
重ねているのかもって思ったけど…>

382
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:36,100
386

383
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,394


384
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:45,151
<この先に あなたとの
未来があったらいいのに>

385
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:54,827
<そしたら 私
もっと速く走れるのに>

386
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:59,916
Haa... Haa... Haa...

387
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:10,092
(Announcement) Is it about time that the first runner will return soon?

388
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,053
(Female) Who is it?

389
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,055
(Announcement) Ah, I can see it, I can see it!

390
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,182
This is the person in the bib number 16.

391
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,184
This is Bianca from Cut Room!

392
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,938
Amazing, he's the best place, and now he's finished!

393
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,773
(Yukako) That's amazing!

394
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,150
(Announcement) The store competition mini marathon this year's victory...

395
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,152
This is Bianca from Cut Room!

396
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,904
(Yukako) He's so cool!

397
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,490
(Yukako) Yes, yes, yes!

398
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,369
(Juri)

399
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,912
(Yukako) It's amazing

400
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,184
(Ayano) Akari-san

401
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,854
Thank you for your hard work

402
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,398
(Juri) Thank you for your hard work

403
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,984
(Ayano) Congratulations on winning

404
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,488
Juri-san was so cool that she couldn't see right away

405
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,531
(Juri) Hehehe...

406
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,117
(Ayano) That's...

407
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,416
(Ayano) Apparently it's effective in recovering from fatigue

408
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,710
(Juri) Thank you

409
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,255
What about Ayano?

410
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:33,884
(Ayano) I'd be quicker to count from the bottom

411
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,303
It's embarrassing

412
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,222
(Juri) But I guess he was able to complete the run within the time limit

413
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,350
It's amazing enough, I'm not used to running

414
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,437
(Ayano) After school, I was running down the schoolyard.

415
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,230
(Juri) Why?

416
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:51,027
There was also a sudden request to be replaced...

417
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,654
Juri-san, you said that

418
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:57,241
I really felt good when I ran

419
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,578
(Children's cheers)

420
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,753
I'm feeling a little bit more enjoyable than I'm good at

421
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:16,135
(Ayano) Akari always teaches you a world you don't know

422
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,477
Haa...

423
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:28,856
Juri-san?

424
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,035
I feel like I'm against the rules to say this...

425
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,334
I'm sure...

426
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,962
I think I like Ayano

427
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,884
yes

428
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,764
So...

429
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,814
I want to avoid meeting anymore...
