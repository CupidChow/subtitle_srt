1
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,900
Mmm...

2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,330
Ow... ouch...

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,420
I see.

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,630
So your old salon is trying
to scout you back.

5
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,720
Yes, that's right...

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,630
That's the situation. I'm sorry.

7
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,680
No, that's amazing.

8
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,470
They even have customers requesting you.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,770
That means they really value you.

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,900
If that's the case, wouldn't it be
better for you to go back?

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,900
Is that really okay?

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,530
Oh, I mean...

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,070
That's for you to decide, Hirayama.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,870
It'll be a loss for us, but you know...

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,000
Maybe this is the right timing.

16
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,790
When things start moving
smoothly like this

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,420
you might regret it 
if you don't take the chance.

18
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,720
This place is so comfortable to work at,
so honestly, I'm hesitant to leave.

19
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,600
And I escaped my previous job due to issues,
so I'm a bit anxious about going back...

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,680
Hm, did you really escape though?

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,520
What?

22
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,310
I mean, if you're reconnecting
 with your old workplace,

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,400
maybe this was just a necessary detour
on your path forward.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,120
If that's the case, maybe it's worth
trying again there?

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,830
...That's what I think, anyway.

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,290
Honestly, I've been really torn about this.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,960
I still have unfinished business with hairstyling.

28
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,430
I understand.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,300
I should go back.

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you for everything.
I'm grateful for your support.

31
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,570
What? Akari, you're quitting?

32
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,820
Akari, you're leaving?

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,780
No, today's not my last day.

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,240
But why?

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,280
- I want to work with you more.
- I'll miss you.

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,740
It's complicated.

37
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,950
I can't work
without you here, Akari.

38
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,740
That's no good. You need to work.

39
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,260
Okubo Ayano - Missed Call Yesterday

40
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,260

Three Months Later

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,990
- Good morning.
- Morning.

47
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,780
Sorry I'm not helping.

48
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,830
It's fine, it's fine.
It's the new term, you must be busy.

49
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,000
Do you have time to eat?

50
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,410
Oh, I'll just
have some coffee.

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,670
Okay.

52
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,050
- Morning.
- Good morning.

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Eri has 
stopped showing herself again.

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,770
Here you go.

55
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,310
Thank you.

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,650
- What grade are you teaching now?
- Fifth grade.

57
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,570
Oh my...
That's a difficult age, isn't it?

58
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,150
Yes, it certainly is.

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,360
Honey,
it says to take this once a day.

60
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,830
That's not the right one.
It's written right there. Let me see.

61
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,040
I haven't seen Akari.

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Hm? See, this one.

63
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm leaving now.

64
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,580
- Okay, be careful.
- Have a good day.

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,010
I went to the bar,
but she had already quit.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,560
I think that was
her response to me hurting her.

67
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,070
Here it is.
Oh, and this too.

68
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,530
- Oh, yes.
- And this.

69
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,030
This one too.

70
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,870
- Make 20 copies of each.
- 20 copies.

71
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,830
- Enlarge them.
- Enlarge them.

72
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,580
Nagase Yuka and...

73
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,960
Nitta Mana.

74
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,570
How does it look?

75
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,580
It's lovely.

76
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,210
I'm so happy that
you came back.

77
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,790
The feeling is mutual.

78
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,750
You even moved away, Kijima,

79
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,800
but you still came all this way.
Thank you.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,340
Well, I was the one who
requested you, after all.

81
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,840
I'll come again next month.

82
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm truly honored.
I look forward to seeing you again.

83
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,560
- Take care.
- Thank you.

84
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,440
- See you.
- Looking forward to it.

85
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,900
Thank you very much!

86
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,200
Alright,
you two can take a break now.

87
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Okay.

88
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,290
- Oh, Akari.
- Yes?

89
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,790
I don't have
your new address, do I?

90
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,830
- Oh...
- Please fill this out.

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,130
Sorry, sorry. Sure.

92
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,640
Hm...
Wasn't moving a hassle?

93
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,010
A bit.

94
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,890
But I didn't have much to begin with and I decluttered, so it went pretty smoothly.

95
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,430
Almost too quickly.

96
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,440
It was even a bit lonely.

97
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,310
I see.

98
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,030
It's nice to be free from
those kinds of attachments.

99
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,330
What? Wait... why?

100
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,540
Why are you here?

101
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,170
Oh...

102
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,970
I live here...

103
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,390
It's not like that!

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,510
I'm not a stalker or anything!

105
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,730
You moved?

106
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,940
Um, yes.

107
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,110
But it's truly just a coincidence.
I have no ulterior motives.

108
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,400
Akari.

109
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,660
It's been a while.

110
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,710
Yeah, it has.

111
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,060
Oh, Akari.

112
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,060
Good morning.

113
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,770
Morning.

114
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,030
You're up early, Akari.

115
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,200
Yeah, I have cleaning and other stuff.

116
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,490
Oh, just for today?

117
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,120
No, it's my turn on the rotation.

118
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,950
What is this?

119
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,870
I was so determined to cut ties.

120
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,880
But...

121
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,970
Good morning.

122
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,350
Yeah, morning.

123
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,980
- Did you bring an umbrella?
- Yes.

124
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,650
- Looks like it might rain.
- You think so?

125
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,570
But it's getting much warmer.

126
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,360
If we happen to meet in the morning, I'm lucky.

127
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,160
If we can chat a little,
I'm happy for the day.

128
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,580
This middle-school-like relationship
might be nice too.

129
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,160
What are they doing in P.E. class?

130
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,050
Fifth graders are sometimes kids
 and sometimes more grown-up.

131
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,590
Ayano.

132
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Can I get your contact info?
My phone actually broke.

133
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,850
Oh...

134
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,860
That's a lie.

135
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,070
I deleted it impulsively. I regret it!

136
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh...

137
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,910
Okay.

138
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,030
Ah... thank you!

139
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,530
Well then...

140
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,080
Um...

141
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,040
- C-Call me...
- I...

142
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,590
Exchanging contact info
is still innocent, right?

143
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,220
- Good morning.
- Morning.

144
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,970
The neighborhood association president
asked if we'd participate again this year.

145
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,060
- Ah...
- The Art Festival?

146
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,100
Oh...
It started while you were gone.

147
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,940
It's part of a community revitalization effort,
like a neighborhood cultural festival?

148
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,860
Hm...

149
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,200
We usually participate
with a food stall,

150
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,870
but every year they ask us
to join the mini-marathon too.

151
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,530
Oh...

152
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,540
Akari.

153
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,500
Didn't you do track and field
in school?

154
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,960
Really?

155
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,460
Yes, she did.

156
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,550
- Then we're counting on you.
- Please help us out.

157
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,470
What?

158
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,880
- What time was it today?
- 11:30.

159
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,640
Wait, I haven't run in a while,
so I don't know...

160
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,810
No, no, that's not an issue.

161
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,350
So this is where you've been.

162
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,440
Ugh, seriously?

163
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,360
Damn it...

164
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,000
I might be feeling better now.

165
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,260
Are you going somewhere?

166
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,890
To the supermarket.
I thought I'd make dinner.

167
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,350
I'll go with you.

168
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,940
Wait a minute!
There's somewhere I want you to come with me.

169
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,270
Wait, wait, wait...

170
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,070
Art Festival?

171
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm on the organizing committee.

172
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,410
Hm...

173
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,620
They're short-handed with preparations.
Please come help.

174
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,120
- What?
- Please?

175
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,210
- No, no.
- Please?

176
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,040
- No, no, I can't...
- Hello there.

177
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,000
- No way, no way!
- It's fine, come on.

178
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,090
What? Geez...

179
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,970
Maybe we'll run into each other on the way home!
...Or maybe not.

180
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh... sorry.

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,630
This is...

182
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,590
not just someone who looks similar,
but definitely Ayano's husband?

183
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,690
Um...

184
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,700
Y-Yes?

185
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,450
Are you perhaps...
Hi-Hirayama?

186
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,250
Yes. I was very rude to you last time.

187
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,510
Oh... um, well...

188
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,300
I recently moved here.

189
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,350
To that apartment...

190
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,780
Across from us?

191
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,740
I assure you,
it's not intentional.

192
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I didn't even know where
you lived, and

193
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,490
I know it seems stalker-ish
and creepy...

194
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,830
No, please,
calm down.

195
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,420
I understand.

196
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,960
Hirayama...

197
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,800
You didn't know my wife
was married, right?

198
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,340
Yes,
th-that's right.

199
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,060
I sincerely
apologize for the trouble.

200
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,230
U-Um...

201
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,820
Nothing has happened before,

202
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,320
and nothing will happen in the future, 
so don't worry.

203
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,830
Though I'm not really
in a position to say that.

204
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,340
It's okay.

205
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,010
I look forward to being
good neighbors.

206
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,600
Likewise.
I look forward to it.

207
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,140
See you then.

208
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,170
You're in charge of the children's group?

209
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,920
Mom made up stuff about me working from home
and being good with computers.

210
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,380
She's the reason I got
roped into this.

211
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,260
She was probably happy
to go out with you

212
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,930
after so long.

213
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,050
Yeah.

214
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,100
- Welcome home.
- I'm home.

215
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,810
Eri cooked tonight.
Ready to eat?

216
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,820
Oh, yeah, sure.

217
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,190
Thanks.

218
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,570
What's for dinner?

219
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,750
Um, ginger pork.

220
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,710
Sounds good.

221
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,540
- Well then.
- Yeah.

222
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,940
By the way, earlier...

223
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,530
Yeah?

224
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,200
Oh, never mind.

225
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,080
I forgot what I was going to say.

226
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,460
That reminds me.

227
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,380
Sorry, I forgot to tell you something too.

228
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,550
What is it?

229
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,270
Um...

230
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,190
Akari Hirayama has moved into
the apartment across from us...

231
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,860
You know, that woman I...

232
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,950
She seems to have moved in.

233
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,200
- On purpose?
- What?

234
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,870
Like, you planned it so you could

235
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,500
see each other anytime.

236
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,250
No... it's truly a coincidence.

237
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,170
We haven't been in touch at all.

238
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,340
And she didn't even know
where I was living.

239
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,810
I understand. Sorry.

240
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,270
I should be the one apologizing...

241
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,110
I probably shouldn't have brought it up.

242
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,490
Well, if you hadn't said anything.

243
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,120
You'd be criticized for
hiding it later, right?

244
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,450
That's why you blurt out
everything honestly

245
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,580
because you want to be transparent about everything, right?

246
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,590
You do it because

247
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,470
it makes things easier for you.

248
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,720
I guess today isn't my lucky day.

249
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,780
I ran into your husband
last night.

250
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,780
Just letting you know since I missed you this morning.
Was it okay?

251
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,200
Ah, so that's why...

252
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,920
Thank you for telling me.
Everything's okay. :)

253
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,310
Good evening.

254
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,350
Good evening.

255
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,900
The next day.

256
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,210
Once we meet, it keeps happening!

257
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,670
This kind of neighborly interaction?
It's refreshing for our generation.

258
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,720
It is.

259
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,050
He's so friendly.

260
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,100
Um...

261
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,270
Have you always been
attracted to women?

262
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,650
Acting friendly but
coming in for the kill!

263
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,230
I-I'm sorry. That was
a very forward question.

264
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,400
W-Well...

265
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,450
My first love was my teacher. A woman...

266
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,840
Ah... I see.

267
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
The day after that.

268
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,890
My wife seems to be busy these days.

269
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,180
Yes, I haven't seen her at all.

270
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,640
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,490
Um...

272
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,120
Yes?

273
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,660
This might surprise you,
but I have an unusual invitation.

274
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,880
Would you like to have dinner
 with us sometime?

275
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,460
At our house.

276
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,350
Uh...

277
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,520
You want to invite Akari over?

278
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,820
Um... what's the reason for this?

279
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,990
There's no particular reason.

280
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,160
Just a friendly gathering
with our neighbor.

281
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,790
Friendly...

282
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,580
Oh, I know.
Let's ask Eri to cook something.

283
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,550
She's good and compliments from 
an outsider might boost her confidence.

284
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,260
Oh... okay.

285
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,560
I think I'll take a bath
before dinner.

286
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,240
I just heard about the dinner!

287
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,150
THIS!!!!!!!

288
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,210
Ah!

289
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,750
I'm sorry!

290
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,670
Did it break?

291
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,170
What is this? A public execution??
Don't say that.

292
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,090
Huh?

293
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,260
Oh, I should apologize.
I wasn't watching where I was going.

294
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,050
No, no,
I barged in too suddenly.

295
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,060
Is something wrong?

296
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,060
Oh, my brother just suddenly
asked me to cook something.

297
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,150
What, already?

298
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,610
I'm not confident doing it alone,
so I was hoping you might help me...

299
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,030
Of course!
I should be the one apologizing.

300
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,870
You don't have to force yourself
to accept, you know.

301
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,200
Oh no,
I don't mind cooking.

302
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,290
Is it for an important guest?
Someone from his company?

303
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,040
Oh! That would be scary.
The pressure would be too much.

304
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,220
No, it's someone we both know,

305
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,300
someone who just moved in across from us.

306
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,490
I guess this is one of those
situations where I have to go?

307
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,410
I'm sorry...
Thank you for accepting.

308
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,330
I should try to think
about this positively.

309
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,460
Since I've been invited,
even though it's her husband's family home,

310
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,340
I can proudly walk into Ayano's house
with my head held high.

311
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,470
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

312
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,930
Yeah, right?! I'm scared shitless!

313
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,440
Alright.

314
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,360
Hmph...!

315
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,910
Is that so?

316
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,120
The apartment across the street is a good choice.

317
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,580
The landlord is very reliable.

318
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,250
They've been our neighbors for ages,
and they're very attentive.

319
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,210
Yes, they've been
very kind to me.

320
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,750
See?

321
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,630
The person I like.

322
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,220
- Here's some wine.
- Oh, thank you.

323
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,760
Her husband.

324
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,810
Honey, can I have some tea?

325
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,730
Her father-in-law.

326
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,650
It's right there.

327
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,400
Today's meal was prepared
by this one here.

328
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,320
Her mother-in-law.

329
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,780
Wow!
Everything is delicious.

330
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,530
Her sister-in-law.

331
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,960
You work at that stylish salon
in the shopping district?

332
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,580
- Yes...
- It seems too fancy for someone like me.

333
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,340
Oh, not at all.
It's not a pretentious place.

334
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,170
- Really?
- Thanks.

335
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Maybe I should visit sometime.

336
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,590
Am I smiling naturally enough?

337
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,350
What would happen if
I became fashionable?

338
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,320
Here you go.

339
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
This was also made by Eri.

340
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,450
Wow!
You could open a restaurant!

341
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,160
Oh... not at all.

342
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,490
Please help yourself.

343
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,950
Thank you.

344
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,120
If I may...

345
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,420
By the way, I hear you're
participating in the mini-marathon?

346
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,920
That's a big help.

347
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,470
My manager pushed me into it.
I used to be on the track team.

348
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,380
Is that right?

349
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,390
I originally joined as a manager,

350
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,350
but somehow...

351
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,810
through an unexpected turn of events,
I ended up becoming the vice-captain.

352
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,100
- That's amazing.
- Not really.

353
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,980
In middle school? High school?

354
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,810
Oh, high school.

355
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,360
So I think I should
get back into running.

356
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,400
- That's impressive.
- Not at all.

357
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,450
Wa-ta-ru.

358
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,120
Hey, that's her, isn't it?
You know, the one with Ayano.

359
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,920
How would I know? It doesn't matter.

360
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,750
Hey... Aya will be back soon.
Hurry up and go.

361
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,340
She just went into the bath,
 so I'm fine.

362
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,430
So? Is it her?
It is, right?

363
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,760
Hey!

364
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,220
Geez...

365
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,810
Amazing! Right across the street?

366
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,230
What is this? A coincidence?

367
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,570
If it was intentional,
that person has quite the nerve.

368
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,150
- Don't talk about her like that.
- But it's true, isn't it?

369
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,320
I wonder what Ayano
is thinking about all this.

370
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,200
She was just sitting there
calmly eating dinner.

371
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,580
My goodness, the nerve!

372
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,210
Akari was on the track team...

373
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,160
Nitta Mana and Nagase Yuka are dating

374
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,130
What?
