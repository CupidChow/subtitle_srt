1
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,433
What will it be like today...

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,769
Um... please cut

3
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:19,979
Hello Teacher

4
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,605
Ah, it's been a while

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,067
Thank you for visiting here This is a hair catalogue

6
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,736
thank you

7
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:49,216
Sorry for letting me surprise you

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,093
no way

9
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,430
I've thought about a lot...

10
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:58,517
I really wanted to have Juri cut it once, so

11
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,479
That's right

12
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,608
I thought they didn't come because they received a cancellation email.

13
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,525
Huh?

14
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,492
Really...

15
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,787
Probably but-

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,167
I think the person who booked it via email was my husband's mother.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,253
Ah, I'm my ex-husband's mother

18
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,468
Wow... why is that...

19
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,848
No... not just cut, what should I do?

20
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:44,438
I'm going to go straight to the moment when I first met Akari

21
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,202
Ayano-chan's last name can you tell me?

22
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,996
It's Miyake

23
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,416
My name is Miyake Ayano

24
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,919
thank you

25
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,519
Hehe...

26
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,871
copper?

27
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,582
Thank you, I like it

28
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,043
That's good! Thank you for your hard work

29
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,503
Hehe...

30
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:56,844
♪～

31
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,726
～♪

32
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,104
How many times have you been talking about that now?

33
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,982
Only Akane can talk to me

34
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,067
Sorry to push you

35
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:16,071
I was so happy, so why should I let you go home?

36
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:22,745
That's right, you're stupid, you know, and you've cut off your contact methods all the time.

37
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,123
Would you like to contact the address you would like to make a reservation?

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,458
Ah...

39
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,212
I see! Nn!

40
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,090
How debilitating is it already?

41
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,383
Yeah?

42
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,805
do not have…

43
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,098
Yeah?

44
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,228
Oh, did you delete it so that your mother-in-law won't use it again?

45
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,899
I said I would appreciate your cooperation!

46
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,820
Maybe the address I already knew couldn't be restored?

47
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,198
Should I just trace the history?

48
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,869
Um... huh? What? What is it?

49
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,331
Wait already

50
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,749
Ah...

51
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,211
What!? Yes?

52
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,879
You have to leave now, right?

53
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,090
It's dangerous... Ah, yeah!

54
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,800
Ah, the jacket...

55
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,218
Ah...

56
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,513
Ah, sorry for leaving it behind, sorry!

57
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,559
good morning! Very close

58
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,605
Good morning Morita It's not yet, so it's fine

59
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,815
Ah, yes

60
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,235
More than that... I just got a call

61
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,612
Yeah? Contact information I'm keeping it

62
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,614
yes

63
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,740
Ah...

64
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,165
Hehe...

65
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,418
Ah... thank you

66
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,796
So I'll get ready... Hehehe...

67
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,477
I guess I'll finish it by adding the illustration...

68
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,479
How many? There are two, huh...

69
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,231
Bitter? Hehehe...

70
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,942
Waii! thank you

71
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,736
Hey, look, I cut my hair!

72
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,030
Eh, I thought I was growing it

73
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,240
Bob Bob Bob Bob Hey it suits you

74
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,034
thank you

75
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,507
Ah, today...

76
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:01,820
gentlemen

77
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,907
I drew a bookmark for a social studies tour

78
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,703
Wow, good! It's perfect, thank you

79
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,039
The teacher has perfect hair too

80
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,957
Oh! oh dear

81
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,668
Thank you very much! Perfect teacher!

82
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,587
Please stop hahahaha...

83
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,255
Well then tomorrow

84
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,715
Goodbye

85
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,675
Yes, thank you for your hard work

86
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,182
Sorry

87
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,352
Thank you for coming to the store for help

88
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,355
I'm busy today only

89
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,650
It's been a long day, I want to call

90
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,780
Honestly, I was unsure about contacting you

91
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,323
Yeah?

92
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,704
But I wanted to ask again

93
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:40,669
About the girlfriend I'm dating now...

94
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,755
Ah... Akane?

95
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,217
Ah... she's hehe...

96
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,304
With her...

97
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,182
Not dating

98
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,559
Huh?

99
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,519
Let it come out of your mouth

100
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,147
I lied quickly

101
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,901
It was awkward to wait for me to leave at a place like that...

102
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,819
Waiting for departure?

103
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,782
Yes, he was stalking Ayano

104
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,910
copper? It's scary

105
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,497
But I also rushed over to work

106
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,167
Well, isn't that something like force majeure?

107
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,960
By a former mother-in-law

108
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,796
No, I used misuse

109
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:29,843
Utilizing misuse... Haha... Certainly

110
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,512
So we're both

111
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,059
Akane-chan recently met friends

112
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,063
The girl who was filming a movie said she wanted to meet Ayano too.

113
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,731
If it's fine

114
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,276
Huh... That's right

115
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,991
In fact, there are so many things we don't know

116
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,329
I want to know a lot about Ayano

117
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,624
For example, birthday

118
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,084
Ah, it's today

119
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,335
What? Today?

120
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,505
I probably forgot about my family too

121
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,008
No, I'll have to celebrate

122
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,135
Eh, which one should I choose?

123
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,847
Incidentally, I'm next month so please celebrate

124
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,558
Ah, this is a date invitation

125
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,602
Date! Yeah

126
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,939
A date...

127
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,984
Is it okay to have something like a collection of memories?

128
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,070
The town where Juri was born and raised

129
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,283
Ah, but I wonder if this will be a celebration for Juri...

130
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,870
It's fine, but... it's going to be a little bit of a short trip

131
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,373
Let's do a short trip!

132
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:45,127
Hehe... But first, Ayano celebrates!

133
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,128
Please order Janjan!

134
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,462
Ah yes huh...

135
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,881
What do you like? Eh...

136
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,466
I definitely want to ask for this

137
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,051
Oh, that's good

138
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,266
If you have stomach pain, go to the hospital

139
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,100
good

140
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,268
why?

141
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,603
anything

142
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,523
Is it okay? Yeah

143
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,527
already…

144
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,779
Hey, it's already three days

145
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,283
I don't want to go to school

146
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,828
Don't you want to go?

147
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,999
Something happened?

148
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,667
there is nothing!

149
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,176
not at all

150
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,262
If there's anything I can help you

151
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,725
It's okay Yoshizumi-san

152
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,230
I'll talk to my homeroom teacher and come back again.

153
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,693
Let's all think of ways to support Ichika

154
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,197
Yes, I'm sorry

155
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:59,010
In the end, they continue to keep in touch...

156
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,389
That's no good...

157
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,684
That's no good...

158
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,359
but…

159
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,574
Huh?

160
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,712
Just a moment... what should I do? What should I do?

161
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,673
What... What should I do...

162
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,801
Wow!

163
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,936
Sister-in-law! I'm going!

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,023
What? Ah... What?

165
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,651
What should I do... Already...

166
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,321
Nn!

167
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,160
yes

168
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,913
Icca

169
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,542
Well, it's about school...

170
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,047
"Why not go to school in the health room?" Okubo-sensei said,

171
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,758
What about Okubo-sensei?

172
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,595
My mother is the same as me in the health room.

173
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,140
You don't have to meet anyone because you can enter directly from outside.

174
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,351
The homeroom teacher is also...

175
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,063
They make a printout of the lessons

176
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,319
copper? Why not go?

177
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,329
Dr. Okubo... will he come to the health room, right?

178
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,166
He says he'll always come and see me when Ikka comes

179
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,968
Maybe I'll go

180
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,720
Really?!

181
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,724
I'll contact you then yeah

182
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,456
copper? First time to attend school in the health room

183
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,543
Umm, it feels strange

184
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,502
I see

185
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,214
Today is the first day so I'll do what I love

186
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,926
Ah, you know the manga is good?

187
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,721
Is it drawn in the class newspaper?

188
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,472
I want to read

189
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,183
Not just the right thing...

190
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,895
Eh, draw and read it

191
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,983
What, amazing! Right!

192
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,819
Yeah! Yoshizumi-san is so good!

193
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,698
Hey hey, draw more! I want to read more Ikka's manga!

194
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,241
me too!

195
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,121
Ah... Oh oh

196
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,707
Yes, yes, I'll have a little break

197
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,959
Well, it's been a while since I last tried hard

198
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,294
You're tired, aren't you?

199
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,634
stand up!

200
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,264
Be careful

201
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,891
Thank you!

202
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,269
thank you

203
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,903
gentlemen!

204
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,572
Ikka is here today?

205
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,574
Ah, I already knew

206
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,118
I'll show up now, will you go with me?

207
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,495
yes

208
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,954
Midsummer

209
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,376
I'll go to the health room for a while

210
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,378
Yeah

211
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,588
Let's go

212
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,891
Hey, can you wake up?

213
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,311
Mr. Okubo and Mr. Nagase came

214
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,232
it's okay

215
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm gonna go!

216
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,494
That's good, come to school

217
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,162
Yeah

218
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,541
It's midsummer when I saw Icca and told me about it

219
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,169
That's right…

220
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:53,471
Ikka might not like midsummer though...

221
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,974
Midsummer, it's really about Icca...

222
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,434
Ah!

223
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,103
Sorry, Ah...

224
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,690
Everyone drinks tea, right?

225
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,400
please

226
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,411
Sorry

227
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,705
It's been a while since I saw my face

228
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,422
Ah, I'll help

229
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,008
thank you

230
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,311
Sorry I'm waiting

231
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,938
My stomach is already pecking

232
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,107
Yes huh...

233
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,783
Um, I wonder if I'll eat a mixed grill or something

234
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,039
That's good, I might... I'll try a steak set

235
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,496
Okay! I decided on a mixed grill after all!

236
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,706
I'll go with the steak set too!

237
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,291
Hehehe...

238
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,668
Sorry!

239
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,003
Yes, please wait a little

240
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,799
Ah, Ikka-chan mom?

241
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,052
Ah, ah, it's been a while...

242
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,178
Thank you

243
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,139
Mama Mama has been away for a while

244
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,142
Come to think of it, I asked my daughter...

245
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,605
Ikka-chan: You've been off school for quite some time?

246
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,107
Well... yes

247
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,112
Apparently you can get a lot of work, so it's fine

248
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,447
...I hope so

249
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:22,120
Ah, I'm currently in the health room and I'm grateful to Professor Okubo-sensei...

250
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,454
I'll pick you up now...

251
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,375
Ah, that's right, when you think of Professor Okubo!

252
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,878
It's just a story I've heard, yes

253
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,173
Around the summer of last year, when a mom I knew was eating at a restaurant...

254
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,093
What happens because of an affair

255
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,430
There was someone at the table behind me discussing divorce...

256
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:45,935
One of them was Professor Okubo!

257
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,562
Huh?

258
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:52,567
What's more, it seems that the teacher had an affair.

259
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,571
What?!? Yes

260
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,285
Oh, Okubo-sensei...

261
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,288
Yoshizumi-san, are you welcoming me?

262
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,456
yes

263
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,166
Thank you for your hard work

264
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,293
This is... Here

265
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,546
I'm glad I came to school today

266
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,052
Ah, but I might not be able to go to the classroom very often...

267
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:24,098
Just what you've come is amazing enough, so don't rush

268
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,060
yes

269
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,479
Thank you very much

270
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,522
So, excuse me

271
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,649
yes

272
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,328
Ah, hey, I'm only going to tell Tamura-san this.

273
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,039
Don't tell anyone, huh...

274
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:52,627
Last summer, when a mom I knew was eating at a restaurant...

275
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,004
What happens because of an affair

276
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,800
There was someone at the table behind me discussing divorce...

277
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:03,388
That was Professor Okubo!

278
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,891
Yes, that's right, it's true!

279
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:11,104
Yes, it's a hellish scene of an affair breakup story!

280
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,857
It's a little far from the school district, but in the restaurant...

281
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,734
I'm so pleased...

282
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,505
Okubo-san?

283
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,717
OK?

284
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,760
Ah, Jinguji

285
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,053
His face is blue...

286
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,515
I mean, it's pure white

287
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,809
Is that so?

288
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,978
Is it because I'm fair-skinned?

289
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,856
No no no no no it's too white

290
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,116
What, maybe you waited?

291
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,037
Haha... Is it okay to be worried about something?

292
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,583
Yes, well... Stomach pain caused by stress?

293
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,419
Also, it seems anemia

294
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,378
ah…

295
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,256
Check it out at the hospital once

296
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,134
You've been busy lately

297
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,554
Be sure to go to the hospital

298
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,556
Yeah

299
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,516
If this is good

300
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,770
Sorry, thank you

301
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:38,316
I'll tell the manager, so please take a good rest before you return.

302
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,581
It's a negative effect on children

303
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,686
Thank you for your cooperation today

304
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:01,232
Thank you very much

305
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,655
So, first of all...

306
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,700
that! teacher

307
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,411
Yes Egawa-san

308
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:19,125
I would like to hear that you've been very intrusive...

309
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:23,963
Rumors are spreading that the teacher is currently having an affair

310
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:29,468
It's only a matter of time before the children hear it...

311
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,721
Already in some households...

312
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,849
It also appears to be inside...

313
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,895
I want to hear from the teacher directly...

314
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,401
Okubo-sensei?
