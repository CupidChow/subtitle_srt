1
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,551
Sorry

2
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,972
I was told I'd prepare a futon in the drawing room...

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,644
I said it's fine in Aya's room...

4
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:24,275
Then... right, it's a couple

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,823
We're a couple, aren't we? still

6
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:34,869
What?

7
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,923
Haa...

8
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,449
Huh?

9
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,408
Fill it

10
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,951
I don't like it, why?

11
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,745
It would be nice to sleep side by side

12
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,413
No!

13
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,882
Woo...

14
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,640
Don't be kidding...

15
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,562
sorry

16
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,843
sorry…

17
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:25,604
♪～

18
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:32,570
～♪

19
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,190
Mom, is that okay?

20
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,609
Yeah?

21
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,445
There's something to talk about...

22
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,366
I'm now...

23
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,912
It's about coming back here...

24
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,790
Ah, that's right

25
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,127
I guess there's a translation though-

26
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,214
Isn't it bad to stay away from home forever?

27
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,842
Yes I know

28
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,890
Anyway, I got a call from that mom.

29
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,017
What?!?

30
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,899
Yes... I'm really sorry for the inconvenience this time...

31
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,276
home

32
00:03:55,444 --> 00:04:00,199
What did you mean, really?

33
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,243
We will have a proper discussion

34
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,664
No, this is it

35
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:12,503
I'm sure Ayano has heard a lot about this...

36
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,923
Ah... That's right

37
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,010
I'm really sorry about this time

38
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,805
We all know each other about couples.

39
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,058
Yes, I'm sorry

40
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,811
Yes, excuse me

41
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,774
Haa...

42
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:43,575
Haa... What are you both?

43
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,663
That's how it looks, he can't explain it to his parents properly.

44
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,759
I really hate the house

45
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,226
Sorry for the late explanation

46
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,688
Hehe... well but...

47
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:17,401
Ayano has never talked about herself since ancient times.

48
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,653
Serious is serious

49
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,197
So this time...

50
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,243
I wonder if something really happened, right?

51
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,871
Yeah? Yeah…

52
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,880
actually…

53
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,425
I've got someone I love

54
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,219
To Wataru-kun?

55
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,891
For me... I've got someone I love

56
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,439
That person is a woman

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,031
So I told Wataru to divorce him.

58
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,660
That's why we're separated

59
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:14,124
Ah... haa...

60
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,926
That's right... Yeah

61
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,982
Hey Eri: Has it been a little weird?

62
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,193
Hey!

63
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,031
Huh? Isn't it the same as before?

64
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,782
So, where shall we start?

65
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,045
Huh? No, hmm...

66
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,567
It's it!

67
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,362
It's not good...

68
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,073
It's...

69
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,118
Well...

70
00:08:55,202 --> 00:09:01,416
No good, I can't do anything about this short eyelash!

71
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,199
Ah!

72
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,427
Ah... sorry, keep me waiting

73
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,847
Sorry for calling me suddenly on my day off

74
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,182
Yes, I was free

75
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,644
I thought I really understood the holidays but...

76
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,856
That's because they used our hair salon.

77
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,817
Ah... Yes huh...

78
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,739
Her hairstyle is really good, her hair is so cute that she's good at it, making good use of it

79
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,782
I'll do it Morita

80
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:23,832
Ah... that's why I want you to ask me about it

81
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,543
Ah, yes, what's wrong?

82
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:33,300
About Morita

83
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,345
Huh?

84
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,919
Ah, wait, Eri-chan

85
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:09,836
Ah sorry

86
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,547
Ah... not that

87
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:27,729
Ah... Since then, I've been wearing glasses for a long time...

88
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,359
Yeah

89
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,619
Hehe...

90
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,769
Sorry, it's a troublesome woman

91
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,065
It's fine

92
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,238
I'm used to that kind of girl...

93
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,701
Ah, shall we eat a cake?

94
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,084
Cake yes

95
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,967
Ah... That trash already...

96
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,971
He's good at work but he's a trash as a person

97
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,140
Don't say anything bad!

98
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,104
I mean...

99
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,691
That guy...

100
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,735
That guy, um...

101
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm married...Eri-chan

102
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,714
I know...

103
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,593
Huh?

104
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,680
Haa...

105
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,684
Haha...

106
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,187
but…

107
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,568
I fell in love with it...

108
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,455
The teacher... huh?

109
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,540
Ah, sorry I'm reading a book

110
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,876
It's fine, it's fine, what's wrong?

111
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:06,174
Have you ever been a teacher with a friend...?

112
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,845
There is

113
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,889
There is, even a teacher

114
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,977
Yes, even the teacher was a child...

115
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,982
...I mean, I'm also becoming an adult

116
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,863
My mother too...

117
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,033
I've never played with my close mom

118
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,993
That's right?

119
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,455
So to Mi-chan...

120
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:42,001
Ah, Mie-chan is that mom's child

121
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,796
That kid ignored me somehow

122
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,297
Oh yeah...

123
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,300
What happened to moms...

124
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,224
I can't ask now though...

125
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,227
That's right...

126
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,654
I should apologise too

127
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,868
Hmm...

128
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,413
About letters and to the two of them...

129
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,499
I think you should apologise properly

130
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:28,465
But I don't think there's a need to be able to get along well with Nitta-san.

131
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,439
thank you

132
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,862
Morita: What do you mean?

133
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,991
Huh? Are you still going to talk about that?

134
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,493
Because it's not finished

135
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,163
Eri-chan is an acquaintance, or rather a former neighbor's daughter.

136
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,666
Personally, we're in a relationship that we're interacting with.

137
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,461
No, so I'm not doing anything strange

138
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,129
There's no way you wouldn't do it!

139
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,216
Wow I don't trust it

140
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:16,221
Ah, it's about time I have to prepare for the next customer.

141
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,224
Ah! a little bit…

142
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,683
There probably aren't any reservations available!

143
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,561
No no no, uh, I'm pretty busy

144
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,446
Ah, Okubo-sensei?

145
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,823
yes…

146
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:39,911
Oh, nice to meet you, I'm Yoshizumi Ichika's mother

147
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,873
Nice to meet you, my name is Okubo from Group 2.

148
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,586
Um... I wonder if I could talk about it a little now?

149
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,673
Ah yes yes

150
00:18:54,884 --> 00:19:00,932
Um... I've been talking so much about my teacher lately.

151
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,016
Huh?

152
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,687
I was originally a child who spoke a lot...

153
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:12,151
I've been feeling angry since last year or so, and I've been blocking it

154
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,946
Well, I'm prepared for it around the age

155
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:20,326
I think it'll be even more troublesome in junior high school, hehe...

156
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,295
I wonder if something happened at school...

157
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:36,175
I can somehow imagine that he's guilty of a friend...

158
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,263
What's beyond that...

159
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,811
So... I'm really thankful

160
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,899
Ah, that's... Please raise your face

161
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,990
They didn't explain in detail how to do it...

162
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,950
It wasn't even in the textbooks, right?

163
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:01,910
What? Is that so?

164
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,329
Yes I've seen it before but I haven't seen it yet

165
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,624
I see... Ah, wait, I have to go home soon

166
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,417
Oh, see you bye

167
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,045
See you tomorrow, tomorrow bye

168
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,046
Byeba

169
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,465
Nitta-san

170
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,345
Sorry up until now

171
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,772
Read this if you like

172
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,377
Tomohana

173
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,839
Icca

174
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,811
this

175
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,073
Strange picture

176
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,838
Ah, Akari-san, Ah, oh

177
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,047
Isn't it late than usual today?

178
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,593
Ah, it was an interview, so I wonder if Akari would be better than usual too?

179
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:46,222
Yes, there must be a customer today

180
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,934
Or rather, has there been something good?

181
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,729
Huh? Ah, no...

182
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,148
yes? Hehe...

183
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,567
See you soon

184
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,860
yes

185
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:25,428
What?!? What... What?

186
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,056
What is it? Suddenly

187
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,856
Something old suddenly revived...

188
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:45,531
I also had a friend I like...

189
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,122
My favorite friend...

190
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,124
female?

191
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,419
yes

192
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:07,053
I'm a classmate in high school and we all meet once in a while...

193
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,346
Yeah

194
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,932
Ah, this is a story...

195
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:16,979
I want to hear, let me know, Ayano's old days

196
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,361
Yes, I've never talked about it much...

197
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:02,316
Ah, I'm thinking of going on a female friend...

198
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,572
I really like it

199
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,869
Seriously, what a strike is it?

200
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:21,002
It's hard to say from my point of view...

201
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,006
Me too

202
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,178
Hehe...

203
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,183
Thank you very much

204
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,731
Goo...

205
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:46,777
Please let me get away now, it's a misunderstanding

206
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,571
Don't let it go

207
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:54,160
But Morita-kun is married...

208
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,079
Something strange makes you think that way...

209
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,207
I think it's better not to

210
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,460
See, from a reasonable Yukako, a genuine opinion

211
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,131
You met Eri-chan, knowing how you feel, right?

212
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:12,595
But the affair, really, that's all...

213
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,972
My own daughter...

214
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,433
For women like Morita-kun, for sloppy people...

215
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,312
It's really impossible to think if it gets caught

216
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:29,278
Ah, sorry, sorry to my wife

217
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,366
But that's what adultery means, right?

218
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,204
Well, that's right...

219
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,125
Right...

220
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:31,424
Today... I also want to hear something

221
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,677
What is it?

222
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,809
I'm not at all but...

223
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:46,063
It's not a bang for someone to say something about someone's love

224
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,650
...Because actually...

225
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,863
I'm in the same state as Eri-chan

226
00:26:56,324 --> 00:27:01,704
There's someone I like... She's married

227
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,331
Are you a sister-in-law?

228
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,248
What?!?

229
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,587
Why? Ah...

230
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,422
Ah, somehow

231
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,717
Somehow...?

232
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,843
Yeah…

233
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,851
Morita-san...

234
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,938
What?

235
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:33,944
It was a confirmation of the promise I would meet again

236
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,370
I…

237
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,581
I'll refuse!

238
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,999
Huh?

239
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,587
I'm giving up now...

240
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,854
great

241
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,322
Would you like to do that too, Akari?

242
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,574
Huh?

243
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:28,082
Wouldn't it be better to give up on your sister-in-law?

244
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,211
I think this is a good opportunity

245
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,139
That's right...

246
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,393
Can I call you big brother?

247
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,728
What? What? No!

248
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,107
Woo...

249
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,945
Sorry for the wait, this is the hamburger set

250
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,659
Please take your time

251
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,625
I don't know if they'll come later but...

252
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,753
I also called my sister-in-law

253
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,228
First of all, why is Eri?

254
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,357
I guess I know a lot...

255
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,736
I understand so I'm talking about my brothers

256
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,532
About divorce...

257
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,868
It's like divorce...

258
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,080
About my sister-in-law and Juri

259
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,963
Is it mom...

260
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,091
Ah... no, that

261
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:07,389
That's what I meant to confess...

262
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,476
Huh?

263
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,481
Um... it's the flow of the story...

264
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:19,860
I was asked to ask her for advice from someone from Akari's workplace.

265
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,242
What? What does that mean?

266
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,787
Is it a hairdresser?

267
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,080
yes

268
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,209
Do you want to be a hairdresser?

269
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,586
Not...

270
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:43,676
I guess I fell in love with the person there...

271
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,721
Right... Is that so...

272
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,017
What, but why...

273
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,979
Will the flow be a bit of a conversation about you and your wife?

274
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,647
it is…

275
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,946
Someone I fell in love with...

276
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,783
Because I was married

277
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,461
What are you hearing about...

278
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,174
You said it, didn't you?

279
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,303
Nothing will happen in the past, or in the future

280
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,139
It's going crazy!

281
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,983
I was forced to get divorced by my wife and I was separated to create that achievement...

282
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,487
At my parents' house, my mother slams me on the ass and tells me not to give up...

283
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:51,035
Furthermore, even her younger sister has a desire to have an affair...

284
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,290
Are there only the main characters or something around me?

285
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,179
Do you want to hear about how my wife and I are all about?

286
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,975
I was suddenly told about you

287
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,855
That's what I was trying to do, and my wife...

288
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,486
Do you know how humiliating it is?

289
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,954
No, it's no use telling you

290
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,666
It's the wife who's the wrong person, so you have to tell her

291
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:45,297
Ah... Big brother calm down, calm down

292
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,426
I'm calm

293
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,398
It's fine now

294
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,067
Broke everything...

295
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:09,196
So it's fine for the two to be happy.

296
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,368
Let's get divorced
