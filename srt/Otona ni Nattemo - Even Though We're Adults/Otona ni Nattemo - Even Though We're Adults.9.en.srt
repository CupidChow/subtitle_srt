1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:04,922
You said it, didn't you?

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,759
Nothing will happen in the past, or in the future

3
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,721
It's going crazy!

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,144
Are there only the main characters or something around me?

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,108
I was suddenly told about you

6
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:29,029
That's what I was trying to do, and my wife...

7
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,702
Do you know how humiliating it is?

8
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,795
It's fine now

9
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,548
Broke everything...

10
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,510
So it's fine for the two to be happy.

11
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,849
Let's get divorced

12
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,628
Ah, that's good

13
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,559
… It's been a while

14
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,686
you're welcome

15
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,399
I can meet again in a place like this

16
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,652
It's true

17
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:02,331
Are you working at an after-school club now?

18
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,084
Yes, at the Art Festa...

19
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,546
I was also in charge of the children's club.

20
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,133
To be honest, I'm pushing it with my mother's connections

21
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,886
I see

22
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,264
Ah but...

23
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,269
It's becoming more enjoyable to interact with the kids

24
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,897
For now, I'll try my best anyway

25
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,567
it was good

26
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,868
After that, who is Juri?

27
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,415
I haven't seen you since that day

28
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,042
What...

29
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,424
I mean, I contacted you a little later.

30
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,975
The phone number you sent is...

31
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:07,563
Due to customer reasons, we are temporarily unable to make calls

32
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,817
I hadn't thought about what I was going to say but...

33
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,904
For now, I want to hear my voice

34
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,659
But it's no longer connected...

35
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,624
I wonder what you're doing now

36
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:48,270
♪～

37
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:55,319
～♪

38
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:12,795
Nn...

39
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,047
Have you woke up? good morning

40
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,507
good morning

41
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,051
fault? Hehe...

42
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,389
Juri's hair smells nice

43
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,975
Hehe...

44
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,686
Do you want to eat something?

45
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,521
i want to eat

46
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,523
Wait a minute, yes

47
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,779
Nn...

48
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,825
Ah... But even so, I only have eggs

49
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,370
Was there rice?

50
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,414
No rice?

51
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,957
none

52
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,129
Ah, there's no rice, but... if it's Mozuku

53
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,797
That's fine, so

54
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,259
I'll do it

55
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,012
Ah...

56
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,725
Can I use this as a fried egg?

57
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,101
nice!

58
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,858
Wow! I'm doing it with one hand

59
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,861
Cool!

60
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,487
Well

61
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,281
Hmm... It's good

62
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,671
Yoshizumi-san, please keep me waiting

63
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,096
What are you writing?

64
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,808
Ehehehe... uh, my mother

65
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,228
Wow

66
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,857
Huh... what? this

67
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:01,612
The other day, your mother hasn't cleaned up your room and you're getting mad

68
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,447
I was watching that behind me...

69
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,700
A little later, my mother said in a small voice

70
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,703
“Huh... well…”

71
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:10,996
…hand!

72
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:43,028
Ah, I was really pleased with my class Okubo-sensei

73
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,323
There's no class change in 5-6 years.

74
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,284
It was really difficult, I couldn't do it

75
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,702
Is that so?

76
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,943
It's always the same

77
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,820
Welcome home now

78
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,446
Oh it's been a while!

79
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,491
Do you eat dinner? Huh? Ah, I'll eat it

80
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,576
Ah!

81
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,828
You drink beer, right? Ah yes

82
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,580
What about souvenirs? souvenir!

83
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,415
I've tried so hard to find it and bought it

84
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,417
Yay! yes

85
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,838
Ah, please give it a moment after you and the others

86
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,798
Dad, this is a bit

87
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,509
So let's eat quickly haa...

88
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,220
You're tired, you'll drink? Ah thank you

89
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,141
Huh? What about Eri?

90
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,059
I just went to my room

91
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,563
Has that started again?

92
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,274
Are you working properly? That guy...

93
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,234
I'm trying my best

94
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,903
Isn't it just that you don't want to see your face?

95
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,405
Haha... it's noisy

96
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,781
Yes yes yes toast

97
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,366
Oh... tired

98
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,743
Thank you, tired

99
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,455
It's tasty, where is this?

100
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,665
I've got a new place in front of the station...

101
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:31,345
I don't know what to make every day hahahaha...

102
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,931
But, Mom's stew is superb

103
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,225
Ahahaha...

104
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,814
...I wonder if I should drink it? Unlocked

105
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,568
Hmm...

106
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:06,171
Do you have a refill? There is... Hehehehe...

107
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,257
I love you dad

108
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,616
Woo...

109
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,426
Juri-san, yeah?

110
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,262
I'm fine with it

111
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,640
And... huh?

112
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,902
This is the menu

113
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,415
Yeah? Did you like the other shops?

114
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,335
Ah no, it's absolutely delicious

115
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,546
That's right, I love you, and come here often

116
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,964
Wow

117
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,655
What should I do?

118
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,782
Are you hungry?

119
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,201
Yes, I'm really into it too

120
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,255
Eh... hey, you eat salad, right?

121
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,173
Yeah

122
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,259
And then... Bruschetta

123
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,011
Oh good

124
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,473
What will you do, Akari? Do you want to go for a lot of curry?

125
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,815
What does gelato taste like?

126
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,858
I'll show you the menu too, yeah

127
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,447
Ah, are there pizza and pasta too? What should I do?

128
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,865
If it's pasta, homemade pasta too...

129
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:44,996
And I had such a funny dream, but when I woke up I forgot

130
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,623
There is

131
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:52,129
It's sad or frustrating to forget about it

132
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,090
I remember that the moment I woke up was so vivid...

133
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,467
It's falling off

134
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:03,348
So even when I thought I had woken up, I was still asleep...

135
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:10,063
I wonder if a dream was to have clear memories in the first place.

136
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,565
I see

137
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:19,072
Yes, but I've forgotten what it's like, but I just can't remember that my ex-girlfriend was there.

138
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,242
So maybe it's sad

139
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,619
Oh, do you still feel uneasy?

140
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,538
There is, there is so!

141
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,291
Hmm... I got dumped...

142
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,962
Is Akari the type who changes things up quite smoothly?

143
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,675
I…

144
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,101
What! I wish we could meet

145
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,728
No, I can't meet

146
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,939
Are you divorced, right? I wish we could meet!

147
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,275
why? Guilt?

148
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,737
Well, that's true but...

149
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,198
I don't know if they're divorced or not in the first place.

150
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,699
There's no way to check

151
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,744
Also, I deleted my contact details...

152
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,499
Well, if you're divorced...

153
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,792
It's not a divorce for our future...

154
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:18,006
I wonder if she was divorced to break away from her past...

155
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,675
What's the difficult thing you're saying?

156
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,219
Huh?

157
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,845
I'll go see you then

158
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:24,888
Where?

159
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,307
Isn't it at school? Where did that person work?

160
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,852
If you wait in front of the school gate, you'll leave soon

161
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,729
Huh!? No no

162
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,023
What if an unrelated adult wandered around in front of elementary school...

163
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,066
It's probably a report case

164
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,692
That's fine!

165
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,446
Let's act like a parent and stand proudly

166
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:46,034
No... No no...

167
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,287
One person came out and it was a bit suspicious...

168
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,498
No no, look, look, look, look, look?

169
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,959
Because there's no one else...

170
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,965
What...

171
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,311
It's been a while

172
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,732
Really

173
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:24,155
Ah... uh...

174
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,327
Ah, this girl is that she's dating now

175
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,330
Huh!? What?

176
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:39,004
Ah... Is that so?

177
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,672
No, it's not...

178
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,592
I'm in a hurry today so I'm sorry

179
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,692
No, seriously, what kind of bug is it?

180
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,612
I don't know, me too...

181
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,950
I thought I had to say something so I quickly said it

182
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,287
Sorry I used it

183
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,249
It's good, it's interesting

184
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,630
Hey, I'm interested in Juri and others.

185
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:22,672
Huh?

186
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,551
This girl is the girlfriend I'm dating now

187
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,016
It would be fine if it was all a dream

188
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,873
Huh?

189
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,501
what? this

190
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,980
This address...

191
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:07,402
Oh, right? Let's exchange addresses, right?

192
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,112
Ayano is busy too...

193
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,990
I often go out for some reason

194
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:12,991
I agree

195
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,451
Hehe...

196
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,661
Umm...

197
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,373
Huh? Ayano-chan, yes, yes

198
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,833
I wonder how to do this...

199
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,467
Sorry for the wait Ayano

200
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,885
Hey, do a bit

201
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,686
thank you

202
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,230
Thank you very much, I'll be waiting for you again

203
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,495
What?!?

204
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,791
What kind of noise are you making? what happened?

205
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,045
No, I just got an unconventional nomination

206
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,173
Isn't that unusual?

207
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,855
Wooo...

208
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,617
It's ridiculous what are you doing?

209
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,829
Cancel Cancel

210
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,335
Haa...

211
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,382
I don't know...

212
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,183
Ah, it's been cancelled...

213
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:35,133
Sorry Nitta-san, call me suddenly

214
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,345
I want to hear about Yoshizumi-san.

215
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,933
No, not at all

216
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,020
I mean, I wanted the teacher to ask...

217
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:51,733
What? Is that so? Sorry, please refrain from doing anything strange...

218
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:04,495
I said it to Yoshizumi-san

219
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,667
Don't talk to Tomoka and me anymore

220
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,384
Yoshizumi-san apologized, but...

221
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:24,307
I really hate what I did for Tomoka and me

222
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,271
But I was holding back because they were friends with Tomoka.

223
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:37,153
But Tomoka says she wants to get along with me and Yoshizumi again...

224
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,365
I thought I'd no more

225
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,704
I see...

226
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,180
It's not like it didn't exist...

227
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,071
welcome

228
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,746
What...

229
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:21,716
