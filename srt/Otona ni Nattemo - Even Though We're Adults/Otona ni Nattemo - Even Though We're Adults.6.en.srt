1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,171
(Hirayama Akari) I'm sure...

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,592
I think I like Ayano

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,555
(Okubo Ayano) Yes

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:16,851
So...

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,650
I want to avoid meeting anymore...

6
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,615
Woo...

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,874
Sometimes I meet and talk

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,296
Even if we continue to be friends like this...

9
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,967
I think I'm lucky if I can be by my side...

10
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,891
I was thinking that such a love might be fine

11
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:03,856
but…

12
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,359
I can't do it anymore

13
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,946
I've gotten unable to

14
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,036
We are adults

15
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:21,832
If I'm nearby I'll be looking for progress...

16
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,920
So...

17
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,216
Try not to meet face to face as much as possible

18
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,598
But the distance is too close now to break

19
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,312
However, you can't move right away

20
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:51,612
Even when I see Ayano, I call out to him...

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,157
I won't do that

22
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,996
(Nagase Tomoka) Ah, it was

23
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,049
(Nitta Manatsu) Ah, haven't you finished talking?

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,259
I'm off in the middle of summer

25
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,015
teacher! That's a bit nice now...

26
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,355
What...

27
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,691
Ah... yes

28
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,694
Sorry, what?

29
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:36,323
(Midsummer) Ah... uh... nothing

30
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,118
Excuse me

31
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,036
(Speed ​​off)

32
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,248
(Midsummer) Let's go after all (Tomoka) What?

33
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:49,044
What, what? what happened? Hey, what's wrong? Hey

34
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,677
The teacher is crying too

35
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:06,061
I see, teacher too...

36
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,494
<朱里さんは なんで 私の気持ちは
聞いてくれなかったんだろう>

37
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:29,543
<現状を打破したい
そのことばかり考えてしまう>

38
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,928
39

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,769
♪～

40
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,692
～♪

41
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,617
(Okubo Yoriko) Wow it looks delicious (Okubo Eri) Amazing

42
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,535
(Eri) It's asparagus (Yoko) That's right

43
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:07,122
Hmm... Wow

44
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,418
(Okubo Wataru) Now (Yoko) Welcome back Oh, in a good place

45
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,586
(Wataru) Amazing feast

46
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,090
Hehehe... our house launch, shall we eat?

47
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,257
(Wataru) Yes

48
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,512
Oh, that's the event today

49
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,848
Huh? What about Aya?

50
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,811
He's down on top, he worked the most today, that kid

51
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,230
He also took part in a mini marathon

52
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:37,069
(Wataru) What? It's a store fight? Why again?

53
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,198
With the person in question

54
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,324
(Slap sound)

55
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,629
Woo...

56
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,126
Haa...

57
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,297
Nn...

58
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,429
Ah... Sorry Eri-chan, did you wake me up?

59
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,058
No, I've been awake all the time

60
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:55,105
Ayano-san, aren't you hungry?

61
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:00,444
Ah... I think that's actually a bit of a pain

62
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,285
That's not too light... pizza is frozen so if you like

63
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,621
Thank you good night

64
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,289
good night

65
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,880
(The sound of the door opening)

66
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,510


67
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,412
(Wataru) At this time

68
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,999
(Ayano) Ah... I got hungry when I woke up

69
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,710
(Wataru) Good job

70
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,589
I'm going to eat a slice too

71
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,675
(Ayano) Ah, I'll do it

72
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,762
(Wataru) Ah... thank you

73
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:09,888
(Ayano) Yes

74
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,076
Why did you run a mini marathon?

75
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,705
(Ayano) Ah... on behalf of my fellow teacher.

76
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,880
Is that really just that?

77
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,677
(The sound of opening the microwave oven)

78
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,306
(The sound of closing the door)

79
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,891
(The sound of pressing the button)

80
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,644
Isn't Hirayama the deciding factor?

81
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,278
Is that so?

82
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,783
It's not that I had a desire to run together...

83
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,039
There were a lot of people I didn't know, so I might have felt a sense of security

84
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,166
Hmm...

85
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,802
(Signal sound)

86
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,262
(The sound of opening the microwave oven)

87
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,516
(Wataru) Thank you (Ayano) Yes

88
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,779
Will we separate?

89
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,573
Huh?

90
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,789
My brother-in-law is...

91
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,627
Apparently, overseas assignments are decided to go on a single person.

92
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,631
That's why my sister wants to come back here with her child.

93
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,721
After all, don't we live alone?

94
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:22,688
(Ayano) That's right, it's tough

95
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,870
97

96
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,415


97
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,548
Also, I... I'm going to go to the hospital after all.

98
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:58,307
I wanted a child but I put off

99
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:08,650
(Water Sound)

100
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,986
(Water Sound)

101
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,362
Aya?

102
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:18,452
(Water Sound)

103
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:24,499
If that's the case... I shouldn't have just removed the previous apartment.

104
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,590
Because the situation was different from that time

105
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,763
(Water Sound)

106
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,975
(Water Sound)

107
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,234
Haa...

108
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:03,497
(Ringtone)

109
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,499
Sorry if that's the case

110
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,169
Um... I'd like to ask you to make a reservation for your consultation.

111
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,129
yes

112
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:15,258
Ah... Divorce consultation

113
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,637
Ah yes as soon as possible...

114
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,182
Ah... it's a divorce

115
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,726
Ah, um...

116
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,729
If you're busy, I'll change the date again...

117
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,855
(Cancel sound)

118
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,943
Haa...

119
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,324
Ha!? Professor Okamura!

120
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,493
(Okamura Sayaka) I've heard it

121
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,496
Okubo Sensei: Are you going to get divorced?

122
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,253
Ah, sorry, I went into private

123
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:55,757
No, it's my fault for calling somewhere like this

124
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,470
When I asked for pinch hitters for the mini marathon...

125
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,806
Perhaps it was a really difficult time?

126
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,059
Ah, no no, yesterday, today, it's not what started --

127
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,271
It has been stagnant for a long time

128
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,066
Oh! That's more troublesome

129
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,111
...So, would you like to consult a lawyer about divorce?

130
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,197
Yes... but...

131
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:24,786
I'm not sure if I'll introduce you to someone I know.

132
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,832
My older brother's childhood friend and I speak town in my hometown.

133
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,774
(Hongami Shigeru) Please

134
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,111
Sorry it's a bit messy

135
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,697
Our home and office

136
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,494
(Ayano) No, sorry, this is the first time I've seen it...

137
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,955
I was nervous about where to start

138
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,541
(Shigeru) It's almost the first time you all.

139
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,503
First, relax with tea

140
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,678
Um... what kind of consultation will you all be asking?

141
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,474
Everyone has their own differences, but in terms of divorce...

142
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,937
Domestic violence, moral harassment, debt, adultery

143
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,814
Something that people around you can't easily let out

144
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,900
Because you're holding it

145
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,195
Some people start crying because their emotions are high

146
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,740
Some people just talk and go home

147
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,785
We attorneys have a duty of confidentiality.

148
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,328
rest assured

149
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,717
I've got the person I love...

150
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,848
That's why I started thinking about divorce.

151
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:09,975
(Shigeru) Yes

152
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:17,983
But that has happened for a long time

153
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:25,865
(Ayano) My husband and I wanted a child...

154
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,286
It wasn't going well

155
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,038
(Ayano) Wataru-kun

156
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,584
Is there no time tonight?

157
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,960
(Wataru) Yes?

158
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,754
I want to talk about the hospital

159
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,426
(Wataru) No, is it a little late today? Can you talk now?

160
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,846
Yes, it's fine again

161
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,972
(Wataru) Yes

162
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,601
Take care

163
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,227
(Wataru) I'm coming

164
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,520
(The sound of the door closing)

165
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:04,029
If it's not good, will we accept the path of living together?

166
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,948
What will you do about your future policy?

167
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,702
There may not be an answer...

168
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,874
We should have gone all out as a couple.

169
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,172
It's become so troublesome

170
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:29,387
I'm tired of looking at my complexion

171
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,683
At times like that...

172
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,230
(Ayano) Business trip? Also?

173
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,525
(Wataru) Yes, this time it's not that long

174
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,819
(Ayano) Looks like he's been busy lately

175
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,405
(Wataru) Yes... Ah, thank you

176
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:55,121
So what if Aya-chan returns to her parents' house for a while?

177
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,083
I'll be alone at home while I'm away

178
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,668
Huh?

179
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,089
(Wataru) No, I used to visit my parents' house often for a while.

180
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,473
(Ayano)

181
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,518
<ちょっと
ゴタゴタしてたころだったから…>

182
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,856
(Ayano) Today...

183
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,609
I have time

184
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,489
(Doorbell)

185
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,040
Did you come from that far?

186
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:55,390
Maybe he just mistook a sense of openness for love

187
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,603
(cry)

188
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,897
If you like me too...

189
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,526
Take responsibility until the end

190
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,405
I miss you

191
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,908
Come and meet me...

192
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:21,666
(Juri's cry)

193
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,835
So...

194
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,801
I want to avoid meeting anymore...

195
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,227
nevertheless…

196
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,900
It's the first time I've felt that way

197
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,153
(cry)

198
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:57,535
I thought I shouldn't cheat

199
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,085
(cry)

200
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,219
(Entrance door opening and closing sound)

201
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,806
(Wataru) Now (Ayano) Welcome home

202
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,974
(Ayano) Wataru-kun (Wataru) Yes?

203
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,520
Maybe a bit nice?

204
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,359
(Wataru) Yes

205
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:35,198
I was thinking about going back to my parents' house for a while

206
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,955
why?

207
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,626
I want to leave this and think about it a little

208
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,631
I want to tell my mother-in-law now

209
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,648
Huh!? What is it? To get out

210
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,734
sorry

211
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,446
But I can't leave without permission

212
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,449
(Yoko) That's right!

213
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:27,208
what? Was he also progressing with the woman he was cheating on?

214
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,461
(Ayano) That's what inspired me, but...

215
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:35,550
I actually realized that my relationship had broken down even before that.

216
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:41,973
(Yoko) Lies It's probably because they thought that they were at a disadvantage if they were infidelity.

217
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,643
That's too late now... a silly person!

218
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,981
(Eri)

219
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,526


220
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:02,911
It's true that I fell in love with Juri-san...

221
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:07,123
I don't want to be vague, I'd rather be clear

222
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,294
that's why! You guys... Come on...

223
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,673
Still, that... it's like a play

224
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:19,093
If you're stupid, divorce or separation,

225
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,929
Every single one...

226
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,889
First, what will happen to Eri?

227
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,768
(Ayano) What... Eri-chan... is that?

228
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,188
(Yoko) Eri is now an important time

229
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,649
If you're a school teacher, you know?

230
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,234
Eri hasn't recovered yet... (The sound of the door opening)

231
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,406
(The sound of pressing the coffee maker button)

232
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,245
(The sound of pressing the button)

233
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:51,834
(Coffee extraction sound)

234
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,091
(Electronic Sound)

235
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,599
(The sound of the door closing)

236
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:12,772
(Yoko) What you're asking now... do you think you've been asked?

237
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,400
(Ayano) What do you think...

238
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,072
What is "still"?

239
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,996
What is it like "I haven't recovered"?

240
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,630
Was it Kaede? My little sister

241
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,215
yes

242
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,677
(Yoko) That's good, excellent

243
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:47,140
It's not like Kaede was smooth sailing too...

244
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,475
(Yoko) Is that so?

245
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:55,023
That's right, when I was in high school, there was a time when I was refusing...

246
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,572
So? Did you drop out of high school too?

247
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,326
(Ayano) Ah, yes, do you want to hear something from Eri?

248
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,500
There's no way Eri could tell me anything

249
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,338
I became a shut-in after being refusal...

250
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,509
I even dropped out of high school...

251
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,015
Are you very independent now? That's amazing

252
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,602
Isn't it good? If you go back to such a splendid house

253
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,114
(Juri) It's no good (Kahoki Yukako) Doesn't it seem like it's impossible?

254
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,201
(Juri) It's harder to find a single person this year...

255
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,411
I thought you could let me stay for a while

256
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,372
It's like I'm looking for endangered species

257
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,125
(Yukako) If I was single

258
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,669
I'm not going to your house at all

259
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,090
(Yukako) Hahahaha... That's terrible

260
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,508
(Juri) Haa...

261
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,054
Is there just my parents' house?

262
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:14,018
It's tough to get back home after a broken heart this year

263
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,854
(Yukako) Hmm... I think so though-

264
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:20,608
You won't be able to be there emotionally

265
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,235
(Juri) What?

266
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,530
(Yukako) Because you said you wouldn't see me anymore, right?

267
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,948
(Juri) That's right

268
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,282
(Yukako) So maybe...

269
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,835
(Yoko) What about Ayano?

270
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,629
(Wataru) I was still ready

271
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,509
I've heard, what are you going to do about the separation?

272
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,679
(Wataru) I haven't admitted it yet

273
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,140
(Yoko) What are you saying carefree things!

274
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,268
If they were forced through, they would get even more chaotic!?

275
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,978
What is it?!

276
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,606
When Ayano returns to her parents' house, go and come over.

277
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,109
I'll meet the woman alone, what should I do?

278
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,113
I'll show up to that house with all my heart!

279
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,158
You're not at all bad!

280
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,410
Rather, he is a victim!

281
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,830
Do you understand?

282
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,959
(Yoko) Now let's eat

283
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,340
(Sigh)

284
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,443
(Midsummer) Okubo Sensei

285
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,913
(Ayano) Please

286
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,509
(Ayano's sigh)

287
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,513
Also…

288
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:21,646
I really know the culprit of this letter

289
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:26,442
(Tomoka) But when I told the teacher...

290
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,947
Teacher, I thought I might tell everyone

291
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,323
That

292
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,911
She was a good friend of Tomoka until her fourth grade.

293
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,582
But along the way, Manuka and Tomoka became friends

294
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,045
I think midsummer is a pain for that child...

295
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,882
I think that's why I hate you

296
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,763
(Midsummer) If that's the case then, it's fine, but...

297
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,184
But that's not all

298
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,688
I read Minaka and Tomoka's exchange diary

299
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:10,111
I'm writing a diary, or rather a story

300
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:15,116
Maybe reading that made me feel sick

301
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,954
I wonder if they're doing something like blackmail...

302
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,418
(Tomoka) That diary... I brought it

303
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,922
(Tomoka) I'll leave it to the teacher

304
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,968
What? Are you giving it to me?

305
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,094
good?

306
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,101
If Tomoka is good, it's fine

307
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:46,522
(Ayano) That... I can't take care of such important things.

308
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,941
I think I'll read it if I have it

309
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:54,155
(Tomoka) I want you to read it! Because it's our masterpiece

310
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:58,534
(Ayano) Such a serious responsibility...

311
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,165
(Tomoka, Midsummer) Thank you

312
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,461
(Ayano) Ah...

313
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,924
