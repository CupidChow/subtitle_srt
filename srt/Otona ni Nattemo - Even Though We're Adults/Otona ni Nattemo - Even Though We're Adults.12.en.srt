～♪

3
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,020
Is it really good?

4
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,814
Is Ayano-chan okay?

5
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:26,152
Yes we... Let's finish it now

6
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,072
Stopping is the end

7
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:33,784
I want to live together in the future

8
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,415
Because it's always necessary

9
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,501
Even tomorrow, it's always

10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:52,595
Hello, welcome

11
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:59,059
2LDK... and facing south...

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,771
It's a room on the second floor or above

13
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:02,897
yes

14
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,402
Um... your family?

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,404
yes?

16
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,241
Ah, um, are you two sisters?

17
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,576
home

18
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,369
Ah...

19
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,542
It's just friends

20
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,796
There are some landlords who don't like it

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,091
I wonder if I'll find it...

22
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,852
Are you going out? What about the rice?

23
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,148
I'll eat it

24
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,692
Where?

25
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,862
Where is...

26
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,241
It's appropriate

27
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,204
With someone?

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,415
I don't know, just right

29
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,253
Come on, take care!

30
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,110
Okubo

31
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,236
Yeah?

32
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,155
Do you have time today? night

33
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,992
At night... like eating dinner?

34
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,618
That's right

35
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,579
If you like, two

36
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,584
Perhaps the couple's problem...

37
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,793
yes!

38
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:51,255
Finally, I got what I got and got divorced.

39
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,381
Haa...

40
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,550
Well, strictly speaking...

41
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,595
There's still a bit more to do, though...

42
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,014
It's sunny and I'm single now

43
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,686
He said he should go drinking

44
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,063
That's right, huh...

45
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,905
Are you serious?

46
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,907
Do you not?

47
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,408
no…

48
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:23,913
Ah, no, of course, this "no" right now is not that kind of thing

49
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,998
Um... huh...

50
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,708
I'd love to

51
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,715
Yes huh huh...

52
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,593
Why don't you go? For two

53
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,637
Oh, it's a lot of weight, so let's all go together

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,221
Isn't it more fun to go together?

55
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,389
Maybe this will stick more...

56
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,391
Why do you say that?

57
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,309
Look at the cracks...

58
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,727
Eh, let's scream and ride

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,520
Screams Isn't it better to ride it closer?

60
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,980
Naoki screams don't you hate it?

61
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,317
Haha... is it okay? It's not scary if you ride together!

62
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,363
I loved humans originally

63
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,991
Bullying, school refusal...

64
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,619
There must be where there are but...

65
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,330
I feel like I'm not related to myself

66
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:11,001
Wow, it was smooth sailing

67
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,427
Ah...

68
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,471
sorry

69
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,432
I'll give it one job

70
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:47,538
One day, I suddenly couldn't do my best

71
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,791
If I go to school... What?

72
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,292
Ah, sorry, wait a minute

73
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:56,255
I have friends but I want to meet you...

74
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,465
Something...

75
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,927
I can't get up physically...

76
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,433
I didn't want to do anything

77
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,149
Ah, I know something

78
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,027
I feel like I'll be left behind

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,738
My time remains stopped

80
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,867
That's right

81
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,624
that…

82
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,087
Is it early tomorrow morning?

83
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,177
Uuuu, slowly

84
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,445
She was probably my mother and my wife...

85
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,697
I can't say it's a good match

86
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,829
But I... pretended not to see

87
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:18,087
That's how I've avoided...

88
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,382
He's the man who tried to fail in marriage

89
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,761
I'm not gonna...

90
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:30,849
yes

91
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,851
Ah, not!

92
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,855
You're not saying anything bad about your wife at all?

93
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:42,361
No... I can reflect on it as much as I can with words

94
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,739
Even if there is a problem with Okubo-san...

95
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,909
There's no good reason to cheat

96
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,331
I'm thinking my ex-husband should go to hell

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,341
Ah... ha... you're such a nasty woman

98
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,850
Jinguji is a cool person

99
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,311
The person who made me think I'm not good is the fault

100
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,693
I think so...

101
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,992
If we're both of you, we can be encouraging

102
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,120
Really huh huh...

103
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,505
After this, the second one...

104
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,716
Ah...

105
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,511
I have a little bit of work left...

106
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,972
I'm going home today Sorry

107
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,641
No, I understand

108
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,769
Don't get too far again

109
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,397
Yes huh...

110
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,065
Shall we eat it?

111
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,400
Ah...

112
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,237
delicious

113
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,288
Well, it was good to be the last real estate agent.

114
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,750
Yes, we both hope to live together.

115
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,002
You respond sincerely

116
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,714
Oh, I especially like it here

117
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,799
Ah the sun was the best

118
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,260
I want to put a sofa that looks good

119
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,429
Yes, I'll go and see it next time

120
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
yes

121
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,686
what's wrong?

122
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,650
No, that...

123
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,694
again…

124
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,031
I'm trying to tell you that I love you

125
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,369
Ah... thank you

126
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,829
Hehe...

127
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,876
Ayano-chan once again...

128
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,922
Will you become my lover?

129
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,758
Of course

130
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:15,389
Juri should be my lover

131
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,267
Ahhh...

132
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,810
Haha...

133
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,894
I'm now

134
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,064
There are so many things I want to try with Juri.

135
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,819
Even spending your daily shopping with some plans...

136
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,364
I'm very excited about that kind of thing

137
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,367
Hehe...

138
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,264
Ah... Moving?

139
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,979
Ah, it's difficult to go to from home at a new school?

140
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,108
Yes, that's true but... yes

141
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,321
I was trying to live with the person I was talking to before.

142
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,421
It's good to be a guarantor...

143
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,257
Well, it's fine

144
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,886
I'll write it when Dad comes back

145
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,638
thank you

146
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,982
So I'll get my sister's room

147
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,150
Huh?

148
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:55,238
Actually, I'm thinking of getting married and living here

149
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,448
What...

150
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,910
What? Married!? With whom?

151
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,662
The one who's dating now

152
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,207
It's quite long

153
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,585
Eh... I didn't know

154
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,045
Hehe...

155
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,923
That little Kaede...

156
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,468
I'm over 30 already

157
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,514
Hehehehe... Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

158
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,977
I couldn't say that until now...

159
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,398
Because I was in trouble...

160
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,818
Hmm... well...

161
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,945
Are you trying to live here too?

162
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:35,946
Huh?

163
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,990
Thinking about us in the future...

164
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,368
Ah...

165
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,497
I can't help but understand what I'm worried about...

166
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,915
It's not

167
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,752
Living together is his hope

168
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,297
It seems he originally wanted to be a single-family home.

169
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,552
He was saying, "Would you like to find a detached house-type maisonette?"

170
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,679
Rather, it's super lucky

171
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,264
Is that so?

172
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,852
I…

173
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:12,566
I'm grateful to my sister about all the things I've had up until now...

174
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,861
It's not for my sister

175
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,323
I'll do what I want to do

176
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,660
If anything happens to the house, I'll rely on you properly.

177
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,538
Yes I want it

178
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,417
My sister is

179
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,214
There is also support for paying money without saying a word.

180
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,049
Hehe...

181
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,098
Hehehe...

182
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,262
that…

183
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,848
electricity…

184
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,104
It's already dark enough but...

185
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,441
Anyway...

186
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,485
Ah...

187
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,821
Yeah

188
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,755
Haa... That's it...

189
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,597
Wow!

190
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,559
I was surprised what are you doing?

191
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,814
Mom?

192
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,360
Ah, welcome back

193
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,780
There's stew in the pot, let's heat it up

194
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,947
Ah, no...

195
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,157
Don't you need it?

196
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,621
No, I'll eat, thank you

197
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,683
Haa...

198
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,145
Haa...

199
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:31,324
Ah, I might want to eat toast and bacon and eggs

200
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,577
So shall we have a morning somewhere?

201
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,329
Ah, that's good

202
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,669
I also love Croc Monsieur...

203
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,712
Hmm...

204
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,590
Morita-san?

205
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,594
Huh?

206
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,431
Why here?

207
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,563
Ah... That here...

208
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,357
It's Mizuki, my wife

209
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,070
nice to meet you

210
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:14,367
I know most of the relationship between the two of them.

211
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,454
What's your name?

212
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,711
I'm Okubo Eri

213
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,300
Let's exchange contact details

214
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,136
What...

215
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,031
Okubo Sensei!

216
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,888
Okubo Sensei

217
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,348
yes

218
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,604
Well!

219
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,399
Thank you Okubo-sensei!

220
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,152
Wow! Did everyone prepare it?!

221
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,071
thank you!

222
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,323
Great success! Yes, that's good!

223
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,829
That's right, we're about to go before the farewell party...

224
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,498
I'm thinking of filling up a time capsule in the park

225
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,751
Wow, time capsules are wonderful!

226
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,004
But I can't decide if I'll include Ikka at all, right?

227
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,800
Because I can't keep important things away

228
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,801
surely

229
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,594
Because it's always necessary

230
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,972
Even tomorrow, forever!

231
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,395
Okay!

232
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,564
Well, sensei, see you later!

233
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,066
See you later! At another farewell party

234
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,818
Thank you for the flowers

235
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,735
Yes!

236
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,445
So, shall we go? Let's go

237
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,197
Ahhh that was good

238
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,367
Please come to the farewell party, Teacher!

239
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,618
Come here!

240
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,196
Goodbye Okubo Sensei

241
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,266
Haa... Huh...

242
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,770
Hehe...

243
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,399
Can I take all of these out and line them up?

244
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,443
Ah, thank you Kaede

245
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,694
no

246
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,038
Thank you for your hard work

247
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,416
Oh! Akane nice timing thank you

248
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,001
Sorry for the trouble

249
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,212
My sister is here today too

250
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,129
Ah Kaede

251
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,007
Here, Akane Kuon

252
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,021
Nice to meet you, this is Kaede, Ayano's younger sister

253
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,692
Ah... Nice to meet you

254
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,742
what? Did you get it?

255
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,494
Very type

256
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,038
Ah, I brought it by mistake...

257
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,498
An electric blanket? Yeah

258
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,792
I'll get it cute

259
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,004
I'm newlywed so buy a new one

260
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,423
Newlywed?

261
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,718
You need to hold as much as possible where you can hold it

262
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,471
Is it a broken heart from near the night?

263
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,807
Don't put it into words

264
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,601
Ah, already...

265
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,771
I'll also use this as a movie topic someday...

266
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,983
Oh, that's the director!

267
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,527
One day, make it a hilarious scene

268
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,197
No, I'm laughing a little now

269
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,866
Eh, everyone

270
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,119
Goal: Finish the living room by lunchtime.

271
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,288
I'll have tempura soba for delivery!

272
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,458
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

273
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,625
Okay, then... Let's do our best

274
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,294
Let's do our best, please!

275
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,756
What should I help...

276
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,729
Kaede-chan is such a good girl

277
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,856
That's right

278
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:08,930
Hey

279
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,767
Can I do more than kiss?

280
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,148
My experience points are low...

281
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:24,445
I often say that, even though I kissed her for the first time

282
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,616
Desire is amazing

283
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,618
Right!

284
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,622
I awakened Ayano, who was sleeping

285
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,040
Hehe...

286
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,876
Hehe... a sexy teacher

287
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,129
yes

288
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,409
In all my places...

289
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,661
Let me kiss you

290
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,662
What kind of adult did you want to be in the future?

291
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,748
Woo...

292
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,629
Haa...

293
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,381
Someone like a teacher

294
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,093
I don't have time to hurry and hurry so quickly

295
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,055
Thank you for your hard work

296
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,808
thank you

297
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,259
Ah wow!

298
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,303
Ah, sorry!

299
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,514
Yes... oh so already...

300
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,558
Ah...

301
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,435
The sofa is fine, what about the injury?

302
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,062
Ah, it's okay

303
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,730
But the sofa isn't good!

304
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,399
I've chosen it together... sorry

305
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,859
Ah...

306
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,701
We went around looking around for these two...

307
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:45,289
I'm glad that I found my favorite in the end

308
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,459
Wow... sorry...

309
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,212
Hehe... not that

310
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:55,716
I hope we can do that too

311
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,472
Even if I take a detour from here onwards...

312
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,683
I want to need each other

313
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,483
What? Huh? Sorry, say something weird

314
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,193
It's not weird

315
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,654
Take care now

316
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,990
Nowadays, I'm proposing in my country

317
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,369
Yes, sorry

318
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,875
I'm so happy now...

319
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,588
It's scary to fall apart and get used to it

320
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:39,802
That's... Me too

321
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,765
I've done a lot of mistakes up until now...

322
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,727
I don't know what's going to happen

323
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:56,610
But if you live together and fail, try it

324
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,364
I agree

325
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:06,078
Discuss whenever there are any issues or solutions

326
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,168
Let's make every day knowing more about each other

327
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,752
Hehe...
