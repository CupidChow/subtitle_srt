1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,090
(Morita Shunsuke) Where are you going on a date?

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,133
(Customer) To eat dinner

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:11,053
(Morita) Hahaha... food is good

4
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:13,347
(Morita) Thank you very much!

5
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,938
Ah... Hello

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,943
(Okubo Eri) Ah, ah... uh... ah...

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,946
(Morita) Ah, are you a customer making a reservation?

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,449
Huh? Ah no

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,202
If you're starting now, you can't make a reservation

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,787
What...

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,415
(Morita) Please

12
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:51,927
<やってしまった…
やってしまった～…>

13
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,433
(Okubo Yoriko) Ah...

14
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,687
Oh da, you're messy head!

15
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,814
(Eri) Is that so?

16
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:07,109
A sloppy mom is out, should I make a reservation?

17
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,235
(Eri) Good

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,864
(Yoko) But... (Eri) That's fine!

19
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,115
(Yoko) Yes...

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,545
(footsteps)

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,800
What would you like to imagine?

22
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,552
Ah... uh...

23
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,307
Sorry Hirayama Akari...

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,352
What? Are you an acquaintance of Juri?

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,521
Ah... yes

26
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,524
Ah, that was it

27
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,945
I didn't make a reservation today so I got it up first...

28
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,823
Can I contact you if I can go back?

29
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,991
No, that's the point!

30
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:59,870
yes? but…

31
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:07,086
Ah... It's been about 10 years since I've come to a proper place.

32
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,716
Yeah... I'm always going to have to have my sister cut me

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,639
So I don't really understand the image of the hairstyle...

34
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,100
(Morita) Yes I see

35
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,436
well…

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,692
What would you choose from here?

37
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,360
(Eri) Ah...

38
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,779
(Morita) Wait a second

39
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,703


40
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:49,837
<こんなにも選択肢があったのに…
10年もムダにした>

41
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,674
43

42
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,762
<髪の毛を
満足に切りそろえることもできない>

43
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:04,310


44
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,446
Ah... um...

45
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,367
Is it a nuisance to leave it to us?

46
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,037
Ah... not at all

47
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,956
please

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,751
(Morita) I'll leave it to you (Eri) Yes

49
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,336
So I'll take care of it

50
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,434
(The sound of cutting hair)

51
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,439
Yes, leave it to you

52
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,274
thank you

53
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,487
Ah... so refreshing

54
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,742
Yes, it's really cute

55
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,746
Ah... wait a minute, sorry

56
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,552
(Morita) The thickness and quirky hair that suits short hair

57
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,388
Because I'm the same

58
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,394
...I mean, the customers and me don't look a little similar?

59
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,561
(Eri) What?

60
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,357
(Morita) Ah, that's rude

61
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,111
Please come again if you're happy with wax service.

62
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,990
Well, wax is...

63
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,710
(Eri) Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

64
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,553
♪～

65
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,601
～♪

66
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,813
(The sound of the ring pull opening)

67
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,235
(Okubo Misato) Yes

68
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,863
Congratulations on your divorce!

69
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,489
(Okubo Wataru) It's not a divorce, separation!

70
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,825
It's just a matter of time

71
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,287
You guys go to the bath

72
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,415
(Okubo Takumi) Eh, I'll be fine later (Misato) Yes?

73
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,750
Is it time to stay today?

74
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,960
I'll stay I've already drank

75
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,587
Ah...

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,423
So, should I decide on your room now?

77
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,591
(Takumi) Oh!

78
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,010
(Wataru) Have you ever seen it was my room?

79
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,179
(Takumi) Not there, but I like a large room

80
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,639
(Okubo Yuki) Me too! Hey me too! (Wataru) Ah

81
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,642
So where was our bedroom?

82
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,189
(Yuki) Wide!

83
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,359
Huh? It's fine but here...

84
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,694
what?

85
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,239
It must be the room the old guys were doing it

86
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,283
Huh? Are you an idiot?

87
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,956
<つうか この家では
まだ一度もヤッてねえし…>

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,627
(Conversation between Yuki and Takumi)

89
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,962


90
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,634
(Takumi) I think I'll sleep well

91
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,640
(Shop owner) Yes, wait

92
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,016
(Miyake Kaede) Hello

93
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,813
Yeah? in short--

94
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,525
That means separation based on the assumption that a divorce is a factor, right?

95
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,026
(Okubo Ayano) Yes...

96
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,863
But I'm the one who caused the divorce

97
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:49,409
Unless Wataru's consent, it will be divorced for three years at the earliest.

98
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,912
It generally takes about 5 years

99
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,456
(Kaede) What, does it take longer?

100
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,958
(Ayano) If it gets tough

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,252
But generally, if you get that long...

102
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,005
Because the marriage relationship will be broken

103
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,550
I see

104
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,927
But Sa-Sister, there's someone I like.

105
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,348
Hirayama-san? ...Would you wait until then?

106
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,394
That's right...

107
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,356
"That's right"...

108
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,109
My sister is more than me...

109
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,904
I thought he was a man who would live a solid life forever

110
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,406
Hehe...

111
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,744
115

112
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,499


113
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,423


114
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,851
Okay! So, let's have sake

115
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,186
(2 people) Hehe...

116
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,395
Sorry!

117
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,771
(Shop owner) Yes? (Kaede) Please sake

118
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,231
(Shop owner) Yes

119
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,733
(Kaede) What is there?

120
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,360
(Shop owner) Please come here (Kaede) Ah, thank you very much.

121
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,446
(Kaede) Which one should you choose? (Ayano) Which should I choose?

122
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,574
(Kaede) Hmm... That's it First off (Ayano) What?

123
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,284
Isn't this a bit strong?

124
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,410
Huh?

125
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,430
(Eri) Ah...

126
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,389
(Morita) Huh?

127
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,560
(Morita) I came to my house the other day...

128
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,855
(Eri) Ah, yes... you're the store manager, right?

129
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,482
Ah yes

130
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,735
Ah, did you make contact?

131
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,656
Ah... yes somehow

132
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:56,954
Wow, it's a huge change of image, so cute

133
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,749
It makes me look more mature

134
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,961
Ah, of course, she looked good on the glasses too

135
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,175
Ah, do you come here often?

136
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:15,347
Ah... uh... sometimes

137
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,350
Oh, then you know that curry restaurant?

138
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,519
(Eri) Ah... (Morita) Umm... what was the name?

139
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,437
(Eri) Ah... (Morita) Eh...

140
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,148
(Eri) Cast... (Morita) What?

141
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,608
(Eri) Oh, my eyes...

142
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,903
(Morita) What? Ah, is it okay?

143
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:34,116
(Eri) Aita! It's not going to happen... (Morita) Did you get trash?

144
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,410
Ah, wait a minute...

145
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,120
Ah, sorry...

146
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,622
(Morita) Do you use a handkerchief? (Eri) Sorry, sorry

147
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,542
(Morita) Maybe it's a contact? Did you get trash?

148
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,877
(Eri) Aita! It's...

149
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,603
(Ayano) Hehehe...

150
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,690
(Kakizaki Kumiko) Hehe... what?

151
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,610
Ah, no, it's the exchange notebook that the students have given me.

152
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:15,532
(Kakizaki) Ahahaha... It's not changed since we were there, exchange diary or something like that

153
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,161
Ah, this is a story of exchange

154
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,579
Huh?

155
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:25,959
Two students write one story alternately in relay format.

156
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,045
Which wrote this?

157
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,464
That's an idea that the girl might write...

158
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,716
It's fun to think about it all at once

159
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,179
(Kakizaki) Wow, it looks fun (Ayano) Yes

160
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,015
Ah, what do you think? I'll make tea

161
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,850
Thank you, I'm fine

162
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,352
(Kakizaki) Ah, right? (Ayano) Yes

163
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,521
(Kakizaki) What do you think? Tea and tea What do you think?

164
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:51,693
(Ayano)

165
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,700
<けど これを読まれてしまったことで
嫌がらせが始まった>

166
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,664
(Nagase Tomoka) I really know that the culprit of this letter

167
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,128
(Nitta Manuka) She was a good friend of Tomoka until her fourth grade.

168
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,259
(Ayano) That's what I think if it's okay...

169
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,138
Maybe the teacher should talk to the child once?

170
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:53,296
Um... Yoshizumi Ichika?

171
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,554
(Ayano) Sorry, suddenly

172
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,016
Oh, this is Okubo, the homeroom teacher of two groups.

173
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,185
(Yoshizumi Ichika) I know

174
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,479
That's right

175
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:15,861
<警戒心マックス
けど 遠回りしてもしょうがない>

176
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:22,784
(Ayano) This note was put in my geta box before Yoshizumi-san?

177
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,917
I also heard from Nagase-san and Nitta-san.

178
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:37,966
So they both were friends with Yoshizumi.

179
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,886
(Ichika) It's different now

180
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,598
(Ayano) Ah... I see

181
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,977
I wonder if the two of them can go back to being friends again...

182
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,104
I was consulted

183
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,397
(Ichika) What...

184
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,234
I can't do it

185
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,154
What... Can't you?

186
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:05,118
Is it impossible...? Is it absolutely possible to make up?

187
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,246
(Ichika) It's like making up...

188
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,875
I'm not friends with Nitta-san, so

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,257
Me and Tomoka were all good friends

190
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:25,555
But Nitta was next to Tomoka when she changed seats...

191
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,974
Because the house is close

192
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,895
Tomoka wants to go home with me

193
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,813
(Ichika) What is the letter?

194
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,190
(Midsummer) Gag tournament

195
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,358
(Ichika) What? Which one won?

196
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,734
(Midsummer) It's Midsummer (Tomoka) It's Tomoka

197
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:43,073
(Ichika) What? Is that a gag competition too? I wanted to do it

198
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,324
(Midsummer) Ah

199
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,035
(Tomoka) I mean, don't you want to write a replacement diary?

200
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,203
(Ichika) What, it looks interesting

201
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,120
(Midsummer) I'll do it

202
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,830
(Tomoka) So, Tomoka will write it and give it to Ikka...

203
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,832
Next, Ikka will be handed over to midsummer

204
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,126
(Ichika) Ah... Yes I understand

205
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,711
(Midsummer) So I'll buy a midsummer notebook!

206
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,046
(Tomoka) What? Thank you!

207
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,215
Oh, we're over here again tomorrow

208
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,050
(Midsummer) Bye bye! (Ichika) Bye bye

209
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,177
(Midsummer) Midsummer won

210
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,554
(Tomoka) What? Tomoka won

211
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,014
(Midsummer) It must be me (Tomoka) No, it must be Tomoka

212
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:25,865
When I go to hand over the exchange diary to Nitta-san's seat...

213
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,786
She's always laughing happily with Tomoka...

214
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,665
Yeah

215
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,794
(Ichika) If you forget to bring it with you many times...

216
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,423
The diary is gone

217
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,093
(Ayano) After that...

218
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:50,265
Did you know that a new exchange note for the two of them has begun?

219
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,520
It's Ikka's fault for stopping my diary...

220
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,316
It's annoying that it seems like it's out of your way

221
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,741
Huh?

222
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,745
(Midsummer) Sorry

223
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,125
(Tomoka) Sorry, I invited you to me from Tomoka

224
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,348
If that's good...

225
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,517
Would you like to talk about it here from time to time?

226
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:40,023
Of course I won't tell the two of them.

227
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,194
I'm not the homeroom teacher

228
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,698
Even if it's a little far away, it feels like an adult...

229
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,660
If there's something easy to talk about...

230
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,547
<大人にこそ
隠しておきたいだろうなぁ いろいろ>

231
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,385
<追い詰めないように
寄り添わなきゃ>

232
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,771
I was surprised...

233
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,773
(Hirayama Akari) As expected

234
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:26,152
I mean, isn't it amazing? Isn't it like a police dog? now

235
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,904
(2 people) Ahaha...

236
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,199
I'm using that line

237
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,535
I'm here

238
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,911
(Juri) I see

239
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,707
Fresh

240
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,210
(Juri) It's been a while

241
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,921
Really...

242
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,849
well…

243
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,894
(Ayano) Ah... Yes, then

244
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,172
Hehe...

245
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,894
(Juri) I was surprised, I heard from Eri that they had separated

246
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,563
Eri-chan? An unexpected information route

247
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,108
(Juri) Isn't that? And he also came to our salon.

248
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,277
What? Eri-chan?

249
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,073
Yes, my colleague just cut me off after I left work...

250
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,535
Please let me know that I'll be there again when Juri is here.

251
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,746
Eh, that's good

252
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,874
I also want to have Juri cut it someday

253
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,293
What? I'll do it anytime

254
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,630
...What are you stumbling?

255
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,050
I was saying I wouldn't see you again, but this is what I said

256
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,594
That's right

257
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,056
(Juri) But it's not intentional

258
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,724
yes

259
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,393
Not that, Ah...

260
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,021
I said I wouldn't call you!

261
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,690
(Ayano) Ah... calm down

262
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,616
Woo...

263
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:45,208
He called out reflexively... Amazing

264
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,379
I was really moving on my instinct

265
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,467
As expected

266
00:18:55,844 --> 00:19:01,349
I still like Ayano

267
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,898
Yes me too

268
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,827
This time, I had a problem...

269
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,832
I think they should have separated anyway

270
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,047
So, it may have been the trigger for Juri-san, but...

271
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:38,177
It could have happened someday even without Juri.

272
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,271
I don't intend to escape using Juri as an excuse

273
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:54,068
My own problems must be solved...

274
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,782
Apart from that...

275
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,787
I also like Juri-san

276
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,710
Ha... I don't want it anymore!

277
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:15,340
Ah, already...

278
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,675
Because it's a savage

279
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,638
Ah... sorry

280
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,351
(Two laughter)

281
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,077
(Juri)<It's usually not absolute on the way home>

282
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:50,667
(Ayano)<Drinking tea without making a promise, talk a little>

283
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,464
well

284
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,802
Ah yes, then

285
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,811
(Juri)

286
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,771


287
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:33,084
(Ayano) What if Kaede? what happened? I'm already home

288
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,045
(Kaede) Ah, I see...

289
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,715
Umm...

290
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,469
My brother-in-law is here

291
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,304
(Conversation between Wataru and his father)

292
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,223
(Ayano) What? Wataru-kun!?

293
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,769
(Kaede) I happened to stop by nearby so I wanted to look at my face and go home.

294
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,523
...So my mom was just getting ready for dinner...

295
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,525
If you like, please

296
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,695
... And Dad is already drunk

297
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:06,242
Yes... Thank you so I'll go home with that in mind

298
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,040
(Tap sound)

299
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:17,211
305

300
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:22,717
<真相を告げられずにいるのは
私の責任>

301
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,026
(Morita) Ah, hello

302
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,695
To the convenience store haha...

303
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,370
Oh Okubo-san

304
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,540
(Eri) Ah, Manager (Morita) Haha... Hello

305
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,334
I met you again

306
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,089
(Eri) I apologize for the inconvenience the other day.

307
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:05,551
That's what I mean by thanking you, but it's sweets and a new handkerchief

308
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:09,305
(Morita) What, that's fine, but

309
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,140
Ah...

310
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,561
Wow, thank you, sorry

311
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:20,441
Ah, no, please be with me until my eyes recover.

312
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,485
I'm grateful that I can't get back all this

313
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,029
Eh, no, really, don't worry

314
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,408
Oh well, when we're in trouble, we're both

315
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,577
If you like, come back to the store

316
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,920
(Eri) S...Sorry... Sorry

317
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:46,092
Um... I pretended to be a coincidence...

318
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,888
I actually ambushed the manager.

319
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,015
Um... I want to thank you

320
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,186
Sorry for doing something gross

321
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,398
(Morita) Ah...

322
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:14,745
(Eri)<It was a confession that was prepared to spurt the impression of an apology>

323
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,974
(Kurosawa Toru) Wow, it's getting damper today too

324
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,309
(typing sound)

325
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,810
Eh...

326
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,981
How was last week?

327
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:50,531
Ah... something strange and I'm curious...

328
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,033
(Yoko) When there...

329
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:53,910
yes

330
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,831
My daughter suddenly...

331
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,887
The thread has started to break

332
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:29,278
He seemed to have fun at school every day and there were many friends...

333
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,822
But...

334
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,161
A few months later...

335
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,507
I told him I was leaving school...

336
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,634
(Kurosawa) Yes

337
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:58,182
Suddenly I'm not stubborn...

338
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,191
Until then he was a really honest and good girl.

339
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,279
(Yoko) No, he's still a good girl

340
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,822
(Sound of slurping)

341
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,158
Even in middle school...

342
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:21,414
There are some things that seem to be rebellious, and I get really hit.

343
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,918
When you're in a good mood, come along with my shopping...

344
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,422
You're so pampered that "Mom, buy this too."

345
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,756
so…

346
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:38,556
I don't think it was an unbalanced parent-child relationship.

347
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,394
(Yoko) Teacher

348
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:50,901
Me... where did I go wrong?

349
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:02,413
(Eri)<We then started meeting together on Morita's days off...>

350
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,335
Is it okay if you're off work today?

351
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,757
Ah, it's okay, it's okay, it's a trip with friends too.

352
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,593
is that so

353
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:24,101
What will you do after this? Something just right... something like a meal?

354
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,690
Ah... Then on the other side...

355
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:30,983
On the other side?

356
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,235
Yes, on the other side...

357
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,654
On the other side?
