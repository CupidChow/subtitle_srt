1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,520
I've had many one-sided loves
 since childhood.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,560
- Uncomfortable?
- No, I'm good.

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,690
Akari, Age 21

4
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,610
Okay, good.

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,780
Yukako, Age 21.

6
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,170
You know, Akari.

7
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,260
Hm?

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,970
You're cute.

9
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,900
I felt like crying.

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,390
I might be embarrassing myself here, but...

11
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,270
are you interested in anyone now?

12
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,190
If you want to invite anyone to the BBQ,

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,610
we welcome surprise guests!

14
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,910
Ayano

16
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,850
Even Though We're Adults

17
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,000
Not at school, but...

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,920
I do at a place I visit often.

19
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,670
A staffer,

20
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,750
a woman.

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,970
- Morning!
- Morning.

22
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,480
I threw something together 
since I'm leaving early.

23
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,650
It's in the fridge, 
so heat it up if you want.

24
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,070
If not, just leave it there.

25
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,200
Got it.

26
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,370
Um...

27
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,830
Sorry about the weird things 
I said yesterday.

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,290
It's okay.

29
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,710
We'll talk when I get home.
Sorry, I'm leaving now.

30
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,680
But I have nothing to talk about?

31
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,350
Well, I guess I do...

32
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,230
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

33
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,060
I don't get it.

34
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,360
It makes no sense, 
that my brain's rejecting it.

35
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,450
What the heck.

36
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,830
It's like having a bad dream...

37
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,120
But it's real.

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,010
Talk about what?!

39
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,680
- Good work today.
- You too.

40
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,310
Was she always this selfish?

41
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,300
Miss Miyake.

42
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,510
I know this is rude, 
but I need to ask you.

43
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,340
Yes?

44
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,140
Do you want to have children?

45
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,020
S-Sorry for getting personal.

46
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,320
I think I want to have kids if I can.

47
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,110
But not everyone feels the same.

48
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,160
Ah, y-yes, very true.

49
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,870
But I think I want children too if I can.

50
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,590
Ah, I see. Great!

51
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,510
Sorry, I didn't mean to presume 
anything when I said, "Great!"

52
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,970
Oh, no, no... It's fine.

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,810
I thought we both wanted children.

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,230
But we decided to let nature take its course.

55
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,160
If it didn't happen,
we'd face that road together.

56
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,530
What is it?

57
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,450
Oh, nothing.

58
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,760
- Welcome home.
- I'm home.

59
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,400
Is that her?

60
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,740
Oh, yes.

61
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,450
And?

62
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,540
Apparently, her friend is hosting a BBQ.

63
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,830
She says, "your husband is welcome too."

64
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,880
Of course I'll decline.

65
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,440
Meeting a bunch of strangers is kind of...

66
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,510
It's okay.

67
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,550
What?

68
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,510
I'll go with you.

69
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,690
Ah, yes, yes, yes.
Thanks, thanks.

70
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,110
It's a cutting board? Amazing.

71
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,610
Thanks, thanks.

72
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,030
They really came.

73
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,750
Oh...

74
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,930
Let's go say hi. 
C'mon, c'mon.

75
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,880
Yukako, Morita.

76
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,840
- Yes, here we go!
- Okay.

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,510
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

78
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,090
Hello.

79
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh, nice to meet you. 
I'm Hirayama.

80
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,850
...and this is our host.

81
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm Kawakita, nice to meet you.

82
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,480
Nice to meet you.

83
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,650
I'm Okubo.

84
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm his wife, Yukako.

85
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm Kawakita Mai.

86
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,240
Oh, Mai!

87
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,860
Thank you for having us today.

88
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,410
Oh, I'm her husband, Wataru.
Sorry for tagging along.

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,670
Hey, the more the merrier, right?

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,080
Ah, I'm Morita.

91
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,920
These two are my former co-workers 
at a salon I used to work at.

92
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,880
I hear you're 
an elementary school teacher, Mrs. Okubo.

93
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,220
Yes, currently teaching third grade.

94
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,220
Really? 
She's starting first grade next year.

95
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,890
First grade in April! I'm excited!

96
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,690
Wow, that sounds exciting!

97
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,020
What do I want from this?

98
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,450
What am I doing here?

99
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,710
- Oh!
- Mmm...

100
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,730
- Here!
- Thanks.

101
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,690
If it's not hot enough, 
reheat it yourself.

102
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,130
Okay!

103
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,050
Good?

104
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,390
Mmm, yummy! So fluffy!

105
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,470
Mister and miss, eat up.

106
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,810
Alright, we're eating it.

107
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,180
Jeez, she's not shy at all.

108
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,400
It's good, she's social.

109
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,360
Akari, you're not shy either.

110
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,030
Well, I'm a grown adult now.

111
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,740
But it's always been that way?

112
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,990
I was the type who was super shy.

113
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,700
It's thanks to you when I first felt 
like I fit in at the salon.

114
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,620
Really? 
But you became a manager at another salon.

115
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,380
But I ultimately failed.

116
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,590
That was just because of timing, right?

117
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,970
Partly, but at the core,
 I'm socially awkward.

118
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,140
So does Mai take more
 after your husband?

119
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,890
Yes, she's definitely her father's daughter.

120
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,820
She gets along with her grandmother too.

121
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,530
That's how it is.

122
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,910
I don't really get it 
since I've never been married.

123
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,950
That's right.

124
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,290
I don't get it either, but I pretend
 to know what I'm doing as a mom.

125
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,210
I see.

126
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,510
Let's eat.

127
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,930
- Time to eat!
- You haven't changed.

128
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,100
Hey, mommy! Come here!

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,970
- Yes? I'm going over there.
- Okay.

130
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,940
Oh, it's done?

131
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,610
- Yes!
- Thanks, it looks good!

132
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,070
- Did you eat some?
- No.

133
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,490
- Not yet, you sure?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,220
- Do you want some meat?
- Yes, I do.

135
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,290
I want some too!

136
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,540
Let's eat, let's eat.

137
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,250
- I'd like some meat too.
- Oh, yes. Here, here.

138
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,380
Sorry for inviting you
 to this weird meetup.

139
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,680
No, it was rude of me to even come.

140
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,640
You cut your hair.

141
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,650
Ah, yes, just the other day.
Yukako cut it.

142
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,690
She's the one you used to date?

143
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,110
Ah, right.

144
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,820
She dumped me 
and now she's hosting this BBQ.

145
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,330
Oh...

146
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,830
That's probably... no, definitely

147
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,710
the woman that Aya is interested in?

148
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,470
Definitely a woman. 
And beautiful too.

149
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,930
I mean Aya is so brazen...

150
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,680
Ah, this is cooked, 
so have some.

151
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,180
- Ah, thank you.
- Sorry, thank you.

152
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,940
Let me introduce my husband again.

153
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,360
Thank you for inviting us.

154
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,490
No, thank you.
Sorry for inviting you on your day off.

155
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,950
No, it's okay.

156
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,830
Everyone here is super nice, 
and I can tell how close you are.

157
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,410
I feel embarrassed now.

158
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,880
So...

159
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,090
My wife says she's interested in you.

160
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,190
What do we do in this situation?

161
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,700
Is it cheating or infidelity?

162
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,540
I'm... I'm sorry.
I drank too much.

163
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,330
I can't handle my alcohol.

164
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,970
This is just my wife's one-sided crush, right?

165
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,180
Sorry, my head's not on right.
Ugh...

166
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,390
We should probably be leaving.

167
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,690
You're right.

168
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,900
I'll call a taxi for you.

169
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,020
No, it's okay.
The fresh air will help.

170
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,900
We'll call one later.

171
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,660
Excuse us for leaving early.

172
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,580
We'll be leaving now.

173
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,970
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,970
I should've declined.

175
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm the one who said we should go.

176
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,070
But I should've declined,
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,160
Whether you declined or not,

178
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,910
you are developing feelings for her, right?

179
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,220
Honestly, you should've taken this
 to your grave.

180
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,890
You would've, right?

181
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,390
But you didn't want to do that, right?

182
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,860
You should've just kept quiet.

183
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,150
You're stupid, Aya.

184
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,340
This is just my wife's one-sided crush, right?

185
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,300
No.

186
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,760
No, no, no... Geez!

187
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,810
This one, that one, 
everyone's married.

188
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,730
I want to see her, but I can't.

189
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,210
Hello?

190
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,840
It's me! I bought some lunch. 
Wanna eat with me?

191
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,590
Oh, okay!

192
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,170
I'll make some tea now.

193
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,220
Don't worry about it.

194
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,140
What?! Oh no!

195
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,530
Wataru, why are you sleeping here?

196
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,600
You'll catch a cold!

197
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,810
It's fine.

198
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,400
It's not fine! Get up!

199
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,110
Annoying.

200
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,020
- Get up!
- I said it's fine!

201
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,900
Jeez, so lazy!

202
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,340
What's going on today?

203
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,760
Did you two have a fight?

204
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,690
We might get divorced.

205
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,820
What?

206
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,030
Oh, um, I...

207
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,030
It's my fault.

208
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,990
What? What do you mean?

209
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,740
Don't tell me...

210
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,750
It's not an affair, is it?

211
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,080
Well? Is it an affair? 
With that person?

212
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,880
"That person"...

213
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,180
Do you know who it is?

214
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,350
Yeah, it was that beautiful woman
 I met the other day.

215
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,470
Huh?

216
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,940
You two need to stop telling me
 bits and pieces.

217
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,730
So, she met her at a bar.

218
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,570
Had an affair with her, and has been thinking about her ever since!

219
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,700
What?

220
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,820
I... I don't quite understand what's going on.

221
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,580
So this person is a woman?

222
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,960
Yes.

223
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,710
Ayano.

224
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,960
You like women?

225
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,050
I don't know.

226
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,840
You don't know?

227
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,480
Well, how far did things go with her? 
What's the relationship?

228
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,600
Mom.

229
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,690
This is important!
I mean, if it's an affair...

230
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,900
We kissed.

231
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,700
That's it?

232
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,590
I mean... I shouldn't say this, 
but is that all?

233
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,180
I mean, normally you wouldn't do that,
but if that's all...

234
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,680
You're making such a big deal out of nothing!
Is that really all?

235
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,680
- Hey...
- I'm just saying!

236
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,980
Was it really just that?

237
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,470
What? You didn't know either?

238
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,780
Well, I don't know 
what goes on between women.

239
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,030
Ayano.

240
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Yes?

241
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,790
This situation with you,

242
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,590
I don't think it's that serious, but...

243
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,460
for you, it was cheating, right?

244
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,430
Then that's fine.

245
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,180
But getting divorced over something
 like this seems ridiculous.

246
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,230
You don't break up 
just because she kissed a girl?

247
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,530
A level 1 penalty should be enough, 
don't you think?

248
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,490
What do you mean by "level 1 penalty"...

249
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,160
Well, Ayano...

250
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,410
She looks like she's begging
 to be punished.

251
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,000
Some atonement might make it easier,
 don't you think?

252
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,980
It's best to call it even and 
move on quickly in these cases.

253
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,430
Hey, you two should
 move out of this place.

254
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,060
Huh?

255
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,440
The reason I came today

256
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,230
wasn't to eat lunch with you two.

257
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,100
Your father collapsed 
and was hospitalized.

258
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,800
What? 
Why didn't you say that sooner?!

259
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,820
I was going to tell you,

260
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,940
but you were curled up on the sofa.

261
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,490
How is father doing?

262
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,570
Well, it's not too serious, 
and the procedures are all taken care of now.

263
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,830
I see...

264
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,240
Yeah, the main point is...

265
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,460
If you can afford to pay rent here, 
you should help us out financially instead.

266
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
You can live at our house, right?

267
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,060
What? 
And you agreed to it?

268
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,150
Well, I get that 
the father-in-law is in a tight spot, but...

269
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,670
Isn't this all happening too fast?

270
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,070
Living under one roof...

271
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,240
Yeah, it is pretty sudden.

272
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,700
Ugh, I would definitely refuse.

273
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,990
I can't stand that family.

274
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,410
But you only met them a few years ago.

275
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,290
Just once or twice at 
the ceremony and formal meeting.

276
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,170
Even so, I couldn't handle it.

277
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,710
Father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law.

278
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,720
They are the worst.

279
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,890
Wait, sis, are you worried 
about the sister-in-law?

280
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,680
What, Misato?

281
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,350
No, that's the oldest daughter, right?
Not her, the youngest one... Eri!

282
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,820
My sister is...
kind of a hermit right now.

283
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,440
I see...

284
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,160
My mom is quite image-conscious, 
and after meeting your sister at the family meeting,

285
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,080
she found it harder to talk 
about my sister's situation.

286
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,660
Sorry about the timing of all this.

287
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,580
No, it's okay.

288
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,210
She stopped going out midway
 through high school.

289
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,970
That's why my mom was so happy
 that you're a school teacher.

290
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,180
I only teach elementary school.

291
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,810
My sister is already over twenty.

292
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,770
It's a bit late to be expecting anything now.

293
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,560
But I think his mother's concern,

294
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,820
is probably more about Eri 
than the father.

295
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,990
Yeah, that's true.

296
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,690
Well, starting next week, 
while packing up for the move,

297
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,380
we'll go between both homes
 and sometimes stay at his parents' house.

298
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,710
What?! 
That's like some kind of punishment!

299
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,130
Do they have something on you?

300
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,720
I guess...

301
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,430
they do have something.

302
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,110
What do you mean?

303
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,270
Ah...

304
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,820
There's a dry cleaner 
and liquor store at that corner...

305
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,470
Oh no, that one closed down recently.

306
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,470
- The liquor store is in a lawsuit now.
- What?

307
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,010
Oh, Ayano, the key is in this inner pocket.

308
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,350
- Oh, yes.
- This one.

309
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,560
The liquor store by the station?

310
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,060
No, not that one.
That's next to the cafe.

311
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,180
Oh, the one with that chubby man?

312
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,940
Yes, that's the one.
And his daughter-in-law...

313
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,490
Since the grandfather passed away...

314
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,610
Oh...

315
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,030
Shh...

316
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,500
And then the grandmother went crazy.

317
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,330
Thanks.

318
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,640
Thank you.

319
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,840
The owner died peacefully, 
but there's a huge fight over the inheritance.

320
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,290
- I see...
- I'll lock the door.

321
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,390
Oh, thanks. Please come in.

322
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,420
- Pardon the intrusion.
- C'mon.

323
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,010
Why is my sister-in-law here?

324
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,930
Oh, a visit?

325
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,850
- I'll put the key here.
- Oh, thanks.

326
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,150
- Let's go look at the second floor, okay?
- Yes.

327
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,900
- Let's go.
- Okay?

328
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,700
You should make a key for Ayano soon.

329
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,280
- Okay.
- Come up.

330
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,410
Okay.

331
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,910
The back room here was Wataru's,
 and that one was Eri's.

332
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,980
And the biggest room was my older sister's.

333
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,420
Whoa!

334
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,220
That's quite a loaded way of saying it.

335
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,090
You were here?

336
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,110
It's been a while, Misato.

337
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,340
Long time no see, Aya.

338
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,720
I was suddenly told to clear out my stuff.

339
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,110
Of course!

340
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,640
This house isn't your free storage unit.

341
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,270
You have your own family now, 
so grow up already.

342
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,320
Wataru's the same!

343
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,940
Wataru is fine 
because he's moving back home.

344
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,820
Um, what about Eri's room now?

345
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,070
Empty.

346
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,370
She moved to grandma's room 
after she died. It's downstairs.

347
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,410
She was always close to her grandmother.

348
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,970
I'm out of packing tape,
so I'll go buy some. Need anything?

349
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,970
Hm, I'd like a hot milk tea.

350
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,050
Okay.

351
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,180
- I want coffee and a meat bun.
- Got it.

352
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,610
Sorry for making you help with all this.

353
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,570
Ah, it's okay.

354
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,750
Um... I heard a bit from my sister.

355
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,000
Um...

356
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,130
I apologize for the trouble
 my sister has caused.

357
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,350
That's not something 
you need to apologize for.

358
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,100
Well, that's...

359
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,860
Did she tell you about the other person?

360
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,910
Huh? No...

361
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,790
They're at this place.

362
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,420
Aren't you curious?

363
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,420
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

364
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,260
The person's name starts with "Hi."

365
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,730
Be my ally.

366
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,090
Welcome.

367
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,930
Is it okay if I'm by myself?

368
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,220
Of course.
Please sit wherever you'd like.

369
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Okay.

370
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,610
- Welcome.
- Ah...

371
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,320
Here's the menu.

372
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,620
Here's your winter vegetable pizza.
Please enjoy.

373
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

374
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,710
Here's your shrimp and mushroom ajillo.

375
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,710
Thank you very much.

376
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,340
Um, excuse me for asking,
but...

377
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,510
Yes?

378
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,850
Are there any male staffers

379
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,430
with a last name that starts with "Hi"?

380
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,230
"Hi"?

381
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,320
No one that I know of.
Why do you ask?

382
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,530
Oh, no!
Sorry for asking such a strange question.

383
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,280
Not at all. 
Please enjoy your meal.

384
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,910
- Hirayama, table 3 needs their check.
- Okay.

385
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,640
Excuse me! 
Sorry to bother you again.

386
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,830
Yes?

387
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,040
Do you know Okubo Ayano?

388
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,890
I'm sorry for interrupting your work.

389
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,720
I'll enjoy my ajillo now.

390
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,530
Hello?

391
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,830
Hello, so the person 
you're having an affair with?

392
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,460
Lover... or paramour?

393
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,960
Whatever. I met that person.

394
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,090
What?

395
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,970
Wataru told me the place 
and their name.

396
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,680
Wataru was acting out of character
 and it was scary,

397
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,220
but you made him that way.

398
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,140
Hirayama, right?

399
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,480
When I mentioned your name, 
her face turned bright red.

400
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,110
She really likes you a lot.

401
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,740
Hey, you're happy about that, aren't you?

402
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,370
Know your place.

403
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,750
I'm not happy.

404
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,290
I thought it was something minor.

405
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,840
But it's not minor, 
it's something you're serious about, right?

406
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,140
Yes.

407
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,970
Hello?

408
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,350
Sorry, Kaede. 
I'll call you back.

409
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,860
Hello... Akari?

410
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,490
It seems my sister, Kaede, bothered you.
 I'm sorry.

411
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,120
Kaede, huh?
Cute name.

412
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,540
It wasn't a bother. 
She came as a customer.

413
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,500
But still...

414
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,380
I'm the one that's a bother, right?

415
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,500
What?

416
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,510
I didn't know you were married.

417
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,310
I'm the victim here, 
having been deceived.

418
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,940
And yet I'm being looked at 
as "the other woman."

419
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,400
The one who's wrong...

420
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,570
is you.

421
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,030
All of it... is you.

422
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,700
But...

423
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,960
I've fallen for you.

424
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,760
If you like me too,

425
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,300
take full responsibility.

426
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,220
I want to see you.

427
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,850
Come see me...

428
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,320
I really messed up.

429
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,540
I really did it.

430
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,580
Testing someone 
when I know they'll be troubled.

431
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,670
I've been jerked around 
by this tactic so many times myself.

432
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,210
I'm the worst.

433
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,340
But I want to see her so badly.

434
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,350
We just met. What is this? 
What do I like about her?

435
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,680
Well, first her face.

436
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,810
The way she acts as a teacher.

437
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,020
Her deceptively shy appearance.

438
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,150
That's about all I know.

439
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,570
Do I like her 
because I don't know her?
