1
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,160
God

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,010
my life

3
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,380
is very boring

4
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,340
What are you

5
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,480
alive for?

6
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,009
-Daruma-san-

7
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,860
-Fell-

8
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Do not move.

9
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
Do not move

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,050
Move or you'll die

11
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,800
-Daruma-san-

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,420
-fell-

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,020
God.

14
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,550
Please send me 

15
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,159
back to my boring life

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,900
-Daruma-san fell-

17
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:38,160
-Daruma-san-

18
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,859
My legs are starting to go numb

19
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,560
So what do you want us to do?

20
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,420
Why?

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,020
Why is everyone dying?

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,519
Is this a terrorist attack?

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,280
Why does that Daruma Doll can move

24
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,189
and speak?

25
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,110
Hey Class President?!

26
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:55,459
How should I know?!

27
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,600
-fell-

28
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,420
-Ah? tsk-

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,699
Must get out of here.

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,879
Asshole! You are the one who is suppose to tell us what to do.

31
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,099
Why can't we open this?!

32
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,500
Get out of my way.

33
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,660
-Daruma-san fell-

34
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,730
-Ah? Ah?-

35
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,939
-Laughs-

36
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,560
No. I don't want to die.

37
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,230
Calm down!

38
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,410
Calm down?

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,950
Do you even understand what is happening right now?

40
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,620
-fell-

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,450
-Ah? Ah?-

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,000
-Tsk. Boring.-

43
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,079
This

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,840
represents the Daruma-san's death doll.

45
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,459
As to why could this be a problem?

46
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,200
Escape is not considered as an option
in this horrible situation.

47
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,890
That game is very boring.

48
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,731
If you want to steal something, go to the other side of the shelf. 

49
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,550
It's the dead spot for the spy cameras.

50
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,440
You can find interesting games there.

51
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,340
Now, get out of here straight and calmly.

52
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,380
But how do we get out of here?

53
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,720
Look, behind that bastard Daruma

54
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,580
-Daruma-san fell-

55
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,350
-boring-

56
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,619
According to the words on the back

57
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,019
-up ~-

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,500
We don't know the exact rules.

59
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,569
but most likely pressing that button will end this.

60
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:32,570
-Mount up ~ ~-

61
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,809
Live it up to me.

62
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,340
Wait-

63
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,860
-Fell-

64
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,900
-laughs-

65
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,929
-up-

66
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,380
What now?

67
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,630
Don't panic.

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,259
Do not worry. We should do it slowly step by step.

69
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,560
That won't work!

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,880
What do you mean it won't work?

71
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,390
I agree with him.

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,860
Quickly look at that.

73
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,269
- of ~ Mount tumbler-

74
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,570
A timer.

75
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,379
What would happen if it reaches zero?

76
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,540
Although I'm not entirely sure,

77
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,679
I'm afraid everyone will die

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,259
-fell-

79
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,540
Only one minute left.

80
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,190
-down-

81
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,340
-laughs-

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,309
-chants-

83
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,310
Damn

84
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,680
-Daruma-san fell-

85
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,719
Please!!! Someone !!! Stop this!!!

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
-down-

87
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
-down-

88
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,930
-down-

89
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
It's no use already.

90
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,700
-Chants-

91
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,539
Stand

92
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
I will instantly

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
send you over there

94
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,360
Huh?

95
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,380
Step on me to fly over
this pile of corpses.

96
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
What?

97
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,499
Remember when we practiced gymnastics in P.E

98
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,540
It's that one.

99
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,260
I know.. I know.. BUt? 

100
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,599
-not fall ~~.-

101
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
Now come here!

102
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,690
Arghhhh

103
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:27,740
-fell ~ down -

104
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,500
-ah ah ah.-

105
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,300
End End End

106
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,490
We did it!

107
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
It worked.

108
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,620
The switch button is pressed by Takahata Shun

109
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,570
The switch button is pressed by Takahata Shun

110
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,400
Survived. Survived.

111
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,920
What the heck is this?

112
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,680
Shun, have you already unpacked

113
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,479
I'll do it tomorrow.

114
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,359
You've been saying that for a month

115
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,650
and I haven't seen you do it.

116
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,320
Tomorrow I'll finish it

117
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,109
The car parked next to a bulding

118
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,590
suddenly exploded resulting to

119
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,539
16 nearby pedestrian deaths.

120
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,639
52 people who suffered light injuries
was rushed to the city hospital

121
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,070
It is not yet confirmed whether there is a Japanese killed.

122
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,760
Local government considered it to be
an act of an anti-government groups

123
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,760
Right now they are doing an investigation regarding this.

124
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,400
Good Morning Shun.

125
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,530
Hey you

126
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Why don't you ask her to be your girlfriend?

127
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,779
Her family lives next door

128
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,070
so since childhood we've know each other.

129
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,900
So I can't harbor any special feeling

130
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,000
I think it's like that for her too.

131
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,780
Oh, she is very popular.

132
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,950
Many wants to be in your position.

133
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,620
I know. I know.

134
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,920
Another boring day.

135
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,940
Those guys are really interesting

136
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,529
During the reign of Louis XIV

137
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,840
French monarchy autocratic was in its prime time.

138
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,859
He said "I am the State"

139
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,780
Therefore "I'm the Sun King."

140
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Takahata

141
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Yes?

142
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,180
Just continue to sleep.

143
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,650
Now here is the coverage of the test.

144
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,220
God.

145
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,080
Please give back to me

146
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,650
my boring life.

147
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,560
You're are a rat

148
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,790
Something is coming.

149
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,110
A cat is coming.

150
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,459
Mouse?

151
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,760
A cat is coming!

152
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,360
A cat is coming?

153
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Ichika

154
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Shun

155
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,380
Thank goodness. You're alive.

156
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,080
Where is everyone?

157
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,049
I want to save everyone.

158
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,840
When finally I'm lose enough

159
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,950
I pressed the button

160
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,840
I killed everybody

161
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,009
It's all my fault

162
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,650
I did the same thing

163
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,260
I pushed it too.

164
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,009
Why is this happening?

165
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,140
I don't have any idea.

166
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,930
Ah.. Let's try calling the police.

167
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,720
Eh.. why?

168
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,340
You are the mouse

169
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,420
A cat is coming soon.

170
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,470
It is coming.

171
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,370
Let's get out of here quickly and let the police know.

172
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Not here also.

173
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,400
Ichika get out of the way.

174
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,860
Oh, It's bulging

175
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,070
Everyone

176
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,580
It's useless.

177
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,600
Once you get in you can't get out.

178
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Ah.

179
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,860
What the heck is this?

180
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,000
Make the cat wear the bell

181
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,510
and it will end.

182
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,980
What does this mean?

183
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,940
Well, quickly change your clothes.

184
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,540
If we don't follow the rules, we don't know what will happen.

185
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Come, get dressed

186
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,130
Quickly, put it.

187
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,060
This is an order of the Student Council President!

188
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,920
The cat is here!

189
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,100
-feed-

190
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,760
That will eat all of us!

191
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,320
Ichika, stand up quickly

192
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,890
Shun, what is that?

193
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,109
Make the cat wear the bell, and it would end.

194
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,550
Then that's...

195
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,310
There.

196
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,060
We have shoot that bell into that basketball hoop

197
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,480
9 minutes and 30 seconds left

198
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,460
That's totally impossible.

199
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,920
Everyone if we put that bell in that cat's collar.

200
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,490
This game will be over.

201
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,390
Good. That would do.

202
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,320
Akimoto Pass.

203
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,230
Please,

204
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,960
I've never been lazy

205
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,520
365 days a year

206
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,120
500 times a day, I practice shooting.

207
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,850
During that, my nails splitted 30 times.

208
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,310
Why should I sacrifice my life
to practice basketball

209
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,680
Now finally I understand

210
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,620
Everything is for this moment.

211
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,740
It will go in.

212
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,830
Great

213
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,030
It's hand is moving.

214
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,580
Everyone take that dress off.

215
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,780
The ones who were attacked are only those who are wearing that dress.

216
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,350
Get it off.

217
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,280
Hurry up or you'll be eaten

218
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,620
So we'll not be eaten like this right

219
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,550
Are you kidding us!!!

220
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,710
You said to wear this dress right

221
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,460
How should I know

222
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,810
that it's a trap all along.

223
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,440
You bastard!You told us it would be different...

224
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,490
I see..

225
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,930
A mouse are not,

226
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,080
it would only eat people

227
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,810
Only three minutes left?

228
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,590
There is no time left.

229
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,690
I will...

230
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,230
die.

231
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,820
Look here.

232
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,880
Look here

233
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Shun!

234
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,760
Someone...

235
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,330
While I attract its attention...

236
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,400
Shoot the bell!

237
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,070
Stop dreaming

238
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,860
I can not die like Yoshikawa.

239
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,620
If this continues, then we'll all die.

240
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
It hurts...

241
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,560
My back is itchy

242
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,150
It's itchy

243
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,970
Who is that?

244
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,220
It's itchy

245
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,120
My back is itchy

246
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,900
I can't sleep ..meow.

247
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,970
Who will help me scratch it meow.

248
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,090
What is this guy saying?

249
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,990
It's itching.. Itching.. ahhh..

250
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,400
back tickling tickling ah ah

251
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,890
Only I can hear it.

252
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,780
Why is that?

253
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,040
meow.

254
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,110
Meow meow

255
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,540
meow

256
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,340
My back is itchy

257
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,740
My back is itchy, I can't sleep meow

258
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,990
So that is really it.

259
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,620
Who will help me meow?

260
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,380
What is happening shun?

261
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,520
The ones wearing this dress will be eaten by this guy

262
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,650
But at the same time

263
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,260
Only those who wear this will be able to understand this guy.

264
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,650
Good.

265
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,600
How's that? It feels good right.

266
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,940
More.. More...

267
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,470
Meow want to be scratched again

268
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,050
More.. More...Scratch me again meow

269
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,970
Must scratch

270
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,470
Must scratch.

271
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,460
Everyone 

272
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,860
Help me!

273
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,680
It itches... It itches...

274
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,500
Who will help me scratch it meow

275
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,890
More.. More...

276
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,690
It feels good to be scratched meow

277
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
More... More...

278
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,500
Scratch me more Meow.

279
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,720
It feels so good meow

280
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,120
Great

281
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,220
Let's do it now.

282
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,510
Wait a moment

283
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,220
Maybe

284
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,330
will be like that time, with the Daruma doll.

285
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,230
Everyone aside from the one who shoots it will die?

286
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,720
This time everyone gave the cat a scratch. 

287
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Everyone have done their duty.

288
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,960
So I think, we will all survive.

289
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,790
Are you sure?

290
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,820
This...

291
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Then I'll shoot

292
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,280
Who agreed with you here

293
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,110
I'll shoot

294
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,020
This time it should be ladies first

295
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,540
Get out you a sow

296
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,730
Me.

297
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,220
Let go

298
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,130
Let go...

299
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,000
Now is not the time to fight!

300
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,020
You're the one to say that

301
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,320
You're also thinking that you want to survive this

302
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,550
Don't lie.

303
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,110
Calm down everyone.

304
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,920
If you don't be quiet, then that guy...

305
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,570
You

306
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,680
Everyone take your hand off of it.

307
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,070
This is the student council president's order

308
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,640
You're just using your advantage to bully everyone

309
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,950
To give it to you.

310
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,120
If we manage to make it fell asleep, then

311
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,790
It's no use.

312
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,400
We do not have that time

313
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,240
Then what do we do?

314
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
What to do?

315
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,430
What to do right now?

316
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,000
Ichika, get that bell.

317
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Follow me.

318
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,200
We cannot just let them escape

319
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,320
Which one is the bell? and Which one is the basketball?

320
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Eyes?

321
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,330
It's eyes distinguishes whether or not someone is wearing a mouse clothes

322
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,410
Throwing it like a basketball

323
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,930
It will catch the bell.

324
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,540
That guy will first confirm it before moving.

325
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,400
So in this case we will be able to create a delay of time 
before he confirms it and make a move.

326
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,170
Success rate is...

327
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,920
50%

328
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,900
Guess which side is the bell

329
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,210
That idiot

330
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,560
It's the critical moment right now

331
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,180
Then the one who has the bell is...

332
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,610
The genuine one is here!

333
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,590
How could this be..

334
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,780
Then letting it see the ball is...

335
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,830
intentional.

336
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,360
To make it think I am holding a bell

337
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,270
Get in..

338
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,470
How could...

339
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,310
God.

340
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
You...

341
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,290
-End-

342
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,510
We did it.

343
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,730
It's not finished

344
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,630
It's to early to be happy right now.

345
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,500
The ones who survived are.

346
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,900
Amaya Takeru

347
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,740
Takahata Shun.

348
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,280
Akimoto Ichikata

349
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,080
Great.

350
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,000
See, we can actually survive...

351
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,460
The top three survived

352
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,140
Survive

353
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,780
What about the others...

354
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,230
God revolutionized this world

355
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,750
where power is everything.

356
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,790
Survivors are the good ones

357
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,450
while the ones who died are evil

358
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,620
I've always dreamed of such a world.

359
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,200
Thank you God

360
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,720
I appreciate it.

361
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,050
This guy...

362
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
is dangerous.

363
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,160
All the normal humans have already died

364
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,980
And only we have survived. We are the chosen ones 

365
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,980
You're also thinking of it that way.

366
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,150
Takahata Shun

367
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,610
I'm not thinking that way

368
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,730
No.

369
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,320
You and I are the same

370
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Similar?

371
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,880
When do you feel alive?

372
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,350
In my case. It's when I'm destroying something. That's when I feel I'm alive.

373
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,470
So in order to survive this

374
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,230
I'll do everything.

375
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,030
Don't joke around. What are you saying?

376
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,680
Look at this intent look.

377
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,490
You

378
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,210
Are also looking forward to this world

379
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,770
Just like me

380
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,110
No.

381
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,530
The two of you are not the same at all

382
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,070
Shun is very gentle and very strong.

383
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,200
And you are completely different

384
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,470
Right.

385
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,470
Stop.

386
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,510
All High Schools WorldWide.

387
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,970
All national high schools in

388
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,460
Washington, Moscow, New York, Sydney and London
Madrid are in the middle of terrorist attacks.

389
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,450
Now information is still not clear

390
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,980
It is said to have more than 10 million young people died

391
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,010
A new intelligence report just came in.

392
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,010
Just now, Prime Minister Abe

393
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,836
of the Prime Minister's official residence established
an Emergency Countermeasures Headquarters.

394
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,110
They announced the it is a National Level Disaster.

395
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,050
Look at that

396
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,300
Right now 

397
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,130
Cube like this one appearing suddenly around the world

398
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,770
Rumors said

399
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,750
That the terrorist attack occuring 
simultaneously in various High Schools

400
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:58,270
Was said to be held in the cube
that contains the surviving students.

401
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,780
Police and self-defense forces are now being deployed
together to implement the rescue operations.

402
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,990
But the entrance to the cube could not be found

403
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,140
Next in the news, a cube that appeared in Hokkaido

404
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,779
is now being tracked by Reporter Sato... 

405
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,300
Now switching to live...

406
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,810
Oh what now.. Now that the news actually matters.

407
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,780
...SDF also thinks that there is no way

408
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,520
That the main road in the city...

409
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,110
Thank you, ah uncle.

410
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,870
Now here in the studio is.

411
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,213
Our guest, Professor of Department
of Human Environment Studies from Touto University

412
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,410
Okuhira Tadakatsu.

413
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,610
Okuhira Tadakatsu.

414
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,350
This series of terrorist attacks and the mysterious cube

415
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,750
Is there a link between the two of them?

416
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,930
This is not a terrorist attack

417
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:49,490
Alien invasion is what we are seriously
should consider right now.

418
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,450
The situation is beyond the scope of human cognition.

419
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,260
Hey.. Hey.. What is he saying?

420
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,040
But you see...

421
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,110
Right now

422
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:06,050
Across the internet, surviving students are being called as "Children of God"

423
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,870
We are starting to see an emergence
of a human deification.

424
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,580
Children of God...

425
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,930
Takumi

426
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,900
I'll put food out here, oh

427
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,970
Takumi.

428
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,080
You should occasionally come out to see your mother...

429
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,150
Shut up.

430
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,290
Go away, old woman.

431
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,870
Children of God.

432
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,590
Children of God.

433
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,550
Children of God.

434
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,680
Children of God

435
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,850
It hurts...

436
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,950
Are you okay, Takahata-kun?

437
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,720
I had a dream of being licked by a cat

438
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,150
I'm feeling the cat's tongue...

439
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,050
Thank goodness. Long time no see

440
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,090
Takase-san, why are you here?

441
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,110
Anyway, where is this place?

442
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,520
Just like you Takahata- kun

443
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,600
When I woke up, I'm already at this place.

444
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,350
I see.

445
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,880
How many years we have not seen each other anyway?

446
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,800
I transferred back when we are in first year, if we are to count it...

447
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,750
We've not seen each other for three years.

448
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,400
Well, you're looking good.

449
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,280
But now, in this situation, I cannot say that.

450
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,930
Takahata-kun.

451
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,030
Is this the end of it?

452
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,220
Why do we encounter this kind of thing?

453
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,820
I do not really know

454
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,980
But we are lucky though.

455
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,870
Yeah, also we managed to meet again

456
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,930
Can you be a little quieter?

457
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,380
I am now doing physics vector analysis of that thing.

458
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,680
Using the Helmholtz Theorem to attempt to 
disassemble its current status.

459
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,820
Huhh

460
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,120
This is Taira-kun from a
private high school.

461
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,539
While there is Taoka-san from an all-girls High School.

462
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,560
They both played the "Daruma Doll"

463
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,080
and also the "Lucky Cat" and survived.

464
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
Taira.

465
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,750
Taoka Takase.

466
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,350
Takahata.

467
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,350
Is the distribution of students

468
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,980
per room is according to the syllabry order of names?

469
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,730
That's about right.

470
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,890
The both of us occupying the same room

471
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,360
proves that it is not distributed 
according to one's IQ level.

472
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,299
How come everytime you start talking
you always tend to find a fault?

473
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,010
Now I see.

474
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,130
So perhaps Akimoto and Amaya are in the same room

475
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,520
We were brought in together. I must go and see.

476
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,730
Damn! It's locked

477
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,190
Someone - Someone - Someone out there
Nothing will happen, so just stop it.

478
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,920
...suddenly appeared all over the world...

479
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,870
...Worldwide high schools...

480
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,210
Meanwhile a spate of terrorist attacks.

481
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,500
...This is not a terrorist attack...

482
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,855
...occurring simultaneously throughout various high schools...

483
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:37,420
...Okuhira Tdakatsu in just the Prime Minister
Prime Minister's official residence...

484
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:40,054
...alien invasion...

485
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:41,979
...released national level emergency...

486
00:43:42,608 --> 00:43:43,654
...this is what we should now be...

487
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,540
Nobody will save us.

488
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,370
SDF are not able to enter the cube to rescue us

489
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,030
Then what should we do?

490
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,350
You should just wait.

491
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,580
Wait for the next game to start.

492
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,880
You still think there will be another game

493
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,780
Not really "think", it's more of a "hope"

494
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,560
I can not wait to catch you idiot guys out.

495
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,510
...The surviving students throughout the internet

496
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,610
are called "Children of God"

497
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,480
We are beginning to see a deified wave...

498
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,930
"Children of God"

499
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Not a bad name...

500
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,720
A key to open the door 

501
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,530
will appear if it ended

502
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,540
It's here.

503
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,840
-Let's play together.-

504
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,760
-Taira-kun let's play-.

505
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,040
Okay

506
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,450
What will we play?

507
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,060
-The game we will -

508
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,790
-be playing is "Caged Bird"-

509
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,580
-At the end of the song you should
guess who is behind you in 10 seconds.-

510
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,700
-And your eyes would be-

511
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,930
-Blindfolded-

512
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,020
This is very interesting.

513
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,250
-So...-

514
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,790
-Let's start-

515
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,710
-Ready...-

516
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:49,170
-Kagome kagome -

517
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,730
-The bird in the cage-

518
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,360
-When, oh when will it come out-

519
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,090
-In the night of dawn-

520
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,740
-The crane and turtle slipped-

521
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,350
-Who is behind you now?-

522
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,760
It's Akemi

523
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,640
-Wrong.-

524
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,110
-Unfortunately I was Hanako-

525
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,300
-bye, bye-

526
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,350
Wait...
-Bow down-
-Up-

527
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,510
-Next then it would be...-

528
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,280
-Let's see.. Let's see...-

529
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,640
-Who will be the one playing it.-

530
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,780
-Who will.-

531
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,060
-Taoka-san play with us.-

532
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,830
No. I don't want to play.

533
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,220
-What... that's really boring-

534
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,130
-Then should we just kill her?-

535
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,870
-Let's do that-

536
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,020
I understand. I'll play. I'll play.

537
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,430
-It doesn't matter. If you hate it, you should not do it.-

538
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,730
I don't hate it.

539
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,570
I'm looking forward to it.

540
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,080
-Then you really want to play it-

541
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,470
-Then there is nothing we could do-

542
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,860
-Let's play it-

543
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,610
-Kagome kagome -

544
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,190
-The bird in the cage-

545
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,900
-When, oh when will it come out-

546
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,460
-In the night of dawn-

547
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,070
-The crane and turtle slipped-

548
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,940
-Who is behind you now?-

549
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,200
It is...It is...

550
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,110
-Time is up.-

551
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,470
Don't!!!

552
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,500
Stop it!

553
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,620
-Let's see-

554
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,070
-Who is next.-

555
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,050
-Takase-san-

556
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,280
-Let's play it-

557
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,700
I will be the one who would play with you.

558
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,990
Let's just start this now.

559
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,270
-OK, ok.. You understand-

560
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,230
-This guy is totally funny-

561
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,580
-Idiot are friends with idiots.-

562
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,540
-Takahata-san-

563
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,300
-So... Let us get started quickly.

564
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,290
-One, Two-

565
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,770
-Kagome kagome -

566
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,310
-The bird in the cage-

567
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,960
-When, oh when will it come out-
I'll survive this

568
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,600
-In the night of dawn-
I'll survive this

569
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,320
-The crane and turtle slipped-

570
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,050
-Who is behind you now?-

571
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,860
-Time is up-

572
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,470
-You'll gonna die-

573
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,070
-Kenichi-

574
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,920
-The one behind me is Kenichi-

575
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,539
-But you are already out of time-

576
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,740
No, I made it just in time

577
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,520
-That's right.-

578
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,800
-What are you saying-

579
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,610
-Why are you saying it's not time yet?.-

580
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,690
It is because of this.

581
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,220
-Time is up-

582
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,050
-I recorded it when Taoka-san is playing.-

583
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,080
-Time is up-

584
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,600
The moment you say time is up

585
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,130
You are just spouting lies.

586
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,390
That is why I lure you into speaking

587
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,660
because the way you re-arrange yourselves
are always the same. 

588
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,330
That way, I'll know who is the one behind me.

589
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,340
-You'll gonna die.-

590
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,940
I may seem like an idiot to you.

591
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,070
Takahata-kun

592
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,190
Thank goodness. Thank you very much for saving me.

593
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,840
Hey, let's hold hands

594
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,400
-I'm so lonely-

595
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,030
-I don't have any friends to play with-

596
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,950
Hey, let's hold hands

597
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,200
-You are friends right-

598
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,080
-nice nice ah ah-

599
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:56,490
-tskk-

600
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,500
We are saved

601
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,330
If you don't hold hand with somebody

602
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,760
That guy will attack you

603
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,990
Takahata-san

604
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,990
My hand.

605
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,900
Please do not let go of my hand

606
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,270
I will certainly not let go

607
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,680
Break it

608
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,990
You'll feel the enjoyment of it

609
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,590
Do not

610
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,580
Let's go.

611
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,300
Ichika.

612
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,780
Shun

613
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:02,730
-Tsk-

614
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,510
-So lonely again-

615
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,150
Thank goodness

616
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,160
I made it in time

617
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,630
Thank you.

618
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,520
Amaya?

619
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,400
I do not know

620
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,400
Although we started in the same room

621
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,340
He struck down after the puppets.

622
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,850
And goes with the person holding a key.

623
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,710
Shoko

624
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,530
It's been a long time.

625
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,700
Kotaro.

626
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,040
Ahh, What is this?

627
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,930
Could it be that

628
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,420
to seven people while inserting Seven Keys
-Seven people holding seven keys-

629
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:06,680
-will insert it and rotate it simultaneously-

630
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,930
How many are you people?

631
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,390
Only four of us

632
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,420
We are one person short

633
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,460
What does this mean?

634
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,780
It seems like seven people is required to gather.

635
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,730
And seven keys is needed to unlock it

636
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,330
For us to move to move forward.

637
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,810
How many keys do you have?

638
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,140
We have two.

639
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,980
We also have two.

640
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,630
Then we still need three keys and one other person.

641
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,060
Otherwise there is no way to open the door

642
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,290
Perhaps if we wait

643
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:34,570
Someone will finally..

644
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,307
You manage to play this far and you still
don't understand it yet.

645
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,920
Two minutes left

646
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,030
Anyway. Let's just go and look for..

647
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,380
That would be impossible.

648
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:49,590
We'll be speaking for two minutes

649
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,570
and no time to collect the three keys...

650
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,900
Amaya

651
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,619
So cool

652
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,499
Now we can finally clear this

653
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,040
but now one person has to...

654
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,380
No problem

655
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,529
The only reason I was with him is because 
I don't want to be turned into a kokeshi doll

656
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,260
He is now out of use.

657
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,100
Hey

658
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,500
Is he your friend?

659
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,200
A problem might bloom

660
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:45,200
if we go along with this madman.

661
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,060
We're friends, right Takahata Shun?

662
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,679
Come on time is running out

663
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,840
I know

664
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,289
Let's go Amaya

665
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,290
One

666
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,250
Two

667
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,200
-Finished.-

668
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,770
-Takahata Shun.-

669
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,569
-Akimoto Ichika.-

670
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,219
-Amaya Takeru.-

671
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,809
-Roku Eiji.-

672
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,559
-Maeda Kotaro.-

673
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,560
-Sanada Yukio.-

674
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,960
-Takase Shoko-

675
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,099
-This seven -

676
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,100
-survived-

677
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,100
-survived-

678
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,329
Put on your clothes

679
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,859
-You survived-

680
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,860
-You survived-

681
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,250
Why are my clothes in here

682
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,680
-Come-

683
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,770
-Come over here-

684
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:26,860
-Come here.-

685
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,970
-Do not stop.-

686
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,180
Please get out of the way

687
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,739
Please make way

688
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,409
Those people standing there 

689
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,380
Please make way.

690
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,649
That's why I'm asking

691
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:46,699
Where the heck is that video coming from

692
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,139
They failed to make it inside the cube right?

693
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,780
There is no way aliens contacted the media.

694
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:00,220
Children of God.

695
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:05,920
Children of God.

696
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:14,700
Children of God.

697
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,000
Where is this place?

698
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,170
Snow Palace

699
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:47,860
What the heck is it this time?

700
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,289
-Hello-

701
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,740
-I like the white color.-

702
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,250
-I really love pure white-

703
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,650
What?

704
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,460
-I hate dark hearted people.-

705
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:51,840
-That's is why you absolutely must tell the truth-

706
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:56,170
-Tell the truth and it would end.-

707
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,930
What do you mean?

708
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,360
-It's very simple-

709
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,999
-Everyone must please-

710
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,219
-Answer honestly to my question-

711
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,539
-If everyone says the truth-

712
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,540
-Then the game ends.-

713
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,019
-But if someone lied,-

714
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:23,699
-Then pick one person out every time as a sacrifice.-

715
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,179
-Please take note-

716
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,249
Sacrifice?

717
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,540
-So the first question is...-

718
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,280
-You.-

719
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,700
-What is your favorite food?-

720
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,920
Oh that is the question?

721
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,159
If it is those kind of question

722
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,920
Then we'll win it easily.

723
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,020
My favorite is

724
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,209
sushi

725
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,819
I like.

726
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,259
Ramen

727
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,880
Meat

728
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,580
Parsley

729
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,659
Curry

730
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,660
Omelette rice

731
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,890
Cream crepes.

732
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,079
-Do not lie.-

733
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,200
-Who is lying?-

734
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,639
-Within two minutes, the liar has to surrender-

735
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,529
-Otherwise, I would eat all the people-

736
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,400
-Two minutes left-

737
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,740
-Two minutes left-

738
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,100
Who lied?

739
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,759
Honestly answer the question.

740
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,039
So you're saying it's not you.

741
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,680
Of course it's not me

742
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,449
I did not lie

743
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,449
Where is the evidence?

744
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:07,620
Are you kidding me?

745
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:09,859
Evidence?

746
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,010
Where do you think you'll find an evidence here?

747
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,279
What is with your look?

748
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,479
Then Sanada-san, do you have an evidence with you?

749
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,890
I'd want to see

750
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,600
Guys please calm down.
I'm calm.

751
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,529
Pretending to be a good student when 
you're the most dubious one here.

752
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,459
I know Shun likes to eat curry

753
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,089
As for me

754
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,313
It doesn't matter if I eat 
egg three meals a day.

755
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,130
You sure are lying.

756
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,210
What?

757
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,680
-One minute left-

758
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,650
59

759
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:58,620
58

760
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,620
57

761
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,050
56

762
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:01,730
55

763
01:08:01,731 --> 01:08:03,139
We'll die
765

764
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,140
we have no time.

765
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,860
What now?

766
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,330
Ah you say like to eat parsley right

767
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:16,490
So?

768
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,099
Right

769
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:18,760
So?

770
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:19,900
Right

771
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,820
Right

772
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:27,849
Someone who eats that kind of thing has definitely a problem.

773
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,009
Everyone is different from each other.

774
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,690
Wait guys..

775
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:32,930
Right

776
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:34,639
It's definitely a problem

777
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,129
I agree.

778
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:37,840
What?

779
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,879
-The time is almost up-

780
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,440
-Who is the one who lied-

781
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,339
What?

782
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,340
It's you

783
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,920
It's you right

784
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,039
No

785
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,039
Not me

786
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,500
I really

787
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,340
like eating parsley

788
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,000
-Liars will have the same fate-

789
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,579
-So everyone pay attention, okay?-

790
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,129
-Let's move on to the next question.-

791
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:49,820
-Do you -

792
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:55,659
-like Takahata Shun-kun?-

793
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,880
-Yes or NO?-

794
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,219
No

795
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,220
No

796
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,570
This is kind of irritating huh...

797
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,960
Yes

798
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,500
-So how do the girls think?-

799
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,769
Well I've known him since we were a child

800
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,770
and if we consider that fact

801
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,160
I'd have to say

802
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,680
Yes

803
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:40,410
How come do I feel like you are just forced to say that?

804
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:54,260
My answer is, yes

805
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:09,979
-Very popular thing-

806
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,120
-This kid-

807
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,960
- Now how about yourself?-

808
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,880
I

809
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,530
No

810
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:44,090
I never liked myself

811
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,760
-You guys-

812
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,139
-Someone among you lied-

813
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,660
-Who is the one who lied?-

814
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,130
-Two minutes left-

815
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,770
-Two minutes.-

816
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,580
Who is it?

817
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,699
Please stop this right now!

818
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,700
Is it...

819
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,080
You

820
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,460
You tried to kill us before

821
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,619
But then you said you like Shun.

822
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,620
That would be odd.

823
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:43,420
The one I want to kill and love are at the same bar.

824
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,460
Takahata-kun.

825
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,250
Do not lie to yourself

826
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:58,460
You're saying you don't like yourself 

827
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,300
but you still exist now.

828
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,560
Say something.

829
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,560
It's really very suspicious

830
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,660
Originally

831
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,699
If everyone honestly answered the questions, everyone can be saved

832
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,540
Obviously, we don't need to lie.

833
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:33,700
But in the end, someone still lies

834
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,969
-You finally noticed the key in it.-

835
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,969
-That is because-

836
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:46,019
-One of us is among you-

837
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,180
- And puts a human like facade- 

838
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,239
-In order to kill all of you-

839
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,210
-By lying-

840
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,169
-You have to find this guy-

841
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,420
-Otherwise all you will truly die-

842
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,079
-I really hate it-

843
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,399
-Liars are dark-hearted people - 

844
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,900
-I like the white-

845
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,040
Among us

846
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,120
Someone is their accomplices.

847
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:35,639
There one minute left

848
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,199
59

849
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,600
58

850
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,679
We have no time.

851
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,220
Wait.

852
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:44,249
I think this maybe very simple.

853
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,170
What

854
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,249
because I know students that are in great Gakuen Heaven

855
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,619
for a while.

856
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,689
Takahata-kun

857
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:51,400
Ichika-san.

858
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,240
Amaya-kun

859
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:55,220
We met each other that time during the
High School meet, right?

860
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,280
Then

861
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,640
the enemy accomplice is

862
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:05,890
not her...

863
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:07,890
It's you, right?

864
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:11,199
The only one we don't know is only you.

865
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,170
No

866
01:15:12,171 --> 01:15:13,609
I did not lie

867
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,819
Both of us are friends in junior high

868
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,039
She could not be the enemy associates

869
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,119
That is even more suspicious

870
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,489
Those kind of people are actually the suspects most of the case.

871
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,090
What?

872
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:21,980
Are you sure it's not a trap?

873
01:15:21,981 --> 01:15:23,059
I believe Takase.

874
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,060
Do not be fooled by her beauty

875
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,919
15

876
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,900
14

877
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,680
13

878
01:15:28,681 --> 01:15:30,999
-You should hurry-

879
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,859
-or all of you would die-

880
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,769
-Do you really know -

881
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,010
-Who is the traitor?-

882
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,659
10

883
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,969
9

884
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,479
8

885
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,649
7

886
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,040
6

887
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,289
5

888
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,289
It's her

889
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,609
Stop that.. you

890
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,610
I said stop that.

891
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,850
Stop

892
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,740
I did not lie.

893
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,360
I

894
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,640
really like Takahata.

895
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:09,560
Please do not let go of my hand.

896
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:27,570
-Awww.. It's sad..

897
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,460
-She is really a human being-

898
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:03,049
-Okay next question-

899
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,009
Wait a moment

900
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:08,200
-Why are you interupting me-

901
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,520
I know

902
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:21,640
In the end who is lying

903
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,260
I know

904
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,610
You finally noticed.

905
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,220
Who is it?

906
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,250
The true liar is....

907
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,410
It's you!

908
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:12,119
I realized it from the start

909
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,120
How did that happened?

910
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:18,569
This game from the start is a lie.

911
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:24,290
He said that one of us is their associate. 
It's actually a lie.

912
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:27,139
It's Takase

913
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,680
It's Takase's blood

914
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,460
which told me the truth.

915
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:51,820
You don't like white things 

916
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,240
-You saw it-

917
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,960
Takahata.

918
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,039
Oh.

919
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:28,690
Hot

920
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,400
It's so hot!

921
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:35,080
I will burn to death.

922
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:51,260
The way to clear it is not to tell you the truth but

923
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,500
to realized you're not what pure white bear

924
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,720
but a terrible black bear

925
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,080
A devil bear

926
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,620
-The game has ended.-

927
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,849
-Takahata Shun.-

928
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:20,560
-Takeshi Akimoto- 
-Takeru Amaya-

929
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:26,259
-Roku Eiji-
-Maeda Kotaro-

930
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,809
-These five people.-

931
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:32,960
-Survived Survived.-

932
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,020
Please do not run.

933
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:10,319
What will appear next?

934
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,699
Probably.

935
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,720
A game with "ma" at the beginning of it

936
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,970
Ma.

937
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,579
What, did you not notice it?

938
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:24,440
The oppenents before have names
that are connected like shirotori

939
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,439
Shirotori?

940
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,440
Right Shiritori.

941
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,520
The first is Daruma.

942
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,050
Then Maneki Neko

943
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,500
Kokeshi

944
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:44,300
Followed by Shiro Kuma

945
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,579
That's right.

946
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,089
Yes.

947
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:55,459
So what is the game with "ma" in the beggining of it.

948
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,000
Such as...

949
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:24,180
Matryoshka Matryoshka

950
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,740
-You guys actually made it here.-

951
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,960
-This is the last hurdle.-

952
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:53,080
-So let's us happily play it to end everyone.-

953
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:55,540
This is the last

954
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,859
What is it you want to play?

955
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,300
-It will be-

956
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,419
Kicked the jar

957
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:10,420
Then it would end.

958
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:13,940
Kick jar?

959
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,459
-The rules are very simple-

960
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:22,860
-The monster will take the can from above-

961
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,060
-and put it in the designated place-

962
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:32,050
-The players will hide while he is at it-

963
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,210
-After the countdown, the monster will-

964
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,900
-search around for the players.-

965
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:44,239
-If the players face is seen by the monster and the monster-

966
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,459
-Stepped at the can while shouting their name -

967
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:52,379
-That person will be caught.-

968
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,779
-Anyone who is caught -

969
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,420
-will be held in a prison cell-

970
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,319
-If a person who isn't caught yet, kicked the jar-

971
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,689
-Before the monster sees them, then- 

972
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,209
-Everyone will be released from being caught.-

973
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:10,380
-But the can will explode by the time it's kicked-

974
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:15,769
-So in order to save everyone-

975
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,930
-One would sacrifice himself-

976
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,779
-It's very interesting right?-

977
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,599
-The game will end if-

978
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,419
-The last man claims victory-

979
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:33,449
-or the other way around where the it-

980
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:37,980
-caughts three or more people to victory Hey.-

981
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:42,780
The game is kicked jar where people would die

982
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,599
Death-defying Kick Jar game

983
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,129
-Stop it please... This game would be fun to play-

984
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:54,160
-So who will become it-

985
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,920
-Draw lots to decide it-

986
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,140
-One, Two-

987
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,809
I am the it

988
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,809
What the hell?

989
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:17,809
Why is it the most troublesome guy?

990
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:23,240
-The time limit is until the sun sets-

991
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,289
-Go ahead-

992
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:31,319
-Game Start-

993
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,320
Let's go

994
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,939
The start here is the most important.

995
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,339
Until that guys gets the can

996
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,519
We should escape as far as we can..

997
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,880
Good

998
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,570
-Amazing-

999
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:10,120
We've run this far. We'll be alright here.

1000
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,680
There is about one hour before the sunset.

1001
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,080
If we don't move until then, we will not be found.

1002
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,280
Too easy

1003
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:23,420
No, it's impossible.

1004
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:31,080
What were your names again?

1005
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,280
Damn

1006
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,299
What was it?

1007
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,040
Ah I remembered..

1008
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,699
Roku-kun 
Kotaro-kun

1009
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,160
Found them.

1010
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,920
Sure enough, the guy is not normal.

1011
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:09,280
It feels like he is looking right here...

1012
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,200
Go ahead.

1013
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,890
Go ahead do it quickly.

1014
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,769
You go

1015
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:43,770
No Ickika .. Ichika....

1016
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:57,000
Akimoto Ickika, found you.

1017
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:41,419
It's all over.

1018
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:47,159
Takahata will not sacrifice himself to save our lives

1019
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:54,250
It's alright. I don't think he would sacrifice Ichika.

1020
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,410
Damn!

1021
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:01,100
The moment the sun goes down

1022
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,720
We are also finished

1023
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,330
What should I do?

1024
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:10,860
What will I do?

1025
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:17,490
Takahata, do you hear me?

1026
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:20,999
I caught already three people

1027
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,680
so I will be able to survive this.

1028
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,050
That is why I'm not going to arrest you.

1029
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,259
Do not worry about it.

1030
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:33,739
So when the time limit ends

1031
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,420
Two people will survive this

1032
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,440
Survive

1033
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,209
We are chosen by Gods

1034
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:47,200
We can survive in the new world.

1035
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,420
New World

1036
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:54,440
You are also looking forward to this world

1037
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,620
Like me.

1038
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,130
I

1039
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,639
I...

1040
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:08,720
Shun, can you hear me?

1041
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:17,130
Honestly, I really hate you.

1042
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,759
You always stay away from other people.

1043
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,079
Always making promises and breaks it

1044
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:32,090
Always able to read my mind

1045
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:39,060
I do not want to see your face.

1046
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,680
So...

1047
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:51,820
So never get out

1048
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,239
You should not believe

1049
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,730
What this guy is saying

1050
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:02,940
Just quickly escape from here

1051
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:05,840
Understand me

1052
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,760
Ichika.

1053
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:20,260
Shun and you are simply not the same

1054
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:25,179
Shun is gentler and stronger than you

1055
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,960
and you are completely different.

1056
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:07,489
Takahata.

1057
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:09,489
We're friends, right?

1058
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:12,039
The game will be over

1059
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,320
Believe me, go out of your hiding place

1060
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:18,139
I understand

1061
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:20,720
I will come out right now.

1062
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:24,820
Shun, please not be fooled

1063
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,979
I kept you waiting

1064
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,980
Ichika.

1065
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:07,650
The rule states that in order the to catch someone, 
you should first see their face then shout their name 
before arresting them.

1066
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:13,099
So you can't see my face behind this mask

1067
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,100
That fool

1068
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,719
What the heck is he doing?

1069
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,729
It's true that in that way he would be
able to hide his face and

1070
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:25,459
guard himself from the explosion when he kicks the can

1071
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:27,460
but that way

1072
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:33,240
he could easily be caught and have his mask removed.

1073
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,899
Takahata-kun, why are you doing all this ruckus?

1074
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,959
Come, Amaya

1075
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,040
I will be your opponent.

1076
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:59,089
What now?

1077
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:01,940
I thought you want to be my opponent.

1078
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,649
Shun, Run away!

1079
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:14,280
In my opinion, that armor is very unwise of you.

1080
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:28,260
Takahata-kun, found you

1081
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:01,100
You're actually right, Amaya

1082
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:04,939
I still think that

1083
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:08,759
all the boring nonsense in this world

1084
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,980
should all be destroyed.

1085
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,090
I also joked with the Gods about it.

1086
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:20,960
But absolutely not like this.

1087
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,500
Now I know how is it to lost something I treasure

1088
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,690
I was a fool

1089
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:32,129
I only felt the sense of being alive when 
I'm at the brink of death.

1090
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,200
I'm really a fool

1091
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,060
We have the right to be alive.

1092
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:42,960
Important things seem trivial

1093
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:48,090
Those boring days are the best.

1094
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,520
Sorry, Amaya

1095
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:56,890
I'm not like you.

1096
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,170
Don't worry

1097
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,410
I don't intend to help you from the start.

1098
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,369
Even if you are struggling that much

1099
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:14,719
As soon as I step on the can and say your name

1100
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,300
You lose

1101
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,980
That's not it...

1102
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:23,659
Wearing this armor is not to hide my face

1103
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:26,770
Nor to protect myself from the explosion

1104
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,740
This is for this

1105
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,340
Shun.

1106
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,030
Enough.

1107
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:19,360
Please stop this. 

1108
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,840
Shun.

1109
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:30,510
Satoke and Shoko-chan

1110
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,450
Surely, I still wants to do a lot of things.

1111
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:57,280
but

1112
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,200
Saying that we are chosen by God.

1113
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:09,130
If this world is created by God.

1114
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:21,220
What the hell is wrong with God?

1115
01:41:21,230 --> 01:41:24,880
Shun!!! No!!!

1116
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:29,210
Takahata

1117
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:31,530
It's going to explode.

1118
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,340
Huh?

1119
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:35,450
-The Game ended-

1120
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:40,140
-Because Takahata Shun rescued the people who were arrested-

1121
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:44,350
-Amaya Takeru's catch totalled into zero-

1122
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:47,270
-Therefore he is out-

1123
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:54,330
-Akimoto Ichika-
-Roku Eiji.-

1124
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,990
-Maeda Kotaro- 
-and lastly Takahata Shun-

1125
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,750
-You Won-

1126
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:03,920
Thank goodness

1127
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:07,580
Although it's a little bit unclear why

1128
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,330
We actually survived?

1129
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,750
We won?

1130
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:14,990
But why didn't it explode?

1131
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,610
-Ah that-

1132
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:19,160
-That is a lie-

1133
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:20,660
Huh?

1134
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:23,790
-Because it is more interesting that way right?-

1135
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,360
You guys, don't mess with me.

1136
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:34,110
I'm chosen by Gods

1137
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:36,200
How can I die here?

1138
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:39,880
-Huh? Die here? What are you saying?-

1139
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:44,190
-From the start everyone is-

1140
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:47,180
-Happily playing the game-

1141
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:51,690
-No one said that those who lost will die ah ha ha ha-

1142
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,740
Is that really true?

1143
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:01,970
That.

1144
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:24,370
-Everyone-

1145
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,750
-All of you worked hard to reach it here-

1146
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:32,350
We really...

1147
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,079
We really are still alive the ah

1148
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,150
Thank goodness.

1149
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:40,690
-This is a reward for everyone-

1150
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:46,240
When you finished, we will send you back home.

1151
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:14,760
It's really beautiful.

1152
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,650
Hey, Ichika.

1153
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:26,410
After we get out of here

1154
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:31,570
Let go out and eat something delicious.

1155
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:34,570
After that...

1156
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:37,870
Let's see some movies.

1157
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:40,440
Okay.

1158
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:42,920
Also after that...

1159
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:49,910
Let's do a lot of things together, Ichika.

1160
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:04,180
Also my mother wants me to clean up the storage room.

1161
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:05,960
You haven't still done that.

1162
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,110
Mom and Dad would probably

1163
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:22,390
wants me train.

1164
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,530
But now i think

1165
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,120
It's not bad at all

1166
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,090
It's delicious

1167
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:13,590
Hmm.. I got a lucky.

1168
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,560
What is it ?

1169
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,510
Sorry, Shun.

1170
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,440
I

1171
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:40,700
won't be able to go to the movies with you

1172
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:56,350
-Everyone-

1173
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:00,980
-In order to live this far- 
-"Intelligence"-

1174
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:03,130
-"Physical Strenght"-

1175
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,260
-'Imagination"-

1176
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:08,510
-You've been able to display all of that-

1177
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:10,660
-And we know you lot worked very hard-

1178
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:12,880
-But there is..-

1179
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:17,120
-One last necessary thing-

1180
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:18,470
-And that is-

1181
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:30,460
"luck"?

1182
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,440
Shun

1183
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:43,980

1184
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:50,030
I like you a little bit.

1185
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:19,240
Bye-bye

1186
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,860
-Luck-

1187
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:05,670
Ichika

1188
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:40,250
What the hell is this?

1189
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,240
What the hell?

1190
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,280
-Takahata Shun.-

1191
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:10,240
-Amaya Takeru-

1192
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:14,640
-Survived Survived-

1193
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:36,290
The cube is finally here.

1194
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,830
The surviving teenager finally appeared.

1195
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,360
Takumi-chan

1196
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:49,690

1197
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:53,880
I will go out

1198
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,810
Where are you going to?

1199
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:01,690
To save the world.

1200
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:06,420
Do not come back too late ah 
Children of God, Children of God

1201
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Children of God

1202
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,300
God doesn't exist.

1203
01:52:57,030 --> 01:52:59,160
-Well, you are wrong-

1204
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,260

-God-
