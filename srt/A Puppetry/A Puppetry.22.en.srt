One day,

they found out

Yuji Dead Raising Sorcery.

107
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:51,900
Therefore,

108
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,860
they separated this sorcery into two

109
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,770
and keep them separately.

110
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,690
They promised not to meet for good.

111

We, Gu Clan

112
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,900
moved to the northern side

113

and never enter Centre Plains

114
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,530
per my late Master's order.

115
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,860
However, a while ago,

116
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,900
the secret sorcery of Gu was stolen.

117
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,060
And I came here while searching for it.

118
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,620
My ancestor has said

119
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,810
that evil sorcery never exists,

120
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,690
but evil minds exist.

121
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,090
Gu sorcery can harm

122
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,140
and rescue people.

123
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,370
It all depends on the conscience
of the person who performs the sorcery.

124
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,210
Musician Song.

125
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,900
This is the Gu insect pair from my clan.

126
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,650
One is male and the other is female.

127
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,770
Both of them are born and grow together.

128
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,690
This is the sole pair.

129
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,250
Hopefully, it can be of your help.

130
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,650
It's said

131
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,140
that there's one Yuji Puppet

132
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,060

of Yuji Clan to return.
