Here ends the ceremony.

24
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,900
The Chief is in power

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,290
and all people shall submit
to Her Grace.

Kneel.

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,420
Matriarchy applies to the Puppet Clan.

Your mother

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
drained herself off for the Puppet Clan.

30
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,730
And the position of the next chief

31

will be taken over by you.

32

I, Moyu, will strive with all my might

and pass it down to the next generation.

The chief of the Puppet Clan

has the totem of Iris on them.

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,380
Once the chief is in danger,

the Yuji Puppet can sense her.

39

To protect the sentient beings,

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,740
you have to sacrifice your body

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,610
to restore peace to the world in return.

42

As the chief of the Puppet Clan,

I'll stay as long as
the clan still stands.

there's still hope.

68
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,420
I'm the successor of the Puppet Clan.

69
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,300
Many years ago, I was adopted
by the troupe leader

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,900
and was protected by the Chen family.

71
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,090
Now that the secret Puppet sorcery
was stolen

72
