38
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,290
I saw you

holding the same

40

puppet.

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,860
I thought

42
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,860
about making an identical one

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,250
so that I could give them
to you in pairs.

44
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,250
I made it for you.

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,100
It must

46
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,690
have taken you a long time.

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,420
It's okay.

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,500
I was bored anyway.

49
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,330
I watch you tinker with them every day

50
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,540
and I pick up bits here and there.

I...

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,690
Just now,

53
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,370
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

54
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,650
Sorry.

55
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,010
I was being too inconsiderate

56
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,970
when I burned that letter.

57
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,940
But I promise you

58
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,780
it's for your own good.

59

the Chen Theater Troupe and Master

64

were all I had.

65
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,090
My biological parents

66
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,810
abandoned me by the troupe's entrance.

67
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,220
Master

68
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,660
raised me

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,050
as one of his own.

70
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,810
He gave me a home

71
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,690
and taught me how to be independent.

72
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,970
