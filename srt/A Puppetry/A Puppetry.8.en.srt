Bravo!

00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,020
Every one of you has witnessed

the talent

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,540
of Miss Xiaoxiao just now.

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,700
Misters, you have known

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,940
the rules of the brothel.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,810
If you intend to spend a night with her,

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,020
the person goes to the highest bid.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,260
If you intend to buy back her freedom...

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,890
Of course, I want to redeem her.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,300
That's right.

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:44,780
- Good.
- Redeem her.

The auction starts now.

18

The person with the highest bid

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,940
will possess Miss Xiaoxiao.

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,300
You can buy back her freedom

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,820
and take her home.

22
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,660
How much does Miss Xiaoxiao worth?

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,460
Due to her special identity,

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,260
we're starting at 30 taels.

25

Madam Hua.

26

This is not the price

we've discussed.

28
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,780
Plans always fall behind changes.

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,500
Just stay silent.

45 taels from Young Master Chen.

34
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,850
Are any there more bids
higher than 45 taels?

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,420
I'll pay 60 taels.

36
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,580
60 taels from Lord Zhang.

37
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,970
Are there any more bids

38

higher than 60 taels?

39

60 taels?

40
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,180
He's a notorious philanderer

41
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,580
and has many mistresses.

42
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,140
This puppeteer

43
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,580
is doomed to suffer.

44
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,460
I hereby announce

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,330
Xiaoxiao belongs to Lord Zhang.

46
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,780
Congratulations, Lord Zhang.

47
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,330
I'll hand Xiaoxiao over to you then.

48
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,730
Please take good care of her.

49
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,610
Sure thing.

50
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,580
- Go back with me.
- No.

51
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,610
Whatever.

52
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,370
I'm telling you

53
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,690
none of you

54
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,460
can take her away.

55
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,780
Who are you, brat?

56
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,460
Get him.

57
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,500
Let go of him.

58
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,690
- Don't pull him.
- Let go of me.

59
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,250
Just go with me.

60
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,370
- Stop it.
- No.

61
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,580
Sir,

62
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,730
what's the matter?

63
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,900
I'll take this young lady

64
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,540
with me.

65
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,370
Unfortunately,

66
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,220
Lord Zhang has bought her.

67
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,500
Well,

68
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,050
do you favour

69
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,370
other ladies?

70
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,220
(Token)
I'll pay 100 taels.

71
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,610
No problem.

72
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,090
Miss Xiaoxiao,

73
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,610
please come with me.

74
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,090
As expected from

75
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,420
the puppeteer of Chen Theatre Troupe.

76
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,860
I love watching the theatre show.

77
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,140
Back then,

78
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:35,970
I've seen Troupe Leader Chen...

79
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,140
(I see.)

80
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,970
Troupe Leader Chen was dynamic

81
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,860
and skilful.

82
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,890
How pitiful of him

83
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,300
to end up in this way.

84
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,220
What a shame.

85
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,090
Then,

86
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,420
do you

87
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,020
know my master?

88
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,330
We only met each other once.

89
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,020
The rumour has it
that Troupe Leader Chen

90
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,090
had received a puppet.

91
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,300
And a curse

92
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,420
was put on the puppet.

93
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,500
And that's the reason

94
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,090
why the entire Chen Theater Troupe
perished in the fire.

95
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,500
Why not

96
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,530
venture out

97
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,530
into the capital city?

98
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,970
The capital is a bustling place.

99
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,690
There are big theatres

100
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,020
and various kinds of music pieces.

101
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,300
At the place,

102
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,380
you carve out a niche of your own

103
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,740
and carry forward the puppetry.

104
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,970
The Puppet Festival today

105
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,740
was going very well.

106
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,810
Liu Xiaoxiao from Chen Theatre Troupe
triumphed over others.

107
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,610
Keep a close eye on Liu Xiaoxiao.

108
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,300
(Memory Table of Beloved Master,
Chen Shide)

109
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,220
Old man.

110
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,450
I came to visit you.

111
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,780
Back then,

112
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,660
you were always not satisfied
with my puppet performance.

113
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,660
However, I have

114
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,530
triumphed over others

115
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,380
by myself.

116
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,940
Don't you regret it?

117
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,970
I've thought it over.

118
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,090
In the future,

119
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,780
I'll enhance and glorify

120
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,660
Chen Theatre Troupe

121
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,220
as fulfilling your last wish.

122
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,890
You better watch out.

123
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,020
My skills will definitely surpass yours.

Could it be this?

Add some more ingredients.
