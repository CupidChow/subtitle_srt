00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,530
And I regard

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,740
you as my confidante,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,650
my most trustworthy friend.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,340
In the end, you want us

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,610
to work together

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,890
for your business
and your personal gain.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,690
You don't care about my feelings.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,650
I'm baffled.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,540
Do you feel remorseful now?

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,050
Why are you here?

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,810
You think an apology

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,730
is all it takes for me to forgive you?

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,620
No way.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,780
Xiaoxiao.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,330
Youhai.

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,330
It's you.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,420
Come in.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,050
What is this?

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,170
What is this?

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,300
The birthday present

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,500
I prepared for you.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,210
I couldn't give it to you
because of the fire.

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,690
Fortunately, I kept it somewhere safe

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,690
so it wasn't burned.

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,180
When I made my escape,

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,290
I brought it with me.

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,970
Now that we are finally reunited,

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,820
I want you to have it.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,050
I love it.

32
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,220
Thank you, Youhai.

33
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,460
Xiaoxiao.

34
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,420
Actually...

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,330
What again this time?

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,820
What's the matter?

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,290
Ouch.

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,730
My leg.

39
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,860
What's going on?

40
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,370
My leg.

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,050
Stop pretending.

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,330
Your shoes are dry.

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,330
Why are you yelling?

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,650
(I can't let you two hang out
in private.)

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,650
Song, if everything is all right,

46
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,460
you should retire early.

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,050
Xiaoxiao and I

48
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,140
need to discuss something.

49
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,460
Youhai.

50
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,460
Don't.

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,860
I already ordered something.

52
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,650
The food will be here soon.

53
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,540
Youhai.

54
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,370
I know

55
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,970
you have had

56
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,330
a long journey.

57
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,690
On behalf of Xiaoxiao,

58
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,460
I ordered a feast

59
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,820
to welcome you.

60
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,730
On account

61
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,810
of my sincerity,

62
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,890
you won't turn me down, will you?

63
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,420
Not bad.

64
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,660
Where did you

65
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,300
find food this late at night?

66
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,300
I heard Lin'An has food delivery

67
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,580
so I ordered some.

68
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,500
Food delivery?

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,090
It's when you

70
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,890
order something in advance
from a restaurant

71
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,890
and have it delivered to you
at a specific time.

72
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,860
It's

73
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,940
very convenient.

74
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:46,970
Here.

75
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,780
A toast from me.

76
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,250
Today

77
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,420
is the day

78
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,250
Xiaoxiao

79
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,530
and Youhai

80
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,140
reunited.

81
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,810
Youhai escaped from death

82
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,740
so a celebration is in order.

83
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,500
Don't you think?

84
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,140
Here.

85
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,020
Drink up.

86
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,810
Shouldn't we

87
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,690
celebrate it?

88
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,330
Come.

89
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,780
Cheers.

90
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,530
I admit

91
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,500
that I

92
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,970
mishandled what happened today.

93
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,580
I would like to apologize.

94
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,690
I'll drink as my punishment.

95
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,380
Youhai.

96
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,020
Come.

97
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,300
Drink with me.

98
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,020
It's just drinking between men.

99
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,940
Don't be hesitant.

100
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,380
Drink it

101
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,250
and we'll be like brothers in arms.

102
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,250
That's it.

103
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,380
Good.

104
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,300
Since Xiaoxiao

105
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,940
and I are very close,

106
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,860
can you

107
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,860
be my Eldest Martial Brother

108
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,890
too?

109
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,140
Youhai, the Eldest Martial Brother.

110
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,660
Youhai.

111
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,300
Now that

112
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,330
both of you are reunited,

113
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,220
you need

114
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,090
to find out

115
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,860
the truth

116
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,610
behind the fire.

117
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,140
Don't worry.

118
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,580
I will help Xiaoxiao out

119
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,450
with all I can.

120
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,090
Xiaoxiao.

121
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,660
You see,

122
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,050
in this journey,

123
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,450
I have made a lot of contributions.

124
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,220
Please don't be mad at me.

125
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,690
You're not worth my time.

126
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,380
Xiaoxiao.

127
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,860
Youhai.

128
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,090
You saw that, didn't you?

129
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,650
Talk to her for me, will you?

130
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,970
Xiaoxiao...

131
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,930
Thank you, Youhai.

132
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,020
I know I can count on you.

133
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,420
Xiaoxiao told me

134
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,460
a lot about you.

135
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,860
A lot of good things.

136
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,250
You're like my idol now.

137
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,530
Here, let me give you another toast.

138
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,860
(I frequent nightclubs a lot.)

139
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,620
(I'm sure you'll pass out before I do.)

140
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,580
Youhai.

141
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,060
Let me fill it up for you.

142
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,090
Another glass, Youhai.

143
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,930
You drank so much.

144
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,770
Are you puking now?

145
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,460
Song Keyang.

146
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,060
How could you make him drink this much?

147
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,860
Are you all right, Youhai?

148
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,810
I'll bring him back to his room.

149
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,770
Youhai.

150
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,770
We'll drink again next time.

151
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,530
Careful!

152
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,770
My idol!

153
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,580
(I bet you had)

154
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,740
(many things to tell Xiaoxiao tonight.)

155
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,460
(However, now that you're stuck here,)

156
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,860
(you can't do anything.)

157
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,300
Xiaoxiao.

158
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,530
Xiaoxiao.

159
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,490
Xiaoxiao.

160
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,020
Come in.

161
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,580
You know,

162
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,650
Hai...

163
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,770
I mean Youhai.

164
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,490
I told him to stop drinking

165
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,340
but he insisted on drinking.

166
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,810
I couldn't stop him

167
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,580
and this is what happened.

168
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,530
Fortunately, I'm good

169
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,650
at looking after others.

170
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,650
I put him in a comfortable place

171
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,650
in our room.

172
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,530
He will sleep it off.

173
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,180
Xiaoxiao.

174
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,810
You care a lot

175
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,210
about Youhai, don't you?
