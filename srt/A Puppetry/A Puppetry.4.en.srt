Xiaoxiao.

Are you okay?

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm fine, Youhai.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,930
But he

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,890
is a musician.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,220
Now that he has left,

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,810
how should we explain it to Master?

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,060
I'll talk to Master.

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,140
You're the priority here.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,730
Don't worry.

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,130
The Chen Theater Troupe

14
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,730
will not let

15
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,780
any harm come to you.

16
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,890
Just let us handle everything.

17
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,570
Youhai.

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,050
It's all my fault.

19
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,100
I was

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,050
too immature back then.

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,690
I won't loiter around anymore.

22
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:44,850
Can...

23
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,050
Can we

24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,460
remain inseparable

25
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,890
like we used to be?

26
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,660
Of course.

27
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,780
I hope

28
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,890
we will never separate.

29
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,660
We will just be like back then.

30
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,300
Like Youhe who volunteered

31
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,100
to brew you some congee

32
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,530
but ended up almost burning himself.

33
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,500
All right. I'll get going.

34
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,660
Where are you going, Youhai?

35
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,850
The puppet show
will have to be canceled.

36
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,170
I need to talk to Master.

37
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:10,530
See you.

38
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,730

You liar.

43
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,140
You opportunist.

44
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,650
You would frame me.

45
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,900
Apologize to me now.

46
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,650
Why am I this ugly in your drawing?

47
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,580
Give it back.

48
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,780
You're mad now?

49
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,370
I had to do

50
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,050
what I did just now.

51
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,140
Here.

52
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,180
Best wine in Chenmen Town.

53
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,930
I bought this to apologize.

54
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,650
Now, you're being kind.

55
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,370
So you were making a fool
out of me just now?

56
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,290
No.

57
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,010
Then?

58
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,690
I...

59
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,610
I get it now.

60
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,780
You and Youhai...

61
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,970
You like him.

62
00:01:59,540 --> 00:01:59,900
So

63
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,250
you pretended to be
a damsel in distress.

64
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,860
Did I get it right?

65
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,330
What are you on about?

66
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,900
They are like my family.

67
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,180
Don't rule everything out this quickly.

68
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,370
There is always a possibility.

69
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,500
Indeed.

70
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,180
I believe in that too.

71
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,780
What do you mean?

72
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,580
That's a long story.

73
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,420
Tomorrow.

74
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,970
I'll tell you tomorrow.

75
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,170
Master.

76
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,970
Yes?

77
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,890
That new musician was a pervert.

78
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,610
He took advantage of Xiaoxiao

79
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,090
and was kicked out by me.

80
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,970
What happened?

81
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,860
I had dealt with it.

82
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,740
Xiaoxiao is fine now.

83
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
The new musician

84
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,740
can play very well.

85
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,450
I wanted him

86
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,330
to perform

87
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,780
with you.

88
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,220
After all,

89
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,450
you poured your soul into this play.

90
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,780
Now that you kicked him out,

91
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,050
what should we do with your play?

92
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,660
Master, you know me very well.

93
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,890
I always believe

94
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,300
a good play will remain captivating
regardless of when it's performed.

95
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,500
You'll cancel it?

96
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,380
I was framed by someone

97
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,970
and was expelled
from the Chen Theater Troupe.

98
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,660
What tomorrow?

99
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,420
I'll figure out a way tomorrow.

100
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,940
Pinkie promise.

101
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,140
You know this?

102
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,660
Why wouldn't I?

103
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,090
Tomorrow,

104
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,740
I'll explain everything

105
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
to you.

106
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,660
I have one more condition.

107
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,220
What again this time?

108
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,970
I'll be the Eldest Martial Brother.

109
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,090
You'll have to obey me.

110
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,140
What? Why?

111
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,660
Never mind then.

112
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm not the one apologizing anyway.

113
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,300
Listen. What's the matter with you?

114
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,450
I know I crossed you

115
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,890
so please be as generous as you can

116
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,970
and forgive me.

117
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,020
If you won't forgive me,

118
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,690
I won't be able to sleep at night.

119
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,660
Pinkie promise.

120
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:45,940
Deal.

121
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,780
All right.

122
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,890
See you tomorrow.

123
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,970
See you tomorrow.

No.

I have to go back to the troupe.

accept this.

138

What do you mean?

it's been a day?
