That's right.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,180
The key point to everything

16
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,570
is the fire of Chen Theatre Troupe.

What about Master?

42
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,530
That day, I escaped

from the fire.

44
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,500
It took me half a month to recover.

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,450
Later, I heard

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,020
that someone performed puppet shows

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,740
in Chen Theatre Troupe's name.

48
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,300
I thought it must be you.

49
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,450
So, I came here

50
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,090
while searching for you.

51
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,330
Did you

52
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,300
notice someone suspicious

53
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,810
at that time?

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,860
I received a secret letter

55
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,940
saying that the fire case at
Chen Theatre Troupe wasn't an accident.

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,090
I have no idea

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,330
if Master had a beef with anyone.

58
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,090
But, since you've received this message.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,970
It means that's possible.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,780

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,220
and all the disciples.

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,450
But, I'm glad to see

69
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,500
that you're a good troupe leader

70

will be proud of you.

I was going to look for you.

Look, it's Youhai.

85
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,690
I saw him.

86
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,740
You jerk.

87

Let go of him.

90
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,810
Why are you helping him instead?

91
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,890
No.

92
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,140
I misunderstood him previously.

He's a good guy.

94
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,900
It was him taking care of me before.

95
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,770
Let go of him.

96
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,140
Are you sure?

97
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,900
Of course.

Don't you believe in her?

99
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,740
We know each other
since we were young.

100

Don't you try to break us.

Well.

103
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,970
It's just a misunderstanding.

104
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,620
Enough said.

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,770
Youhai

106

managed to survive the fire.

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,740
No matter what,

108
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,580
from now on,

109
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
we're

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,420
one family.

111
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:54,810
By the way,

112
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,490
give it to me.

113
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:55,810
The letter.

114
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,060
I want to show him.

115
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,090
Why did you tell him everything?

116
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,460
He's my Eldest Martial Brother.

117
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,300
I can tell him everything.

118
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:01,690
Come.

119
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,060
Give it to me.

120
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,420
I've burnt it.

121
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,090
Stop messing around.

122
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,930
Give it to me now.

123
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,930
Perhaps he can figure out something.

124
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm not messing around. I've burnt it.

125
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,620
Why did you burn the letter?

126
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,460
How am I going to investigate then?

127
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,300
Well, Xiaoxiao.

128
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,580
Think carefully.

129
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,860
This letter is definitely nonsense.

130
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,930
Everything is going on well
as we collaborate on the performance.

131
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,180
You're going to perform
in the palace soon

132
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,140
yet you haven't come out with the plot.

133
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,300
Let's go back

134
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,180
and think of the story.

135
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,770
The story, my foot.

136
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,180
This concerns

137
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,090
my master's death.

138
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,580
Do you think

139
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
the letter speaks
from some sort of hearsay?

140

Youhai.

141
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,900
Let's leave here.
