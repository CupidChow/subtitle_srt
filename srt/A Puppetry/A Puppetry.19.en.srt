Youhai.

Let's go.

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:13,770
(Chen Youhai)

(is the culprit.)

(Now, they claim to have found
an eyewitness.)

00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,050
(That's impossible.)

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,450
(Something has changed again?)

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,890
(This is bad.)

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,340
(Xiaoxiao might be in danger.)

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,570
(If Song Keyang follows me,)

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,730
(that means he wants to kill
the eyewitness.)

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,460
(Cry if you're sad.)

(you can get back on your feet
as soon as possible.)

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,730
Master.

My seniors.

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,100
I will kill the culprit

24
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,780
to avenge all of you.

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,780
Who are you?

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,780
You? How can this be?

27
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,050
Xiaoxiao.

28
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,740
Xiaoxiao.

29
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,500
Listen.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,300
You came at a great time.

31
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,970
I modified

32
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,050
the plot of the play.

33
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,970
Would you care to listen to it?

34
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,380
Once upon a time,

35
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,170
there was a girl.

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,740
She lived in a performance troupe

37
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,780
with her Master

38
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,660
and her seniors.

39
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,220
She had

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,050
a carefree

41
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,690
and happy life.

42
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,330
However,

43
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,420
everything

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,220
changed

45
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,780
after a fire.

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,690
(She couldn't save her Master)

47
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,330
(and she)

48
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,050
(was rescued by a musician.)

49
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,300
This musician

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,140
helped her a lot.

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,020
(He gave her)

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,740
(Don't worry, I'm here)
(the will to live.)

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,420
Nice to meet you,

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,330
Song Keyang.

55
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,660
(They performed in many places)

56
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,810
(and shared many)

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,050
(beautiful memories.)

58
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,890
(Together,)

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,530
(they helped and relied)

60
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,690
(on each other.)

61
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
(They became each other's)

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,330
(confidante.)

63
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,940
Unfortunately,

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,530
it was all

65
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,170
an elaborate scheme.

66
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,330
The man

67
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,530
killed the girl's Master
and her seniors.

68
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,500
He then pretended to be her friend.

69
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,740
The man

70
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,370
was the mastermind after all.

71
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,650
Did I get it right,

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,060
Song Keyang?

73
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,180
You

74
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,340
are the man in black.

75
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,060
Xiaoxiao.

76
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,970
There must be

77
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,140
a misunderstanding somewhere.

78
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,860
A misunderstanding?

79
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,810
You were rejected
by the Chen Theater Troupe.

80
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,250
In an act of spite, you

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,860
burned the ship to murder us.

82
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,580
Xiaoxiao.

83
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,970
I followed you yesterday

84
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
because I was worried about you.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,770
That's why I...

86
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,900
You still want to lie to me

87
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,490
until now.

88
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm not lying.

89
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,020
I was set up.

90
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,740
Yesterday,

91
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,140
I saw Youyao too.

92
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,900
He isn't dead.

93
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,860
He's in the mountain.

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,740
Song Keyang.

95
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,300
Did you hear

96
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,420
what you just said?

97
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,460
You killed the troupe members.

98
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,420
You lied to Xiaoxiao.

99
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,860
You are evil.

100
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,250
Now that the truth has been revealed,

101
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,770
you should surrender yourself.

102
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,620
Chen Youhai.

103
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,650
Enough with your accusations.

104
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,140
Stop it!

105
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,580
Xiaoxiao.

106
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,900
The performance is around the corner.

107
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,140
It's too late

108
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,860
to make new puppets now.

109
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,020
After careful consideration,

110
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,690
you'll have to be the Flesh Puppet

111
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,340
to carry out the performance.

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,420
(I see it now.)

113
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,090
He wants to use

114
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,250
Liu Xiaoxiao

115
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,210
to obtain the Book of Yuji.

116
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,090
(Flesh Puppet)
He has to coddle her to become a Flesh Puppet.

117
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,690
(Why haven't I thought of that?)

118
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,460
Xiaoxiao.

119
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,420
Forget about the performance.

120
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,140
I'll protect you.

121
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:48,770
Come.

122
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,900
With you?

123
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,810
You think I'm still

124
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,460
the gullible fool?

125
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,250
Fine.

126
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,580
I'll tell you now.

127
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,300
It's him.

128
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,250
Chen Youhai.

129
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,930
He plotted everything

130
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,250
to make you into a Flesh Puppet.

131
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,460
Do not believe him.

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,930
Do not believe him?

133
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,690
Should I believe you then?

134
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,650
Song Keyang.
