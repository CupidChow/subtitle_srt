Theater Troupe that I drew.)

Why are you here?

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,300
I'm Song Keyang, a wandering musician.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,690
I heard the Chen Theater Troupe
is recruiting a musician

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,100
so I came.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,570
(What's going on?)

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,570
(Why is it going off-script today?)

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,730
(It's different
from the previous cycles.)

19
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,300
My master and my seniors

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,980
went out.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,890
I don't have time to entertain you.

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:07,850
Come...

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,170
Come again tomorrow.

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,260
But I...

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,370
I have traveled for many days.

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,100
If I can't meet Troupe Leader Chen,

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,100
I won't let you leave.

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,100
Why are you doing this?

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,010
Like I said,

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,780
I'm busy today.

31

Come again tomorrow.

Will you move aside?

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,250
No.

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,500
Bugger off.

35
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,250
Liu Xiaoxiao.

36
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,580
You are barbaric.

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,500
The sky is starry
but the moon is gloomy.

The world is full of lives
but justice does not prevail.

the vainglorious pursuit

50
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,420
(I'll steal the puppets)

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
(and now, you cannot perform.)

52

No matter what,

53

I will save all of you.

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,450
It's you.

55
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,940
You know me?

56
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,580
No.

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,020
But I can read someone's fortune.

58
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,580
Let me see.

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
You just had dumplings

60
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,170
and you're here

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,860
because you want to join
the Chen Theater Troupe.

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,940
You're good.

63
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,420
Do we have a guest?

64
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,810
Do me a favor.

65
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,660
Hi, Troupe Leader Chen.

66
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,020
You are...

67
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,300
- He's a musician who wants to join us.
- I...

68
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,090
Precisely.

69
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,580
You're the rare talent

70
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,970

71
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,140
She said your techniques

72
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
could move the sky.

73
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:06,940
She flatters me.

74
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,050
So young and full of potential.

75
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,380
Why don't you perform

76
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,020
before me?

77
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,810
Sure.

78
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,140
Oh, Master.

79
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,250
Make sure you evaluate his techniques

80

thoroughly.

will go on as usual.)

Master.

93

Don't you want
to evaluate his techniques?

94
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,380
Should we

95
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,050
perform before you?

96
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,420
Great idea.

That's odd.

99

She retains her memory then?
