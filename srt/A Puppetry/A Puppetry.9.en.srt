But whenever I got spanked,

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,570
Third Martial Brother

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,620
would cook me delicious food.

20

Besides, he always told me,

21
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,660
"Xiaoxiao,"

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,050

However, there was once

27
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,010
Third Martial Brother got drunk

28
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,460
