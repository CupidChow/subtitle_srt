like you.

last time,

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:20,940
I was drunk.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,940
You kissed me

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,260
when I wasn't looking.

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,100
You kissed me several times.

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,890
Now, I'm drunk.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,700
I'll return you those kisses.

to tell all of you.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,250
Just now,

41
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,250
the movement feels very stiff.

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,050
It's not good enough.

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,300
Pay attention

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,740
to the uniformity

45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,250

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,090

during the performance,

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,330
I'll appear

Everyone's watching.

60

Don't rush the choreography.

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,610
You have to be patient.

62
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,890
Sometimes, you need

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,970
to take it slow and steady.

64
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,220
Come.

65
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,300
Let's choreograph now.

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,380
Who's there?

67
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,740
It's me.

68
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,300
Come in.

69
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,970
Youhai.

70
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,890
Why are you here?

71
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,050
Xiaoxiao.

72
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,810
I need to tell you something.

73
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,860
Yes?

74
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,970
I saw an iris plant motif

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,940
on your costume

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,690
yesterday.

77
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,450
Who drew it?

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,330
Is there

79
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,500
a problem with the motif?

80
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,220
My costume got dirtied

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,220
so we drew something to fix it.

82
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,810
During the fire,

83
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,300
I saw a man clad in black.

84
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,610
There was an iris plant motif

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,090
on the cuffs of the mysterious man too.

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,450
I'm sure

87
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,860
these two must be related.

88
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,330
If someone did commit arson,

89
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,220
it must have something to do

90
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,050
with the puppet show
of the Chen Theater Troupe.

91
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,420
Now that

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
the culprit has done it once,

93
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,250
he will be on the move again.

94
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,330
Maybe

95
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,420
the culprit is just beside us.

96
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,860
I

97
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,450
don't think so.

98
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,970
It could just be a coincidence.

99
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,860
Besides,

100
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,810
an iris plant

101
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,090
is a common clothes motif.

102
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,300
I think

103
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,170
we should

104
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,810
gather evidence first.

105
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,500
Xiaoxiao.

106
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,220
Youhai.

107
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,170
I'll take note of this discovery.

108
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:26,970
Just

109
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,770
go back now.

110
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:31,650
Okay.

111
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,210
Xiaoxiao.

112
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,620
Xiaoxiao.

113
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,460
Listen.

114
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,530
Just now...

115
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,650
I have good news for you.

116
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,180
Someone from the Ministry
of Internal Affairs just came.

117
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,020
They wanted

118
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,370
to take our measurements

119
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,420
for our costume.

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,300
Take our measurements?

121
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:14,740
Yes.

122
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,900
Then,

123
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,420
do we

124
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,810
get to design the motif?

125
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,860
I was thinking

126
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,060
that we should

127
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,690
embroider

128
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,650
an iris plant motif.

129
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,180
An iris plant motif?

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,770
It's what I drew

131
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,460
on your costume before
your last performance.

132
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,970
Why an iris plant?

133
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,900
I heard you said

134
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,090
that during the fire,

135
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,620
you saw this motif

136
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,530
on a stranger's cuffs.

137
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,420
We could use this opportunity

138
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,460
to spread this motif

139
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,530
everywhere.

140
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,140
The suspect will surely notice.

141
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,340
And then, we can

142
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,620
lure him out.

143
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,370
Even if

144
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,370
we can't locate the culprit,

145
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,490
we can still follow this track

146
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,210
to identify him.

147
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,930
Don't you agree?

148
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,860
Right.

149
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,300
And I thought

150
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,090
you didn't want

151
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,740
to help me investigate the fire.

152
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,090
Thank you.

153
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,580

154
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860

155
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,020
