00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,780
Don't trust him?

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,690
Do you want me to trust you instead?

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,570
Indeed.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,490
I've trusted you completely before.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,020
But look at what you've done.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,940
You killed my Master

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,730
and eliminated
the entire theatre troupe.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,490
Song Keyang.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,810
What else

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,730
do you want from me?

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,570
Xiaoxiao.

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,020
Can you please listen to me carefully?

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,890
I'm a comic author
from the future world.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,810
I created everything here.

17
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,020
I can tell you everything

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,010
if you want to know the truth.

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:43,730
But for now,

20
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,730
you must leave with me.

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,820
We

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,010
are

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,170
done here.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,140
Xiaoxiao.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,460
I don't mind if you blame or loathe me,

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,010
but you can never be the flesh puppet.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,980
He'll manipulate you and kill you.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,370
Ever since

29
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,010
I've known the truth,

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,420
I'm all dead inside.

31
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,220
Xiaoxiao.

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,140
I'll capture you now

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,050
and report you to the government
tomorrow.

34
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:22,820
Xiaoxiao.

35
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,580
Xiaoxiao.

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,370
Xiaoxiao.

37
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,330
Go and find me zither.

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,860
The evidence is inside it.

39
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,420
Xiaoxiao.

40
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,460
Don't forget what I told you.

41
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,900
Xiaoxiao.

42
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,370
Once I obtain Yuji Puppet,

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,820
I'll open the treasure

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,100
and get the Book of Yuji.

45
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,580
Just one step left

46
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,100
and the world will fall into my hand.

47
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,780
Master.

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,930
Do you see that?

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,650
I'm your most successful disciple.

50
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,180
I'm the only chief

51
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,140
of Puppet Clan.

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,140
Master.

53
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,580
Does the treasure

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,020
of the Puppet Clan exist?

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,420
What's inside it?

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,660
The rumour has it
that the possessor of the Book of Yuji

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,380
will conquer the world.

58
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,220
It's just a rumour.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,050
Even if it's true,

60
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,940
we're merely mortal

61
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,250
and we can't open the gate.

62
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,740
It's said that only flesh puppets

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740
are able to do that.

64
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,580
Even though

65
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,380
we're the branch of the Puppet Clan,

66
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,810
we must be kind and pure.

67
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,660
What we have to do

68
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,740
is to pass down the puppetry
to the next generation.

69
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,970
If the heinous sorcery
like flesh puppets

70
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,220
does really exist in this world,

71
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,810
it must be eradicated

72
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,580
so that it won't fall into
the hand of evil.

73
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,140
The Puppet Festival?

74
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,220
Level with me,

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,970
are you practising

76
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,780
the flesh puppetry secretly?

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,140
Yes.

78
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,050
Master.

79
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,580
Stop calling me.

80
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,610
I've told you this several times.

81
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,300
Why are you so stubborn?

82
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,450
How could you practice
such heinous flesh puppet sorcery

83
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,300
with a real human?

84
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,250
You'll be cursed, do you know that?

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,090
I don't mind even if I'm cursed.

86
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,580
I've had enough

87
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,330
of tough days practising puppetry.

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,090
Master.

89
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,140
Please believe me.

90
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,610
I'll strive to carry forward

91
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,050
our Chen Theatre Troupe.

92
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,330
We, the Chen Theatre Troupe

93
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,530
will dominate the world

94
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,380
eventually.

95
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,580
You scoundrel.

96
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,140
Master.

97
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:39,810
First Martial Brother.

98
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,220
Master.

99
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,050
What has happened?

100
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:45,810
You come at the right time.

101
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,660
Today, I'll show you

102
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,660
the real flesh puppet.

103
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,300
- Leave here now.
- Master.

104
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,660
It's said that the performance
of the firework-featured puppet

105
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,380
went perfectly well.

106
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,650
There was
a strange celestial phenomenon.

107
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,580
The whole sky shone with light.

108
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,300
I knew Master's Yuji Puppet

109
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,770
is with you.

110
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,490
Book of Yuji.

111
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,740
Liu Xiaoxiao.

112
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,250
Xiaoxiao.

113
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,770
Something bad has happened.

114
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,490
Someone stole the puppet.

115
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,530
My dear Little Martial Sister.

116
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,180
If you manage to obtain
the Book of Yuji for me,

117
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,530
I'll never forget your kindness.
