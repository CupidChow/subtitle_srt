00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,250
Bravo!

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,860
(Lin'an City)

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,347
Lantern Festival is coming soon.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,890
There are only limited stalls in Lin'an.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,060
We'd be better go out now.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,060
Besides, I heard

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,180
that the purpose

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,290
of Lantern Festival this time

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,050
is to pray for good weather

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,210
and world peace.

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,130
The festival will last for five nights.

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,940
All people

16
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,940
are eligible to perform.

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,020
The performer
who receives the most cheers

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,940
will be rewarded by the Emperor.

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,330
But, I haven't decided

20
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,210
on the script.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,010
I want to write about

22
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,260
the story of Yuji and the Emperor.

23
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,940
I think both of them

24
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,330
are the perfect couple

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,300
to allow my creativity runs freely.

26
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,820
But, I'm running out of ideas now.

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,050
It's crucial to make new creations.

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,570
However,

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,260
you need to know the reason

30
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,780
why do you favour them?

31
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,170
Make this your prime point of thought

32
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,300
and you can

33
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,050
have new ideas.

34
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,730
I got it.

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,820
We just arrived Lin'an today.

36
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,850
As the Lantern Festival
is around the corner,

37
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,300
could you please lend us your place?

38
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,650
We'd like to perform
the firework-featured puppet

39
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,860
during the festival.

40
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,460
We can help to attract customers
for you too.

41
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,860
I heard that
the firework-featured puppet

42
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,420
is a delicate handicraft

43
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,540
which requires
complicated production processes.

44
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,580
Dwellers here

45
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,690
have merely heard of it,

46
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,650
but no one has seen it before.

47
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,970
Can you really perform this, young lady?

48
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,100
To be honest,

49
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,900
I'm the only successor

50
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,690
of Chen Theatre Troupe.

51
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,780
Although

52
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,140
I'm not highly skilled,

53
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,730
speaking of producing
the firework-featured puppet,

54
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,690
it's right up my street.

55
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,220
On that day,

56
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,900
I'll place two racks

57
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,930
on both sides here

58
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,820
and light up the firework simultaneously

59
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,180
to launch the puppet into the air.

60
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,010
Then, with the aid

61
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,330
of the explosive,

62
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,650
the puppet will fly and spin in the air.

63
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,540
Great.

64
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,330
Sir, if you approve of this,

65
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,330
you can pay

66
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,730
four taels of silver
as the down payment.

67
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:02,650
It's done.

68
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
(Baoyuan Restaurant)

69
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,820
- I'm counting on you then.
- Thank you so much.

70
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,500
May you be prosperous.

71
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,610
- I'll wait for your good news.
- Please wait for our good performance.

72
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,420
We're done.

73
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,500
As for the rest,

74
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,220
we'll have to handle it well.

75

(The Lantern Festival falls on
the 15th day of the first lunar month.)

76

We're performing tomorrow.

77
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
So, I take you out
to get some fresh air.

78
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,050
The Lantern Festival in the capital city

79
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,140
is indeed crowded and lively.

80
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,140
You should thank me then.

81
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,140
Look, Song Keyang.

82
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,580
It resembles you.

83

Look, it's the fire breathing.

84
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,090
Come on, try on the lantern riddles.

85
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,330
Sir.

86
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,250
How much is the rabbit lantern?

87
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,890
This is not for sale.

88
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,970
You can have it

89
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,860
if you answer three riddles correctly.

90
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,500
Its shape

91
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,220
and size.

92
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,330
It's a treasure.

93
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,500
Correct, young lady.

94
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,580
Please forward to the next question.

95
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,300
A flat surface with eight chi big.

96
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,810
Two sides and four corners.

97
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,890
It only knows the face of humans

98
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,300
instead of the animals.

99
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,810
It's a handkerchief.

100
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,220
You're smart, young lady.

101
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,970
If you can answer
the last riddle correctly,

102
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,970
this moon rabbit lantern

103
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,940
belongs to you.

104
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,610
You can entrust him with
an underage teen

105
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,090
and a kingdom.

106
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,660
What's the answer?

107
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,810
Try to think about it.

108
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,020
Name a price.

109
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,690
Sir,

110
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,740
I don't want this lantern.

111
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,020
May you be prosperous.

112
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,740
Thank you.

113
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,580
Are you silly?

114
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,380
It's not worth that much.

115
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,380
Don't you like that?

116
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,690
Yes, but it's not worth it.

117
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,380
We must spend the money wisely.

118
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,610
It's crowded over there.

119
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,050
Sir.

120
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,690
I can tell the young lady

121
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,690
likes the lantern very much.

122
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,530
What about this?

123
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,530
I'll keep it for you.

124
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,330
If you can answer

125
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,610
the last riddle correctly

126
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,530
tomorrow,

127
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,740
you can take it

128

129
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,220
You have taken us wrong.
