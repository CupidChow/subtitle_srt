Something bad has happened.

What's the matter, Youhai?

44
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,930
The puppets were stolen.

45
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,730
What?

46
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,970
I was patrolling around as usual

47
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,420
and I noticed this room was unlocked.

48
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,540
I thought someone forgot to lock it

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,690
so I wanted to do so.

50
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,180
But then I heard something from the room.

51
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,330
I pushed the door open

52
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,180
and saw a man in black

53
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,100
jump out of the window.

54
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,460
I went to look for Song Keyang.

55
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,420
He isn't here.

56
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,690
So it's him?

57
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,500
No.

58
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,010
It can't be.

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,330
Xiaoxiao.

60
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,930
I should bring you to your room.

61

Master.

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,690
No.

Come with me.

65
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,050
I can't walk any further.

66
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,610
Take care of yourself.

67
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,050
Carry the Chen Theater Troupe's
legacy with you.

68
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,860
Go now.

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,780
Master!

70
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,580
Remember.

71
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,580
Follow your heart
and not your eyes sometimes.

72
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,530
It might be able

73
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,940
to guide you when it matters.

74
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,170
Master.

75
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,050
No, master.

76
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,860
Master.

77
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
Master!

78
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,220

79

81
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,660
Don't do this.

82
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,380
Master.

83
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,690
Master.

84
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,020
Master!

85
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,860
Xiaoxiao.

86
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,860
Did you have a nightmare?

87
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,740
Youhai.

88
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,890
Did you find the puppet thief?

89
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,250
Is Song Keyang back?

90
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,580
What about the drawing?

91
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,940
My drawing.

92
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:18,940
Xiaoxiao.

93
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,530
Look at this.

94
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,170
This is...

95
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,220
This attire with an iris plant motif

96
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,220
was found

97
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,250
in Song Keyang's room.

98
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,050
The truth cannot be any clearer.

99
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,890
You can't possibly

100
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,740
let Master

101
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,300
and other troupe members die in vain,
can you?

102
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,810
If Song Keyang truly murdered

103
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,810
the entire Chen Theater Troupe,

104
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,090
I would not spare him.

105
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,580
But Youhai,

106
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,500
we cannot prove he's guilty

107
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,220
with a gown

108
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,140
and a drawing alone.

109
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,860
Don't you think so?

110
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,780
They

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,860
can be forged.

112
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,530
Xiaoxiao.

113
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,530
I have a way

114
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,530
to test him out.

115
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,690
Xiaoxiao.

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,370
Where were you last night?

117
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:41,930

(Someone knocked me out.)

119
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,180
(When I was awake, I was already
on the outskirt.)

120
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,020
I ran back here.

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,690
Why are you two

122
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,420
looking at me like that?

123
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,060
What happened?

124
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,650
The puppets were stolen last night.

125
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,020
They were?

126
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,180
How can this...

127
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,460
The puppets were stolen.

128
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,690
The performance is around the corner.

129
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,970
Something's afoot.

130

It is indeed fishy.

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,650
Oh.

135
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,930
We found something new

136
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,620
about the fire.

137
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,530
The Chen Theater Troupe fire?

138
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,900
Youhai found a deckhand

139
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,090
on board during the fire.

140
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,420
He witnessed everything

141
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,580
and managed to escape.

142
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,530
The ship?

143
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,900
Deckhand?

144
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
(That's impossible.)

145
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,460
Where is he?

146
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,020
Youhai said the deckhand was old

147
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,620
and he was worried that the murderer

148
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,370
would kill him.

149
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,810
And so, Youhai has him hide somewhere.

150
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,620
Only the three of us

151
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,420
know about this.

152
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,580
Are you sure

153
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,340
that the deckhand witnessed everything?

154
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,250
Everything will become clear

155
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,420
once I meet with him.

156
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,210
Okay.

157
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,250
I'll come with you.
