that the puppet show

could be so marvellous.

going to deal with this house?

Yes.

72
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,140
Prefect Cao ordered me

to find you.

I know him.

76
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,970
Master told me

77
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,420
that the Emperor tasked the prefect

78
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,660
to seek talent in his territory.

79
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,810
You said that Prefect Cao wanted
to see us.

80
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,860
Could it be...

81

Yes.

82
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,610
His Majesty heard of
the theatre show yesterday

83
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,660
and he was happy.

84
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,740
So, His Majesty summoned my master

85
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,420
to get the two of you

86
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,220
to seek his audience.

87
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,250
Congratulations.

88
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:33,890

Yes, I did.

In my opinion,

this is just nonsense.

117
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,140
Perhaps someone annoyed you

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,530
on purpose

119

as you're performing

120
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,090
under Chen Theatre Troupe's name.

121
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,090
It shouldn't be.

122
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,970
I don't think it's as simple as this.

123

Think about it.

124

There were

125
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,250
so many strange things
that happened at that time.

I think

127
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,050
this letter is a breakthrough.

Go back and rest early.

What do you want to do in my room?

141

Do you want to sleep with me?

No.

We'll deal with this tomorrow.

Well,

Go ahead.

Do study it carefully.

152
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,740
Go and get some rest.

153

Therefore, according to the pattern,

166

I should wrap up the story

as fast as possible

168

so that I can go back to the real world.

169

Why would I even start this script?
