170
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,090
Okay.

171
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,930
After I fill my tummy,

172
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,370
I'll continue to travel.

173
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,690
Oh, no.

174
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,090
Where's my purse?

175
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,860
Master.

176
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,460
Seniors.

177
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,340
Are you inside?

178
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,650
Master?

179
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,650
The sky is starry
but the moon is gloomy.

180
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,740
The world is full of lives
but justice does not prevail.

181
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,250
In the mortal martial arts world,

182
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,900
the vainglorious pursuit

183
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,900
is but a dream.

184
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,340
Bravo!

185
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,340
Until Master arrived at the Ruins
of All Endings...

186
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,690
And he found an Immortal Herb.

187
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,650
And then,

188
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,530
a slap.

189
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,740
He took a careful look.

190
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,180
