Youhai.

Youhai.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,810
What do you think?

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,420
You look different today.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,100
Is it that obvious?

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,130
You can tell it right away.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,570
You grow up before my eyes.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,970
I have seen everything about you.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,540
Then he will be able to notice too.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,420
He?

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,620
Who?

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,500
It's a secret.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:58,940
Song.

Song Keyang.

Song Keyang.

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,900
Song Keyang.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,900
Look at me.

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,900
What?

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,100
Take a proper look.

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,500
Okay.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,180
And they say...

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,970
(Marionette)
The sky is starry but the moon is gloomy.

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,370
The world is full of lives
but justice does not prevail.

28
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,460
Amazing movement.

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,860
This is the signature technique
of the Chen Theater Troupe.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I train for this

31
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,010
since young.

32
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,370
With a flick

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,860
of these few fingers,

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,540
I could manipulate the strings.

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,460
There are so many nuances to it.

36
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,140
Right.

37
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,100
Once upon a time,

38
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,180
in a remote town,

39
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,580
there was

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,540
a smart, cute,

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,930
and kind

42
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,540
lady.

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,780
Unfortunately,

44
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,780
shortly before her birthday,

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,540
something bad happened to her family.

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,690
When she lost all hope,

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,450
a

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,050
handsome man appeared.

49
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,810
Appeared!

50
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,530
This man promised

51
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,780
to bring her happiness,

52
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,380
to give her

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,580
the will to live amid hardship.

54
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,940
They shared

55
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,660
many beautiful memories.

56
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,890
The man said

57
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,020
he would bring her

58
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,940
to visit

59
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,380
his hometown.

60
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Visit his hometown.

61
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,420
He also said

62
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,140
they should hold hands

63
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,580
and travel far away.

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,500
(He doesn't care about me at all.)

65
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,690
(He didn't even notice anything.)

66
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,660
Yay!

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,300
Done.

68
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,580
I never had the time

69
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,420
to get you a present

70
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,250
for your birthday.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Now, I drew a painting.

72
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,220
So?

73
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,300
Are you surprised?

74
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,500
Shocked?

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,330
Why are you upset?

76
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,380
Is it not beautiful enough?

77
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,170
You look cute.

78
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,500
What's the matter?

79
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,810
Song Keyang.

80
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,250
You didn't notice me.

81
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,380
A plum makeup with pearls.

82
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,890
I already noticed it.

83
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,970
(Once I master the Flesh Puppet)

84
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,170

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,050
(and obtain the Book of Yuji.)

(I need to find a way)

91
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,300
(to take Xiaoxiao with me)

92
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,380
(to execute my plan.)

(I don't want any unnecessary trouble.)

94
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,970
(Master.)

95
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,020

tomorrow.)

(will never be forgotten.)

Who's there?

100
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,420
Youhai.

101
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,770
Why are you here?

102
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,580
Let's speak inside.

103
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,370
I found a lead on the fire.

104
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:58,650
I plan

105
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,970
to finish my business
in the Imperial Palace

106
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,770
before pursuing the lead.

107
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,340
If there's something more to the fire,

108
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,690
this return trip

109
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,810
will be a dangerous one.

110
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,180
Perhaps

111
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,140
I can scout out everything first.

112
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,340
You can stay
in the Imperial Palace first.

113
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,740
If I have something,

114
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,370
I'll notify you with a carrier pigeon.

115
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,300
You can then come and join me.

116
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,530
No, Youhai.

117
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,180
I'm not

118
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,210
a coward.

You know what?

121
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,580
Once my performance is done,

122
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,860
I'll come with you to investigate.

123

Okay.
