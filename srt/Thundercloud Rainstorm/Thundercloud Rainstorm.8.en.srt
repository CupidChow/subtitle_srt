4
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,340
In other words,

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,230
he's from your orphanage, right?

6
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,520
Does he know about this, too?

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Yes.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,900
He left the orphanage at six,
so he should have some memory.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,710
There was a philanthropist who sponsored

10
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,250
children being adopted overseas.

11
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,620
The sponsor's name is...

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,160
Yes, I know that person.

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,590
He's my uncle.

14
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,730
But why did my uncle adopt Iljo?

15
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,210
Kids who aren't conscious
of being abandoned are easy to adopt,

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,010
but at his age, they tend to resist it.

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,780
Lee Iljo was the oldest child
in this orphanage.

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,650
I think the sponsor just decided to adopt
the last kid.

19
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,130
But I heard that the spouse didn't agree,

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,580
so they weren't able to complete
the official procedures.

21
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,570
Seriously...

22
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,500
Okay.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,710
Thank you for checking.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
Also, Jeonghan,

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,180
there's something I couldn't tell you.

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,840
You must think I lied to you.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,700
I said I knew

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,880
that you slept with Seo Jeongin.

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm telling you I don't mind.
So why are you being like this?

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,220
Lee Iljo, you...

31
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,010
Jeonghan.

32
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,130
Are you okay?

33
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,350
Yeah.

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,490
It's Iljo.

35
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,290
You have a fever.

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,990
Am I dreaming?

37
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,660
It feels so real.

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,780
Am I going to die?

39
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,700
Get up and eat the porridge
so you can take your medicine.

40
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,840
Are you Iljo?

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,890
Are you really Iljo?

42
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,310
Is there a fake Iljo?

43
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,930
It will spill!

44
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,000
What took you so long?

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,480
I've been waiting for you.

46
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,070
Have the porridge first.

47
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,640
No, it's not good.

48
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,190
No.

49
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,430
That's not what I meant.
I mean I can't taste anything.

50
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,860
My nose is blocked.

51
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,740
Take your medicine after you finish.

52
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm leaving.

53
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,580
Remember to take your medicine.

54
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,800
No!

55
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm going to just die from this sickness.

56
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,770
Please don't say things like that.

57
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,190
Go if you dare.

58
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,990
Don't go.

59
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,560
Please stay with me.

60
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,560
What if I keep making you suffer?

61
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,140
No one can hurt me.

62
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,780
If Seo Jeongin finds out...

63
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,710
It's okay.

64
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,220
He was arrested.

65
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,260
What?

66
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,330
For drug trafficking.

67
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,770
Seo Jeonghan, seriously...

68
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,420
I'll get rid
of all the people who hurt you.

69
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,220
What else do you want me to get rid of?

70
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,650
Lie down and rest.

71
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,160
Come here.

72
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,630
By the way,

73
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,330
why did you suddenly come home?

74
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,570
Because of Suhyo.

75
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,010
What? Jang Suhyo?

76
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,260
Yes.

77
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,400
Don't you know
that Iljo is being threatened?

78
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,440
Is it really none of your business?

79
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,570
Threatened?

80
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,310
It has nothing to do with Jeonghan.

81
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,550
Really.

82
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,270
His name came out
of that filthy Seo Jeongin's mouth.

83
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,170
Let's just go, okay?

84
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,150
Why did you say that?

85
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,710
I told you.

86
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,200
That he didn't know about this.

87
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,660
How can you be so sure?

88
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,900
The timing was way too coincidental.

89
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,530
When news about that house
being redeveloped started spreading,

90
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,470
Seo Jeonghan started to approach you,

91
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,900
and Seo Jeongin started threatening you.

92
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,380
I know.

93
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,730
I know it has nothing to do with Jeonghan.

94
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,970
If you're that sure,
why did you break up with him?

95
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,970
And why do you keep refusing
to sell the house?

96
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,940
Because I'm all alone now.

97
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,000
Dad and Jeonghan aren't with me anymore.

98
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,850
If I give up my house,

99
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,870
I'll really be alone.

100
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,050
What about me?

101
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,440
Am I invisible?

102
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,450
Iljo.

104
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,300
Mm?

105
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,740
All this time,

106
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,240
you've been living for others.

107
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,140
Live for yourself from now on.

108
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,630
Don't think about others.

109
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,560
Listen to your heart.

110
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,370
Do what you want.

111
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,590
This is what Seo Jeonghan
and I want to see.

112
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,780
What do you want to do the most right now?

113
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,420
I want to be by Jeonghan's side.

114
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,410
Go ahead.

115
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,860
I'm telling you to go find that rascal.

116
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,580
I want to stay by your side.

117
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,280
Did anyone say anything?

118
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,150
I said I'll get rid of them.

119
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,690
Your father...

120
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,440
Uncle...

121
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,650
Ah...

122
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,660
I can't get rid of my dad.

123
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,700
Also,

124
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,640
we're not cousins related by blood,

125
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,620
so what's wrong?

126
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,240
How did you...

127
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,200
Why are you so stupid?

128
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,290
He's not your biological father.

129
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,420
Yet you took care of him for nine years,
wasting your youth.

130
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,150
Seo Jeongin and you
have nothing to do with each other,

131
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,200
so why do you feel like
you owe him

132
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,430
and let him cuss you out
for being a bastard?

133
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,490
Saying you understand him?

134
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,730
How can you laugh?

135
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,260
Are you an idiot?

136
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,610
We just have different ways.

137
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,010
The way we love each other.

138
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,050
At that moment,

139
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,480
I understood.

140
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:39,190
The Iljo in front of me
always looked small and pitiful,

141
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,860
but I'm the one

142
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
who's actually small.

143
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,670
Jeongin, no.

144
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,940
I understand Jeongin.

145
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,860
He suddenly lost his dad.

146
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,690
It's understandable that he hates me.

147
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,420
Iljo knows how to feel indebted

148
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,270
and how to bear the hatred of others.

149
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:19,290
I just wanted to return the love
I received.

150
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,230
Jeonghan.

151
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,000
There's no reason for love.

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's no price, either.

153
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,180
At least, that's how my love is.

154
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,710
He knows how to be loved

155
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,470
and love.

156
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,280
He's always honest

157
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,090
and sincere.

158
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes.

159
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,230
I dare not say that I know everything
about Iljo.

160
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,670
The Iljo in front of me

161
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,090
now looks like an existence that is huge.

162
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,540
He's so pure,

163
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,560
bright,

164
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,630
and beautiful.

165
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,670
I love you.

166
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,300
Me too.

167
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,140
That's it.

168
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,050
Maybe the other name for love

169
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,510
is fear.

170
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,650
But

171
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,330
I don't want to hear about you
from other people anymore.

172
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,750
Okay.

173
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,830
I'll tell you everything from now on.

174
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,050
Then tell me.

175
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,980
Is there anyone else I need to get rid of?

176
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,780
Right.

177
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,200
Your exes?

178
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,420
I think murderers are a bit...

179
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,230
What will you do if I become a murderer?

180
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,410
Will you abandon me and run away?

181
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,490
Let's run away together forever.

182
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,150
Don't look at me like that.

183
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,400
Why?

184
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,630
It makes me want to kiss you.

185
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,460
Then just kiss me.

186
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,870
No.

187
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,670
You'll catch my cold.

188
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,780
No.

189
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,770
I've never caught a cold in my life.

190
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,970
I said no.

191
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,090
You'll catch a cold.

192
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,800
Come on.

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,210
You're not listening to me again.

194
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,260
Listen to me.

195
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,720
I said you'll catch a cold.

196
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,660
No.

197
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,560
I said no!

198
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
I said no!

199
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,680
Hey!

200
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,250
All right.

201
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,100
Iljo.

202
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,660
Get up.

203
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,820
Have some porridge and take medicine.

204
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,260
Why is the porridge angry?

205
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,330
I told you it's contagious
and not to kiss me, didn't I?

206
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,540
Hey!

207
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,720
Why?

208
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,330
"I've never caught a cold in my life."

209
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,780
Gosh.

210
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,010
Here.

211
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,410
How is it?

212
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,370
It's delicious.

213
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,400
Really?

214
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,470
Oh.

215
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,430
Here.

216
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,190
It seems I'll have to be the one cooking.

217
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,170
In the future?

218
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,490
Mm-hmm.

219
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,300
Iljo.

220
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,820
From now on, we don't have to
care about other people anymore.

221
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,380
Let's do whatever we want to do.

222
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,770
What we want to do?

223
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes.

224
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,250
I will make everything come true—

225
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,030
everything you want to do.

226
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,329
Why?

227
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,310
What is it?

228
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,220
Tell me.

229
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,760
Do you want me to buy you a house?

230
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,890
Or a car?

231
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,500
I want to get a high school diploma.

232
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,090
I want to go to college, too.

233
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,790
I want to find something I'm good at.

234
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Then do it. All of them.

235
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,850
But to do that I need time and money.

236
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,490
Do you think
I can't invest that much in you?

237
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,810
It'll take a very, very...

238
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,410
long time.

239
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,480
I know.

240
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,630
College takes four years.

241
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,250
To find what I'm good at

242
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,350
might take even longer.

243
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,640
Do you have to go this far?

244
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,480
I want to have it.

245
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,570
I...

246
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,870
want to have your future.

247
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,710
I know.

248
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,120
-It's all my wishful thinking.
-Take it.

249
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
My future.

250
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,710
You can have it.

251
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,350
I knew you'd say this.

252
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,610
That's why I didn't tell you.

253
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,700
How can you exchange
your future with me like that?

254
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,400
Come here.

255
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,190
Iljo.

256
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,060
I'm not a pushover.

257
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,470
You're just telling me not to give up
on everything just for you, right?

258
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,780
You're saying that you decided to

259
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,340
let go of me because you like me too much
and didn't want to ruin my future.

260
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,090
Not that much...

261
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,590
Hey!

262
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,600
Seriously...

263
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
-I was so sincere, you just had to...
-Hold on!

264
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,380
I'm still sick, Jeonghan.

265
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,090
Oh, right.

266
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,760
-Got it, got it.
-I'm sick.

267
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,060
Lie down.

268
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,530
Come closer.

269
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,660
Stop it!

270
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,670
Come on!

271
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,050
[Two months later]

272
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,980
Thank you.

273
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,000
Looks like Uncle was really mad.

274
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
Don't even talk about it.

275
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,490
I almost died.

276
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,470
Look at the bruises.

277
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,280
Couldn't you be more tactful?

278
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,620
Why were you so honest?

279
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,110
I wanted to be honest

280
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,280
about my feelings.

281
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,370
You're really something.

282
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,230
You beat your great father, after all.

283
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,030
I'm the only son in my family.

284
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,100
My cousins are all messy like Seo Jeongin.

285
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,440
My dad has no choice.

286
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,390
But I promised to be in charge
of the overseas branch.

287
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,590
Hey.

288
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,790
Why are you guys always so reckless?

289
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,320
It's because of how you're like
that Iljo had a hard time.

290
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,180
I heard you haven't seen each other
for over a month.

291
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,750
Are you my friend or Iljo's friend?

292
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,250
You darn loser.

293
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,320
Hey, I'm a patient!

294
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,970
What about Iljo?

295
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,230
He's not coming with you?

296
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,340
Yes, we're going to meet at the airport.

297
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,260
I'm heading off.

298
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,050
Thanks.

299
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,170
Jeonghan.

300
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,880
What?

301
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,080
Will he really go?

302
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,810
What?

303
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm talking about Iljo.

304
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,750
What if...

305
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,940
he doesn't show up there?

306
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,850
I'm curious.

307
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,360
Why would Lee Iljo

308
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,980
think of leaving me?

309
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,590
I have nothing.

310
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,720
What do you mean you have nothing?

311
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,890
You have me.

312
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,340
You have me,
who has everything.

313
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,870
So you have everything.

314
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,890
Is that so?

315
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,640
Iljo.

316
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,290
Hmm?

317
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,750
There's something I'm curious about.

318
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm really ready to give my future to you.

319
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,100
I want to be your family.

320
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,560
I hope the fate we share is one where
there are misunderstandings,

321
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,830
we fight,

322
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,770
or get hurt—

323
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,220
where conflicts like this

324
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,390
will always arise.

325
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,410
What about you?

326
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,730
Are you ready?

327
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,910
[Iljo, I'm setting off.]

328
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,740
It's Iljo.

329
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,220
The sound of the footsteps
running towards me.

330
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,670
No matter how far
this tiny sound comes from,

331
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,630
I will know

332
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,560
if it's Iljo.

333
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,180
Iljo, are you ready?

334
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,590
Yes.

335
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,930
What about Uncle's house?

336
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,470
It's fine.

337
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,670
I now have something else
I want to protect more.

338
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,520
Something you want to protect?

339
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,750
That's you.

340
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,570
Also,

341
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,300
I am all yours.

342
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,910
My future,

343
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,410
my present,

344
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,390
and my past.

345
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,670
And I

346
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,150
shall receive the weight of my future—

347
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,070
that is you running into my arms
with all your might.

348
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,840
When can we get there?

349
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
It's hot, right?

350
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
If we walk another 5 minutes...

351
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,120
You said 5 minutes just now, too.

352
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,970
How can you
live in a countryside like this?

353
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,000
Huh?

354
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,040
What's going on?

355
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,310
I think it's going to rain.

356
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,780
All of a sudden?

357
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,180
This place is always like this.

358
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,370
The rain would always come suddenly
and stop suddenly.

359
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,930
Hey, over there! Run!

360
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,430
I don't want you to go back to Seoul.

361
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,200
Hey.

362
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,170
Don't say such scary things.

363
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,570
Let's leave when the rain subsides.

364
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,270
I want to hang out with you forever.

365
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Or rather,
I hope you can come over every holiday.

366
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,530
Lee Iljo.

367
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,460
You can just come over.

368
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,510
Why ask me to come over?

369
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,340
You come over.
