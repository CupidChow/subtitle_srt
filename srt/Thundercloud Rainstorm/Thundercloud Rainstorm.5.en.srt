4
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,220
I look horrible now, don't I?

5
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,120
Not really.

6
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,540
It hurts, right?

7
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,440
With you applying the medication on me,
it doesn't hurt.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,810
How is that possible?

9
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm serious.

10
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,340
Stop putting ointment on me and kiss me.

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,590
Hey.

12
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,320
I just applied the medicine.

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,510
Tsk.

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,630
Where are you going?

15
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,450
To sleep.

16
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,920
Aren't you going to keep me company?

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
I can't hold it in.

18
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,930
Then don't.

19
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,140
No.

20
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,320
I'll take good care of you.

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,170
All of a sudden?

22
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,190
Yes.

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,490
No one can touch you...

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,220
nor hurt you.

25
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,090
You can touch me.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,520
Sleep in my room from now on.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,390
Rather than my own room?

28
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,310
If you want to stay in my house,
listen to me.

29
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,690
Or else...

30
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,250
Or else...

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,630
I don't know.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,860
Let's sleep together in my room tonight.

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,390
Whatever.

Iljo!

35
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm sorry. Was I being too noisy?

36
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,220
You don't have to clean anymore.

37
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,730
I will have the cleaner come back.

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,990
Why?

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,810
It's tiring.

40
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
Go wash up quickly and get changed.

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,450
We're heading out.

42
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,990
Are we going somewhere?

43
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,880
Yes.

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,680
Is there anything you want to do?

45
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,450
I just want to stay home.

46

Hey...

47
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,600
What?

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,260
Does that make sense?

49
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,610
It's a nice day,
yet you just want to stay at home?

50
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,000
Tomorrow, the day after,
and the day after that, we'll be at home.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Why stay at home?

52
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,720
Never mind.

53
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
O-Okay.

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,940
Hmm?

Let's go.

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,400
Just so-so.

58
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,540
Next.

59
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,630
This is cute.

60
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,580
Would you like to take this?

61
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll take this.

62
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,950
Is it good?

63
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,090
Yes. It's delicious.

64
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,090
Why did you get it everywhere—

65
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,600
I-I'll clean it off myself.

66
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,080
Okay.

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,100
Ah, this is nice.

68
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,430
Why?

69
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,230
It's too hot.

70

72
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,220
What?

73
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,860
What's wrong?

74
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,120
Let go.

75
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,880
Do I embarrass you?

76
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,460
It's not like that.

77
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,300
Are you embarrassed of me?

78
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,780
No.

79
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,930
Yes, that's impossible.

80
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,170
This is our first time.

81
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,290
It's our first date outside.

82
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,670
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,040
But I don't like it

84
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,360
when I make things difficult for you.

85
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,640
What if someone sees you?

86
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,020
Is that why... you said
you wanted to stay at home?

87
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
This is driving me crazy.

88
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,690
Hey, what are you doing?

89
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,060
Get on.

90
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll give you 10 seconds.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,460
Ten.

92
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,820
Nine.

93
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,020
Eight.

94
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,080
Three.

95
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Two.

96
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,190
One.

97
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,840
Hold tight.

98
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,429
Don't fall off.

99
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,710
Were you really upset?

101
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
Yes.

102
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,210
Was it this difficult

103
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,960
when you liked me?

104
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,330
There were more happy days
than difficult days.

105
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,970
Gosh.

106
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,400
This is what's bad about carrying you.

107
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,670
What?

108
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,610
That I can't kiss you immediately
when I want to.

109
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,520
Iljo.

110
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,910
Yeah.

111
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,020
You still like me, don't you?

112
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,130
Where's your answer?

113
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,640
Hey.

114
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,730
Why aren't you answering me?

115
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm saying, let's date.

116
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,910
You'll regret losing me, you know?

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
Put me down.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,490
Answer me first.

119
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,310
Do you think you can find someone else
as handsome as me?

120
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,720
Looks aren't everything.

121
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,780
I'll make you
not want to step on the ground anymore.

122
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,720
I can carry you all day.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,140
I like walking, though.

124
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,520
I'll let you live in my house forever.

125
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,850
No, no.

126
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,650
Shall I just give you that house?

127
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,920
You can't buy people's hearts with money,
Jeonghan.

128
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,780
Hey, Lee Iljo.

129
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,160
If I lose you, I'll regret it.

130
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,440
I know...

131
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
it's a little late now.

132
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,620
But can you

133
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,660
give me another chance?

134
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,070
Please.

135
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,820
Let's go inside.

136
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,400
At least tell me the reason.

137
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,050
Okay.

138
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,600
Let's date.

139
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,030
But

140
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,890
you have to promise me one thing.

141
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,830
What is it?

142
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,350
Once we hurt each other...

143
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,910
We break up?

144
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes.

145
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,230
I don't want to be with you
with a wounded heart.

146
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay.

147
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,560
I won't hurt you.

148
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,610
But I have one condition.

149
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,850
What is it?

150
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,840
You can't disappear without a word.

151
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,130
Never again.

152
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,200
Mm.

153
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,030
Iljo.

154
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,800
Yeah?

155
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,990
What kind of people did you date?

156
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,580
Just ordinary people.

157
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,970
Well,

158
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,140
would they write you letters?

159
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,620
Mm.

160
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,450
Were they handsome?

161
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,260
Mm.

162
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,780
Hey.

163
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,990
You're more handsome.

164
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,860
Do you have any photos of your ex?

165
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,660
Mm.

166
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,210
That's ridiculous.

167
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,210
Pass me your phone.

168
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,030
What are you doing?

169
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,050
I want to check if I'm the most handsome.

170
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,960
I already said you're the most handsome.

171
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,490
So show me.

172
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,430
No.

173
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,380
Why?

174
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,310
It's all in the past.

175
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,770
Iljo.

176
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
Are you asleep?

177
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,100
Let's get off together.

178
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,940
I'll get off first.

179
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,590
Look ahead.

180
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,990
-Hello.
-Hello.

181
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,070
Hello. Good morning.

182
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,380
-Hello.
-Hello.

183
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,300
You look more suspicious now.

184
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm leaving.

185
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,160
Oh, Iljo.

186
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,730
Mr. Jeonghan?

187
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,690
Did you two come to work together?

188
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,210
Yes.

189
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,440
We live together.

190
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,250
Huh?

191
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,990
Didn't know the two of you were close.

192
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,060
What's your relationship?

193
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,020
We are...

194
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,370
Cousins.

195
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,080
Yes, cousins.

196
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,050
No wonder!

197
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,690
Both of you are so handsome.

198
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,730
I have to go to work.

199
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,280
I'll head in first.

200
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,360
All the best!

201
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,150
All the best!

202
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,650
Why didn't you tell us?

203
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,589
I'm so jealous that you two live together.

204
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,460
Jealous? Of who?

205
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,990
Well...

206
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,200
By the way, is Iljo in a relationship?

207
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,540
Yes.

208
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,050
With a super cool person.

209
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,260
What about you?

210
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,630
I am, too.

211
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm so envious of your partners.

212
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,400
Right?

213
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,360
The elevator door is opening.

214
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
-It's pretty serious.
-Yeah.

215
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,040
Good morning.

216
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,030
Oh, Jeonghan.

217
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,720
Seo Jeonghan,
did something good happen to you?

218
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,450
He said he's in a relationship.

219
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,950
He's at the age of passionate love.

220
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,140
Oh, go ahead.

221
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,450
See you.

222
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,500
[Seo Jeonghan:
I told my colleagues that I'm dating.]

223
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,920
I told my colleagues

224
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,620
that I'm dating.

225
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,090
You really told everyone?

226
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,720
Three Iced Americanos
and two Iced Teas.

227
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,950
Iljo.

228
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,020
I heard you're dating.

229
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,950
And that it's with a super cool person.

230
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,280
Yeah...

231
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,240
It's 14,400 won.

232
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,640
Today,

233
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,760
it's on me.

234
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh, nice!

235
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,480
We'll go take a seat first then.

236
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,400
Okay.

237
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,630
Let's go.

238
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,830
Hey!

239
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,370
What are you doing?

240
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,990
Isn't it thrilling?

241
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,500
Come down after work.

242
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,570
I'll wait for you at the parking lot.

243
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,310
Why isn't he coming out?

244
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,650
You haven't cleaned that side yet.
Can you clean it properly?

245
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,760
You're the one who's not mopping it well.

246
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,850
What are you talking about?

247
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,270
Your fingerprints are all over it.

248
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,510
It's none of your business.

249
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,690
Then clean it up properly.

250
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,290
Jeonghan.

251
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,820
Hello.

252
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,280
Stop joking.

253
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,810
What brings you here?

254
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,830
Can you please let part-timers
get off work on time?

255
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,130
I want to go home together with him.

256
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,350
Hey!

257
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,040
Let's go, Iljo.

258
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,420
Give me a second.

259
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,090
Jeonghan.

260
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,300
Why?

261
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,930
Do you feel uncomfortable?

262
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,930
People don't think too much about it.

263
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,570
That's not what I meant...

264
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,360
Goodbye.

265
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,030
Bye.

266
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,620
See?

267
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,270
They don't care at all.

268
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,810
Mm...

269
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,470
I'm having dinner with Suhyo today.

270
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,420
Why?

271
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,920
Well, he's a friend.

272
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,170
You...

273
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,730
Okay.

274
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,200
It's okay?

275
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,530
Yes.

276
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm pretty chill in relationships.

277
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,540
Got it.

278
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,650
Call me.

279
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,310
I'll pick you up.

280
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,040
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

281
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,750
Go back first.

282
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,680
Got it.

283
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,120
I'll head off first.

284
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,920
Lee Iljo, seriously...

285
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,710
Have you been here before?

286
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,880
No.

287
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,410
What about you?

288
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,060
I've been here before.

289
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,730
The vibe is good
and the food is delicious.

290
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,330
What do you want to eat?

291
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,110
Anything is fine.

292
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,190
When did you come?

293
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,450
About a month ago.

294
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,460
With whom?

295
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,690
Just a few friends.

296
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,450
I see...

297
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,480
You wanted soju, right?

298
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,520
Yeah. The vibe here is pretty nice.

299
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,070
Right?

300
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,760
I've always wanted to bring you here.

301
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,300
Thank you.

302
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,710
How have you been?

303
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,120
Just so-so.

304
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,600
Do you still live there?

305
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah...

306
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,300
It's better if you move out soon.

307
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,170
Is it fine?

308
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,960
I don't have enough money
to pay rent with my part-time job.

309
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,340
Would you like to work full-time, then?

310
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,520
Or work on the weekends too?

311
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,760
Really?

312
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,800
Yes.

313
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll take good care of you.

314
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,080
Okay, I'll think about it.

315
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,890
Okay.

316
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,680
Hurry up and save up and move out.

317
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,740
I don't like how that rascal's
been looking down on you.

318
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,930
What do you mean, "that rascal"?

319
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,080
He kept teasing you.

320
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,410
Actually,

321
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,620
we're dating.

322
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,840
Huh?

323
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,530
Since when?

324
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,380
It hasn't been long.

325
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,900
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

326
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,520
What's there to be sorry about?

327
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,880
So?

328
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,720
Are you happy?

329
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,630
Don't you like him?

330
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,650
I'm happy.

331
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,870
I don't want to talk about this.

332
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,590
But I'm a little worried.

333
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,520
Anyone can tell
you're the only one who'll get hurt.

334
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,680
It's fine.

335
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,260
Still, I'm happy.

336
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,070
Hey, Lee Iljo.

337
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,340
Be careful.

338
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,690
They might be behind this.

339
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,000
Blood is thicker than water...

340
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,620
Suhyo.

341
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,370
Let's go.

342
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,820
It's not even 10 PM yet.

343
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,600
Jeonghan is waiting for me.

344
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,630
Hey, Lee Iljo.

345
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,990
You...

346
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,200
I'm sorry.

347
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,070
Let's go.

348
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,220
The bill, please.

349
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,750
It's 27,000 won. Thank you.

350
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,140
Thank you.

351
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,150
Thank you for the meal, Suhyo.

352
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,510
Jeonghan?

353
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,000
Why are you here?

354
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,390
Hey, Lee Iljo. You smoke?

355
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,250
Why did you hide it?

356
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,820
I didn't mean to hide it.

357
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,350
You just never asked.

358
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,870
How was your meeting with that rascal?

359
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,800
What do you mean "that rascal"?

360
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,680
The two of you, seriously...

361
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,630
Why?

362
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,770
Does he call me "that rascal" too?

363
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,850
Forget it.

364
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,760
What did you talk about?

365
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,020
It's a secret.

366
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,930
Why did you come here?

367
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,600
What's wrong?

368
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,470
Come here.

369
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,020
Huh?

370
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,180
I'm telling you
to come to the driver's seat.

371
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,760
I'll reward you.

372
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,070
Hey.

373
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,450
Be careful.

374
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,310
If you accidentally honk,
everyone in the neighborhood will wake up.

375
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,130
Don't take off my shirt...

376
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,940
[In the next episode]

377
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,890
I heard Iljo didn't come to work today.

378
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,930
I heard he had to go to the hospital.

379
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,550
The owner opened the cafe late today too.

380
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,650
Has Iljo been getting beaten up?

381
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,790
He keeps getting wounded.
