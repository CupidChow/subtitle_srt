Why are you hiding in the blanket?

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,780
Don't look.

7
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,730
I said, no!

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800

Good morning.

166
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,060
-Working so hard early in the morning!
-Oh, yeah.

Isn't it hot?

No, I'm fine.

169

Having seen you today,
I feel like I'm going to have a good day.

170
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,840
Is such flirting okay?

171
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,760
By the way, I really love your coffee.

172
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,980
We don't go to any other cafes.

173
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,700
We're regulars here.

174
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,380
The coffee's really good.

175
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,490
Can we make a bulk order after lunch?

176
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,280
Yes, of course.

177
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,830
-See you later then. Thank you.
-Okay.

178
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,520
Bye.

179

182
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,200
I'm sick of spicy pork.

183
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,480
Why?

184

-Then what do you want to eat?
-Ugh, I'm going crazy.

Aren't you going for lunch?

I'm not hungry.

188
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,620
Still, Jeonghan,
you should join everyone for lunch.

189
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,360
I said, I'm not going.

190
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,140
Jeonghan,

191
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,570
you're quite grumpy today.

192
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,820
Leave him alone.
What's wrong with wanting some alone time?

193
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,420
Get some rest.

194
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,040
Let's go.

195
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,010
Fine, let's go.

196
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,010
How about cold noodles?

197
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,260
Sounds good.

198
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,760
[Seo Jeonghan:
Let's have dinner nearby]

199
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,140
[Seo Jeonghan:
before going home.]

200
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,720
Jeonghan!

201
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,200
I came early and ordered already.

202
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,380
This restaurant's signature.

203
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,780
Not your first time here?

204
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,060
Oh...

205
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,200
Yeah.

206
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,750
Eat.

207
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,030
Oh.

208
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,120
I have something to say.

209
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,170
If you're going to apologize,
do it after eating.

210
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,420
Jeonghan.

211
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,760
Yeah?

212
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,930
I want to be in a relationship with you.

213
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,210
What?

214
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,060
I want to be
in a serious relationship with you.

215
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,690
Hey.

216
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,730
Do you think it makes sense?

217
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,360
Why doesn't it make sense?

218
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,560
Do I have to explain such a simple thing?

219
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
Explain it to me.

220
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,460
Lee Iljo, we're cousins.

221
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,090
If that is important,

222
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,090
what about everything we've done?

223
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,630
You hugged me, kissed me,
and smiled at me.

224
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,300
You always took the initiative.

225
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,680
So why can't we be official?

226
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,890
Fine.

227
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,780
I was wrong.

228
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,520
I was freaking thoughtless
and a total idiot.

229
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
Happy?

230
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,390
What was I to you?

231
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,400
Whatever it was, it's meaningless.

232
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,530
Not that you ever meant anything to me.

233
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,270
It doesn't matter.

234
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,710
Hey.

235
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,530
Don't be clingy. It's a turn-off.

236
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,360
You said it yourself
that you fall in love easily.

237
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,600
Don't try these love games with me.
Find someone else.

238
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,950
But you're the one I like.

239
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,070
Enough with this sappy crap and just eat.

240
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,380
The biggest problem is

[User Survey and Analysis Result]

242
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,430
the data loss.

243
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,000
Automatic safekeeping becomes unstable,

244
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
which lowers the users' trust.

245
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,950
[Thank you for everything.]

246

So we should...

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,990
[I'll move out by this week.]

248
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,910
It's necessary to strengthen this feature.

249
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,090
Also, we need to improve on
our equipment for the AI program.

252
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,770
How dare you inform me through text?

253
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,480
And why aren't you picking up your phone?

254
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,100
Are you taunting me?

255
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,140
I'm working.

256
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,350
Let me know the total cost of
the remaining hospital bill and the rent.

257
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,720
Rent?

258
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,620
And food expenses.

259
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,480
Lee Iljo.

260
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,280
Did I ever ask you
to pay me for all that?

261
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,790
No.

262
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,460
Then why are making me out to be so petty?

263
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,850
You have nowhere to go anyway.

264
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,390
I do.

265
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,590
My friend's place.

266
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,430
Your friend?

267
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,680
Which friend?

268
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,890
Him?

269
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,900
So you've been living at his place?

270
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,250
Do you even know him?

271
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,470
He's a good person.

272
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,440
For goodness sake.

273
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,060
That's your biggest problem.

274
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,520
You just met him,

275
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,370
but you're following him around
like a stupid puppy.

276
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,010
Don't look at me with those eyes,
like I'm pathetic.

277
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,160
How much are you paying him?

278
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,880
Oh.

279
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,610
Or are you

280
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,800
going to pay him with your body again?

281
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,650
Do you just sleep with anyone,
even if you don't have feelings for them?

282
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,160
That's you.

283
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,060
What?

284
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,130
You don't like me,
but you screwed me as you liked.

285
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,240
You don't know when to stop talking,

286
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,630
do you?

287
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,240
Hash it out outside.

288
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,710
What?

289
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,090
Okay.

290
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,160
I won't move out, so go now.

291
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,740
I'll be home at eight.

292
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,140
Don't be late.

293
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,440
Get home before me and wait for me.

294
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,110
Why do you always do whatever you want?

295
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,710
Because I can do whatever I want with you.

296
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,910
Just because I like you, it doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want with me.

298
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,450
You don't know how I feel.

299
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,050
I'm not interested in
knowing how you feel.

300
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,750
It's not important too.

301
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,630
You just have to do as I say,

302
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,560
understand?

303
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,860
You're really a freaking scumbag.

304
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,310
Hey! Lee Iljo!

305
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,220

[In the next episode]

00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,500
How did you know I was here?

309

Where else can you go?

310

When are you coming home?

311
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,760
I don't know.

312
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,240
My dad said he wanted me to be happy.

313
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,460
But I don't know if I deserve to be happy.

314
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,930
You can be greedy.

315
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,360
You deserve it.

316
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,240
You deserve happiness.

317
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
I know you're doing this
because you're bored,

318
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,440
but don't be too nice to him.

319
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,430
You're just toying with him as you wish.

320
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,660
You're the worst.
