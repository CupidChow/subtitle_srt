You bastard son.

How dare you come here?

You disgusting freak.

You took care of him for just a few years,
and you got the house?

Isn't that a bit too much, Iljo?

It's all your fault, you freaking jinx.

62
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,790
The surgery went well.

63

He can be discharged in a day or two.

64
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,230
Surgery?

65
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,390
Be careful.

66
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,390
Or you'll get a splitting wound.

67
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,630
No strenuous exercise for 3–4 weeks

68
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,490
and avoid greasy food.

69
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,520
Take care of the wound
to prevent scarring.

70
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,980
Scarring?

71
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,060
Yes.

72
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,240
What about the surgery fee?

Surgery and hospitalization

74
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,240

75

You should go.

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,590
-Thanks for your help.
-Okay.

78
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,920
Get some rest.

79
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,390
What surgery?

80
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,020
Are you crazy?

81
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,360
What's wrong with him?

82
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,930
He has gallstone disease.

83
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,380
His gallbladder has to be removed.

84
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,030
He needs a surgery?

85
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,650
He must've been in pain for days.

86
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,170
How did he put up with it for so long?

87
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,510
The inflammation is serious,

88
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,570
so he'll need laparoscopic surgery.

89
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,170
If you agree,
we'll go ahead with it right away.

90
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,680
No...

91
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,550
Sorry?

92
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,760
I can't... have surgery.

93
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,650
If he doesn't get surgery,

94
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,840
will he die?

95
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,770
It'd bother me

96
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,360
if you died when you've been with me.

97
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,390
What about the surgery fee?

98
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,270
Is your life worth only 4 million?

99
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,730
I'm saying this because
it's not worth 4 million.

100
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,770
That's why you just
stupidly put up with the pain?

101
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,200
I thought it was nothing.

102
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,380
So miserable.

103
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,190
How will I pay for it?

104
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,890
I've paid for it.

105
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,520
I'll pay you back.

106
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,570
How?

107
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,140
Give me some time...

108
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,660
Pay with your body.

109
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,330
What?

110
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,790
Do you have anything else
besides your body?

111
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
That's why.

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,480
Find a way to repay it with your body.

114
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,380
Um...

115

Yesterday, when I came onto you...

116
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,110
Shut up.

117
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,900
Do you think you are
the only one who likes me?

118
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll pretend nothing happened.

119
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,170
So don't piss me off.

120
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,400
Why do you let me stay with you?

121
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,770
I'd never visited Uncle
since he'd collapsed.

122
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,140
I don't want to feel any guilt about it.

123
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,480
I see.

124
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,920
Good for you, big shot.

125
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,730
Will you come again?

126
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,040
No.

127

You're here.

128
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,920
You really didn't visit me once.

129
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,390
I give you food and shelter,
and paid for your treatment.

130
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,870
What else do you want from me?

131
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,760
You have no shame.

132
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,940
But still,

133
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,360
I was discharged today.

134
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,740
That's why I didn't go out
and stayed home.

135
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,740
Really?

136
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,510
Were you... waiting for me?

137
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,900
I never said I was waiting for you.

146

Yeah.

147
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,480
Why?

148
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,150
You told me to pay with my body.

149
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,530
Oh.

150
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,060
Help me.

151
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,430

Do you just take off your clothes
in front of anyone?

154
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,460
You're not just anyone.

155
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,740
You're not a kid.

156
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,120
Do it yourself.

157
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,270
What's wrong?

158
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,060
Does it taste weird?

159
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,160
Did you poison it?

160
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,020
No!

161
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
Don't you ever cook again, or you're dead.

162
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,460
What about dinner?

163
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,320
Aren't you eating?

164
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,280
It's all yours.

166
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,380
Here. Come in.

167
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,120
So...

168
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,570
You two live in Jeonghan's place
together, right?

169
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,550
Wow.

170
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,960
What's the big deal about
cousins living together?

171
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,280
That's not it.

172
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,290
What's surprising is
you living with anybody at all.

173
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,450
Don't you hate living with others?

174
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,740
That's why you moved out early.

175
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,920
You don't even like us
going to your house.

176
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,730
Do you

177
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,400
have something on him?

178
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,849
No.

179
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,000
How did you get him to agree?

180
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I didn't ask him to.

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,359
Then what?

182
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,940
H-He suggested it?

183
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,800
Isn't there an elevator here?

184
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,430
We're almost there.

185
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,670
Ta-da.

186

How can someone live in a place like this?

188
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,580
It's cozy and nice.

189
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,470
What's cozy about this?

190
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,170
Don't be stupid.

191
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,380
Even my bathroom is better than this hole.

192
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,940
Why did you show me your shabby house?

193
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,120
You said you'd take me home.

194
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,710
Why don't you just stay at my place?

195
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,260
Your place?

196
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,740
Your bathroom?

197
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,450
No.

198
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,130
In my house.

199
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,070
Because I pitied him.

200
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,750
You know how he is.

201
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,580
He's a fool who'd rather die
than get surgery because he's broke.

202
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,660
Hey, what's wrong with you?

203
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,340
Nothing beats family
who takes care of you, right?

204
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,890
Don't mind it.

205
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,650
He's super rich.

206
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,390
Stop talking nonsense.

207
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,790
It's not nonsense.

208
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,180
Why don't you get him a job
at your company?

209
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,750
Oops...

210
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,600
Is it still a secret that
you're the CEO's son?

211
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,920
Hey.

212
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,730
Just shut up and drink.

213
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,910
Okay.

214
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,340
You know,

215
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,840
you've been quiet lately.

216
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,470
Not seeing anyone?

217
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,280
Is Jeonghan popular?

218
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,060
Well,

219
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,560
this little brat has no manners,

220
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,020
but I guess
it's what people like these days.

221
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,500
He's handsome.

222
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,600
I mean, he must be popular
because he's handsome.

223
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,070
Let's go for a smoke.

224
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,840
Avoid greasy food. Eat this instead.

225
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,950
What's so funny?

226
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,910
Your cousin is quite cute.

227
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,070
How is he cute?

228
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,690
He's so annoying.

229
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,440
How should I put it?

230
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,640
He's not like young people nowadays.
He's simple and pure.

231
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,760
That's what I'm into lately.

232
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
It's not tiring.

233
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,550
They don't play mind games.

234
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,410
Everything is straightforward.

235
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,030
Then take him home and live together.

236
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,500
Should I?

237
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,580
It should be fun living with him.

238
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,690
Let's go in.

239
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,890
Okay.

240
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,500
Hey, Seo Jeonghan.

241
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,200
Are you okay?

242
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,420
Ah! I have to go!

243
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,250
I'm drunk.

244
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,670
Mr. Iljo— No...

245
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,490
-Iljo.
-Yes?

246
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,280
I'll get going.

247
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,360
See you around.

248
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,440
Gosh, I'm so drunk.

249
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,460
Sir, bill, please!

250
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,680
And... he'll be paying.

251
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,680
Hey, Jeonghan. Time to go, yeah?

252
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,190
Get up.

253
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,880
Come on. Get up!

254
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,630
Darn it.

255
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,760
Hey, try to walk properly...

256
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,320
Sir, you haven't paid the bill.

257
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
U-Uh, hang on.

258
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,550
Here.

259
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

260
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,600
Hey, stand upright, Jeonghan.

261
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
Walk properly, can you?

262
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,180
Seo Jeonghan!

263
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,110
Can't you walk properly?
Don't you know I'm sick?

264
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,730
W-What...

265
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,420
What's wrong?

266
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,930
Seriously...

267
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,050
Walk properly!

268
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,100
Does it hurt?

269
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,640
Where are you going?

270
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,000
What are you doing?

271
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,360
Bite on this.

272
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,770
Don't move.

273
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,740
Stay still.

274
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,320
Good boy.

275
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,790
You're drunk.

276
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,960
Quiet.

277
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,220
[In the next episode]

278
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,450
I've started a part-time job.

279
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,340
Jeonghan.

280
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,180
I didn't know it was your company.

281
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,720
It was the only place that
responded to my job application.

282
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
What now?
What else are you hiding from me?

283
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,080
Don't you...

284
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,990
remember?

285
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,200
Remember?

286
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,270
I remember now.

287
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,380
I was drunk and crossed the line.

288
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,540
I'll help you.

289
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,320
Tell me.

290
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,420
I'll do whatever it takes.

291
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
Kiss me.
