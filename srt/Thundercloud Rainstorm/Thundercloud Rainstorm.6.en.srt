00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,440
Everyone.

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,070
Mr. Seo is very satisfied.

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,720
You've all worked hard
to prepare for this project.

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,190
Everyone will have good news,

8
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,500
so just look forward to it.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,890
Will we get promoted?

10
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,460
Or will we get bonuses?

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,540
Then how about grilled pork belly
and soju today?

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,840
Goodness.

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,930
We should eat beef on a day like this.

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,320
Am I right?

15
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,720
Come on.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,670
Did you hear that?

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,020
No one is allowed to be absent.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,170
Everyone, come.

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,620
Oh, Seo Jeonghan.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,039
I heard the guy who works
at the cafe downstairs

21
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,470
is your cousin.

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,890
Bring him along.

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,360
I'll treat you to very expensive beef.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,560
All right, let's head
to the barbecue restaurant. Go, go!

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,970
But Iljo didn't come to work today.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,759
He didn't come to work today?

27
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,539
Don't you live together?

28
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:38,580
I heard he had to go to the hospital.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,200
The owner opened the cafe late today, too.

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,090
Let's go.

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,910
Seo Jeonghan!

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,110
Seo Jeongin.

33
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,760
Why are you here?

34
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,050
To see my uncle.

35
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,360
What for?

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Why are you being so distant?

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,600
Leave if you're done.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,620
Have you been in touch

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,780
with that rascal Lee Iljo?

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,650
I heard he's working here.

41
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,780
I don't know.

42
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,600
What a loser.

43
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,960
What are you doing?

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,380
It's you, right?

45
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,520
Seo Jeongin.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,100
Damn, am I that famous?

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,740
Stop threatening Lee Iljo.

48
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,130
Is Lee Iljo

49
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,410

50
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,110
How ridiculous.

51
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,460
So he has a new partner already?

52
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,390
Are you cheating with him?

53
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,680
Seo Jeonghan is going to get backstabbed.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
Wow.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,470
Stop it while I'm still being nice.

56
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,500
If Seo Jeonghan finds out

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,210
you're threatening Iljo,
it's going to be over for you.

58
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,390
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,930
It's going so well only because
Jeonghan's helping.

60
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,680
Don't you know?

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Our family's business is quite systematic.

62
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,029
Go tell Iljo

63
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,829
to stop pestering the Seo family.

64
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,230
Where's Iljo?

65
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,890
Oh, he did all the tests.

66
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,440
He took some painkillers and is sleeping.

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,170
Is it because of the gallbladder surgery?

68
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,800
No, I don't think so.

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,020
Well...

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,300
Shoot.

71
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

72
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,580
Has Iljo

73
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,730
been getting beaten up?

74
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,600
He keeps getting wounded.

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,120
Shouldn't we call the police?

76
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,140
Lee Iljo.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,270
What is all this?

78
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,310
Jeonghan.

79
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,040
-I can explain.
-I'm asking you, what is all this!

80
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,700
It's Seo Jeongin, right?

81
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,620
You let him beat you up like this?

82
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,040
Are you stupid?

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,110
Why did you just let him beat you up?

84
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,659
This darn bastard...

85
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,840
If you ask me to do it,
I'll beat him up for you.

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,260
I'll make him hurt more than you.

87
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,630
I understand him.

88
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,620
What?

89
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,340
He suddenly lost his dad.

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,200
It's understandable that he hates me.

91
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,430
Why did you hide it from me?

92
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,070
Why do I have to hear this
from someone else?

93
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,350
I'm sorry, Jeonghan.

94
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,810
I'm nothing to you.

95
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,960
It's not like that.

96
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,540
You...

97
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,650
must've no idea what I went through

98
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,980
to decide on starting this relationship.

99
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,970
What?

100
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,640
Seeing how I'm head over heels for you,

101
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,760
you think I'm a joke now?

102
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,990
How long are you going to do this to me?

103
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,050
I'm in so much pain because of you.

104
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,090
Hey, Jeonghan.

105
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,380
What?

106
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,540
Let's...

107
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,299
break up.

108
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,780
You know what you're saying, right?

109
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
Yes.

110
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,690
Why are you thinking
of breaking up with me?

111
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,970
Are you having fun playing me?

112
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,970
It's not like that.

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,400
You must be having a great time
looking at how you have control over me.

114
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,990
Jeonghan.

115
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,660
How long
have you been thinking about this?

116
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,720
Here I am saying that I'd take revenge
on the bastard who is torturing you.

117
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,120
Yet you're hurting me.

118
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,340
Huh?

119
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,960
You want to break up?

120
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,140
Jeongin knows.

121
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,520
About what?

122
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,520
That I live with you.

123
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,050
So?

124
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,430
Also that...

125
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,170
I like you.

126
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,600
Don't worry.

127
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,920
I said it was one-sided.

128
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,280
Don't worry?

129
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,820
Do you think I'm someone who'd be worried
about that at this point in time?

130
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,010
I just need to kill that bastard, right?

131
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,770
That's all I need to do, right?

132
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,080
Darn it!

133
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,160
-Jeonghan!
-That darn bastard!

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,910
Jeonghan!

135
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,910
Jeonghan, don't do that.

136
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,080
-Jeonghan!
-Let me go, darn it!

137
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,270
Jeonghan!

138
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,120
Jeonghan!

139
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,110
Jeonghan, please stop!

140
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,360
Please stop! Jeonghan, please.

141
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,580
Please stop, Jeonghan.

142
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,740
Don't you dare say nonsense
like that again.

143
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,830
If I stay by your side,
you'll keep getting hurt.

144
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,130
I won't get hurt just because of this.

145
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,790
I was just whining

146
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,110
when I said it gives me pain.

147
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,580
So...

148
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,980
I'm the one in pain, Jeonghan.

149
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm in so much pain.

151
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,750
I was happy when I was by my dad,

152
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,170
but I was also so unlucky
I wanted to die.

153
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,230
I felt like
I was my dad's only misfortune.

154
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,480
Jeonghan, I don't want to become
my loved one's misfortune again.

155
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,000
But you didn't leave.

156
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,230
You stood by Uncle's side.

157
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,270
So why are you leaving me?

158
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,340
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

159
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,970
I...

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Maybe I like you too much,
so I got greedy.

161
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,720
I think this is all my fault.

162
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,530
It really...

163
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,430
doesn't hurt me at all.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,910
You're not my misfortune, either.

165
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,510
I'd be more misfortunate without you.

166
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,050
No matter what happens,
I will be by your side.

167
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,550
I promise.

168
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,420
Jeonghan.

169
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,880
It's difficult for me.

170
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,290
Please...

171
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,030
Let's just break up.

172
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,130
Hey, don't drink so much.

173
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,090
You're drunk.

174
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,990
Get your hands off me.

175
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,010
Darn it.

176
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,100
Have some snacks.

177
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,150
I told you to drink less.

178
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,880
Darn it.

179
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,210
Here.

180
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,630
Oh?

181
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,630
You're here to drink alcohol for me?

182
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,400
Are you on drugs again?

183
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,330
Let's go for a smoke.

184
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,900
What are you doing?

185
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,770
You bastard!

186
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,060
Darn it.

187
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,650
You bastard!

188
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,410
Bastard!

189
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,430
Darn it.

190
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
Darn it.

191
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,470
What the hell are you doing?

192
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,140
Shut your mouth and smoke.

193
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,040
Hey, Seo Jeonghan!

194
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,590
Hey!

195
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,030
What are you doing?

196
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,860
Come to your senses!

197
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,080
You crazy jerk!

198
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,370
Stop acting pitiful.

199
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,600
Darn it. This is nothing
compared to what you've done.

200
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,300
Did Lee Iljo seduce you?

201
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,040
How the hell did you fall for him?

202
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,080
Shut up.

203
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,830
I saw how he acted innocent
taking care of my dad.

204
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,500
But every moment he got,
he'd stick right onto you in the hospital.

205
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,570
-I told you to shut up—
-Hey.

206
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,540
It's so obvious.

207
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,960
Lee Iljo seduced you, didn't he?

208
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,840
But what to do?

209
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,560
He fooled around with me a lot.

210
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,270
Bastard.

211
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,340
He's still giving others head nowadays.

212
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,950
Seo Jeonghan.

213
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,620
You were fooled, you jerk!

214
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,340
Bastard!

215
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,050
Bastard!

216
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,700
Darn it.

217
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,480
I saw how he acted innocent
taking care of my dad.

218
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,250
But every moment he got,
he'd stick right onto you in the hospital.

219
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,130
But what to do?

220
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,020
He fooled around with me a lot.

221
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,270
You were fooled.

222
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,400
Darn it.

223
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,290
Darn it.

224
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,760
Mr. Seo wants to see you.

225
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,660
I told you to keep a low profile
before you take over the company.

226
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,210
It's just a quarrel between cousins.

227
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,250
It's nothing big.

228
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,910
Don't you know how hard those people
are trying to find dirt on you?

229
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
But they never did.

230
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,200
Lee Iljo.

231
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,040
Don't get too close to him.

232
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
It's for your own good.

233
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,480
There's nothing wrong

234
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,020
with cousins being close.

235
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,050
Jeongin won't easily bet
on a game that he's destined to lose.

236
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,700
He definitely has something on you.

237
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,850
But I don't know what that is yet.

238
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,580
So,

239
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,890
I'm going to get rid of every weakness
you might have.

240
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,590
He's the first one.

241
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,200
He's not my weakness.

242
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,910
If you have nothing more to say,

243
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,390
I'll get going.

244
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,690
Seo Jeonghan!

245
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,710
You don't seem to understand,
so in other words,

246
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,950
it's not for your own good,

247
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,700
but for his own good.

248
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,560
Don't touch him.

249
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,020
If you dare,

250
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,100
I won't let you off easily.

251
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,600
Be smart.

252
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,380
Misfortune will fall upon many people.

253
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,140
Just because of you.

254
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,130
I've been waiting for you
to come back to say goodbye.

255
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,380
What's wrong? What happened to your face?

256
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,430
Did Seo Jeongin do it?

257
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,480
Did you fight?

258
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:56,070
Iljo... Is dating me a misfortune to you?

259
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,060
What are you talking about?

260
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,480
Answer me.

261
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,740
I've never not been happy

262
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,180
because of you, Jeonghan.

263
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,840
That's all I need to know.

264
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,120
I'm ready...

265
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,460
to be with you for a long time.

266
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,780
What about you?

267
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,440
I can easily support you.

268
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,890
So from now on, just do what you like,

269
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,150
and care about what you like.

270
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,760
I don't want to be your weakness.

271
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,530
I'm going to get rid of every weakness
you might have.

272
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,460
He's the first one.

273
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,960
You're not my weakness.

274
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,990
So stop saying
that you're my misfortune or weakness.

275
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,030
I've completely fallen for you.

276
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,430
Lee Iljo.

277
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,140
You and I...

278
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,180
can't just be like that anymore.

279
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,310
But you have a future.

280
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,920
A future more important than me.

281
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,130
Compared to that stupid future,
I prefer the future with you.

282
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,030
So just answer me.

283
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,440
I'm not as kind as you think.

284
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,060
There's something I couldn't tell you.

285
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,660
What is it?

286
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,800
You must think I lied to you.

287
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,720
I know.

288
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,600
What?

289
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,970
I said I know everything, too—

290
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,210
that you slept with Seo Jeongin.

291
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,170
But I don't mind.

292
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,520
Whether you slept with Seo Jeongin

293
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,300
or fooled around with a few people
in Uncle's hospital—

294
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,740
I'm telling you I don't mind.
So why are you being like this?

295
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,980
Lee Iljo.

296
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,210
Stop right there.

297
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,840
If you walk out now,
it's really over for us.

298
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,990
It'd really be over!

299
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,160
Welcome...

300
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,940
You know where Lee Iljo is, right?

301
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,240
I don't.

302
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,740
Isn't he at your house?

303
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,100
How I hope so.

304
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,910
If I file a police report,
we'll find out everything.

305
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,960
Before you embarrass yourself,

306
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,040
tell me where Iljo is.

307
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,010
Bye.

308
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,480
Sorry,

309
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,880
that was rude of me.

310
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,580
After he left,

311
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,790
I got so nervous that I was going crazy.

312
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,750
I thought if he were at your house,

313
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,900
I might be more at ease.

314
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,310
I won't force him to see me.

315
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,480
Just tell me where he is.

316
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,180
Let's sit down and talk.

317
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,840
How sincere are you?

318
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,270
What do you mean?

319
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,420
Why is it Iljo?

320
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,910
Huh?

321
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,760
Why him?

322
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,590
As your partner.

323
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,620
Must there be a reason to like someone?

324
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,760
Don't you know it might hurt him?

325
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,490
I promised him
that no matter what happens,

326
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,690
I'll be by his side.

327
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,650
No.

328
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,890
You're not able to do that.

329
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:56,600
After all, other than Iljo,
you have way too many things to protect.

330
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,990
So leave Iljo be.

331
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,610
Well...

332
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,090
If you see him,

333
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,770
please contact me.

334
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,790
Please.

335
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,880
Mr. Seo Jeonghan.

336
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,630
What?

337
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,000
Is my dad asking you to keep an eye on me?

338
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,090
I have something to tell you.

339
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,080
Mr. Seo wants you to move up
to a directorial position now.

340
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,610
He said you should start shouldering
the future of the company.

341
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,820
But you have a future.

342
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,280
I don't want to be your weakness.

343
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,710
I'm going to get rid of every weakness
you might have.

344
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,560
You met Iljo, right?

345
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm asking you. You met him, right?

346
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,250
I'm sorry.

347
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,460
I can't tell you.

348
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,640
What did you say?

349
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,380
Did you threaten him?

350
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,060
What do you mean?

351
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,960
Please let go. We're in the office.

352
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,490
For the past nine years,
he was sincere towards the Seo family.

353
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,980
Mr. Seo ordered me

354
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,600
to give him a sum of money

355
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,120
as compensation.

356
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,740
Did he accept it?

357
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,380
Yes.

358
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,560
The sum of money I gave to him
is to his satisfaction,

359
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,290
so he accepted it.

360
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,190
When I first mentioned it to him,
he said he would consider it.

361
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,830
When I called him a few days ago,

362
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,500
he agreed.

363
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,340
Looks like you've been in touch
for a long time,

364
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,740
the two of you.

365
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,180
He could have gotten a lot of money
from me.

366
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,080
Why did he choose such a difficult path?

367
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
I think you misunderstood.

368
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,340
This is clearly a settlement between us.

369
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,770
Your relationship
won't do the two of you any good.

370
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,380
Just go.

371
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,900
[Iljo, I'm sorry.]

372
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,620
[I'm sorry for everything.]

373
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,500
[It's my fault.]

374
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,380
[I failed to protect you.]

375
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,540
[I'll be good to you.]

376
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,660
[Iljo, I can't live without you.]

377
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,180
[Lee Iljo:
I never slept with Seo Jeongin.]

378
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,340
[In the next episode]

379
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,330
I didn't move out because I was angry.

380
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,400
I just didn't want to see you anymore.

381
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,370
I want to break up with you.

382
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,080
I'm not done yet.

383
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,360
Don't you know
that Iljo is being threatened?

384
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,590
Is it really none of your business?

385
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,900
His name came out
of that filthy Seo Jeongin's mouth.

386
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,140
Seo Jeongin...
