[Thundercloud Rainstorm]

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,820
When you realize it's love,

5
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,390
it's as if a tiny spotlight
above your head is lit up.

6
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,260
Searching alone on a wooden floor
where I couldn't see anything,

7
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,330
I'm suddenly blinded by some bright light.
So I lower my head,

8
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,380
and find that my feet are

9
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,600
surrounded by countless shiny diamonds
reflecting light.

10
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,530
Iljo is not a stone kicked to my feet,

11
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,960
but a gem that only I can understand.

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,550
Jeonghan!

13
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:24,620
Jeonghan! Jeonghan!

14
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,680
Ugh, you're so noisy.

15
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,329
Oh!

16
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,130
You have to be gentle and precise
with tomatoes.

17
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,270
Their growth slows down below 13 degrees.

18
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,930
When it's over 30 degrees,
pollination stops.

19
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,380
And if you water them too often,

20
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,380
the roots will rot
and they'll get sick easily.

21
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,720
Side shoots grow between their leaves.

22
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,540
If you don't cut these off,

23
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,670
the fruit won't get ripe.

24
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,660
Right, if they lack calcium,

25
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,520
there will be blossom-end rot.

26
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,390
Isn't the name funny?

27
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,230
Blossom-end rot.

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,920
Ugh, it's so hot.

29
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,360
How have you been?

30
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,910
Took you long enough to ask.

31
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,080
I don't know.

32
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
My life sucks. Everything sucks.

33
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,370
All that company and inheritance stuff...

34
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,260
I don't care about all that.

35
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,230
They need more than six hours
of direct sunlight.

36
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840
They only turn red after sunbathing.

37
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,540
So dirty.

38
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,960
You have it.

39
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,860
Jeez, so dirty.

40
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,070
Try it!

41
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,860
Jeez, so dirty.

42
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,090
Hey.

43
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,530
Give me that.

44
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,050
Hey! Wait!

45
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,300
What's wrong with you? Wait!

46
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,180
Come here! Come!

47
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,600
Wait.

48
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,450
I said, wait!

49
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,760
Jeonghan?

50
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,750
Why did you come without telling me?

51
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,420
Can't I come?

52
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,950
What about the company?

53
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,659
I'm on leave.

54
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,700
How did you know I was here?

55
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,790
Where else can you go?

56
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,470
Right.

57
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,710
Didn't you say you wouldn't move out?

58
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,020
I didn't move out.

59
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,030
Then?

60
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,030
I just... miss my dad.

61
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,110
I guess you managed to keep it.

62
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,550
This house.

63
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,140
Wasn't Seo Jeongin riled up about
this being part of the inheritance?

64
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,880
Yeah.

65
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,510
This house isn't worth much anyway.

66
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,860
When are you coming home?

67
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,960
I don't know.

68
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,550
Jeonghan.

69
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,990
What?

70
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,340
Why did you try to leave without saying hi
when you came all the way here?

71
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,330
Because you look the most at ease here.

72
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,000
You should've just lived here.

73
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,169
Why did you come to Seoul?

74
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,880
My dad was so sick he was hospitalized.

75
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,440
I wanted to spend more time by his side.

76
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,720
But you wasted your youth.

77
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,390
He didn't even register you as his son.
Why do you love him so much?

78
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,170
I really don't understand.

79
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,340
My dad said he wanted me to be happy.

80
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,560
That's all he wanted.

81
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,240
But I don't know if I deserve to be happy.

82
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,560
I just

83
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,440
wanted to return the love I received.

84
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,860
Jeonghan.

85
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,360
There's no reason for love.

86
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,160
There's no price either.

87
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,100
At least, that's how my love is.

88
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,290
But every time I see you, I get greedy.

89
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,070
I thought...

90
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,360
maybe I can also be happy.

91
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,640
Can't I...

92
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,640
be happy?

93
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,920
What's wrong?

94
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,330
I'm going for a walk.

95
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,290
Iljo.

96
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,970
Do you want me to move here too?

97
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,020
What about the company?

98
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,380
It's boring;

99
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,180
the company and living there.

100
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,470
Is it?

101
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,710
Since you're so rich,
you can renovate the place for me.

102
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,480
Upgrade the entire house

103
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,060
and build a pool in the yard...

104
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,320
Hey!

105
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,550
What?

106
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,710
Aren't you rich?

107
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,210
You little brat!

108
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,440
Ouch.

109
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,840
By the way,

110
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,120
why aren't you asking me to like you?

111
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,170
One-sided love suits me better.

112
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,720
Oh, really?

113
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,260
How many people have you had a crush on?

114
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,990
Give me a sec.

115
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,830
Hey!

116
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,820
What?

117
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,100
Do you want me to beg you to like me?

118
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,200
How does your mind jump around like that?

119
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm quite quick-witted, you know?

120
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,620
Fine, good for you.

121
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,590
Okay.

122
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
I'll do it just for you.

123
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,900
Do what?

124
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,840
Jeonghan.

125
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,770
Please like me.

126
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,300
What are you talking about?

127
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,070
Please like me. Pretty please.

128
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,000
Stop it.

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,770
What if I don't stop?

130
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,340
What would you do?

131
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,090
Why are you being such a pain?

132
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,940
Please like me, yeah?

133
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,540
Please, just like me, won't you?

134
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,140
Are you testing my patience?

135
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,410
Nope!

136
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,980
Jeonghan!

137
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,840
Please like me!

138
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,310
Just like me!

139
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,120
Hey, Lee Iljo, you...

140
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,370
Please like me!

141
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,810
Jeonghan.

142
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,650
Jeonghan!

143
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,410
Jeong...

144
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,280
Oh my god.

145
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,380
You scared me.

146
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,010
You can be greedy.

147
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,500
You deserve it.

148
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,230
You deserve happiness.

149
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,230
Okay.

150
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,230
You don't want to go?

151
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,930
Should I just stay?

152
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,870
No.

153
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,770
You have to go.

154
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,550
You have work to do too.

155
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,790
No hesitation at all, huh, Lee Iljo?

156
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
You have to go make money.

157
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,520
How else are you going to provide for me?

158
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,490
Get some rest.
Take your time and come back soon.

159
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,750
How can I both
take my time and go back soon?

160
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,460
You know what I mean.

161
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,890
Okay.

162
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,490
First of all,
excluding public education,

163
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,080
it's rare to have a perfect match
for private education.

164
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,480
In comparison, competition...

165
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,180
[Lee Iljo:
I'll be back soon.]

166
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,900
[Seo Jeonghan:
Soon when?]

167
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,740
[Seo Jeonghan:
When are you coming back?]

168
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:40,140
[Seo Jeonghan:
I'm lonely. Come back.]

169
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,270
[Lee Iljo:
Don't you work?]

170
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,900
[Seo Jeonghan:
I'm the CEO's son.]

171
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,650
Jeonghan.

172
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,960
Lee Iljo.

173
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,130
So when are you coming back?

174
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,560
Aren't you tired of asking?

175
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,950
Yes, I'm not tired of asking.

176
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,950
I'll keep asking until you
tell me when you'll be back.

177
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,510
I'll be back in no time.

178
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,570
Ugh!

179
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,080
I don't want to hear

180
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,560
"soon" and "in no time."

181
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Don't you know words
like "now" or "right away"?

182
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,920
So you know how to pester others too.

183
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,280
Hey, Lee Iljo.

184
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,530
Do you think this is fun?

185
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,230
Forget it.

186
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,270
I'm hanging out.

187
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,620
Hey, fine, I'm going back.

188
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,590
When?

189
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,870
Um... Next Friday?

190
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,420
This Friday.

191
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,270
O-Okay.

192
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,770
See you at the restaurant.

193
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,060
At 6 PM.

194
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,910
The restaurant?

195
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,800
Yeah.

196
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
The restaurant
where we had dinner together

197
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,030
before spending a hot night together
in the hotel.

198
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,270
G-Got it.

199
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,420
Go to sleep.

200
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,460
Okay.

201
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,819
Good night.

[Royal Cuisine
Reservation Confirmation]

203
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,050
I've been learning to cook
through online blogs.

204
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,630
Oh.

205
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,960
Me too.

206
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,140
Did you learn how to cook?

207
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,380
Yes.

208
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,800
-Do you cook for your girlfriend?
-Yes.

209
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,100
I cooked for her yesterday too.

210
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,670
Wow, she's so lucky.

211
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,450
What's wrong?

212
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,130
-N-Nothing.
-Nothing

[Seo Jeonghan:
6 PM tonight at Royal Cuisine.]

214

See you soon.]

[Call me when you see this.]
[Iljo, did something happen?]

216
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,940
[Did you forget about tonight?]

217

The phone is turned off.

218
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,210
Please leave a message after the tone.

219
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,330
The phone is turned off.

220
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,700
Please leave a...

221
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,980
What's going on, Lee Iljo?

222
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,960
Ta-da.

223
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,220
Damn it.

224
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,550
You must be waiting for someone.

225
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,180
Who is it?

226
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,210
A friend?

227
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,720
I think this is too much.

228
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,750
A boyfriend?

229
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,760
Shut up and get lost.

230
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,740
You are great in all aspects,

231
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,530
but just too cold to me, your cousin.

232
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,340
[Where are you?
Did something happen?]

233
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,360
Why don't you help
sell some alcohol at my store?

234
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,980
Don't waste your money
on that stupid parasite.

235
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,030
Stupid parasite?

236
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,980
You heard me right.

237
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,710
Lee Iljo, the one who
brought shame to our family.

238
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,030
Your problem is that
you're too compassionate.

239
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,710
You pity him, don't you?

240
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,050
Acting all pathetic in that shabby house.

241
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,640
Did you meet him?

242
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,890
Paid him a visit after a long time.

243
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,400
Why?

244
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,890
Can't we meet?

245
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,440
He's my younger brother after all.

246
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,140
Where did you meet him?

247
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,660
Where else?

248
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,510
The place where my deceased father lived.

249
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,320
No matter what I do,
he wouldn't let go of that house.

250
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,990
I didn't expect him to
target my dad for that house

251
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,250
while he was ill and delirious.

252
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,410
I can't do anything about it
because of the freaking will.

253
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,580
I thought he was just a loser.
Turns out he's a sly fox.

254
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,100
I know you're doing this
because you're bored,

255
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,040
but don't be too nice to him.

256
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,460
What if he clings onto you like a leech?

257
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,560
But don't worry. I've given him a warning.

258
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,620
He won't bother you anymore.

259
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,680
Why are you getting all riled up
over nothing?

260
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,630
Jeonghan.

261
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,090
Do you think you're any different?

262
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,280
You're just toying with him as you wish.

263
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,270
You're the worst.

264
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,340
I'm leaving.

265
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,050
Have fun.

266
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,610
You're just toying with him as you wish.

267
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,230
Hey, it hurts.

268
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,650
Lick it.

269
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,040
How dare you get on top?

270
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,030
What about everything we've done so far?

271
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,990
What was I to you?

272
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,980
Whatever it was, it's meaningless.

273
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,110
Not that you ever meant anything to me.

274
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,300
Sir. Sir!

275
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,380
We're closing.

276
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,080
Oh.

277
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,280
Okay.

278
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,740
Lee Iljo?

279
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,220
Jeonghan.

280
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,750
Lee Iljo.

281
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,130
Lift your head up.

282
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,300
I didn't want you...

283
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,480
to see me like this.

284
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,540
Are you stupid?

285
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,960
What do you take me for?

286
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,990
I'm sorry.

287
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,530
Let me have a look.

288
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,010
Seo Jeongin, that bastard!

289
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,850
Jeonghan.

290
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,550
How could he do this to you?

291
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,090
I look horrible now, don't I?

292
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,460
No, you look pretty.

293
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,760
Iljo.

294
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,770
Let's be official.

295
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,970
What?

296
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,140
I said, let's be official.

[In the next episode]

298
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,850
Iljo.

299
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,570
You still like me, don't you?

300
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,020
Hey.

301
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,640
Why aren't you answering me?

302
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,670
You'll regret losing me, you know?

303
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,730
Do you think you can find someone else
as handsome as me?

304
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,140
Looks aren't everything.

305
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,270
But I'll regret losing you.

306
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,540
I know it's too late,

307
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,580
but can't you give me a chance?

308
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,650
I don't want to be with you
while my heart's wounded.
