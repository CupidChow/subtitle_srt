193
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,440
A prisoner hung himself!

194
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,510
Help! Help!

195
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,580
I can't believe the timing!

196
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,600
We just got here and he's gone.

197
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,870
It means we're on the right track.

198
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,820
Let's go.

199
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,850
What's wrong?

200
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,130
Someone is following us.

201
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,240
Don't look.

202
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,030
Follow me.

203
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,270
Let's go!

204
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,720
What are you doing?

205
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,420
Move!

206
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,290
Let's go.

207
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:38,760
Hello.

208
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,700

209
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,040
Useless!

210
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,250
This place has been turned over.

211
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,430
Weilun mentioned it after all.

212
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,580
They wouldn't have left any evidence.

214
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,390
I really found something.

215
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,320
Look.

216
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,150
A earring?

217
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,750
This might prove

218
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,840
that Rou was here.

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,350
Keep looking.

220
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
-Keep this safe.
-Okay.

Who is Yang Bo?

232
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,520
What are you looking for?

233
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,740
I remembered something.

234
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,820
Where are you going?

235
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,070
I've to go somewhere.

-You're here.

-Don't worry about it.

I worked with you. I know you.

I believe you are innocent.

244
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,840
I hope this would be

245
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,750
of help to you.

246

-Yes. Officer Lai?
-Yes.

Have a seat.

251
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,730
I sent you the photos

252
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,610
some time ago.

253
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,800
In case it wasn't clear enough,

254
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,770
I magnified them.

255
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,220
I was photographing a flock of water birds.

256
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,770
Following the birds, I ended up

257
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,760
by the river.

258
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,300
I didn't find anything wrong

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,630
while taking pictures.

260
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,450
But after the photos were developed,

261
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,860
I was so shocked.

262
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,440
When were these taken?

263
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,990
It was... last year, I think.

264
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,150
I was too busy to develop this batch of film

265
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,020
back then.

266
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,330
I found them

while sorting out my photos.

268
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,570
So I sent them to you right away.

269
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,510
Got it.

270

271

275
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,630
Isn't this the hospital Jiang Yuan went to?

276
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,560
Why are they all cases that Lai has solved?

277
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,820
Rou actually took sedatives regularly.

278
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,400
If we can find the other earring,

279
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,870
it can be proved

280
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,080
that the earring belonged to Rou

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,230
and that she must have been to the burial site.

282
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,670
Where can the other one be?

283
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,850
It's this earring.

285
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,730
I found something big.

This earring really belonged to Rou.

290

You didn't even close the door.

291
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,089
So careless.

292
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,349
I'm sure I closed the door.

293

Check if you lost anything.

294

298

Could it be Jia?

299
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,880
If it was him,

300
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,230
he must've found out

301
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,240

Nothing.

Mr. Quan.

384
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,640
Please take care.

385
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,800
Okay.

386
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,330
How did she know my name?

387
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,870
-Right.
-Have you seen her before?

388
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,650
No, I haven't.

00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,270
Is anyone in?

392
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,830
Hello.

393
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,710
Who are you looking for?

394
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,090
I thought this place looked familiar

395
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,760
when I passed by.

396
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,440
It's like I've been here before.

397
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,850
Sorry for intruding.

398
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,790
Maybe we're fated to meet.

Are you Lily?

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,830
You... know me?

402
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,750
I also know your story with Mr. Bai Lang.

403
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,680
Well,

404
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,110
I don't know how you knew

406
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,030
but...

407
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,550
thank you.

408
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,400
I mean it.

410
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,010
I think

411
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,940
it doesn't matter how long you get

What matters

414
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,690
is every moment you are together.

Bai Lang.

416
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,940
Why did you go out dressed so lightly?

417
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,320
I went to get some fresh air.

418
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,300
It's too stuffy in the house.

419
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,310
Here.

420
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,240
Put it on.

421
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,450
What is this?

422
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,410
I ran out of medicine.

423
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,980
I went out to buy some.

424
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,510
Mr. Bai Lang.

425
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,250
Just hang in there a while more.

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,950
A miracle drug will be released soon.

427
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,480
A miracle drug?

428
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,490
Yes.

429
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,190
Is there really a miracle drug?

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,590
a lot about your story.

433
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,270
Yes.

443

This time,

445
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,590
I need you to do me a favor.

446
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,160
For Liu Meng's case,

447
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,870
who ordered Weilun

448
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,450
to frame Lai?

449
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,620
Frame?

450
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,230
Zhao.

451
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,260
Weren't you monitoring

452
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,930
Zhang Weilun's case?

453
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,590
Spit it out!

454
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,230
It was me.

455
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,590
Weilun was worried that if the investigation continued,

456
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,080
Rou's identity would be exposed.

457
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,240
So he said he killed Liu Meng.

458
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,770
He knew Lai would find out the truth,

459
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,250
so he bribed me

460
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,700
to frame Lai.

461
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,450
Zhao's misdeed must be

462
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,900
dealt with strictly.

463
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
Reinstate

464

Lai today.

465
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,590
Also,

466
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,830
once Rou wakes up,

467
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,690
arrest her immediately!

468
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Okay.

469
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,500
How's it going over there?

470
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,200
The truth of Liu Meng's case is revealed.

471
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,080
The person who framed me is under investigation,

472
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,430
and Rou will be arrested when she wakes up.

473
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,640
What about you?

474
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,930
I'll go back to being a cop, of course.

475
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,470
What about you?

476
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,920
Have you found the lighter?

477
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,880
Of course I did.

478
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,960
After I got the lighter,

479
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,820
I even met an old couple

480
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,480
and recalled the story of the previous comics.

481
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,100
It's a romantic story about a loving couple

482
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,820
whose love stood the test of time.

483
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,330
What kind of story?

484
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,580
Share it with me.

485
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,640

It's Bing!

490
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,190
It's your fault that Bing was arrested.

491

Lai!

495
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,950
You framed Bing.

496
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,500
You caught the wrong person!

497
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,350
I must avenge my son!

498
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,680
Bing is innocent.

500
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,310
I must kill you. I must kill you!

501
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,170
Lai.

502
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,080
Watch out!

-Don't crowd around!
-Don't crowd around!

505
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,850
Move aside! Stop looking!

506
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,540
Arrest him.

507
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,280
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

508
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,140

509
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,110
Are you okay?

510
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,960
I thought you were

511
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
going to die in front of me.

512
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,270
It's okay now. It's okay.

[Fengtai Restaurant]

514
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,500
Cheers.

515
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,360
So it all started because

516
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,110
of the arrest of Bing.

517
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,900
I saved you when you were young

518
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,070
and arrested Bing.

519
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,650
Based on the original history,

520
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,070
it was Bing who got out of prison and killed me.

521
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,440
And because of my death,

522
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,240
you went to interview him in prison

523
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,010
and drew all of these stories into the comics.

524
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,260
But it turns out that the lighter enabled your time travel back here.

525
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,540
So everything

526
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,960
is part of this loop.

527
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,340
So Bing is the space-time origin you mentioned.

528
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,640
Now you have the lighter

529
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,300
and Bing didn't get you.

530
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,570
Does it mean we've broken out of the time loop?

531
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,710
It doesn't matter.

532
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,750
I don't know about some time loop.

533
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,020
All I know is that

534
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,110
at least I'm still alive.

-Careful.
-Take her to the hospital!

544
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,680

547
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,780
It really hurts here.

548
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,270
Why is there suddenly a scar?

549
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,960
A scar?

550
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,590
Are you okay now?

551
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm fine.

552
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,320
Excuse me.

553
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,230
What happened just now?

554
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,910
The boss' daughter accidentally knocked her head

555
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,270
and got seriously injured.

556
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,180
The boss just sent her to the hospital.

557
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,610
In that case,

558
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,390
this is the fourth time.

559
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,860
The first time

560
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,310
you time-traveled,

561
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,550
you were shot

562
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,500
and lost your memory.

563
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,310
The second time,

564
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,980
young Lu Na was

565
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,270
kidnapped by Bing.

566
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
The third time, you almost got into a car accident.

567
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,160
The fourth time

568
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,000
was just now.

569
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,540
The young you was knocked out by a pot.

570
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,620
Every incident proves that in the same space-time,

571
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,160
you two cannot coexist.

572
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,680
One of you will be in danger.

573
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,910
If the little girl dies—

574
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,020
I will die too.

575
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,330
You once said that

576
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,480
the time travel always occurred during the Moon-Venus Conjunction.

577
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,280
We really can't guarantee

578
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,290
nothing goes wrong before the next Moon-Venus Conjunction.

579
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,490
We might really have to send you back

580
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,220
to your space-time with the lighter this time.

581
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,160
Lai.

582
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,270
We're celebrating

583
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,040
your return to the police station

584
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,830
and me escaping another disaster.

585
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,430
Let's not talk about this.

586
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,550
Come on.

587
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,880
Let's drink.

588
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
This toast

589
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,550
is to you.

590
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,930
Thank you for saving my life.

591
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,590
The second toast

592
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,390
is to you for

593
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,660
being a good cop.

594
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,140
And this toast

595
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,790
is to thank you for being in my life.

596
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,000
Enough.

597
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,680
Enough.

598
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,440
Enough!

599
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,140
Do you hear me?

600
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,200
Let go.

601
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,760
Let's get drunk today.

602
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,200
Come on.

603
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,350
Drink up!

604
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,680
Join me!

605
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,800
You won't drink?

606
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000
I'll drink your share too then.

607
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,449
The lighter

608
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,260
and the Moon-Venus Conjunction.

609
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,310
So that's how it happens.

610
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,260
How were my high notes?

611
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,770
Good.

612
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,810
You sang well.

613
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,639
Where are you taking me?

614
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,940
-We’re home.
-Are we home?

615
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,030
No!

616
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,800
We're home.

617
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,870
No, no, no! No, we're not!

618
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,280
You're abandoning me!

619
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,480
I'm not letting you go!

620
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,230
Be good.

621
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,670
Be good, okay?

622
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,320
It'll be the Moon-Venus Conjunction

623
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,800
sometime from tonight to tomorrow.

624
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,780
I'm sleepy.

625
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,140
Let's talk tomorrow.

626
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,450
Let's talk tomorrow.

627
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,440
What if you fail in your time travel tomorrow?

628
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,180
Then I'll stay.

629
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,550
I'm not playing around!

630
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,890
If you don't go back tomorrow,

631
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,750
what should we do if something goes wrong

632
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,610
before the next Moon-Venus Conjunction?

633
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,550
Why are you so fierce?

634
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,710
Tell me what we should do then!

635
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,830
You still have a lot of wine.

636
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,160
I'll get some wine.

637
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,460
Let's finish it.

638
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,570
Can we test it out?

639
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,440
Test it out?

640
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,380
What if we succeed?

641
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,630
Then I'll disappear.

642
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,700
Do you think I want to do it?

643
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,920
Do you think I want to do it?

644
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,710
But at least I can send you back

645
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,630
so you can come back safely,

646
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,360
no?

647
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,050
If I suddenly disappear

648
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,400
and we don't even get a proper goodbye...

649
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,830
are you fine with that?

650
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,280
With your survival on the line,

651
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,670
nothing else matters.

652
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,230
They don't matter?

653
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,000
Do you really think so?

654
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,300
Lu Na.

655
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,000
Lu Na!

656
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,400
Don't you just want me to leave?

657
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,000
I'll leave.

658
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
That's not what I mean.

659
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,980
As you wish.

660
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,920
Lu Na.

661
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,490
Lu Na!

662
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,840
That’s not what I mean, you know?

663
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,130
Then what do you mean?

664
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,550
Give it to me.

665
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,070
Give it to me.

666
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,030
Give it to me.

667
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,700
Can you really bear for me to leave?

668
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,070
Why are you so cute?

669
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,060
I suddenly feel like this is so unfair.

670
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,870
You are clearly

671
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,370
20 years older than me.

672
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,110
But when I come back from the time travel,

673
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,080
I'll be five years older than you.

674
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,360
♫The moon is suddenly on fire♫

675
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,120
♫You must have just been here♫

676
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,880
♫The rose in the flower shop recognizes me♫

677
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,650
♫It was probably once mine too♫

678
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,100
♫How long will it be until we meet?♫

679
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,710
♫I don't even know your name♫

680
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,770
♫Maybe we brushed past each other on the street♫

681
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,900
♫But were swept away by the crowd♫

682
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,710
♫Maybe we're on different planets♫

683
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,790
♫How else could I have overlooked you?♫

684
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,170
♫This loneliness is greater than the distance♫

685
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,880
♫Tearing up out of the blue♫

686
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,710
♫I had a fresh apple♫

687
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,310
♫Which was pulverized by time♫

688
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,800
♫Your city walls have become mottled♫

689
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,210
♫Maybe they have worn out from my stare♫

690
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,520
♫How long will it be until we meet?♫

691
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,120
♫I don't even know your name♫

692
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,960
♫Maybe we brushed past each other on the street♫

693
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,590
♫But were swept away by the crowd♫

694
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,010
♫Maybe we're on different planets♫

695
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,110
Okay.

696
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,270
Thank you.

697
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,260
Have a good day.

698
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,880
Done.

699
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,630
-Here you go.
-Okay.

700
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,110
Have a good day.

701
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,920
Thank you.

702
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,250
Coming.

703
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,410
Did you not bring your keys?

704
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,510
You are...

705
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,840
I’m back.

706
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,360
Lu Na.

707
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,070
Lu Na!

708
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,800
[I have her. Bring the lighter.
See you at the warehouse in the eastern suburbs.]

709
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,190
Let go of me!

710
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,670
What the hell do you want?

711
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:33,800
Tell me

712
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,310
how you came to this era.

713
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,400
I don't understand.

714
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,740
You don't belong to this era.

715
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,670
You belong to 20 years in the future.

716
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,060
I'm really curious.

717
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,800
In 20 years,

718
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,320
what am I doing?

719
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,630
Do you think

720
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,740
a person like you has a future?

721
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,030
What about Lai?

722
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,810
If he hadn't read your comics,

723
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,190
he'd be nothing.

724
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,030
Even if he didn't read my comics,

725
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,210
he'd still have solved those cases.

726
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,760
He's better than you.

727
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,410
Lu Na!

728
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:18,510
Jia,

729
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,710
are you out of your mind?

730
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,980
Let her go.

731
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,360
Let her go!

732
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:23,710
The lighter.

733
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,500
Don't give it to him!

734
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,390
Okay!

735
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,260
Don't... Don't hurt her.

736
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,140
I'll give it to you.

737
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,020
No!

738
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,190
No!

739
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,960
Let her go,

740
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:38,920
and it's yours.

741
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,340
Are you in a position to negotiate with me now?

742
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,400
Give it to me!

743
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:58,670
Your gun.

744
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,440
Your gun!

745
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,270
Kick it over.

746
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,530
No, Lai!

747
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,950
She must be very important to you.

748
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,320
Don't get others involved

749
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,170
in the feud between us.

750
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,410
It's about time

751
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,470
I settle the score with you.

752
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,200
Lai.

753
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,040
You've made things difficult for me on both sides.

754
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,250
I saved Jiangyuan,

755
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,360
Fei's brother,

756
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,650
but you insisted on reporting him.

757
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,230
Lai!

758
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,270
Now Fei's after me.

759
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,610
I was the one who made Zhang Weilun

760
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,710
frame you too.

761
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,610
He could have survived.

762
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,420
But again,

763
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,870
you insisted on investigating it.

764
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,340
Now I lost the Chief Inspector's trust!

765
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,150
Lai, run!

766
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,710
I was also the one who provoked Bing

767
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,960
to take on his alter as Li Qi.

768
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,880
I asked him to kill you,

769
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,620
but you escaped again.

770
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,960
Ignore me!

771
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,130
Run!

772
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,650
You've become the Chief of Police,

773
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,480
yet you colluded with the Maritime Gang,

774
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,850
engaged in corruption,

775
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,440
and disregarded the law!

776
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,360
Why!

777
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,510
Chief of Police?

778
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,330
Is that a big deal?

779
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,680
You really belittled me.

780
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,340
Take a good look!

781
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,530
Look.

782
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,760
You were also involved in smuggling?

783
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,010
Lai.

784
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,900
In Shanglan,

785
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,360
you're nothing

786
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,630
without money and power.

787
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,140
Look at the foreigners

788
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,530
and the Maritime Gang.

789
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,190
I only want money

790
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,230
and power!

791
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,590
I want to stand above them

792
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,960
and have them submit to me!

793
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,770
But all because of you,

794
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,620
I'm in a tight spot now.

795

796
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,400
I could've killed you long ago.

797
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,960
It was only when I got the comics

798
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,310
and learned the secret

799
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,310
that I found out

800
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,580
you can travel through time with the lighter.

801
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,810
Today, let's see what this lighter

802
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,690
can do for me.

Aren't you the great genius detective?

814
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,930
Did her comics tell you

815
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,910
about today's events?

816
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,710
Let me tell you.

817
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,640
I'll kill you today!

It's time you go.

856

You should go back to where you belong.

861

How did I get here?

874
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,570
There was an earthquake last night.

875

by a pendant light at home.

Don't worry.

879

I often ask myself

why time is so moving.

914
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,730
It's because it fosters the growth and demise

953
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,110
I'll draw

954
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,980
a love story with a perfect ending.

955
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:15,660
♫We've been a match since before we knew it♫

956
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:22,670
♫Love is being blindfolded; a fog that cannot be cleared♫

957
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,550
There's no need.

958
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,920
Stories don't have to be perfect.

959
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,040
It's darkness that

960
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,800
accentuates the brilliance of light.

961
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:30,670
♫Time is a winding, lost path, with no way back, no step forward♫

962
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,400
Don't you think?

963
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:34,780
♫In the Yearning Valley in my dream♫

964
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:39,320
♫I see you holding a gift in your hand♫

965
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:47,360
♫Uttering the most beautiful hypothetical: What if...♫

966
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,460
It's missing the word "Lai."

967
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,060
♫Give me a time and a direction♫

968
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,440
Okay.

969
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,470
♫I have a hunch that you and I are a match made in heaven♫

970
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,490
Then I'll...

971
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,070
get it engraved for you.

972
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,390
♫I am your person♫

973
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,030
♫We've been a match since before we knew it♫

974
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:12,500
♫We've been a match since before we knew it♫

975
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,810
♫Don't be afraid♫

976
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,880
♫Running away♫

977
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,470
♫Come here with me♫

978
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,460
Miss Yang.

979
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,310
Actually I called you before.

980
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,230
♫Come with me♫

981
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,070
I am

982
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,610
the president of New Star Publishing House.

983
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,540
♫Give me a time and a direction♫

984
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,240
♫I have a hunch that you and I are a match made in heaven♫

985
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,640
♫I am your person♫

986
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,810
[Back For You]
