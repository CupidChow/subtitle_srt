Back off. Back off!

3
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,090
What's going on?

4
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,729
I don't know.

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
A corpse was found this morning.

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,360
A corpse!

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,920
I was throwing the trash this morning.

8
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,130
It scared me to death.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,810
So tragic.

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,580
In past cases,

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,870
the criminal's motive

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,030
was usually to rob money and to rape.

13
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,020
When there's resistance,

14
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,340
they'd then kill the victim on a whim during the conflict.

15
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,410
This murderer is different.

16
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,680
He appears at midnight.

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
The victims

18
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,960
suffered greatly before death,

19
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,500
tortured through bloodletting

20
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:27,950
and suffocation.

21
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,060

and suffocation.

(Stab wound on the neck)

23
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,950
This is clearly

24
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,520
a serial murder case.

25
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,280
The murders were premeditated.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,840
They chose targets for murder.

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,079

it'll be done in two days.

The injured is male. 29 years old.

He's a sailor.

73
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,060
His blood vessels are ruptured.

74
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,110
He needs surgery now.

75
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,490
Contact his family.

no matter how late I had to stay up to save lives.

81
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,190
Because

82

I both look forward

88
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,800
and fear that it's him.

91
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,750
he died in the sea.

92

But I believe he's still alive.

93
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,630

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,310
Wake up. Don't be a fool.

191
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,070
Do you know what our classmates say about you?

192
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,490
They say you're possessed.

193
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,360
Chun Ying.

194
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,490
One shouldn't dwell on the past.

195
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,870
Actually,

196
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,920
in school,

197
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,960
I quite liked you.

198
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,940
What does his survival have to do with you?

199
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,630
I'm willing to wait. I'm choosing to.

200
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,520
You...

201
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,680
Another glass, please.

202
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,750
Hey.

203
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,670
We found him.

204
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,440
Report back.

205
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,040
Yes, sir.

206
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,910
Come back with us.

207
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,910
You can't escape.

208
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,660
Chun Ying.

209
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,030
Chun Ying.

210
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,980
Why did you drink so much?

211
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,750
Don't drink too much.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

213
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,810
Go have fun.

214
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,620
W-Will you be okay alone?

215
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,130
Go, go, go.

216
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,840
Be careful.

217
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,210
(New World)

218
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,350
Chun Ying.

219
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,080
What do you want?

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,500
You're drunk.

221
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,670
I'll give you a ride.

222
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,790
No need.

223
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,870
-You can’t even stand still.
-Let go!

224
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,750
Don't be stubborn.

225
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,420
Chun Ying—

226
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,530
Let go of her!

227
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,820
Why are you back?

228
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
If you come near Chun Ying again,

229
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,120
I won't go easy on you.

230
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,210
I've put up with you for a long time.

231
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,240
Leave me alone.

232
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,390
Sir.

233
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,670
This lady is really drunk.

234
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,700
I don't need you to see me off.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
Do you know each other?

236
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,080
We'll get off if you won't drive.

237
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,910
Don't.

238
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,700
I was just asking.

239
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,160
Where are you going?

240
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,000
Drive to

241
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,000
Hesheng Hotel.

242
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,790
Okay.

243
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,510
(Hesheng Hotel)

244
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,940
Careful.

245
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,910
Slow down.

246
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,080
You drank so much.

247
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,300
It breaks my heart.

248
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,830
Where am I?

249
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,600
You're awake.

250
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,000
Who are you?

251
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,200
It's me, Chun Ying.

252
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,290
Don't come near me.

253
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,270
Chun Ying.

254
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
Who are you?

255
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,030
Don't come near me!

256
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,430
Hold on.

257
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,910
Jia Hua?

258
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,300
Chun Ying.

259
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,390
It's me.

260
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,840
It's me.

261
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,670
What took you so long?

262
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,030
I missed you so much.

263
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,680
You're injured.

264
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,670
I'm fine.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
It's just a scratch.

266
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,200
Let me see.

267
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,020
This is not a scratch.

268
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,840
This medicine isn't enough.

269
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,040
I have a doctor friend.

270
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,150
Let's go to him now.

271
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,150
He'll keep it a secret.

272
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,670
No.

273
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,970
If they find out,

274
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,430
you'll be in danger too.

275
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,510
Who are they?

276
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,390
The Maritime Gang.

277
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,440
This story is related to the Maritime Gang.

278
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,460
(Hesheng Hotel)

279
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,619
Hello.

280
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,640
Hello.

281
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,400
The man and woman who just got a room here

282
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,000
left their bag in my car.

283
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,109
Room 204.

284
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,390
Come down as soon as you're done.

285
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,030
Okay.

286
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,000
Yu told me

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
to transport

288
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,750
a dozen boxes of red wine

289
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,720
for his friend.

290
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,620
But only when the wine was delivered...

291
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,480
Why is it all wine?

292
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,200
-And someone verified it did I realize...
-Where are the goods?

293
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,050
that they were making us transport

294
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,010
crude opium.

295
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,710
Why is it all wine?

296
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,800
-I don’t know.
-Tell me!

297
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,850
I'll kill you if you don't tell me!

298
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,410
-But the crude opium...
-Where are my goods?

299
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,120
was switched out by someone.

300
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,680
Where are my goods?

301
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,320
I... I-I really don't know.

302
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,160
Calm down!

303
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Calm down!

304
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,850
Can you not touch my shoulders?

305
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,590
I told you not to touch my shoulders!

306
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,920
So what if I touch your shoulders?

307
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,140
Don't kill them!

308
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,180
Look!

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,160
They suspected

310
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,200
that I took the goods.

311
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,760
They know I'm still alive.

312
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,310
So they've been looking for me.

313
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,980
I know

314
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,670
that if I went to you,

315
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,310
you'd be in danger too.

316
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,280
Forget about that for now.

317
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,590
What matters now is treating your wound.

318
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,690
Listen to me.

319
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,150
Go to the friend I said.

320
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,350
It will be fine.

321
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,640
If there's any danger,

322
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,790
we'll face it together.

323
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,350
Okay.

324
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,400
Come on.

325
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,230
I'll take a look.

326
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,940
Who is it?

327
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,190
Hello.

328
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,470
I'm the limousine driver who drove you here.

329
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,280
Miss.

330
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,170
You left your bag in my car.

331
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,290
Jia Hua.

332
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,620
It's the driver just now.

333
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,430
He can send us there.

334
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,130
Hello.

335
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,240
Thank you.

336
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,240
We—

337
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,630
Chun Ying!

338
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,070
What are you doing?

339
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,120
Chun Ying, are you okay?

340
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,760
Chun Ying! Chun Ying!

341
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,550
Chun Ying!

342
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,820
Who are you?

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,330
Let her go.

344
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,190
It has nothing to do with her.

345
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,640
Miss!

346
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,140
I want to ask you about someone.

347
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,400
That is, he...

348
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,740
he's wearing a 8-point hat

349
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,190
and brought a drunk woman

350
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,110
to stay in your hotel.

351
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,940
Sorry.

352
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,760
We can't divulge our customers' info.

353
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,640
Come on.

354
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,310
Tell us!

355
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,490
Do you know what this is?

356
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,440
Room 204.

357
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,460
Naughty.

358
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,380
You should've told us earlier.

359
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,830
What'd she say? 2-0-what?

360
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,590
204.

361
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,750
The more you struggle,

362
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,680
the sooner you die.

363
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,680
I really didn't take the crude opium.

364
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,200
I don't know where the crude opium

365
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
has gone to either.

366
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,730
Don't hurt her.

367
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,340
Come at me if need be.

368
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,840
She knows nothing!

369
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,200
Don't panic.

370
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,330
I'll get to you.

371
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,590
Don't hurt her.

372
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,700
Come at me!

373
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,510
Come at me!

374
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,640
Carotid artery.

375
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,580
I'll cut it.

376
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,040
Don't hurt her!

377
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,240
Come at me!

378
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,200
Don't hurt her!

379
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,400
Her arterial blood will spray to the ceiling.

380
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,470
In 15 minutes,

381
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,450
she can

382
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,270
die of shock.

383
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,730
I really didn't take the crude opium.

384
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,260
They asked me to transport red wine.

385
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,440
I really had no idea!

386
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,090
Jia Hua.

387
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,880
Chun Ying!

388
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,510
Let go of me.

389
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,310
Let go of me!

390
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,880
Let go of me!

391
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,030
Let go of me!

392
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,640
Chun Ying.

393
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,270
Hurry.

394
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,840
Get down!

395
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,720
Jia Hua!

396
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,410
Come out!

397
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,790
Hand over the goods!

398
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,670
He's there!

399
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,890
Don't let him escape!

400
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,830
He ran away like this last time.

401
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,370
Running again?

402
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,450
You think we're fools?

403
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
It's not Jia Hua.

404
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,780
We got the wrong guy!

405
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,920
Did you hear it right?

406
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,190
You sure she said 204?

407
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,440
Beanpole!

408
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,320
Let's go.

409
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,450
Jia Hua!

410
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,830
Jia Hua! Watch out!

411
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,970
Chun Ying, don't come here.

412
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,070
-Don't bother about me.
-Careful.

413
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,030
Run!

414
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,720
Jia Hua!

415
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,380
Where are my goods?

416
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,950
I really didn't take your crude opium.

417
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,260
-Chun Ying!
-Where are my goods?

418
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,380
Tell me!

419
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,760
Jia Hua!

420
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,930
Open the door!

421
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,830
Open the door!

422
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,270
Jia Hua!

423
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,830
Jia Hua!

424
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,880
Where are my goods?

425
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,790
Let go! Let go!

426
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,830
Where are my goods?

427
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,070
Let go of me!

428
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,350
Where are my goods?

429
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,020
I didn't take your goods... I really didn't!

430
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,260
Chun Ying!

431
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,620
Let her go!

432
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,280
Chun Ying.

433
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,400
Are you okay?

434
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,630
Let's go.

435
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,400
Jia Hua.

436
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,020
The Maritime Gang has been taken care of.

437
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,110
Let's go to the hospital.

438
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,530
Come on.

439
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,530
Get in.

440
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,960
Chun Ying.

441
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,020
Jia Hua, are you okay?

442
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,060
Jia Hua. Jia Hua.

443
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,310
You can't fall asleep.

444
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,900
I'm too tired.

445
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,980
Let me sleep for a bit.

446
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,920
Hang in there.

447
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,270
We're almost at the hospital.

448
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
Hang in there.

449
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Please, I beg you.

450
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,200
It's pointless.

451
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,390
It's too late.

452
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,500
Chun Ying.

453
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,380
Chun Ying.

454
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,060
Take me to our usual spot.

455
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,110
Chun Ying.

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,590
I don't want to die in the hospital.

457
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,470
Please.

458
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,020
Take me to our usual spot.

459
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,000
I thought I wouldn't ever get the chance

460
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,070
to watch the sunrise with you like this again.

461
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,110
Jia Hua.

462
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,330
For a year,

463
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,500
I'd been waiting for you to show up.

464
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,390
Don't work so hard at work

465
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,550
from now on.

466
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,140
Because

467
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,380
I was always right by your side.

468
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,110
I watched you get on the tram

469
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,720
and rode the tram with you.

470
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,380
You were so tired that you fell asleep on the tram.

471
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,240
I really wanted to

472
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,930
go and let you lean on my shoulder.

473
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,420
On your birthday,

474
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,760
I even prepared fireworks for you.

475
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,380
Thinking about how happy you'd be watching the fireworks

476
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,600
and the colorful lights shining on you,

477
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,430
I really wanted to rush over

478
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,180
and hug you.

479
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,810
Do you remember

480
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,630
when we just got together,

481
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,050
I often brought you here to watch the sunrise?

482
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,600
On our first date,

483
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,730
we went to the photo studio

484
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,790
to take photos.

485
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,580
Do you remember

486
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,370
that you kept making funny faces?

487
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,670
We ended up without a proper photo

488
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,990
even after posing for so long.

489
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,640
Look.

490
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,470
You look really ugly like this.

491
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,330
Suddenly, on top of the mountain,

492
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,760
a breeze brushed past Chun Ying's hair.

493
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,630
It's as if the burning soul of Jia Hua

494
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,110
was hugging Chun Ying for one last time.

495
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,140
Lu Na.

496
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,750
What’s wrong?

497
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,860
Lu Na!

498
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,010
Doctor!

499
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,590
Doctor!

500
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,010
Is the doctor here?

501
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,340
Doctor. Doctor. Hurry.

502
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,200
Check on her. She moved.

503
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,200
Is... Is she waking up?

504
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,570
Doctor, is she waking up?

505
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,510
Sudden fits.

506
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,750
Hold on.

507
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,010
How is she?

508
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,490
She's still unconscious.

509
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,880
It might've been triggered by a dream.

510
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,330
Is that dangerous?

511
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,220
She's fine now.

512
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,510
Her heart rate's leveled off.

513
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,130
Liu, note that down.

514
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,630
Remove this.

515
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,790
Okay.

516
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,720
Wait.

517
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,870
I seem to have missed something.

518
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,140
In past cases,

519
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,470
(Stab wound on the neck)
In past cases,

520
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,490
(Stab wound on the neck)

521
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,310
the criminal's motive was usually to rob money and to rape.
(Stab wound on the neck)

522
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,510
the criminal's motive was usually to rob money and to rape.

523
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,560
(Crime scene location: Renyi Apartment)
the criminal's motive was usually to rob money and to rape.

524
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,470
Where are you going?

525
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,160
Hesheng Hotel.

526
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,110
Okay.

527
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,410
(Hesheng Hotel)

528
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,140
Is she trying to tell me something?

529
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,340
Doctor.

530
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,480
I'll be right back.

531
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,190
Please take care of her for me.

532
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:34,840
Okay.

533
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,960
Pay attention to

534
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,880
the patient's infusion.

535
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,530
Got it.

536
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,770
Chief Inspector Zhang.

537
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,070
It's me, Lai.

538
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,440
I may have some clues

539
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,950
about the midnight murder case.

540
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,750
I think the murderer is probably

541
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,820
a limousine driver.

542
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,070
He lurks in front of the nightclub

543
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,230
to target those single drunk women.

544
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,570
If there is a car number

545
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,650
with the plate F1028,

546
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,250
it must be inspected carefully, okay?

547
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,110
Okay.

548
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,920
(New World)

549
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,310
Here.
(New World)

550
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,000
(New World)

551
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,510
Careful.
(New World)

552
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,200
(New World)

553
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,940
It's late.
(New World)

554
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,200
(New World)

555
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,310
Let's get a taxi.
(New World)

556
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,480
(New World)

557
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,000
Sure.
(New World)

558
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,250
Let's take this taxi.

559
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,360
Okay.

560
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,880
Get off the car!

561
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,440
Get off!

562
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,330
Behave! Someone reported you for murder.

563
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,240
What's going on?

564
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,790
Get off.

565
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720
Get off!

566
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,780
-Inspect the car.
-Yes, sir.

567
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,780
Don't move!

568
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,330
Look.

569
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,300
Arrest him.

570
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,490
He was targeting you.

571
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,880
The serial killer

572
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,830
has been arrested.

573
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,730
It's okay now.

574
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,920
Take him back!

575
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,160
Thank you.

576
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,640
That driver was...

577
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,130
I think he's some

578
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,990
murderer of a serial murder case?

579
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,110
I'm not sure either.

580
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,920
But it's all settled.

581
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,840
How are we going to get home?

582
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,550
Let's get another taxi.

583
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,500
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

584
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,540
Well done, Lai.

585
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,230
You solved another case.

586
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,370
The serial murder case is solved.

587
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,659
Along with that,

588
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,130
the case of Beardie and Beanpole

589
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,670
smuggling crude opium is also solved.

590
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,790
Actually, in the first place,

591
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,610
Officer Huang sent me to be a spy

592
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,159
to investigate the crude opium smuggling by the Maritime Gang.

593
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,840
After a strange turn of events, I ended up with some clues.

594
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,870
Unfortunately,

595
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,110
the blame was ultimated pinned on

596
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,360
just the two of them.

597
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,630
At least we've found something.

598
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,110
By the way,

599
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,880
I've been meaning to ask you this.

600
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,500
Are these clues

601
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,530
from the same informant from before?

602
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,520
Who is this informant?

603
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,350
My informant is a gorgeous beauty.

604
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,510
She will risk it all

605
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,610
for me.

606
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,020
Fine, forget it.

607
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,630
You don't have to tell me.

608
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,400
Make sure

609
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,000
you protect the informant.

610
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:10,960
Okay.

611
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,370
We're finally here.

612
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,660
Yes.

613
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,320
There's something

614
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,570
I've kept hidden deep down.

615
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,080
I must find him.

616
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,400
I'm finally back.

617
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,760
(Buddy Hotel)

618
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,190
This rundown place
(Buddy Hotel)

619
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,960
(Buddy Hotel)

620
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,000
is no longer the Buddy Hotel in my memories.
(Buddy Hotel)

621
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,480
(Buddy Hotel)

622
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,590
He saved me here back then.

623
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,630
This time,

624
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,480
I must find you.

625
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,460
(Back For You)
