00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,970
not your home.

196
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,600
Pack up and leave tomorrow.

197
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,060
Crazy.

198
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,390
I'm sorry, Dad.

199
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,430
I got you fired.

200
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,890
It's okay.

201
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,560
I can't stay here much longer anyway.

202
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,510
It's good to leave.

203
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,460
Li Qi.

204
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,730
Li Qi, it's really you.

205
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,420
I didn’t expect to meet you here.

206
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,950
You used to work in a pawnshop.

207
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,800
Why do you pretend you don't know me?

208
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,490
No.

209
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,670
What a coincidence.

210
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,390
Is he your son?

211
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,720
He looks like you.

212
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,600
I heard you got the wrong pawn ticket

213
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,830
and went home with your wife.

214
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,220
Why are you working here?

215
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,600
Where's your wife?

216
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,790
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,100
We've got work to do. We have to go.

218
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,560
Li Qi.

219
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,460
Why are you still standing there?

220
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,440
Come and help.

221
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,740
We'll leave soon.

222
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:21,750
Dad.

223
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,560
What did he just say?

224
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,100
Never mind.

225
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,430
Come help me.

226
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,190
Dad.

227
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,740
Where is my mom?

228
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,990
Why have you never mentioned her?

229
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,450
Why haven't I thought about it myself?

230
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,660
Where's my mom? Dad.

231
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,140
Dad.

232
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,550
Why didn't you tell me anything

233
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,550
about my mom?

234
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,950
Can you tell me?

235
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,690
Dad.

236
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,420
Dad.

237
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,970
Stop asking.

238
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,240
Drink the milk. Drink.

239
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,530
Drink it.

240
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,020
Drink it and you'll be fine.

241
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,870
Drink it.

242
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,520
Drink it.

243
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
Drink it and you'll be fine.

244
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,570
Drink it and you'll be fine.

245
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,900
You'll be fine.

246
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,240
You'll be fine.

247
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,400
You'll be fine.

248
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,940
You'll be fine.

249
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,690
You'll be fine.

250
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,150
Stop asking.

251
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,630
Stop asking.

252
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,730
Mom!

253
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,480
Mom!

254
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,030
Mom!

255
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,480
Dad!

256
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,120
Dad!

257
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,670
Dad!

258
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,520
Dad!

259
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Your son stole my gold watch.

260
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,290
What are you waiting for? Search him!

261
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,320
Do you know

262
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,580
the guest who lost his watch

263
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,750
ended up leaving without checking out?

264
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,700
I wonder if it's because of your dad.

265
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,000
Have you seen Long?

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,550
No.

267
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,140
I can't find him anywhere.

268
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,730
There are tonics in the milk.

269
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,620
It's good for you.

270
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,060
Drink it.

271
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,300
Officious

272
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,190
and contemptuous.

273
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,450
Why are you working here?

274
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,720
Bing.

275
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,390
I'm going to call the police.

276
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,440
You're a murderer.

277
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,190
Bing.

278
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,190
Manman.

279
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,280
Bing.

280
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,630
-Manman.
-What’s wrong?

281
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,490
Run!

282
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,150
What's wrong?

283
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,830
What are you doing?

284
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,690
What are you doing?

285
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,390
Don't you want to be my friend?

286
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,400
I shouldn't have talked to you.

287
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,790
Get out.

288
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,660
Please help me.

289
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,120
Don't you want to be my friend?

290
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,430
Let go of me!

291
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,420
Help me!

292
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,900
Otherwise my dad will kill you too.

293
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,390
Help me.

294
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,380
Bing!

295
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,210
Bing!

296
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,910
Where are you?

297
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,350
Bing.

298
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,130
Where are you?

299
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,970
Bing.

300
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,750
Don't talk.

301
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,880
Don't talk. Keep quiet.

302
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,920
Don't talk.

303
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,830
Bing.

304
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,830
Are you being disobedient?

305
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,340
Bing.

306
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,260
Don't talk. Keep quiet.

307
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,550
Don't talk.

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,620
Bing.

309
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,160
Open the door!

310
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,460
Open the door!

311
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,870
Help!

312
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,800
Help!

313
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,140
Help!

314
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,740
Help!

315
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,580
Bing.

316
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,870
Are you being disobedient?

317
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,490
Dad.

318
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,770
Disobedient!

319
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,920
Is your head still hurting?

320
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,770
Why did you kill them?

321
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,710
They bullied you.

322
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,590
I would never allow anyone else

323
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,350
to bully you.

324
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,780
So I killed them.

325
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,240
You killed them?

326
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,360
I took them as gifts.

327
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,460
Do you like them?

328
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,820
You always say that I didn't do anything for you.

329
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,150
Actually, I did a lot for you.

330
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,040
You killed my mom?

331
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,110
I thought

332
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,060
you would never remember this.

333
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,540
She wanted to take you away,

334
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,460
but she couldn't.

335
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
As long as you listen to me,

336
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,590
I will protect you.

337
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,680
It's not like that.

338
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,860
It's not like that.

339
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,040
You kill because you're useless

340
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,120
and people look down on you.

341
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,680
You stole from the pawnshop.

342
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,690
You never do anything to others.

343
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,550
You only beat me

344
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,860
and my mom.

345
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,090
You've been like this since you were a kid.

346
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,800
You've never dared to do anything to anyone else.

347
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,980
You only beat me

348
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,680
and my mom.

349
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,590
I remember now.

350
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,610
You're crazy.

351
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,290
You're crazy.

352
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,840
I'm not crazy.

353
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,450
Don't talk to me like that!

354
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,470
That was a long time ago.

355
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,180
Let go of me!

356
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,600
-You have to trust me.
-Let go of me!

357
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,730
I'm doing this for your own good.

358
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,310
Just like this woman.

359
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,020
Do you really think she will like you?

360
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,620
Impossible.

361
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,560
That's because of you.

362
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,140
You don't trust me?

363
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,290
Do you like Bing?

364
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,490
Don't say anything.

365
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,610
Don't say anything.

366
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,050
Don't say anything.

367
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,970
Don't say anything.

368
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,750
Say it.

369
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,440
Don't say it.

370
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,370
Say it.

371
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,330
Don't say it.

372
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,230
Don't say it.

373
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,640
I like him.

374
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,510
Don't say it.

375
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,330
I like Bing.

376
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,440
You're lying.

377
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,920
No!

378
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,310
I really like Bing.

379
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,920
No!

380
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,580
No one in the world

381
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,810
really loves you except me,

382
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,290
and no one

383
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,770
can take you away from me.

384
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,330
Be good, Bing.

385
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,200
Drink the milk.

386
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,350
Here.

387
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm not Bing.

388
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,760
You killed my mother.

389
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,280
You killed Manman!

390
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,190
You murderer!

391
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,420
Go to hell!

392
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,530
Bing.

393
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,010
I'm not Bing.

394
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,240
I might be you.

395
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,860
You made me like this.

396
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,690
You know what?

397
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,780
I hate milk.

398
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,300
How could this happen?

399
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,520
How could this happen?

400
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,820
How could this happen?

401
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,410
How could this happen?

402
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,360
It wasn't me.

403
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,180
It wasn't me.

404
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,660
It wasn't me.

405
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,300
Who are you?

406
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,920
My name is Bing.

407
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm just a waiter.

408
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,360
I didn't kill anyone.

409
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,570
Why did you draw me as the murderer?

410
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,440
Why?

411
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,200
It wasn't me.

412
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,660
Lu Na!

413
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,650
Let her go!

414
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,860
I don't care who you are.

415
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,730
Don't hurt her.

416
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,010
Are you the cop who arrested me?

417
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,710
I am.

418
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,410
I didn't kill anyone.

419
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,030
It's my dad.

420
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,220
Help me find my dad,

421
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,150
and I'll let her go, okay?

422
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,320
I'll let her go.

423
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,610
Say something.

424
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,070
You can't find him?

425
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,400
You're not Bing.

426
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,100
What did you say?

427
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,480
The person you're looking for

428
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,870
is yourself.

429
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,970
Your dad died because of you.

430
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,020
Don't you remember?

431
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,820
What are you talking about?

432
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,750
What are you talking about?

433
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,720
What...

434
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,420
Myself?

435
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,720
Myself?

436
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,330
My dad?

437
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,880
Myself?

438
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,870
Bing.

439
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,150
Where are you going?

440
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,540
Bing!

441
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,830
Bing!

442
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,830
Leave me alone.

443
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,310
Where are you going?

444
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,010
I don't want to be a waiter anymore.

445
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,840
I don't want to be looked down upon anymore.

446
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,210
I didn't take anything from him.

447
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,640
Didn't we settle the matter already?

448
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,500
Did we?

449
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,940
But what were you doing back then?

450
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,480
You would only watch

451
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
and do nothing.

452
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,830
You collected the clothes.

453
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,590
If you'd seen it, this wouldn't have happened.

454
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,720
Right.

455
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,380
It's always my fault.

456
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,180
Don't talk to me like that!

457
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,030
Right.

458
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,600
All you do is beat me.

459
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,120
What else can you do?

460
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,430
You will never protect me.

461
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,880
Bing.

462
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,990
Stop bothering me.

463
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
Bing.

464
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,680
Dad!

465
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,330
Dad!

466
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,240
Dad!

467
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,000
Dad!

468
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,880
Dad!

469
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,920
Dad!

470
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,440
Dad!

471
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,750
Dad!

472
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,640
Dad!

473
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,680
Bing.

474
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,240
Dad!

475
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,700
Dad.

476
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,450
No.

477
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,150
No.

478
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,860
No.

479
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:04,750
No.

480
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,210
Dad!

481
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,350
Dad!

482
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:08,880
Dad!

483
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,370
Tell me, did you take my gold watch?

484
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,780
You are so stupid.

485
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,570
How can the wine be sweet?

486
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,430
You're just a temp.

487
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,920
There's no hope for you.

488
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,290
Living in the attic, you're worse than a cockroach.

489
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,250
Idiot.

490
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,430
Do you really think I treat you as a friend?

491
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,180
Look at him.

492
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,840
What are you looking at?

493
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,130
It wasn't me.

494
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,360
Dad.

495
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,990
-Dad.
-Did you take it?

496
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,030
Did you take it?

497
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,470
I didn't.

498
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,030
No, it wasn't me. Dad.

499
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,410
Bing.

500
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,490
Don't be afraid.

501
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,780
I'm here.

502
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,010
I will protect you.

503
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,240
Bing likes these glittering things.

504
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,820
Do you really like me?

505
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,830
Do you really like me?

506
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,770
Do you really like me?

507
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,030
Do you?

508
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Yes.

509
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,460
I like you.

510
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
You're lying.

511
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,010
I'm not lying.

512
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,860
I really like you.

513
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,580
My mom often told me this when I was a kid.

514
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
She said she loved me the most.

515
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,520
Every night before I went to bed, she told me

516
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,330
she loved me,

517
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,000
but one morning when I woke up,

518
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,690
she disappeared.

519
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,680
She only left me a note.

520
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,450
Do you think you'll be like her?

521
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,690
No.

522
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,900
I won't.

523
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,900
I really like you.

524
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,290
Let go of me!

525
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
I can prove it to you.

526
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,180
Let go of me. I'll prove it to you.

527
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,270
Let go of me!

528
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,360
Do you think we should let her go?

529
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,150
Do you really think she will like you?

530
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,500
Don't disturb my game.

531
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,260
I told you to be quiet.

532
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,180
I told you to be quiet.

533
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,790
Milk.

534
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,490
I really like you.

535
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,500
Please let me go.

536
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,410
Bing!

537
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,530
Let go of me!

538
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,840
What are you doing?

539
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,720
If you really like Bing,

540
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,940
drink this glass of milk.

541
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,590
Bing loves milk.

542
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,450
OK?

543
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,630
Do you really like Bing?

544
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,620
Do you?

545
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,180
Do you?

546
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,400
If you like him,

547
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,860
just kiss him, okay?

548
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,990
You're lying.

549
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,270
I'm not.

550
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,390
I'm not.

551
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,889
Poor Bing.

552
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,179
Without me,

553
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,060
who could protect him?

554
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,090
You killed your father.

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,380
Then you had a split personality

556
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,260
and did all the things you were afraid to do before,

557
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,370
and got back at those

558
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,770
you thought had bullied you before.

559
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,210
I'm his father.

560
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,050
Shouldn't I?

561
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,150
Shouldn't I?

562
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,989
Say something.

563
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,980
You're not.

564
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,600
You're just a murderer

565
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,030
making excuses for yourself.

566
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,409
Because they deserve to die.

567
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,360
Everyone who bullied Bing deserves to die,

568
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,110
including you.

569
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,030
We?

570
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,800
Don't you remember?

571
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,230
Officer.

572
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,210
Bing was miserable in prison.

573
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,620
He was always beaten by those scumbags.

574
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,190
It's all because of you.

575
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,770
Because you arrested him.

576
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,860
As for you, Miss Comics.

577
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
Bing has been in prison for 20 years.

578
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,440
Only one person went to visit him,

579
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,710
and that was you.

580
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,210
