is the same person

in the wheelchair yesterday.

6
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,330
Why does he look so much older?

7
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,200
And the Buddy Hotel suddenly became so shabby,

8
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,840
as if it had been decades.

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,970
These might be caused by the comics.

10

Are you remembering something?

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,120
When you were fighting

12
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,580
with the middle-aged Bing,

13
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,790
I seemed to see something.

14
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,290
It's like I was making a wish,

Sorry.

20
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,450

to tell you.

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,250
But it did happen.

32
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,780
You appeared in front of me unexpectedly

33
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,530
with comics that could predict murders.

34
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,420
So many unbelievable things have happened.

Yes.

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,570
there was not enough staff in the restaurant.

54

How did you travel through time?

134
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,870

to get us back here, right?

164
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,180

the lighter you picked up when you were young

176
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,590

00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,360
He wanted to kill Manman.

195
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,310
He wanted to kill Manman.

196
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,910
Nonsense.

197
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,250
He really wanted to kill Manman.

198
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,440
Your father died long ago.

199
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,820
You're not going to confess, are you?

200
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,460
Fine.

201
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,570
I'd like to see

202
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,070
if you're tough enough.

203
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,020
Zhao.

204
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,820
Manman.

205
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,180
It was me.

206
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,820
I did it.

207
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,040
I killed them.

208
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,700
I'll tell you.

209
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,090
Please let my son go, okay?

210
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,830
Jia.

211
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,110
Is he possessed?

212
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,870
Bing,

213
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,270
you can't fool us with your tricks.

214
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,470
What do you want to know?

215
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,430
I can tell you.

216
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,570
Bing knows nothing.

217
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,300
Let him go, okay?

218
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,420
You can't clear your name by playing tricks.

219
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,980
I'm Bing's father.

220
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,640
My name is Li Qi.

221
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,510
Bing is an honest boy.

222
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,700
I only did it

223
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,190
to protect him

224
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,670
from being bullied by those bad guys.

225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,370
Jia.

226
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,880
Is he really crazy?

227
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,610
Shut up!

228
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,430
Mr. Can

229
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,250
said he was with Lai.

230
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,420
The female guest he kidnapped

231
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,130
also said she was with him.

232
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,340
One person

233
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,670
appeared in two places at the same time.

234
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,850
How is that possible?

235
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,250
Jia.

236
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,060
Does he have a twin brother?

237
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,750
Well...

238
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,150
Is the date wrong?

239
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,960
[Tuesday, August 8, Year of Bingxu]

240
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,310
Year of Bingxu?

241
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,610
It should be the Year of Bingyin.

242
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,980
Year of Bingxu?

243
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,030
Year of Bingyin?

244
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,730
Why?

245
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,990
Sir.

246
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,180
I just received

247
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,670
a report from Yuhua Girls' High School.

248
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,580
Lan Xin, a high school girl,

249
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,740
has been missing for three days.

250
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Jia is working on a big case.

251
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,580
Can't you see?

252
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,860
He doesn't have time to deal with it now.

253
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,110
Register it. We'll talk later.

254
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,970
Yes.

255
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,060
How much can you remember

256
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,390
in these blank comics?

257
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,290
I only

258
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,750
remember a little.

259
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,330
Don't be anxious.

260
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,440
Just give me some time.

261
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,670
I'm not anxious.

262
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm a little disappointed in myself.

263
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,460
Why?

264
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,310
According to our logic,

265
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,790
I'm not a good cop

266
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,300
in your imagination.

267
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,480
I can solve the cases

268
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,890
just because of these comics.

269
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,150
Of course not.

270
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,560
Without you,

271
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,460
how would I know the truth of these cases?

272
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,340
How could I draw these comics?

273
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,060
Yes.

274
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,860
A new story.

275
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,760
All fear

276
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,760
is the projection of your inner self.

277
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
My name is Ma Ke.

278
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,900
My hometown is in northern Jiangsu.

279
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,750
I've always wanted to see the outside world.

280
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,650
My family is worried that I am too kind

281
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,260
and will be easily bullied.

282
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,900
But I believe

283
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,410
God rewards those who work hard.

284
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,690
No effort is wasted.

285
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,760
Good things happen to good people.

286
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,560
Don't rent a sunny room if you can't afford it.

287
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,740
Ma Ke.

288
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,150
I know you’re inside.

289
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,200
Listen.

290
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,530
You have to pay the rent.

291
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,540
Do you hear me?

292
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,000
You bumpkin.

293
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,740
If you don't pay the rent,

294
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,130
just get out of here.

295
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,940
Do you hear me?

296
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,840
Ma Ke.

297
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,900
Coming, coming, coming.

298
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,830
It's for two months.

299
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,060
When will you pay me the rest?

300
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,070
The rest?

301
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,740
Soon.

302
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,940
Soon.

303
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,710
Poor me!

304
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,940
[Fengtai Restaurant]

305
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,589
I'm an errand boy at the Fengtai Restaurant.

306
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,180
They call me delivery boy.

307
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,470
Right.

308
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,310
They say

309
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,900
Ma Ke is a fancy name.

310
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,420
Mr. Quan.

311
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,470
I'm back.

312
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,550
Ma Ke, thank you.

313
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,950
Mr. Quan, there're so many guests.

314
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,770
Yes, it's full.

315
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,619
So you should treat guests warmly

316
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,319
and serve them well.

317
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:27,750
Okay.

318
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,850
Work hard

319
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,820
and sharpen your eyes.

320
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,900
Okay, don't worry, Mr. Quan.

321
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,550
I'd like to pay my bill.

322
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,040
Go get to work.

323
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,820
I'll be right there.

324
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,620
Let's get these as you said.

325
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,780
Okay.

326
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,970
Sir.

327
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,510
Don't waste so much food.

328
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,880
How about this?

329
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,830
If you think it's a waste,

330
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,830
you can eat them all.

331
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,550
Okay?

332
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,270
Eat.

333
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,790
Here.

334
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,610
You can take them away.

335
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,430
Take them away?

336
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,060
-Take them away?
-Who are you?

337
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,810
How dare you poke your nose into my business?

338
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,550
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,510
He's the new delivery boy.

340
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,460
He's immature.

341
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,870
Please forgive him.

342
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,150
Please.

343
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,710
Let's go.

344
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,740
Have you finished?

345
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,600
Yes.

346
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,360
Mr. Jiang.

347
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,910
Go.

348
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,950
Mr. Jiang.

349
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,740
Take care.

350
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,680
See you again.

351
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,970
Are you crazy? Mind your own business.

352
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,010
Do you know who they are?

353
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,130
Aren't they just rich people?

354
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,030
The leader is Jiang Yuan.

355
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,950
His brother, Fei,

356
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,140
is now the boss of Jinxin Company of the Maritime Gang.

357
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,580
Those people next to him are all from distinguished families.

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,620
You are poor.

359
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,140
How can you fight against them?

360
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,710
Listen.

361
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,100
You're

362
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,190
no match for them.

363
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,840
I know, Mr. Quan.

364
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,330
Hurry up and deliver the food.

365
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,270
Your food.

366
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,420
Here's your tip.

367
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,230
Thank you.

368
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,750
Hello? The delivery boy is here.

369
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,260
Thank you.

370
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,710
Your food.

371
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,030
To make more money...

372
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,590
Thank you.

373
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,470
I rush to deliver every order every day.

374
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,420
I'm even willing to go

375
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,110
where no one else wants to go.

376
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,780
What is this?

377
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,680
What is this place?

378
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,260
Where are you going?

379
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,160
What the hell?

380
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,670
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,130
I seem to have lost my way.

382
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,520
What is this place?

383
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,380
This is the famous

384
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,060
St. Mary's Hospital.

385
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
