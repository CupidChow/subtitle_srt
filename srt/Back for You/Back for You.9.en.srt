197
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,290
Well done.

198
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,750
It's my pleasure, Jia.

199
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,300
You played a big part in me taking over the Chief of Police.

200
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,250
You'll be the captain from now on.

201
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,350
Thank you, Captain!

202
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,630
Thank you, Chief of Police!

203

Let's share the feast of success.

204
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,130
Yeah...

205
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Share the feast of success!

206
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,640
From now on, we'll share the feast.

207
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,200
And leave Lai nothing.

208
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,630
Jia,

209
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,330
luckily, I got the photos

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,830
from Alai in advance this time.

211
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Otherwise, he'd have taken the credit once again.

212
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,020
But

213
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,680
I find it quite weird that

214
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,270
Lai's always one step ahead, finding the key

215
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,610
to the cases before anyone else.

216
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,590
Why?

217
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,390
You're right.

218
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm also curious.

219
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,090
Anyway,

220
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,750
we must keep a close eye on him this time.

221
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,240
Can't let him turn the tables no matter what.

222
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,590
Keep a close watch Lai.

223
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,680
Don't worry, Jia.

224
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,670
This is...

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,480
So this is the safe house you mentioned?

227
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,320
Yep.

228
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,310
Take a seat.

229
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,620
You said you're a cop.

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,510

234
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,870

235
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840

This is my police academy graduation certificate.

238

And my suspension has a lot to do with you.

239
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,440

The comics in your bag

244
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,930
perfectly match these real cases.

245
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,540
You mean

246
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,230
these comics foreboded these murders?

247
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,770
Yes.

248
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,120
And these comic books appeared with you.

249
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,940

I have no reason to lie to you.

I don't know!

255
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,640
Because the comics show the content

256
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,470
only when a case is about to happen.

257
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,480

288
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,010
that girl

289
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,790
was taken away from the hospital by Lai.

292
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,960
Could she be Lai's informant?

293
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,050
Since this is related to the case,

294
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,640

I don't know why, but I woke up in the hospital,

310
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,490
not even knowing who I am.

311
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,970
a suspended cop.

315
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,470
put these blank comics in front of me,

316
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,530
and asked me to think about the murders that might happen next.

317
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,880
How would you take it

318
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,920
if you were in my place?

319
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,420
Then why did you come back with me?

320
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,040
Because when I was in a coma,

321
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,620
I thought I heard someone telling me a story.

322
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,870

I know the whole thing's kind of hard to swallow,

327
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,390
but as I've said,

328
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,820
to know who you are

329
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,710
and what will happen next,

330
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,000
we must figure out

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,270
what the comics have to do with you.

332
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,930

333
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
really have nothing to do with me?

383
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,070
Well...

384
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,970
does what I did count as calling the police?

385
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,740
Of course.

386
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,480
Mr. Can, is there a wheelchair here?

387
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,510
Could you find me one?

388
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,100
Okay.

389
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,130
I'll go look for it.

390
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,160
Lu Na,

391
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,990
fetch me the comics.

392
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,890
Got them?

393
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,850
Let's head for the police station

394
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,640
and figure out who he is.

395
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,390
Let's go.

396
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,650
Hold on.

397
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,310
Buddy Hotel,

398
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,120
237...

399
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,650
Buddy Hotel?

400
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,110
Mr. Can, you know where it is?

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,210
It's a newly opened hotel,

402
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,250
located at 7, Seventh Street, Wanheng Road.

403
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,310
Okay.

404
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,500
Let's go.

405
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,760
Who are you?

406
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,200
We're Lai's colleagues.

407
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,380
He asked us to wait for him at his place.

408
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,910
We're police in the Port District.

409
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,410
Where is he?

410
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,810
So you're also police!

411
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,850
A cripple just appeared in our warehouse.

412
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Lai and a girl sent him away.

413
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,060
A cripple popped up out of nowhere?

414
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,480
Jia.

415
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,960
How similar...

416
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,060
It's him!

417
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,650
It looks so much like that cripple.

418
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,250
What's up?

419
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,460
What's wrong?

420
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,410
Are you okay?

421
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,170
I think I saw something in my mind.

422
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,330
What did you see?

423
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,510
I saw this person.

424
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,060
But

425
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,540
he looked a bit younger.

426
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,500
So messy.

427
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,330
There was blood all over the place.

428
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,570
And also a

429
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,120
huge crystal chandelier.

430
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,750
It was like in a

431
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,780
hotel.

432
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,010
Yes,

433
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,750
a hotel.

434
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,650
Now you believe what I said?

435
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,680
You're always involved in such weird things.

436
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,920
You must have drawn these comics.

437
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,850
See if there's anything new.

438
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,050
Let's go.

439
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,910
Let's go to the Buddy Hotel first.

440
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,080
Hurry, let's go.

441
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,940
Lai! Stop there!

442
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Where are they?

443
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,220
What the hell is this place?

444
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,920
The Buddy Hotel that Mr. Can mentioned.

445
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,950
What?

446
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,750
Didn't he say it was newly opened?

447
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,300
It doesn't look like a new hotel at all.

448
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,130
[Tuesday, August 8th, 1946]

449
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,270
1946?

450
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,720
The newspaper from 20 years later? Are you kidding me?

451
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,740
Watch out, Lai!

452
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,580
This is 20 years later from your timeline!

453
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,620
You're the police who arrested me back then.

454
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,400
You made me serve in prison for 20 years.

455
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,430
I won't give you a chance to do that!

456
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,950
Lai!

457
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,150
Who on earth are you?

458
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,410
It was you.

459
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,050
You got me arrested.

460
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Why?

461
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,980
Why did you draw my story?

462
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,730
Didn't expect God to drop me here.

463
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,570
This is a miracle.

464
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,130
Let's end this.

465
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,250
Lu Na!

466
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,310
[Buddy Hotel]

467
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,270
Did you steal my gold watch?

468
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,760
No, I really didn't take it.

469
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,070
I've asked around.

470
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,200
You were the only one who entered my room today.

471
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,200
Give me the watch!

472
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,430
I didn't take your watch.

473
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,650
Still denying it?

474
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,860
Search him! Call the police!

475
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,250
Hold on, hold on...

476
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,060
Hello, sir.

477
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,680
I...

478
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,420
I'm Li Qi, his father.

479
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,970
What happened?

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,050
Your son stole my gold watch!

481
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,210
-What are you waiting for? Frisk him!
-Search him.

482
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,810
Hurry!

483
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,410
Don't touch him. Please don't.

484
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,440
What are you doing?

485
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,430
Our customer lost his watch.

486
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,270
Call the police.

487
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,240
Take off your clothes.

488
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,720
I didn't take his watch.

489
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,320
Take off your clothes.

490
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,890
I said, take off your clothes.

491
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,820
Go on.

492
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:15,920
Dad.

493
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,180
Take it off.

494
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,310
Go on.

495
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,070
Dad...

496
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,570
Go on.

497
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,350
And more.

498
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,350
Continue.

499
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,820
Enough... What's this all about?

500
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,320
Put on your clothes. Come on!

501
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,350
Put them on!

502
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,590
Mr. Wang.

503
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
My gold watch?

504
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,050
What happened?

505
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,630
I found it in your laundry today.

506
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,940
-Sorry, so it was just a misunderstanding.
-A misunderstanding...

507
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,970
-Just a misunderstanding.
-Yeah.

508
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,530
Just let it go.

509
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,600
Sir, looks like we've got everything sorted out now.

510
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,800
Don't you think you should apologize to my son?

511
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,000
Apologize?

512
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,800
Are you kidding me?

513
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,400
Listen!

514
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,680
Your son collected my clothes.

515
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,490
Although I got my watch back,

516
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,760
it should still be his fault.

517
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,370
You want me to apologize?

518
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,400
What?

519
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,590
Are you trying to blackmail me?

520
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,480
Forget it...

521
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,140
Let it go since the customer won't hold him accountable.

522
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,540
Get back to work.

523
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,550
Mr. Wang,

524
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,370
chill.

525
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,720
Better train your staff properly.

526
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,160
Okay, I got it...

527
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,270
Go back upstairs.

528
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,140
You're in charge of collecting

529
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,180
customers' laundry today, right?

530
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,760
Yes.

531
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,200
But I didn't take his watch.

532
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,480
You didn't?

533
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,480
I didn't.

534
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,469
No?

535
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,219
No?

536
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,150
No?

537
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,020
You didn't take it?

538
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,550
Did you covet his beautiful watch

539
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,520
and get greedy about it?

540
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,139
No.

541
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,520
Bing!

542
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
Did you take it or not?

543
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,120
No,

544
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,070
I didn't.

545
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,540
You'd better be telling the truth.

546
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,170
Dad didn't want to hit you either.

547
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,070
I just

548
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,740
don't want you to become a bad guy.

549
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,000
If you do,

550
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,480
people will look down on you.

551
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,960
You know?

552
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,880
Here.

553
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,550
Drink the milk and sleep.

554
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,320
It is quite bitter.

555
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,710
There's some tonic added to the milk.

556
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,360
It's good for your health.

557
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,360
Drink it.

558
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,480
All right.

559
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Time to sleep.

560
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,000
Who is it?

561
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,320
Who?

562
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,880
What do you want?

563
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,350
You...

564
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,360
What?

565
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,990
Why are you so nervous?

566
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,670
You thought it was your dad?

567
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,330
I'm Long.

568
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,320
Hey, temp.

569
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,510
With so much alkali,

570
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,150
it will only make it dirtier.

571
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,250
What should I do then?

572
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,810
It's just a sheet.

573
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,180
Just throw it away.

574
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,230
Come on,

575
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,600
there's too much laundry to do.

576
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,480
Just come here and chat with me.

577
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,000
Come on... Come on!

578
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,710
Your dad

579
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,320
is such a pervert.

580
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,700
How could he ask you to take off your clothes in public?

581
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,060
Do you know

582
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,370
the customer who lost the watch

583
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,210
left without even checking out?

584
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,800
Wonder if he was scared by your dad.

585
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,930
At this rate,

586
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,650
you won't last long.

587
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,910
What are you looking at?

588
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,710
I just think your necklace

589
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,160
looks so beautiful.

590
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,650
Like real gold, huh?

591
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,460
Here, have a smoke.

592
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,780
My dad doesn't allow me to smoke.

593
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,070
Then have a drink.

594
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,810
It's sweet. Come on!

595
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,050
Sweet.

596
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,180
It's really sweet.

597
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,420
The wine is sweet?

598
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,550
Of course! Just take it.

599
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,800
Give it a try.

600
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,500
Really?

601
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,580
How stupid you are!

602
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,970
How can wine be sweet?

603
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,540
No wonder you're so obedient.

604
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,280
It's said the milk in the kitchen keeps going missing lately.

605
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,610
Did your dad steal it?

606
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,350
What are you doing?

607
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,060
Dad.

608
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
Just kidding.

609
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,170
Stay away from him.

610
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,700
Keep your distance.

611
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,980
Who wants to get close to you?

612
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,990
Who cares about you guys?

613
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,340
Just a temporary worker!

614
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,840
Hired today, fired tomorrow.

615
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,940
Living in the attic, you're worse than a cockroach.

616
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,300
Mind your attitude!

617
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,190
Dad! Dad!

618
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,210
Don't hit me.

619
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,860
Do you know why I beat you up today?

620
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,500
Don't go astray,

621
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,230
don't make friends with the wrong people,

622
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,150
and don't let others look down on you.

623
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,290
Understand?

624
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,330
Do you understand?

625
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,920
Yes.

626
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,890
Here.

627
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,560
Drink the milk

628
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,760
and sleep tight.

629
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,780
[Back For You]
