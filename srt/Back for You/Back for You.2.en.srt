00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,470
My undercover mission is finally over.

3
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,040
Chief Inspector Zhang

4
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,080
has fulfilled Officer Huang's promise.

5
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,710
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)
has fulfilled Officer Huang's promise.

(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

7
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,510
and reinstated me as a police officer.

9
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,510
I can finally walk into the police station
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

10
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,640
with my head held up.
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

11
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,340
Are you supposed to be idling about?

12
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,760
Have you solved your cases yet?

13
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,370
Pull it together! Take action!

14
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,120
Jia,

16
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,850
look at this.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Hello,

18
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,050
you've reached the police station.

19
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,370
Okay.

20
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,090
Kiddo,

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,150
what did you do this time?

22
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,490
Don't you ever learn your lessons?

23
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,390
Allow me to introduce

24
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,690
a new officer to you.

25
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,460
This is...

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,329
Xu Lai.

27
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,160
He has just finished an undercover mission.

28
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,370
Give him a warm welcome.

29
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,820
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,210
Chief Inspector.

31
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,390
Lai,

32
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,040
come on.

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,020
Let me introduce

34
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,600
my right-hand man to you.

35
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,550
He is Jia.

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,770
If you really think about it,

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,680
you two are...

38
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,190
Alumni.

39
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,980
Yes.

40
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,250
You know each other?

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,570
In the future,

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,770
you gotta look out for each other.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,430
Chief Inspector,

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,840
there is a little misunderstanding

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,910
between us.

46
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,960
Lai,

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
at that time,

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,840
I really thought you fell into a bad way.

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,160
From now on,

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,980
whenever you need help,

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,840
I'll be there for you.

53
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,870
Thank you.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,670
Lai,

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,810
cops also need to follow the rules.

56
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,329
Make sure you will

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,510
change these little habits of yours.

58
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,430
Later on,

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,800
get a uniform from the General Affairs Department

60
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,829
and report to the Archives Department.

61
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,410
Okay.

62
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,630
The Archives Department?

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,230
Yes.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,550
Chief Inspector,

65
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,430
I don't want a desk job.

66
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,420
I'd like to work cases.

67
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,550
How about this?

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,520
I'll make you

69
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,800
the leader of

70
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,840
the archives group.

71
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,030
You can familiarize yourself with the surroundings there.

72
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,010
When a major case comes up in the bureau,

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
you'll be the first one I call on duty.

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,630
Alright.

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,410
Take a seat over there.

76
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,870
By the way, Lai,

77
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
someone asked me

78
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,240
to give something

79
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,380
to you.

80
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,180
What is this?

81
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,000
Open it.

82
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,870
(Honor)

83
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,160
Officer Huang
(Honor)

84
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,660
asked me to give this to you.

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
I left you a present

86
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,360
at the police station.

87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,430
Go get it when you solve the case.

88
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,650
(Honor)

89
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,720
Lai,

90
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,170
here are some files.

91
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,700
(File)

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,500
Robberies.

93
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,940
Missing persons cases.

94
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,280
(Hongren Hospital)

95
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,930
Doctor,

96
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,430
how is she?

97
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,790
When will she wake up?

98
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,000
The superficial injuries are recovering at a shocking speed,

99
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,590
but the symptoms of cerebral hemorrhage are obvious.

100
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,740
This situation is beyond our anticipation.

101
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,860
Besides, look,

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,710
the patient has been in a coma.

103
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,980
We are not sure when she will come to.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,490
Well,

105
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,630
is there a way

106
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,070
to wake her up sooner?

107
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,180
Theoretically, no.

108
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,230
However, I once met a patient

109
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,930
whose family kept talking

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,320
about their past by his bed.

111
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,000
The patient woke up very soon.

112
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,900
If her family is around,

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,130
you can give that method a try.

114
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,380
I don't know what happened to you,

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,560
but since you brought these comic books here,

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,930
I guess it would be helpful

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,430
if I read them to you.

Just as I expected,

136
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,570
I'm just an unimportant character.

137

No one will remember me.

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Miss,

139
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
did you read too much of my novel

140
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
that your mind got a bit disturbed?

141
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,490
Listen to me,

142
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,170
novels are...

143
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,270
Calm down.

144
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,630
Calm down.

145
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Weapons are dangerous.

146
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,850
Killing is illegal.

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,150
I am Lu Na from your book.

(... the groom fought...)

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
Lu Na and her groom fought their way out of the church.

151
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,340
As the groom was about to put a ring on Lu Na,

152
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,050
a survived killer scrambled up.

153
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,430
Lu Na shot him dead immediately.

154
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,440
Standing at the gate of the church,

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,960
the bride and groom were ready to finish their disrupted wedding.

156
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,230
Unexpectedly,

157
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,700

Unexpectedly,

158
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,520
(Unexpectedly...)

159
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:30,790
the groom pointed the dark barrel of a gun at Lu Na.
(Unexpectedly...)

160
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,970

161
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,870
(... the groom pointed the dark barrel of a gun at Lu Na...)
the groom pointed the dark barrel of a gun at Lu Na.

163

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,270
(Lu Na and her groom fought their way out of the church. As the groom was about to put a ring on Lu Na...)

166
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,400
Why did you have to mess with the novel?

167
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,960
I was finally getting a happy wedding,

168
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,550
but you had to make it a bloodbath.

169
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,120
You even wanted the groom to shoot me.

170
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,670
The groom's tender looks were replaced by cruelty.

171
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,410
He raised a gun

172
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,620
and pointed its dark barrel

173
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,870
at her.

174
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,210
What are you doing here in my house in the middle of the night?

175
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,560
You even tore my manuscript apart!

176
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,480
Rewrite it.

177
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,680
Write a happy wedding for me.

178
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,200
The publishing house sent you here, right?

179
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,860
You're here to rush me, right?

180
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,590
Three days.

181
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,290
I'll give you the manuscript in three days.

182
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,250
I'll return the advance payment!

183
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,880
Do you wanna die

184
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
or rewrite it?

185
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,350
The latter.

186
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,000
I know

187
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm just an unimportant role,

188
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,710
so I dare not ask for much.

189
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,000
I only need you to write

190
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,900
a happy wedding for me.

191
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,260
When I'm satisfied,

192
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,100
I'll leave.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Okay.

194
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,830
No problem.

195
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,360
No problem.

196
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,270
Miss,

197
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,640
you're really stressing me out. Why not

198
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,320
come and sit down?

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,640
Miss,

200
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,570
what kind of husband

201
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,340
would you like?

202
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,570
My ideal groom

203
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,810
is handsome

204
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,820
and dignified.

205
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,290
I have to be the only woman he loves.

206
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,700
Understood.

207
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,520
(... majestic church...)

208
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,080
Wait.

209
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,390
Didn't I just say handsome and dignified?

210
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,350
Got it. Got it.

211
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,080
Yeah. So happy.

212
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,880
She's lucky to marry a good guy.

213
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,250
From today on,

214
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,120
I'll give my daughter to you.

215
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,440
I hope you will take good care of her.

216
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,600
Dad,

217
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,900
don't worry.

218
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,640
I will take good care of her.

219
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,310
Good.

220
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,610
Bride,

221
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,030
will you marry this man?

222
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,030
Will you love him,

223
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,570
be faithful to him,

224
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,950
with or without wealth,

225
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,110
in sickness or in health,

226
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,120
till death do you apart?

227
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,090
Yes.

228
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,490
Bride and groom, please exchange rings.

229
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,380
Wait!

230
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,090
I object!

231
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,050
I should be the groom!

232
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,700
Nonsense!

233
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,000
This is my wedding.

234
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,920
Who are you?

235
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm the groom of this wedding.

236
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,790
I should be the groom!

237
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,640
Stop fighting!

238
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,610
Stop fighting!

239
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,320
Bullet,

240
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,790
what are you writing now?

241
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,240
Have you never thought about

242
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,960
how to properly write a novel?

243
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,840
Didn't you ask for a wedding like this?

244
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,620
What do you think you're writing now?

245
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,570
Two grooms are fighting for you. Aren't you satisfied?

246
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,120
I don't have a father.

247
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,300
Who is that "dad" in the wedding?

248
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,240
It doesn't matter.

249
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,600
I'll make it a "mom."

250
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm an orphan.

251
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,700
Sorry.

252
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,780
I'll change that.

253
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,870
I'll change that.

254
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,720
Have you forgotten

255
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,960
what you have written?

256
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,310
I'm a killer.

257
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,550
What should a killer's wedding be like?

258
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,080
A killer...

259
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,900
Then your wedding

260
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,000
should be like this.

261
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,490
Why isn't our daughter here yet?

262
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,400
Why isn't the bride here yet?

263
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,080
Give her one more moment.

264
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,380
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,590
A little accident

266
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,810
held me back.

267
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

268
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,020
I'm glad you're here.

269
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,200
Let's get started.

270
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,870
Okay.

271
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,470
Bride and groom, exchange rings.

272
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

273
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,110
Congratulations.

274
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,580
You can kiss each other now.

275
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,640
So soon?

276
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,690
Kiss each other now?

277
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,350
Wait!

278
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,060
I won't let you be happy!

279
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,670
You coward.

280
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,030
How dare you use me as a human shield?

281
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,080
Bullet,

282
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,780
what are you writing?

283
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,750
You've given me a cowardly husband

284
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,380
who uses me as a human shield.

285
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,550
Why did you raise your gun again?

286
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,010
Are you doing this on purpose?

287
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,480
Is it a prank?

288
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,069
Isn't this the wedding you asked for?

289
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
A killer deserves

290
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,109
a thrilling wedding.

291
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,790
What matters most for a wedding?

292
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,829
It's love.

293
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,329
You think a groom who puts me between him and bullets

294
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,550
would actually love me?

295
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,829
Let me put it this way.

296
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,079
This is my novel.

297
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,690
I can write it however I want.

298
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,940
Aren't I already miserable enough in the book?

299
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,270
Rewrite it.

300
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,320
Okay.

301
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll change it.

302
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,240
What are you writing?

303
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,460
Your death!

304
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,630
Give it to me!

305
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,200
Give it to me!

306
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,680
Give it to me!

307
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,920
Go away!

308
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,200
A-Are you okay?

309
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,080
Sorry. I didn't mean it.

310
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,560
I wrote that chapter

311
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,370
a long time ago.

312
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,750
You are not a main character.

313
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,550
I just let my thoughts run wild.

314
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,030
I can't recall much of the content.

315
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,520
Why don't you tell me about it?

316
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm an orphan.

317
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:47,750
Come on.

318
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,170
When I was seven,

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,730
my foster parents adopted me.

320
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,200
I thought

321
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
I could finally

322
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,640
live a happy life.

323
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,480
What I didn't expect was

324
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,810
that I just entered another hellish world.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,780
I was their tool for getting pension from the government.

326
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,750
When I grew up to be an adult,

327
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,960
they sold me to a brothel

328
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,330
so I could be their money maker again.

329
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,590
Everyone around me was terrible.

330
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,690
This was the life you gave me with your pen.

331
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,730
Just as I said,

332
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,540
you are not a main character.

333
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,030
I just wrote down

334
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,080
what popped up in my head.

335
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,380
You think what I went through was fake?

336
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,680
Then you just got way out of the line.

337
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,690
You wrote that I killed a john,

338
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,990
and became a target for a killers' organization.

339
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,910
They took me in,

340
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,440
trained me,

341
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,870
and turned me into Lu Na, the person I am now.

342
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,500
You see, nowadays, readers

343
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,700
enjoy reading

344
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,690
a story

345
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,080
that is full of ups and downs.

346
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,470
I wrote it that way

347
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,570
for better sales.

348
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,540
But it has never occurred to you

349
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,490
that I was going through all the pain.

350
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,960
How am I supposed to know

351
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,520
that someone would go through all that?

352
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,330
I experienced

353
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,090
each and every

354
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,060
unreasonable plot you wrote.

355
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,030
Do you know why

356
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,000
people don't like your novel?

357
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,300
Because you don't have a heart.

358
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,730
You don't have feelings.

359
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,060
That's why you can't make a good writer.

360
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,000
What kind of life do you want?

361
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,720
Tell me.

362
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,090
I'll write it.

363
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,710
But this thing...

364
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,730
Let's put it aside.

365
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,360
I'll get the pen.

366
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,920
Talk to me.

367
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
I'll start writing.

368
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,800
Is this comic book the same as the last one?

369
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,290
Will you marry me?

370
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,650
I object!

371
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,110
Who is he?

372
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,110
-This...
-Yeah.

373
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,560
-Who is he?
-Yeah.

374
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,350
Lu Na,

375
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,320
go with me.

376
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,750
Why am I trying to take you away?

377
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,770
You need to write what I say, right?

378
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,630
Ah?

379
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,920
Groom,

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,250
will you marry this woman?

381
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,920
Will you love and be faithful to her?

382
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,750
Yes.

383
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,110
Bride,

384
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,670
will you marry this man?

385
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,190
With or without wealth,

386
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,860
in sickness or in health,

387
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,420
will you be with him till death do you apart?

388
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,530
Yes.

389
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,460
Bride and groom, please exchange rings.

390
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,770
Congratulations.

391
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,270
You can kiss each other now.

392
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,280
Who is this?

393
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,990
See, several men are fighting for you again

394
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,570
all because of your vanity.

395
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,090
A whole group of people?

396
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,480
They're not here to fight for the bride.

397
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,040
They’re here for revenge.

398
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,380
Lu Na,

399
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,160
this is the day you die!

400
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,560
Killers!

401
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,280
What should we do?

402
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,790
So cool!

403
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,110
Watch out!

404
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
Are you okay?

405
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm fine.

406
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,550
I wrote this novel.

407
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,490
I'm gonna live.

408
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,490
Wait.

409
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,270
I have some personal vendetta to deal with.

410
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,570
Personal vendetta?

411
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,100
Who are they?

412
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,630
My foster parents.

413
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,010
You don't deserve to show up alive in my story.

414
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,680
No need to get your hands dirty.

415
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,920
Oh, our daughter...

416
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,700
(In the end, Lu Na's foster parents...)

417
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,760
It’s done.

418
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,220
In the end, Lu Na's foster parents

419
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,330
had heart attacks and fell dead.

420
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,900
Quite a creative story.

421
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,360
Sir, I'm taking this.

422
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,670
Sir, I'll take this.

Would you share with us

428
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,560
about writing this book?

429
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,620
Writing is actually very simple.

430
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,390
Every writer should believe

431
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,120
that their characters

432
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,900
are living souls.

433
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,150
Some people doubt

434
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,070
if the latest chapter

435
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,460
was written by you.

436
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,450
What do you think about it?

437
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,840
Who else could write it?

438
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,890
Congratulations.

439
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,590
You've finally earned recognition.

440
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,240
Congratulations to you too.

441
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,200
You're loved by more people now.

442
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,200
What do you want me to write now?

443
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,750
I want to live my life as an ordinary person.

444
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,830
An ordinary person?

445
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,440
Yes.

446
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,940
I already got you

447
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,610
out of the killers' organization

448
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,510
and made you the world's richest person

449
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,700
by inheriting a large sum of money.

450
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,510
Nothing could bother you.

451
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,330
Why do you want to be an ordinary person?

452
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,010
Haven't you promised

453
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,720
to write

454
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,750
whatever I tell you?

455
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,860
Yes.

456
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,170
Just write it.

457
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,750
Unexpectedly,

458
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,920
the life of an ordinary person that Lu Na said

459
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,170
was about being with me.

460
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,440
She stayed with me

461
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,060
and gave me so much inspiration.

462
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,330
Lu Na became a main character instead of a supporting one.

463
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,930
Readers loved her bizarre life.

464
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,570
Then,

465
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,790
they felt happy

466
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,050
(Local Daily)
they felt happy

467
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,110
(Local Daily)

468
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,830
for her having a peaceful new life.

474
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,360
I enjoyed all the honors that a best-selling author would have.

475
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,370
But later on,

476
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,550
people said my book was getting bland.

477
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,690
Then a new writer emerged

478
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,290
(Welcomed by all-- new writer Luo Jie comes to town for a book signing)

(Welcomed by all-- new writer Luo Jie comes to town for a book signing)

480
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,110
and completely stole my thunder.

482
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,680
I thought

483
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,240
it was time to put an end to all this.

484
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,550
So beautiful.

485
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,970
We

486
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,350
haven't written anything in a long time.

487
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,000
Do you

488
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,480
have any new ideas recently?

489
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,440
The readers are waiting.

490
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,940
Bullet,

491
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,330
I want to put a pause on this.

492
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,380
Why?

493
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,110
Are you not feeling well?

494
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,510
Or are you too tired recently?

495
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,460
I'm happy about the life I have now,

496
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,900
so I don't need you to write anything else.

497
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,890
Bullet,

498
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,060
I'm living my ideal life now.

499
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,330
I think it is time

500
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,900
to end the Biography of Lu Na.

501
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,720
You are the female lead.

502
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,750
You have to take adventures nonstop in the novel

503
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,990
so that the readers would enjoy it.

504
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,790
You think it's over just because you say so?

505
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,550
Will the readers accept it?

506
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,440
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,510
I don't know what got into me.

508
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,830
I was being rude.

509
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,570
You must be tired

510
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,750
or feeling under the weather.

511
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,580
It's okay.

512
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,850
Let's take a breather.

513
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,200
We'll get some rest.

514
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,920
Look,

515
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,850
I'm going out now

516
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,000
to buy you

517
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,470
tasty food and drinks.

518
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,110
Bullet,

519
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,220
do you love me?

520
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,920
From then on,

521
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,920
Lu Na left my life.

522
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,200
I lost my source of inspiration.

523
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,360
I thought

524
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,550
I could write the novel myself,

525
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,790
but all I created was a pile of waste paper.

526
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,940
The famous writer Bullet

527
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,670
starts using crude opium after entering a dry spell

528
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,010
and is disdained by all.

529
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,130
Did you write the Biography of Lu Na?

530
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,800
It’s not your creation at all.

531
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,840
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

532
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,100
What can a crude opium user create?

535

One late night,

536
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,160
Lu Na and Bullet

537
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,750
went to the empty church.

538
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:42,840
Come on.

539
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,020
I

540
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,430
am just a two-bit writer.

541
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,720
That's why I wrote so many

542
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,960
tragic experiences for you to go through.

543
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,150
I had no choice.

544
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,360
I just wrote

545
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,900
whatever the readers liked.

546
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,470
Only after you showed up

547
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,200
did I achieve success.

548
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,630
So, without you,

549
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,070
I couldn't write anything,

550
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,730
or become anyone.

551
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,510
Today, right at this place

552
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,730
where there are only the two of us,

553
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,270
I'd like to give you a real wedding.

554
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,800
Lu Na,

555
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
will you marry me?

556
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,880
I love you.

557
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,040
I want you to call me my original name,

558
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,590
Zhang Baobao.

559
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,230

560
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,880
Zhang Baobao...

561
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,360
It sounds so familiar.

562
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,449
How come there are so many unsolved cases?

563
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,380
Mu Xuefeng reported the case.

Mu Xuefeng reported the case.

566
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,520
Zhang Baobao is the missing person.

567
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,620
A missing person's case...

568
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:20,830
(Gender: Female)
A missing person's case...

569
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,750
(Gender: Female)

570
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,139
(Pen name: Bullet)

571
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,840
Bullet?

572
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,739
Bullet is relevant to the missing person's case?

573
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,830
Zhang Baobao,

574
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,050
will you marry me?

575
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,110
Yes.

576
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,570
Oh, right,

577
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,980
Lu Na...

578
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,110
Yes?

579
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,550
We’re family now.

580
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,500
We can keep writing the Biography of Lu Na.

581
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,510
The readers are waiting.

582
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,000
Just ten more chapters.

583
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,040
We'll end the book after ten more chapters.

584
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,760
Is it okay with you?

585
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,110
This is the reason

586
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,940
you proposed marriage to me today, right?

587
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,190
You do not want

588
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,370
Lu Na,

589
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,560
or Zhang Baobao.

590
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,620
All you want is the Biography of Lu Na.

591
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,280
Listen up,

592
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,240
this book

593
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,470
doesn't belong to you.

594
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,770
It’s mine.

595
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,150
Lu Na...

596
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,500
The book is mine,

597
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,030
and I can end your life in it when I want to.

598
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,210
It's okay.

599
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,630
It'll be fine.

600
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,130
It's all okay.

601
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,600
It's okay.

602
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,970
You want to become a human, don't you?

603
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,260
Humans feel pain.

604
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,440
Pain is what every human

605
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,460
goes through.

606
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,240
You'll be fine.

607
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,270
Bullet shot Zhang Baobao to death.

608
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,350
Zhang Baobao's miserable life was finally ended.

609
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,320
Is Zhang Baobao dead?

610
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,520
That means

611
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,850
this is not your story.

612
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,030
You just happen to have the same name.

613
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,630
Then the killer is...

614
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,810
If Bullet did kill Lu Na,

615
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,690
then where is the evidence?

616
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,390
Where is the body?

617
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,400
Where would he hide the body?

618
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:41,880

00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:42,810

620
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,630
(Church)

621
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,500
Church?

622
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,870
The book says all five of Lu Na's weddings took place in the church.

623
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,540
Hi. Put me through to Chief Inspector Zhang in the police station.

624
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,160
(Nurse Station)

625
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,440
Chief Inspector, this is Lai.

627
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,300
I found something suspicious about Zhang Baobao's missing.
(Nurse Station)

628
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,620
I found something suspicious about Zhang Baobao's missing.

629
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,890
Please tell the man who reported the case to come to the police station now.

630
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,150
Okay.

631
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,360
I'll have Jia do it right now.

632
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,190
Okay.

633
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,450
According to the previous connection between the comic book and reality,

634
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,280
the story must have something to do with the case.

635
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,080
In reality, Zhang Baobao went missing.

636
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,280
In the book,

637
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,020
Bullet killed Zhang Baobao somewhere near the church.

638
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,040
If my guess is correct,

639
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,490
the body is probably

640
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,010
hidden here.

641
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,030
You reported

642
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,460
that Zhang Baobao had gone missing.

643
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,200
We already found her.

644
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,880
Where?

645
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,010
This is Baobao.

646
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,490
It should be me asking you this question.

647
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,490
Who did it?

648
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,480
Why do you think you're here?

649
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,170
Do you think I killed her?

650
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,810
When was the last time you saw her?

651
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,120
On the 28th of last month.

652
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,400
She hurried me

653
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,530
to go out and pick a wedding dress with her.

654
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,360
I was writing

655
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,580
the last chapter

656
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,260
of my novel.

657
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,650
I wanted to go after I finished it.

658
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
Then she accused me of not loving her

659
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,880
and ran away.

660
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,770
Ran away?

661
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,720
You killed her, right?

662
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,030
She ran out and I went after her.

663
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,340
That was the last time I saw her.

664
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,810
If I killed her,

665
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,280
why would I report her missing to the police?

666
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,180
Sounds about right.

667
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,890
Also,

668
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,300
explain this to me.

669
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,460
It's mine.

670
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,480
How did it get to the victim's hands?

671
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,000
Baobao was my fiancee.

672
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,710
It's not strange for her

673
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,840
to hold something of mine in the hands.

674
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,960
This is a hand-shaped blood clot found on the victim's left arm.

675
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,070
Blood clots are different from post-mortem stains.

676
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,550
Blood clots are formed by after-death external pressure.

677
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,000
We presume

678
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,890
that someone dragged her

679
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,420
by holding her arm tight after she died,

680
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,750
so the clot was formed.

681
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,120
Look at this shape.

682
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,980
The third joint of the index finger left a deeper mark.

683
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,590
If someone with a ring

684
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,000
on his index finger, just like you,

685
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,370
drags a body,

686
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,240
a similar blood clot would be formed.

687
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,910
Officer,

688
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,900
this can't be evidence, can it?

689
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,150
Do you know

690
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,850
Zhang Baobao was pregnant?

691
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,410
Baobao was pregnant?

692
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,120
You didn't want the baby at all.

693
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,640
You were afraid of people's insults.

694
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
So you killed her.

695
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,000
You had no intention of marrying her.

696
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,790
Nonsense!

697
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,270
I didn't know she was pregnant.

698
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,090
You had a thirst for vanity.

699
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,960
You knew she was an escort.

700
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,100
You thought you were way out of her league.

701
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,310
So you never wanted her to bear your child.

702
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,200
When she told you she was pregnant,

703
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,360
you killed her.

704
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,440
I said I didn't know she was pregnant!

705
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,800
Even if I knew she was pregnant,

706
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
I would never kill her.

707
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,320
She just lost her balance!

708
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,830
Lost her balance?

709
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,540
I didn't tell you she fell dead.

710
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,270
Baobao was my source of inspiration.

711
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,960
Her life was filled with misery.

712
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,200
She was an orphan.

713
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,270
Those who raised her abused her.

714
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,960
Then she became a lady of the evening.

715
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,120
I took her in,

716
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,760
and we fell in love.

717
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,180
She said she wanted to try writing.

718
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,570
I thought that was her way to have fun,

719
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,370
so I encouraged her to write whatever she liked.

720
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,940
I didn’t expect her to come up with the Biography of Lu Na.

721
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,030
Neither did I realize

722
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,260
she was a wonderful writer.

723
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,130
By then,

724
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,070
I had not created

725
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,610
anything good for a long time.

726
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,790
So I suggested

727
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,870
we publish it under my name.

728
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,330
Mu Xuefeng,

729
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,180
why wouldn't you let people know about me?

730
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,880
That's not true.

731
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,460
Alright. Alright.

732
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,550
Okay. Fine.

733
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,030
Next time,

734
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,690
I'll ask them to put only your name on it.

735
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,760
You just won't do it, will you?

736
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,260
Fine.

737
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,550
I'll do it.

738
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,390
Let go!

739
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,620
Give it to me!

740
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,760
Let go!

741
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,480
I loved Baobao.

742
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:40,410
It's true

743
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,070
that I made a mistake.

744
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,070
I didn't send her to the hospital in time.

745
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,700
That was an accident.

746
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,030
I didn't kill her.

747
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,280
It wasn't an accident.

748
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,610
If it was an accident,

749
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,440
why did you hide her body in the church?

750
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,230
Suppose she fell,

751
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,760
you could've helped her.

752
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,580
But you didn't.

753
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,650
Do you know

754
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,700
the Biography of Lu Na?

755
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,420
That’s my best work.

756
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,950
I see it as my baby.

757
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,220
No one can take it away from me,

758
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,260
not even the love of my life.

759
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,150
No one.

760
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,010
You said you loved her,

761
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,610
but actually you only love yourself.

762
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,890
You both did a great job solving this case.

763
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,280
The suspect has confessed to the crime.

764
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,910
The credit goes to you two.

765
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,400
Keep up the good work, officers.

766
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,400
Get back to your work now.

767
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,090
(Hongren Hospital)

768
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,590
How do you know about Zhang Baobao's missing?

769
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,650
Are you connected to all these cases?

770
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,510
Why are these pages blank?

771
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,110
What am I thinking?

772
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,520
Comic books can't predict crimes, can they?

773
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,310
As I read through the cases you worked on,

774
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,010
I felt sorry for what happened to Zhang Baobao.

00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,450
Therefore, I changed my pen name to Lu Na.

779
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,570
I hope her name

780
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,580
will be known to all in a different way

781
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,420
so that her dream can go on.

783
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,010
Hello?

784
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,690
Hello, Miss Yang.

785
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,730
I'm an editor at New Star Publishing House.

786
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,000
We received your submission.

787
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,190
Our chief of the house read it and liked it,

788
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,360
considering it a novel and special story

789
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,710
with great potential.

790
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:54,780
We'd love to publish it.

791
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,660
That said, we still have some advice.

792
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,440
We know the content is

793
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,510
based on real cases,

794
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,170
but our chief of the house suggests

795
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,150
you add more whimsical factors in it

796
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,220
to make sure that the readers will love it.

797
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,480
Okay, I'll try.

798
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,520
