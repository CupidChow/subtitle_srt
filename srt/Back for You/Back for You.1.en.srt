00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,880
(Back For You)

2
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
Once upon a time,

3
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,789
there was a girl named Yang Manru.

4
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,350
One day,

5
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,180
when a monster attacked her,

6
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,190
a blurry shadow protected her.

7
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,020
Before she could thank him,

8
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,639
the shadow disappeared.

9
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,710
(Lai)

10
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,070
Since then,

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
she started looking for this shadow.

12
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,780
In her journey,

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,960
she has experienced countless moments of exhilaration,

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,910
sighing, and sweetness with the shadow.

15
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,240
These are all pieced together into the shadow in her heart.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
However,

17
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,780
she could never catch up with him

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,100
or see his face clearly.

19
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,480
If possible,

20
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,190
I wish I could see you again.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,079
(Lai)

22
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,380
In the Year of Bingyin,

23
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,700
Mid-Autumn,

24
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,290
Venus caught up with the moon

25
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,450
and the two aligned.

26
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,780
No one could've imagined

27
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,990
that on the night of the Moon-Venus Conjunction,

28
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,940
under the stars and moon

29
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,410
in this city,

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,720
a series of fascinating stories

31
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,690
has begun to unfold.

32
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,400
Let's split up.

33
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,620
It's a small place. Block all exits!

34
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,400
We must find Lai tonight

35
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,280
and avenge Boss Si!

36
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,020
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

37
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,170
(Lai)
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

38
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,690
(Lai)

39
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,470
Tonight's heavenly anomaly must mean

40
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,860
that something big will happen.

41
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,780
If you want to know what will happen next,

42
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,710
join me again next time!

43
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,010
Move!

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,540
Move!

45
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,829
Here you go!

46
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,380
A bowl of Yangchun Noodles!

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,560
Watch out!

48
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,410
(Lai)

49
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you okay?

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,060
I'm okay.

51
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,920
Thank you, sir.

52
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,990
Lai!

53
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,130
He's here!

54
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,530
Come here!

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,360
Get him!

56
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,870
Let's go!

57
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,770
Enjoy this slap!

58
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,409
You too!

59
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,730
Give it to me!

60
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,230
Want to catch me?

61
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,500
Try again in your next life.

62
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,500
I'll discipline you for your dad.

63
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,630
You've got some nerve!

64
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,530
You're trapped!

65
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,140
Keep looking!

66
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,810
Yes, sir!

67
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Sir.

68
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,300
May I borrow a light?

69
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,200
Sure.

70
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,410
He's here!

71
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,960
You got the wrong person.

72
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,510
Don't take my stuff.

73
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,330
Get out of my way!

74
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,120
Don't you run!

75
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,700
Is the flour yummy?

76
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,810
All misses, no hits!

77
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,190
Go to hell!

78
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,330
Over there!

79
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,890
Sir, let me borrow this.

80
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,180
This is for attacking me!

81
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,070
Goodbye!

82
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,140
Lai,

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,440
you killed Boss Si.

84
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,980
Do you think you can escape?

85
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,760
Fei.

86
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,680
I'm not fleeing.

87
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,150
I'm here to explain to you

88
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,830
that I didn't kill Jin Si.

89
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,850
It's a misunderstanding.

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,540
Who else could've done it?

91
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,870
Fei.

92
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,360
Don't you know who I am?

93
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,260
How could a coward like me

94
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,620
dare to kill Boss Si?

95
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,320
Fei.

96
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,120
We're buddies.

97
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't do this.

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,210
I really didn't kill Boss Si.

99
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,370
Don't move!

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,790
Who is your buddy?

101
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,260
Our men saw you do it.

102
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,220
They saw it wrong.

103
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,290
It really wasn't me.

104
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,760
If there's any misunderstanding,

105
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,550
go explain to Boss Si in the afterlife.

106
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,430
It really wasn't me.

107
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,170
Fei!

She was shot.

Why did she save me?

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,550
"Street Corner Stories"?

192
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,150
Why do the characters look so much like Jin Si and me?

193
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,320
It's really Jin Si from that afternoon.

194
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,340
The recent two batches

195
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,600
were both intercepted by Longhu Hall.

196
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,340
Is Long Qi

197
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,080
tired of living?

198
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,090
(Jin Si)
(Boss of Jinxin Company)

199
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,910
I plan to kill him.

200
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,160
You guys are the newest members of our Maritime Gang.

201
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,930
They don't know you.

202
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,320
Any one of you wants to volunteer to kill Long Qi?

203
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,810
You drew me?

204
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,040
How do you know Jinxin Company?

205
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,100
It's really me.

206
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,510
How...

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,550
How did you know that

208
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,150
I snapped

209
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,670
my divination stick three months ago?

210
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,320
Did one of the four of them tell you?

211
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,800
Was it you?

212
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,360
Could it be you?

213
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,970
Or you?

214
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,530
That's not it.

215
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,920
As usual,

216
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,260
whoever gets the highest number

217
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,030
will go!

218
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,070
(99)

219
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,570
Show me your sticks.

220
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,210
Mine's No. 5.

221
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,270
And you, Fa?

222
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,320
Mine's No. 16.

223
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,030
(Snap)

224
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,400
And you, Xiong?

225
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,390
Mine's No. 48.

226
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,590
What about you, Lai?

227
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,000
Boss, mine's

228
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,810
No. 19.

229
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,600
What?

230
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,660
Mine's No. 19.

231
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,460
Look, Boss Si.

232
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,310
(Divination Stick No. 19)

233
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,320
(Divination Stick No. 99)

234
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,250
I have...

235
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,820
I have family to look after.

236
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,940
I can't do this.

237
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,950
You have family to look after?

238
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,760
We'll take care of them.

239
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,250
Boss Si. Boss Si. Boss Si.

240
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,350
Is there

241
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,420
an alternative to killing?

242
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Can you give me another choice?

243
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,080
The alternative

244
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,780
is for you and Pei Yun to die here.

245
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,440
Otherwise,

246
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,770
take this

247
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,360
and take Long Qi's life for me.

248
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,140
Boss Si.

249
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:22,930
Boss Si.

250
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,080
I'll go.

251
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,060
I'll go.

252
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,540
I'll go, Boss Si.

253
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,010
(Mission: Kill Long Qi)
(Location: Mahjong Parlor)
(Time: 3:15 PM, tomorrow)

254
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,840
How did it go?

255
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,570
Tell me about it.

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,510
(Officer Huang)
(Port District police officer and Lai's mentor)

257
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,320
Tomorrow afternoon,

258
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,240
Long Qi will be playing mahjong in the parlor

259
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,050
opposite here.

260
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,470
He'll leave around 3:15.

261
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,600
(Long Qi)
(Boss of Longhu Hall)
He'll leave around 3:15.

262
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,990
(Long Qi)
(Boss of Longhu Hall)

263
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,040
How can I kill him in broad daylight?
(Long Qi)
(Boss of Longhu Hall)

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,050
How can I kill him in broad daylight?

265
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,960
This is obviously a suicide mission.

266
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,180
Officer Huang.

267
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,640
What should I do now?

268
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,850
Lai.

269
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,970
Don't panic.

270
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,070
I'll send someone to help you tomorrow

271
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,680
and get Long Qi to fake his death

272
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,570
so you can go back and report to Jin Si

273
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,020
and get through this.

274
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,760
Oh, right.

275
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,500
The password to contact your helper is

276
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,790
"box delivery."

(Mission: Wait for the "box delivery" person)
(Location: Mahjong Parlor)
(Time: 3:15 PM, tomorrow)

279
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,220
Box delivery?

280
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,450
Box—

281
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,430
Not him?

282
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,830
Box delivery?

283
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,250
Psycho.

284
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,630
Did I remember the password wrong?

285
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,400
Is this flower seller the one?

286
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,630
Box delivery?

287
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,170
Box delivery?

288
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,550
What box delivery?

289
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,040
My family is so poor that we're starving.

290
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,080
Why isn't

291
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
that person here yet?

292
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,110
Hey!

293
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,200
You!

294
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,560
Yo.

295
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,600
Lai.

296
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,200
Long time no see.

297
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,640
Jia.

298
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,360
Long time no see.

299
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,900
Hands on your head.

300
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,090
Stand up there.

301
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,030
We were classmates after all.

302
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,060
Must you do this?

303
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,490
What classmates?

304
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,900
I'm a cop.

305
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,120
You're a gangster.

306
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,760
I suspect you were involved

307
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,620
in the jewelry theft a few days ago.

308
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,850
Remove his clothes

309
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,790
and search him.

310
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,390
Come on.

311
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,960
Move.

312
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,790
Move!

313
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,090
Behave yourself.

314
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,530
Behave!

315
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,890
Check properly

316
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,290
and carefully.

317
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,990
What are you looking at?

318
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,920
What are you trying to see?

319
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,160
Stop staring!

320
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,030
They wouldn't search you if you weren't questionable!

321
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,010
Who is he to stop us from looking?

322
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,829
There's nothing to see here!

323
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,550
Lai.

324
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,730
You can leave now.

325
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,940
Don't let me catch you.

326
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,550
Why are my shoes dirty?

327
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,430
Clean them for me before you go.

328
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,230
Weren't you a big shot back then?

329
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,420
Don't you know?

330
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,100
He was the invincible top student

331
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,460
of our police academy.

332
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,720
Is that so?

333
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,350
Didn't you aspire to be a genius detective?

334
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,470
But now...

335
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,100
you've quit?

336
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,550
Are you done?

337
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,020
What are you doing?

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,550
What are you doing?

339
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,480
Clean your shoes?

340
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,580
Demonstrate it to me.

341
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,930
-Come on.
-Lai.

342
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,060
You'll go to jail for assaulting a cop, you know?

343
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,620
Jia.

344
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,550
I was being respectful.

345
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,310
How dare you push your luck?

346
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,580
Listen up.

347
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,830
I bullied you in the police academy,

348
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,150
and now, I'll still bully you.

349
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,390
What's wrong?

350
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,400
I'll put you in jail today.

351
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,110
Try me.

352
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,920
I have too much liver heat lately.

353
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,230
Get me some water chestnut and pear drink.

354
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,350
I don't have that.

355
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,850
How about some toilet water?

356
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,830
Arrest him.

357
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,150
Turn around!

358
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,790
Behave!

359
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,010
(Divination Stick No. 19)

360
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,490

(Divination Stick No. 19)

364
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,350
What are you laughing at?

365
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,240
Let's go.

366
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,990
Yesterday,

367
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,650
one of my informants told me that

368
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,480
Jinxin Company of the Maritime Gang is up to something big.

369
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,830
One of his underlings

370
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,790
drew an unlucky stick

371
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,720
and has to

372
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,690
kill Long Qi of Longhu Hall by himself.

373
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,480
To think

374
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,470
that person

375
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,400
is you.

376
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,570
I see.

377
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,960
You deliberately provoked me

378
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,470
to make me arrest you

379
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,650
so you can get out of this, huh?

380
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,570
Lai.

381
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,150
I witnessed people dying in gang fights.

382
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,670
There was one

383
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,050
who was shot all over that he looked like a sieve.

384
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,680
Another

385
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,720
had over 30 holes in his body from being stabbed.

386
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,080
Do you think I'd save such people?

387
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,800
A scumbag like you

388
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,690
only deserves to die on the street.

389
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,740
I wanted to earn some merit today,

390
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,940
but since it's him...

391
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,760
Let’s stay out of such trifles.

392
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,510
-Okay?
-Okay.

393
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,970
Ignore him.

394
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,970
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

395
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,650
Jia!

396
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,590
If you don't arrest me now,

397
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,970
you won't get another chance!

398
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,620
Hey!

399
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,780
The show's over. Let's go.

400
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,320
My gun.

401
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,010
(Mail Collection Time:
10:40 AM & 15:40 PM)

402
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,160
Lai.

403
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
(Pei Yun)

404
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,960
Pei Yun.

405
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,220
What are you doing here?

406
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,670
To deliver clothes

407
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,580
to customers.

408
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,600
You seem

409
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,880
to be in low spirits.

410
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,330
No, I'm not.

411
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
Many people from Longhu Hall

412
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
come and go here.

413
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,760
You have to be careful.

414
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,830
Pei Yun.

415
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,310
Have you ever thought of changing life paths?

416
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,380
How?

417
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,710
Leave Jin Si's tailor shop.

418
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,040
Why?

419
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,040
You work for him to repay debts day after day,

420
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,630
year after year,

421
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,040
without an end!

422
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,410
Pei Yun.

423
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,970
Since we joined the Maritime Gang,

424
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,730
we've been taking care of each other.

425
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,510
You're like a sister.

426
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,270
I care about you.

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,730
Let's leave Jin Si.

428
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,760
Lai.

429
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,280
I have to go.

430
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,370
Why are you saying such weird stuff

431
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,790
all of a sudden?

432
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,920
Stay alert and be safe.

433
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,650
Pei Yun.

434
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,160
Jin Si isn't a good person.

435
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,590
It's really dangerous to be with him.

436
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,450
Come with me.

437
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,480
We grew up together.

438
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,790
Anywhere's better than here.

439
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,030
Actually, I'm not a gangster.

440
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,760
I am...

441
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:23,750
Let her go!

442
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,630
What are you doing?

443
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,110
-What are you doing?
-Let go of me!

444
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,880
What are you doing?

445
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,900
-Pei Yun!
-Let go of me!

446
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,550
Pei Yun!

447
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,260
-Boss Si.
-Let go of me!

448
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,790
Boss Si!

449
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,270
What are you doing?

450
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,310
Boss Si. Boss Si.

451
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,630
Pei Yun knows nothing.

452
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,400
Don't touch me!

453
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,080
Is there a misunderstanding?

454
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,450
I just

455
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,140
don't want you to be distracted.

456
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,270
I'll take care of her for you.

457
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,690
You'll get her back after you finish your job.

458
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,990
No, Boss Si. Boss Si!

459
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,390
Drive.

460
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,450
Boss Si! Pei Yun.

461
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,750
-Pei Yun! Boss Si! Pei Yun!
-Lai! Lai!

462
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,680
Boss Si!

463
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,310
Lai!

464
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,080
Pei Yun!

465
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,510
Hello?

466
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,710
Who'd you like to speak to?

467
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,390
I'd like to speak to Officer Huang.

468
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,260
Hold on.

469
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,240
Sir, you said you were looking for...

470
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,790
I'd like to speak to Officer Huang.

471
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,080
I'm looking for Officer Huang!

472
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,030
We just received news that

473
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,200
he was in a car accident

474
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
and died of excessive bleeding.

475
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,440
Since you know this number,

476
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
you must work for him.

477
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,550
If it's urgent,

478
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,880
I can connect you to Chief Inspector Zhang.

479
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,110
Hello?

480
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,420
Can you hear me?

481
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,290
Hello?

482
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,680
From now on,

483
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,530
you'll be my undercover spy.

484
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,800
Infiltrate Jinxin Company

485
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,440
and investigate

486
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,210
their smuggling of crude opium.

487
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,990
Why me?

488
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,470
You know this life

489
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,090
better than others.

490
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,940
Because you used to work at the dock.

491
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,270
When

492
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,710
can I come back?

493
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,630
Once you get the evidence of their crimes,

494
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,570
I promise

495
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,100
you'll return to your post in the police station

496
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,860
and all your ID documents

497
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,850
will be restored.

498
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,750
No one from the station

499
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,660
knows about this except me.

500
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm a cop. How can I kill someone?

501
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,960
I just want to go back to the station.

502
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,350
I want...

503
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,510
I want to be a cop.

504
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,820
You're so impatient!

505
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,770
Let me finish.

506
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,990
If this plan succeeds,

507
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,600
your identity will be restored.

508
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,480
I can't be wrong about you.

509
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,110
You will be a good cop.

510
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,880
Don't patronize me.

511
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,830
I'll give you a small gift first.

512
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,610
I left the other gift

513
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,510
at the police station.

514
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,370
Go get it when you've succeeded.

515
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Your car light is out.

516
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,270
Remember to fix it.

517
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,960
Bulletproof vest?

518
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,460
That old man still cares about my survival.

519
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,360
Who are you?

520
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,070
Huh?

I wasn't this brave that day.

527
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,240
Actually, that day

528
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,130
went like this.

529
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,940
All of you, freeze!

530
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,060
I only want Long...

531
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,770
Qi.

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,240
Wait a minute.

536
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,650
Let me first deal with these treacherous bastards.

537
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,500
He.

538
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,160
What were you saying?

539
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,830
You can't keep up with the times!

540
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,900
We need a new boss,

541
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,620
right?

542
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,480
Yes!

543
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,140
Young fellow,

544
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,360
do you think he is

545
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,470
up to it?

546
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,140
It's an internal dispute.

547
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,870
I'll stay out of it.

I have a gun!

551
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,620
I'll shoot you! Try me!

552
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,870
A gun?

553
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,080
Slash him!

A bunch of you versus one man?

558
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Not cool!

559
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,280
Let go!

560
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,150
Wang, going to work?

561
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,710
Let's go.

562
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,010
Let's go!

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,290
Stop!

569
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,170
Stop!

570
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,960
Let's hide here!

571
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,950
Stop!

572
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,430
Where are they?

573
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,560
I think they went straight!

574
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,550
Go! Go that way!

575
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,270
Stop!

576
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,290
Stop!

577
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,690
Luckily,

578
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,600
those losers are still as dumb.

579
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,680
Thanks for earlier.

580
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,510
Are you under Jin Si?

581
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,110
You're smart.

582
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,570
I'll treat you well if you follow me.

583
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,830
I didn't mean to save you.

584
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,150
You didn't?

585
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,520
Do me a favor.

586
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,190
I have to save my sister.

587
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,190
She's innocent.

588
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,520
I have no choice.

589
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,780
If you don't agree...

590
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,710
I'm sorry.

591
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,830
If you were going to kill me,

592
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,130
you wouldn't have saved me.

593
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,550
You know the three-move takedown taught in the police academy.

594
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,960
If I'm not mistaken,

595
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,990
just like me,

596
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
you're a spy planted by Officer Huang,

597
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,520
right?

598
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,240
Another one as unlucky as me.

599
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,590
I have to save my sister.

600
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,140
You have to help me complete this plan.

601
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,560
What is it?

602
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,910
Tell Boss Si

603
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,470
I've brought Long Qi back.

604
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,250
Give the body to me.

605
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,480
Boss Si is busy.

606
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,980
I want to see him personally.

607
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,760
Leave.

608
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,720
Cut the crap!

609
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,650
Boss Si.

610
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,400
Boss Si, this is inappropriate.

611
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,050
Pei Yun!

612
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,630
Are you crazy?

613
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,720
Pei Yun, I'm here to save you.

614
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,260
You actually came back alive.

615
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,790
Pei Yun.

616
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,980
Come here.

617
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,050
Lai.

618
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,400
Your sister is blessed

619
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,510
to have me dote on her.

620
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,120
She chose to follow me.

621
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,050
Pei Yun.

622
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,480
Is that true?

623
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,020
I told you.

624
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:55,880
Lai.

625
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,510
Don't bother about me.

626
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,920
Gosh.

627
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,490
I didn't expect you to be so lucky.

628
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,630
You shouldn't have come back alive.

629
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,730
-Do I have to do it myself?
-Don't...

630
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,630
I'm exchanging your life for Long Qi's turf.

631
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,330
This way, your life

632
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,740
will be of value.

633
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,860
Be content with this fate.

634
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,870
I almost became deaf!

635
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,260
We're even now.

636
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,070
Boss Si!

637
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,030
Boss Si!

638
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,850
Let's go!

639
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,590
What?

640
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,390
Louder!

641
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,550
Let's go!

642
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,090
What?

643
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,170
It's time to go!

644
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
-Boss Si.
-Boss Si.

645
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,270
Boss Si!

646
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,420
Boss Si is dead!

647
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,300
Boss Si.

648
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,880
It was Lai.

649
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,450
Lai did it!

650
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,320
After him!

651
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,460
-Let’s go!
-Let’s go!

652
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,040
Let's go!

653
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,550
What are your plans?

654
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,610
Return to the police station.

655
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,590
What about you?

656
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,150
I'm going back to Longhu Hall

657
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,050
to get rid of He first

658
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,950
and continue to be the boss of the gang.

659
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,550
Why?

660
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,070
It wasn't easy to get you out,

661
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,050
yet you want to go back?

662
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,610
I've been a gang leader for so many years.

663
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,730
I don't know what else I can do now.

664
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,020
Besides,

665
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,870
Officer Huang is dead.

666
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,340
No one can prove my identity.

667
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,590
Wait.

668
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,280
When Officer Huang died in a car accident,

669
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,300
you were in the mahjong parlor.

670
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,600
How do you know he's dead?

671
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,430
Were you involved in Huang's death?

672
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,640
You're not that stupid.

673
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,890
I didn't want to do it so early.

674
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,230
Why did you do that?

675
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,950
Why did you do that?

676
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,170
Do you think the police station is clean?

677
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,450
It's better to be a gang boss.

678
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,240
He told me

679
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,580
that after this,

680
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll have to quit

681
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,230
and live a normal life.

682
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,630
I'm Long Qi.

683
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,690
Long Qi is me.

684
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,330
I've been a gang leader for eight years.

685
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,790
I'm no longer a mere cop.

686
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,730
I can never go back.

687
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,940
Have you forgotten that you're a cop?

688
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,180
Why did you kill him?

689
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,700
You have other choices!

690
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,900
Choices?

691
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,870
You,

692
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,920
me,

693
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,650
Jin Si,

694
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,400
and Officer Huang;

695
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,980
what choices do we have?

696
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,420
Does anyone care about us?

697
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,300
Now,

698
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,600
Officer Huang is dead.

699
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,470
No one can prove your identity.

700
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,260
Jin Si is dead too.

701
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,440
His turf is mine now.

702
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,350
I can share some with you.

703
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,840
You don't have to be a petty gangster anymore.

704
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,580
What do you think, Lai?

705
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,990
Let's work together.

706
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,830
I have a choice.

707
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,690
I choose to be a cop.

708
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,520
Bulletproof vest?

709
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,230
Huang really cared about you.

710
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:30,630
All that talk about having no choice?

711
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,770
(Pow)
All that talk about having no choice?

712
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,790
All that talk about having no choice?

713
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:31,990
(Pow)
All that talk about having no choice?

714
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,540
All that talk about having no choice?

715
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,040
(Pow)

716
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,360
It's all an excuse for your greed!

717
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,580
(Pow)
It's all an excuse for your greed!

718
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,230
It's all an excuse for your greed!

719
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,220
This gun only had one bullet.

720
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,920
I'll bring you back to the police station.

721
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,900
I will bring you

722
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,480
to justice.

723
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,080
This is for Officer Huang!

724
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,550
Who told you to kill him?

725
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,100
I don't want to kill you.

726
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,480
I'll turn you in to the police station

727
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,900
at the right time.

728
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,199
You have no remorse.

729
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,540
I can only take things into my own hands and enforce justice.

730
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,850
I'm a cop.

731
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,030
I only make arrests.

732
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,850
I never kill.

733
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,770
What are they doing?

734
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,640
Murder! Murder!

735
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,140
Hey! Don't drop it!

736
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,890
Long Qi.

737
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,900
Man proposes, but fate disposes.

738
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,200
(Divination Stick No. 19)

739
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,530
Who are you?

740
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,640
How do you know I'm an undercover spy?
