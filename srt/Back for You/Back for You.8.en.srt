00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,420
Today, we'll have

197
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,730
Mr. Luo send us home.

198
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,400
Then...

199
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,310
What about Rou?

200
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,190
Look how drunk she is.

201
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,690
She'll stay at my place.

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,370
Let's go.

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,220
Slowly.

204
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,880
Slow down.

205
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,550
Careful.

206
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,830
Watch the steps.

207
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,210
Slow down.

208
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,820
I can walk myself.

209
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Miss Rou.

210
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,440
What are you talking about?

211
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,300
I must make sure you're home safe.

212
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,650
Be careful.

213
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,250
Miss Rou, you're quite cute

214
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,240
when you're drunk.

215
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,690
Here. Come on.

216
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,940
Lie down.

217
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,780
Lie down.

218
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,870
Lie down and you'll be fine.

219
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,230
Miss—

220
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,890
Miss Meng!

221
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,120
Miss Meng!

222
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,190
Miss Meng!

223
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,620
Miss Meng!

224
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,480
Miss Meng!

225
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,830
Miss Meng!

226
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,370
Miss Meng!

227
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,320
Miss Meng!

228
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Miss Meng!

229
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,430
Miss Meng!

230
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,700
Miss Meng!

231
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,320
Miss Rou.

232
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Miss Meng!

233
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,790
Save me!

234
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,500
Miss Meng!

235
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,140
Save me, Miss Meng!

236
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,490
Miss Meng!

237
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,150
Miss Meng.

238
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,360
Miss Meng!

239
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,390
Miss Meng.

240
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,050
What's wrong?

241
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,820
N-Nothing.

242
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,290
I just came to see...

243
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,750
see if you got home safely.

244
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,060
Aren't I here?

245
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,780
Then...

246
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,560
Then what about Rou?

247
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,620
She's drunk and fell asleep long ago.

248
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,840
How about...

249
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,320
It's late. Go back and rest.

250
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,040
Can I trust a chauffeur who doesn't get sleep?

251
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,280
Rou!

252
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,880
What happened?

253
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,520
Sit down.

254
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,490
Come on.

255
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,810
I'll get you some water.

256
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,600
Mr. Luo...

257
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,830
Alright, alright.

258
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,320
What happened?

259
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,350
Hush, it's okay now.

260
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,880
Miss Meng.

261
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,230
Why didn't you save me just now?

262
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,270
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,220
I was too tired.

264
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,710
I fell asleep on the sofa.

265
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,890
But how'd this happen?

266
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,390
Mr. Luo is a gentleman.

267
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,240
He wouldn't do this to you.

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,960
But just now...

269
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,140
I tried my best to resist,

270
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,850
and I also shouted for help.

271
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,570
Why didn't you save me?

272
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,470
I'm so, so sorry!

273
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,920
Listen to me, Rou.

274
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,260
Now that it has happened,

275
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,100
we'll find a way to solve it.

276
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,030
You know what?

277
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,080
Reputation is everything

278
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,360
to women.

279
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,150
Let's keep this a secret.

280
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,790
Don't you need money?

281
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,390
I'll ask Mr. Luo

282
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,820
to give you a lot of money

283
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,270
for your dad's bottomless debt,

284
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,780
okay?

285
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,550
It's okay now.

286
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,070
It's okay now.

287
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,360
How about

288
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,650
I talk to Miss Meng?

289
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,270
Or we can report to the police directly.

290
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,830
We can't just let that jerk go like that!

291
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,750
If I report it to the police...

292
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,100
my reputation will be tarnished forever,

293
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,360
right?

294
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,240
Rou.

295
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,850
How about...

296
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,670
we quit working with her?

297
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,330
If I quit...

298
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,780
what should I use to fill the bottomless pit

299
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,310
of my dad's debt?

300
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,160
How much money does your father owe?

301
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,810
Let's find another way together!

302
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,380
Weilun.

303
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,310
Why can't we

304
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,640
choose our background?

305
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,060
If

306
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,300
I were

307
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,869
born into a good family like Miss Meng,

308
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,470
what would it've been like?

309
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,640
What place are we going for the filming today?

310
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,830
Such a long drive.

311
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,850
Baili Gorge.

312
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,140
Half an hour more to go.

313
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,450
This is a gift from Mr. Luo.

314
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,470
It's very valuable.

315
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,580
He said

316
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,560
that as long as you serve him well,

317
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,200
you can have whatever you want.

318
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,740
Put it on.

319
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,710
Miss Meng, I don't think I want it.

320
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,380
I can't accept it.

321
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,450
Why?

322
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,840
Do you think it's not good enough?

323
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,140
Are you still mad at me

324
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,310
for not saving you last night?

325
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,460
Here, put it on.

326
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,780
It'll look good.

327
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,160
Miss Meng, I quit!

328
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,550
I'm reporting it to the police!

329
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,070
Go ahead then.

330
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,020
If you dare report it,

331
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,140
I'll send you to Zuihong Brothel

332
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,450
to be a prostitute for life.

333
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,880
Weilun.

334
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,550
Weilun.

335
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,560
Weilun!

336
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,420
Weilun!

337
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,370
Weilun.

338
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,720
Weilun!

339
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,190
Get off.

340
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,900
Get off first.

341
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,590
Wake up.

342
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,960
Rou.

343
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,820
Rou.

344
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,510
Rou.

345
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,810
Save me.

346
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,890
Miss Meng.

347
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,350
Miss Meng.

348
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,560
Let me help you.

349
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,540
Miss Meng.

350
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,380
Miss Meng.

351
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,710
Save me.

352
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,640
Save me.

353
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,590
What should I do?

354
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll pull it out for you.

355
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,750
Don't move, Miss Meng.

356
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,020
Save me.

357
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,530
Cover it.

358
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,350
Save me.

359
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,460
Hang in there, Miss Meng.

360
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,210
I'll check on Weilun.

361
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't go.

362
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,080
You can't go. Take me away now.

363
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,180
Take me away now.

364
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,480
I'll check on Weilun first.

365
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,890
Why do you care about that worthless man?

366
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
You impostor.

367
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,360
Do whatever I say.

368
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,870
If you don't listen,

369
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,050
I'll sell you around

370
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,050
until you die,

371
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,520
you rotten hussy.

372
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,100
If you dare report it,

373
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,940
I'll send you to Zuihong Brothel...

374
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,710
You're a rotten piece of trash now.

375
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,010
Without a face that looks like me,

376
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,100
how much could you be worth a night?

377
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,400
You hussy!

378
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,460
Come back!

379
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,040
Miss Meng.

380
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,420
Miss Meng.

381
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,700
So,

382
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,380
the real Liu Meng is already dead.

383
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,770
The person the police saw in Liu Meng's house

384
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,590
was actually Rou.

385
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,930
You rotten piece of trash.

386
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,210
How dare you try to kill me?

387
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,140
Miss Meng!

388
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,980

582
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,040
Just... Just with these silhouette photos?

583
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,290
What can you prove?

584
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,880
It doesn't matter.

585
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,910
I'm not interested

586
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,860
in this news anymore.

587
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,440
Because I found something more interesting.

588
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,010
Liu Meng doesn't have a mole on her neck.

589
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,330
The one with the mole is Rou.

590
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,000
I always have had this mole.

591
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,290
Go on.

592
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,110
Keep lying.

593
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,590
How about I compare

594
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,360
your past and current movies for everyone?

595
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,240
Let's find the mole.

596
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,020
It's said that

597
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,910
Rou is missing.

598
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,090
In my opinion,

599
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,580
Liu Meng is the one who went missing,

600
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,960
right?

601
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,230
What are you talking about?

602
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,790
It's okay.

603
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,040
You don't have to admit it.

604
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,890
I'll report to the police tomorrow.

605
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,800
You just have to explain

606
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,990
where Liu Meng is

607
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,150
to the police,

608
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,100
to the press,

609
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,880
and especially to the investors

610
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,160
of Liu Meng's works.

611
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,590
Let's see how that turns out for you.

612
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,900
What's the matter?

613
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,040
What do you want?

614
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,440
Are you...

615
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,570
begging me?

616
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,880
5,000 silver dollars,

617
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,720
and I promise

618
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,440
I'll wipe my memory clean.

619
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,030
Hello?

620
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,800
Meng.

621
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,090
I'm running out of money.

622
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,240
Can you give me another 10,000 silver dollars?

623
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,690
Didn't I just give you money?

624
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,380
I got

625
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,070
into a car accident.

626
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,170
I want to buy a new one.

627
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,750
How about you give me 30,000 silver dollars at once?

628
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
What do you think?

629
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,010
I promise—

630
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,160
You want money, yeah?

631
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,770
See you at the usual place.

632
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,250
Where's the money?

633
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,560
It's here.

634
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,850
Take it yourself.

635
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,960
For every glass you drink,

636
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,020
I'll take off a piece of clothing.

637
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,770
The second glass.

638
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,430
What's wrong?

639
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,670
I knew what you were up to

640
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,000
the moment you were at the door.

641
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,670
Spiking the wine, huh?

642
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,510
You think I was born yesterday?

643
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,130
Bastard!

644
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,170
Are you okay?

645
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:38,840
Weilun.

646
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,850
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

647
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,690
On the day of the accident,

648
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,020
I saw everything

649
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,840
before I passed out.

650
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,560
How much money do you want?

651
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,030
I want nothing.

652
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,510
Really.

653
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,920
I just want to be by your side

654
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,570
to protect you.

655
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,520
Trust me.

656
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,810
If you don't trust me,

657
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,220
I'll prove it to you.

658
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,470
Rou.

659
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,830
Will you be with me?

660
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,240
Tell me.

661
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,970
When did you start

662
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,180
impersonating her?

663
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,530
Don't they say everyone is equal?

664
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,770
But how can we be equal?

665
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,150
I was born in a poor family.

666
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,990
When I was 13, my biological father...

667
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,060
sent me to a brothel.

668
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,390
And her?

669
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,320
She comes from a better background than me.

670
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,950
I'm better than her in everything,

671
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,480
yet she enjoys more success

672
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,420
and has power over me.

673
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,920
What did you do to her?

674
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,440
Nothing much.

675
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,930
I was handed an unfair fate.

676
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,140
It's just tit for tat.

677
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,840
So you killed her?

678
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,640
I saved her.

679
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,020
I didn't kill her.

680
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,100
But she...

681
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,290
insulted me,

682
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,380
threatened me,

683
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,790
and scolded me.

684
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,670
She said I was a prostitute.

685
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,570
She even said she wanted to sell me.

686
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,460
She forced me!

687
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,080
I couldn't stand it anymore.

688
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,020
What should I've done then?

689
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:48,780
There was a stone,

690
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,190
so I used it to smash her!

691
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,880
I smashed

692
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,480
and smashed

693
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,230
and smashed!

694
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,760
Die!

695
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,470
Everyone's innately kind at birth...

696
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,290
Am I right?

697
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,480
Cut!

698
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,760
Good take!

699
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,050
Perfect!

700
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,360
Miss Liu Meng is amazing.

701
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,260
This take

702
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,390
is the perfect ending

703
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,050
to the movie!

704
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,720
Miss Meng.

705
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:45,610
Miss Meng!

706
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,250
Just for this scene,

707
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,580
this movie must be a hit!

708
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,280
Miss Meng.

709
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,660
Miss Meng.

710
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,120
Great job.

711
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,020
You haven't removed your makeup.

712
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,210
Miss Meng isn't feeling well.

713
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,580
She won't be attending the wrap party.

714
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,630
Thank you, everyone.

715
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,270
You did great.

716
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,610
Great job, Miss Meng!

717
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,480
I know you're not Liu Meng.

718
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,230
I saw everything.

719
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,480
There's no mole on Liu Meng's neck.

720
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,880
How about I compare

721
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,450
your past and current movies for everyone?

722
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,350
Cut it.

723
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,220
Why aren't you doing it?

724
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,150
Do you think you can become me if you cut it?

725
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,580
I didn't kill you.

726
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,650
I didn't kill you.

727
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,020
You killed yourself.

728
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,170
You forced me to do it.

729
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,110
Aren't you curious

730
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,270
why I'm still alive?

731
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:05,930
Miss Meng.

732
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,260
Looks like you're really good at acting.

733
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,320
No wonder no one noticed you're fake.

734
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,110
Thank you for winning so many awards for me.

735
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,040
Those are mine.

736
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,510
Those are mine!

737
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,270
Those are mine.

738
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,230
Yours?

739
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,930
Why don't you take a good look?

740
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,780
Liu Meng's written on them.

741
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,380
Give them back.

742
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,860
Time to wake up.

743
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,640
Do you really think having a stolen crown

744
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,490
makes you a queen?

745
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,110
Do you know

746
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,800
why I didn't expose you?

747
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,390
Because I wanted to use you

748
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,950
to get my name out there as an actor.

749
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,770
You don't deserve it!

750
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:57,890
Why?

751
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,190
All you can do

752
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,220
is cater to those rich men with your looks.

753
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,490
Yes, I have nothing but my looks.

754
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,850
And you are an impostor.

755
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,110
If you didn't look

756
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,550
exactly like me,

757
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,670
how'd you have gotten the chance to experience

758
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,100
being a star in the limelight in the vast Shanglan?

759
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,950
If it weren't for me

760
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,730
redeeming you,

761
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,830
you'd still be selling your body as a prostitute.

762
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,530
You're not Liu Meng.

763
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,940
I am Liu Meng.

764
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,400
Stop calling my name.

765
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,110
I am Liu Meng.

766
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,820
You thief!

767
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,200
Miss Meng.

768
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,540
Miss Meng!

769
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,000
Rou!

770
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,630
Rou.

771
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,970
