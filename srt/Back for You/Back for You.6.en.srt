00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,530
Feng, are you okay?

196
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,960
Come here!

197
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,630
Come sit with me.

198
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,130
Come have a drink with me!

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,520
You're really mistaken.

200
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,790
She's not a waiter. You're mistaken.

201
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,380
Sorry.

202
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,750
I'm mistaken?

203
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,670
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

204
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,150
Yeah?

205
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,080
Yes.

206
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,050
Damn it!

207
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,980
Feng!

208
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,760
Why did you hit him?

209
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,020
Are you okay? I'll help you up.

210
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,700
Listen.

211
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,040
I'm not weak either.

212
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,130
How dare you point your finger at me?

213
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,710
Don't hit him!

214
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,380
Feng!

215
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,730
Mind your own business!

216
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,650
-Busybody!
-Don’t hit him!

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,420
Move!

218
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,140
I won't let you bully my wife.

219
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,880
Trying to be the hero, huh?

220
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,910
She's the person I want to protect the most in my life!

221
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,660
You're playing dirty, you sissy!

222
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,680
Damn it!

223
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,270
Feng!

224
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,000
Feng!

225
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,390
Feng, are you okay?

226
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,290
Feng!

227
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,560
Call the doctor!

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,000
Nirvanic rebirth isn't easy.

229
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,330
If you can start over,

230
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,790
will you change?

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,860
If you can start over,

232
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,340
will you change?

233
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,080
Where am I?

234
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,480
Isn't this the day I missed my exam

235
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,350
when I was 17 years old?

236
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,050
My art school exam

237
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,930
is at 2 PM today.

238
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,360
I mustn't miss it this time.

239
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,470
Do things go exactly as before?

240
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,700
The dog is squashed.

241
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,150
Why didn't they put their dog on leash?

242
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,930
Stop looking. We're going to be late for the exam. Let's go.

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,080
I can't make it in time if I try to save it.

244
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,000
What should I do?

245
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,650
Should I save this dog?

246
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,080
I can't just let it die.

247
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,310
What a good man.

248
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,360
You're okay now.

249
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,960
Am I not dead?

250
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,910
I...

251
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,510
Why am I back?

252
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,750
You drank too much.

253
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
You fell asleep.

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,630
What did you dream about?

255
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,200
No.

256
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,120
I didn't fall asleep.

257
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm sure that wasn't a dream.

258
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,990
I went back to when I was 17.

259
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,650
I was about to take the art school exam that day.

260
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,400
I ran into an injured puppy on the way.

261
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,390
I saved it.

262
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,200
I was just holding it!

263
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,660
So did you take the exam?

264
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,960
I didn't make it in time.

265
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,490
Just like before.

266
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,720
You knew this would happen,

267
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,010
yet you still saved it.

268
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,800
It would've died if I didn't save it.

269
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,770
You saved it,

270
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,370
but it might not live long anyway.

271
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,860
But because you missed the exam,

272
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,010
your whole life is affected.

273
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,980
Every choice of yours decides your future.

274
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,230
Maybe

275
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,870
if you didn't save that dog,

276
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,600
you wouldn't have encountered what came next

277
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,870
or got into the fight just now.

278
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
You wouldn't have been injured.

279
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,680
You'd be able to

280
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
get married

281
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,260
with Qiao

282
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,400
and live a happy life.

283
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,180
The wine I just had...

284
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,860
I'll have one more glass.

285
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,000
♫Where we part♫

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,270
♫Old roads lie♫

287
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,530
Why are you here?

288
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,280
Right, why am I here?

289
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,790
This is your dream,

290
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,080
so, of course, you brought me in.

291
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,000
♫Willows wave♫

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,910

295
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,270
He drank so much.

296

♫Goodbye♫

297
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,380
I remember now.

298
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,750
On our graduation night,

299
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,920
he was dumped.

300
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,540
He fell down and hurt his head.

301
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:03,870
Have some water.

302
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,750
Hurry.

303
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,060
Slowly.

304
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Tell me.

305
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
Why was I dumped again?

306
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,560
Is there really no one who loves me?

307
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,140
She didn't abandon you.

308
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,030
It's okay.

309
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Feng.

310
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,960
Wen Yue?

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,790
Wen Yue!

312
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,390
How have you been?

313
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,510
It's time.

314
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm going to the train station.

315
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,750
Didn't you say you'd go with me?

316
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,200
I...

317
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
What are you waiting for?

318
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,900
Go see her off!

319
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,430
I'll take care of Jie first.

320
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,090
Go ahead first.

321
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,040
Wait for me.

322
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,390
I'll give you a surprise.

323
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,390
♫Old roads lie♫

324
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,080
Okay.

325
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,910
Hurry up then.

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,200

You don't care about your girlfriend?

329
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
Because he's my buddy.

330
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,320
♫The sun bids hills goodbye♫

331
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,550
Are you going against me too?

332
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,710
I'll break you.

333
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,910
I'll break you!

334
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,990
Jie! Jie! Jie!

335
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,790
I know you're upset.

336
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,510
Don't be so hard on yourself,

337
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,030
okay?

338
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,110
I want to talk to her!

339
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,580
How are you going to do that?

340
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,330
Listen to me.

341
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,090
Listen to me.

342
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
Get some sleep first.

343
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,870
Talk later,

344
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,300
okay?

345
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,720
Come on.

346
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,910
Go away!

347
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,960
Get lost!

348
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,510
Get out of my face.

349
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
You value dates over mates.

350
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,400
Get lost!

351
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,900
I've been with you all night...

352
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,500
yet you still think I value dates over mates?

353
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:05,760
Because of you,

354
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,650
my girlfriend later broke up with me!

355
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,250
Leave.

356
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,240
I don't need your pity.

357
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,290
Forget it.

358
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,120
I don't want to take care of you this time.

359
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,190
[High-Speed Train]

360
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,340
The surprise I promised to give her

361
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,210
was to leave with her.

362
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,520
But because of my friend,

363
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,960
I missed my chance with her.

364
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,140
I didn't even get to say goodbye to her.

365
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,960
Today,

366
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,140
I must catch up with her.

367
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,210
Go on and leave.

368
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,790
Leave me alone!

369
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,700
Jie!

370
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,510
Jie.

371
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,330
Jie!

372
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,930
Jie!

373
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,590
Jie!

374
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,240
Jie!

375
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,370
Going back to the past with a glass of wine?

376
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
So mysterious.

377
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,700
There must be more details about the case.

378
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,960
What did you dream of this time?

379
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,160
Weren't you with me just now?

380
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,750
I was in your dream too?

381
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,400
I dreamed that I went back when I just graduated.

382
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,550
My ex-girlfriend and I

383
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,030
planned to live together in another place.

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,930
Too bad...

385
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,480
Because of my close friend Jie,

386
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,510
I missed my life with her.

387
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,060
And then?

388
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,840
Later...

389
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,660
Jie married my ex-girlfriend.

390
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,090
Even in a dream,

391
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,980
you lost your girlfriend to another guy.

392
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,180
Come on.

393
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,340
Give me the wine.

394
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,440
Why are you here again?

395
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,220
It's you who dreamed of me again.

396
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,160
Isn't this when I was working overtime last year

397
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
before the promotion announcement?

398
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,950
That night, halfway through drawing,

399
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,400
the circuit breaker tripped.

400
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,480
After I fixed it and went back to my desk,

401
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,820
the cup of water was already spilled all over my blueprint.

402
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,080
Let me guess.

403
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,660
You didn't get promoted because you didn't work hard?

404
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Don't say that.

405
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,240
I always work very hard.

406
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm just a bit unlucky sometimes.

407
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,130
Feng.

408
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,590
How's it going?

409
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,440
Are you done?

410
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,880
Almost.

411
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,000
And you?

412
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm having some trouble with my drawing.

413
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,370
Can you help me take a look?

414
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,550
Don't even think about it.

415
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,930
You're not done with yours.

416
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,280
Sure, sure.

417
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,520
Thank you.

418
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,270
-It’s here. Take a look.
-It’s here. Take a look.

419
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:00,930
Here.

420
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,450
Here.

421
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,030
You need to adjust these parts.

422
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,030
Increase the usage of this space.

423
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,120
Here?

424
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,550
Here?

425
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,410
Leave it to me.

426
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,430
It's so hard.

427
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,180
-I've never done such a complex design.
-It's so hard. I've never done such a complex design.

428
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,030
-How can I submit this tomorrow?
-How can I submit this tomorrow?

429
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,950
-Without your help,
-Without your help,

430
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,950
-I'd never make the deadline.
-I'd never make the deadline.

431
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,590
You're such a good guy.

432
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,000
Done.

433
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,420
-Done already?
-Done already?

434
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:24,980
Yes.

435
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,160
-Thank you,
-Thank you.

436
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,790
Feng.

437
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,880
Without you,

438
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,660
I wouldn't make the deadline.

439
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,110
No problem.

440
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,310
Thank you.

441
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,490
You're not feeling well.

442
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,220
Finish it quickly and go back to rest.

443
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,170
Thank you so much.

444
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,070
Thank you.

445
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,710
You're welcome.

446
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,200
Thank you so much.

447
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,780
Feng.

448
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm leaving.

449
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,820
Thank you for your help.

450
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,600
Don't stay too late.

451
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,070
Bye.

452
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,260
Bye.

453
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,400
The circuit breaker tripped again.

454
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,630
Luckily, I was prepared.

455
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,210
My blueprint got wet

456
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,370
because of this glass of water.

457
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:20,880
[Passers-by, please keep quiet.]

458
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,570
My blueprint!

459
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,180
What did you do?

460
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,140
This has nothing to do with me.

461
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,050
What did I say?

462
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,850
I told you I'm always unlucky

463
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,860
at the critical moment.

464
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,310
Hey.

465
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,470
Do you know why the power went out?

466
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,970
Why?

467
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,660
Your female colleague

468
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,430
[Passers-by, please keep quiet.]

469
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,620
switched it off.

470
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,280
Why?

471
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,170
I helped her just now!

472
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,240
Because

473
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,110
you and her

474
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,570
are competitors.

475
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,220
Only by being better than you

476
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
can she be promoted.

477
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,680
Forget about that.

478
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,390
As long as I finish drawing it,

479
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,560
I might still have a chance.

480
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,750
Can you stop disturbing me?

481
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,150
I have no time.

482
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,450
You aren't dreaming right.

483
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,550
Are you crazy?

484
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,550
I have no time!

485
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,610
You...

486
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,260
If you want to change your life,

487
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,720
it should be like this.

488
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,860
Feng, how's your drawing going?

489
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,680
Are you done?

490
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,150
Almost.

491
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,020
And you?

492
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm having some trouble with my drawing.

493
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,020
Can you help me?

494
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,330
Really?

495
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,100
Yeah.

496
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,580
I can't figure it out.

497
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,690
Isn't your drawing going well?

498
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,110
There's a problem.

499
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,320
Please help me.

500
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,790
I have no idea either.

501
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,070
I doubt I can help you.

502
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,270
Huh?

503
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,400
Feng's design blueprints

504
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,180
have been receiving much praise from many clients.

505
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,690
Well done!

506
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,790
Our next

507
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,110
head

508
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,550
of the Design Department is

509
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,350
Feng!

510
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,430
A round of applause!

511
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,070
Congrats, Feng.

512
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,810
Congrats, Feng.

513
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,480
From now on,

514
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,350
learn more from Feng.

515
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,990
Yes.

516
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,920
Thank you, Boss.

517
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Keep up the good work.

518
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,590
Look at your drawing.

519
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,320
What crap is this?

520
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,320
Since graduation,

521
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,990
there's not been one design of yours that could be used!

522
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,350
Look at him.

523
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,680
He just graduated

524
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,830
but is way better than you!

525
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,060
You've been with us for long enough.

526
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,510
I think you'd better stay home!

527
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,290
Boss!

528
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,110
Boss.

529
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,350
Please don't fire me!

530
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm pregnant.

531
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,780
It's hard to get another job.

532
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,100
If you let me stay,

533
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,830
I'll do anything.

534
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,910
I really need this job.

535
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,430
I have a kid coming along.

536
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,270
Please, Boss.

537
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,890
Qiao.

538
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,950
I'm so blessed

539
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,150
to have met you.

540
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,830
From now on,

541
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,470
I'll work harder,

542
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,090
really hard,

543
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,290
to take you to the places you want to go.

544
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,000
Okay.

545
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,680
Qiao.

546
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,470
Will you marry me?

547
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,900
Yes!

548
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,290
Sort it out right away.

549
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,730
The boss needs it in half an hour!

550
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,790
Okay, okay.

551
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,550
Is my coffee ready?

552
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm sorry. Right away.

553
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,000
Hurry up!

554
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,640
Okay, okay.

555
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,140
The boss wants you

556
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,320
to deliver the material for this afternoon's meeting.

557
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay, okay.

558
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,590
Right away.

559
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,830
No.

560
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,360
No!

561
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,800
What's wrong?

562
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,590
Isn't this a good ending?

563
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,150
But she's pregnant.

564
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,010
I can't bully a pregnant woman like this.

565
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,880
She has a family to take care of

566
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,440
and a child coming along.

567
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,030
Even if she's pregnant,

568
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,640
she still shouldn't have

569
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,430
screwed with you to get promoted.

570
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,830
But...

571
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,210
I understand the logic.

572
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,600
But I just can't do it.

573
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,430
Tell me.

574
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,200
Why did I always make the same choices

575
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,490
when I was given many chances in life?

576
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,700
In this world,

577
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,750
being a good person

578
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,780
isn't enough.

579
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,600
Have another drink.

580
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,500
I'll show you something.

581
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,460
This is my son Feng.

582
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,030
He's a very honest man.

583
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,400
Dad.

584
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,250
If I'd stopped my uncle from borrowing money then,

585
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,590
my dad wouldn't have become paralyzed from anger.

586
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,870
Hey! What's wrong?

587
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,430
Dad!

588
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,600
What's wrong?

589
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,130
Dad!

590
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,030
Dad!

591
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,000
Qiao?

592
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,060
This is what your loved ones will be like

593
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,740
if you choose not to change—

594
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,220
lonely

595
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,070
and tormented.

596
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,050
Do you still choose

597
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,550
not to change?

598
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,680
Look.

599
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,230
If you don't change,

600
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,730
Qiao will be all alone too.

601
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,280
For myself,

602
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,970
for my dad, and for Qiao,

603
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,990
I'll change this time.

604
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,060
Dad.

605
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,080
I must be brave this time

606
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,770
so I don't have regrets.

607
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,800
What's wrong?

608
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,160
Regret your move?

609
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,860
Dad.

610
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,910
Do you know what day it is today?

611
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,180
Today?

612
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,270
What day is it?

613
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,350
The day before your company's payday.

614
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,990
Is there something you're thinking about again?

615
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,860
What I mean is

616
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,470
since it's the day before payday,

617
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,430
there will be a lot of money in the safe.

618
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
You have to be careful.

619
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,730
Why do I feel like

620
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,800
I don't get what you're trying to say?

621
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,320
No matter who tries to borrow money from you,

622
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,800
you mustn't agree to it.

623
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,700
Brother!

624
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,350
Brother!

625
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,090
You have to save me.

626
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,830
Dad!

627
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,380
Brother.

628
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,390
Get up first.

629
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,320
Brother.

630
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,210
What happened?

631
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,000
Brother.

632
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,950
Can you lend me some money?

633
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,490
Dad!

634
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,260
But I just gave you money for investments.

635
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,740
How much do you want now?

636
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,010
The more, the better.

637
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,580
20,000 silver dollars.

638
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,670
Dad!

639
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,960
What did I just tell you?

640
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,630
We can't lend it.

641
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,290
Right?

642
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,030
You... You...

643
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,180
You stupid kid!

644
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,580
You ungrateful brat!

645
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,620
When you were little,

646
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,280
I bought you new clothes

647
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,500
and a drawing board!

648
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Have you forgotten?

649
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,460
You just want money to gamble!

650
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,920
You'll put my dad in jail.

651
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,840
You...

652
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,720
Brother.

653
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
Help me just once more.

654
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,510
I

655
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,000
don't have that much.

656
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,430
10,000 is fine too.

657
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,590
If you don't lend it to me,

658
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,440
this time,

659
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,160
I'll really lose everything.

660
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,970
I'll have to

661
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,150
go begging on the street,

662
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,880
Brother.

663
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,270
Dad! Dad!

664
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,160
You can't say yes.

665
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,920
The money...

666
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,480
He's lying.

667
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,590
He'll go abroad with the money.

668
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,270
You'll be audited

669
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,110
and end up in jail!

670
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,670
Don't say yes!

671
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,310
Don't listen to his lies!

672
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,590
Brother, don't listen to him.

673
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,920
Enough, you two!

674
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,180
I'll get it for you.

675
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,470
No, Dad!

676
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,590
-I need this money or I'll die!
-Dad, don't touch the money in the safe!

677
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,270
Dad!

678
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,640
Are you trying to kill me?

679
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,870
I can't change anything.

680
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,640
I can't change my life,

681
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,100
nor can I help the people around me.

682
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,400
Qiao.

683
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,340
Have you been waiting for long?

684
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,800
Let's go!

685
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,130
Get me another drink.

686
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,390
You've got the wrong person.

687
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,260
Let go of her!

688
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,280
Who the hell are you?

689
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,730
Feng!

690
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,030
What are you doing?

691
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,140
You've got the wrong person.

692
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,640
Come on.

693
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,190
Let go of her!

694
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,760
Wait for me here.

695
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,010
You must be careful.

696
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,460
Feng!

697
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,700
Feng.

698
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,960
Stay away.

699
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,030
You can't kill me this time.

700
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,480
Come on.

701
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,710
You like weapons, huh?

702
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,790
Can you handle it?

703
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,890
Come on.

704
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,080
Let me teach you.

705
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,880
Boss! Boss!

706
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,080
-Boss!
-Boss!

707
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,900
Feng.

708
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,680
You...

709
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,360
You killed my leader!

710
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:34,980
I didn't.

711
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,910
Boss.

712
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,590
I didn't kill him.

713
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,440
Boss!

714
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,410
I didn't kill him!

715
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,400
Boss.

716
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,030
I didn't.

717
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,490
Why did I always make the same choices

718
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,300
when I was given many chances in life?

719
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,660
I can't change anything.

720
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,090
Feng!

721
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:10,860
Feng!

722
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,969
Feng.

723
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,960
Feng.

724
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,360
Feng.

725
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,310
Feng!

726
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,270
Feng.

727
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:27,810
Feng!

728
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:28,989
Feng!

729
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,900
Feng.

730
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,710
Feng.

731
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,719
Feng.

732
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,690
My son, do you still blame me?

733
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,670
Dad.

734
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,190
Feng.

735
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,480
Do you remember the drawing board I bought for you when you were young?

736
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,310
Feng.

737
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,520
Thank you for fixing my blueprint for me.

738
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,350
Feng.

739
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,520
You promised to see me off.

740
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,270
Feng.

741
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,949
Why am I dumped again?

742
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,480
Is there no one who loves me?

743
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,530
Feng.

744
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,360
Feng.

745
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,000
What's wrong?

746
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,650
Feng.

747
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,210
Feng.

748
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,150
Feng.

749
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,180
Feng.

750
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:57,840
Feng.

751
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,890
Do you remember the bag I bought you when you were little?

752
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,110
Feng.

753
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,560
Feng!

754
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,230
Feng!

755
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,740
Nirvanic rebirth

756
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,070
isn't easy.

757
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,970
If you can start over,

758
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,460
will you change?

759
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,470
Feng.

760
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,680
Wake up, Feng!

761
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,500
How are you?

762
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,860
Are you okay?

763
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,130
Are you okay?

764
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,580
Here.

765
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,320
The truth hasn't been determined yet.

766
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,830
Did you have to go this far?

767
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,440
My life is a complete failure.

768
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,480
If I have to live the rest of my life in prison

769
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,360
on an unfounded charge,

770
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,290
I might as well be dead.

771
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:10,960
Feng.

772
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,570
I believe you

773
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,840
and Qiao believes you too,

774
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,340
yeah?

775
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,280
I'll help you find out the truth

776
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
and clear your name.

777
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,150
Trust me.

778
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,960
Think about it.

779
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,670
If you die now,

780
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,510
people will think you committed suicide out of guilt.

781
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,770
Your reputation will be ruined.

782
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,190
Is that what you want?

783
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,050
People will point their fingers at Qiao for the rest of her life.

784
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,960
No.

785
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,360
Is that what you want to see?

786
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,870
At that time,

787
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,190
I ran into Hei Ba

788
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,500
upon entering the bar.

789
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,580
He was drunk and kept pulling me.

790
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,200
So Feng stepped in to stop him for me.

791
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:00,070
[Juror] [Judge] [Juror]

792
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,320
Then Hei Ba hit Feng and they started fighting.

793
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,260
[Defendant's Witness]

794
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,400
Hei Ba grabbed the ice pick and tried to stab Feng.

795
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,360
But he missed

796
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,830
and stabbed himself instead.

797
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,090
Nonsense!

798
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,010
How could my leader have stabbed himself?

799
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,350
You did it!

800
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,630
Yes, you did it!

801
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,400
You did it!

802
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,360
Silence!

803
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,810
[Juror] [Judge] [Juror]

804
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,710
Does any other witness at the scene have anything else to add?

805
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,220
Your Honor.

806
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,090
I'm a police officer from Port District Station, Xu Lai.

807
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
May I request to offer my deduction?

808
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,510
Approved.

809
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:38,500
[Juror] [Judge] [Juror]

810
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,030
Your Honor.

811
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,040
Hei Ba's stab wound is very deep.

812
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,920
Almost the entire ice pick

813
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,320
was stabbed into his body.

814
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,440
As you can see,

815
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,330
Feng is a very thin man.

816
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,710
It's unlikely that

817
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,360
he could stab the ice pick into Hei Ba's body

818
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,650
with this much force with one hand

819
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,440
while protecting Qiao with the other hand.

820
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,840
You were the first officer to arrive at the scene.

821
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,400
[Juror] [Judge] [Juror]

822
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,790
Did you see any blood

823
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,420
on Feng or his hands then?

824
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,420
When I arrived at the scene that day,

825
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,290
he was holding on to the lady.

826
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,710
-There was no blood on him.
-I didn’t kill him.

827
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
We found a lot of

828
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,480
blood splatters at the scene.

829
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,820
If Feng is the murderer,

830
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,150
do you think

831
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
it's possible that

832
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,750
there was no blood

833
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
on his hands or body?

834
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,880
But it still doesn't prove

835
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,360
that he didn't do it!

836
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,880
Your Honor.

837
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,440
I think Hei Ba aimed to stab Feng

838
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,400
while hugging him,

839
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,180
but Feng unexpectedly dodged,

840
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,850
so he ended up stabbing himself.

841
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,010
I conclude my deduction.

842
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,760
Thank you.

843
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,800
Right.

844
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,700
I remember now.

845
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,550
[Defendant's Lawyer] [Defendant's Witness]

846
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,650
The ice pick was in Hei Ba's hand.

847
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,480
Yes, yes.

848
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,230
Feng is innocent.

849
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,190
I can testify.

850
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,150
My leader couldn't have died like this!

851
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,440
You...

852
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,550
You must all be in cahoots!

853
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,190
[Juror] [Judge] [Juror]

854
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,280
Silence!

855
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,010
[Juror] [Judge] [Juror]

856
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,840
Based on the statements of the witnesses at the scene

857
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,400
and physical evidence,

858
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,710
the deceased Hei Ba is found to have died of self-inflicted injury

859
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,280
and the accused Liu Zifeng is found

860
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,920
not guilty

861
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,710
and released immediately.

862
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,000
Thank you.

863
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,210
Long time no see.

864
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,570
Long time no see.

865
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,960
Happy New Year.

866
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,120
Thank you.

867
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,980
I've figured it out.

868
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,270
I don't want to change my life.

869
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,660
If I didn't save that puppy,

870
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,990
didn't save Jie,

871
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,630
didn't let my female colleague off,

872
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,110
and if my dad wasn't who he was,

873
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,590
I wouldn't be who I am today.

874
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,110
Then I might never have met Qiao.

875
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,030
Qiao loves who I am.

876
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,990
As long as I have Qiao in my life,

877
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
there's nothing more I want.

878
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,910
But I won't be a coward anymore.

879
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,270
I'll protect the people I want to protect.

880
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,690
Propose.

881
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,220
She will definitely agree.

882
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,810
Qiao.

883
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,070
Five!

884
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,190
Four!

885
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,320
-It's the countdown.
-Three!

886
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,550
Two!

887
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,230
One!

888
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,510
Happy New Year!

889
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,230
Happy New Year.

890
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,400
Happy New Year.

891
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,150
Because of Lai's intelligence and determination,

892
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,440
Feng was given a chance to be reborn.

893
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,960
If everyone's given a second chance at life,

894
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,960
I hope everyone

895
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,070
will still choose to be kind and brave.

896
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,670
Hello?

897
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,820
Miss Yang.

898
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,430
Our president read

899
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,800
the stories you edited.

900
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,950
[Romantic]

901
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
He loved them.

902
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,150
He said to follow this direction

903
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,790
for the rest of the stories too.

904
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,630
That's great.

905
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,070
Do you think I can meet your president?

906
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,780
I want to thank him in person.

907
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,880
Sure.

908
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,280
I'll let him know.

909
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,840
Okay, thank you.

910
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,560
[Back For You]
