peeping at those opposite him every day.

580
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,960
He has shut himself off from the world for a long time.

581
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,330
The doctor diagnosed him with delusional disorder.

582
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,920
Yuan San is just

583
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,300
a pitiful man who is isolated in his own world.

584
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,290
He is very lonely

585
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,020
and no one understands him.

586
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,400
Everything he sees is distorted.

587
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,440
For example,

588
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,390
Fengqiao Building is not a fancy place.

589
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,670
It's just an ordinary apartment.

590
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,400
Michelle and Alan are just two actors

591
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,710
living in Fengqiao Building.

592
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,890
When Alan helped Michelle rehearse her stage play,

593
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,210
Yuan San thought Alan was really going to kill her.

594
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,680
So Yuan San barged into Michelle's house

595
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,160
to try to kill Alan

596
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,630
to protect Michelle.

597
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,200
I've made up my mind.

598
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,880
There's no turning back.

602
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,910
Don't get me wrong.

We're rehearsing.

604
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,860
This knife is fake. See?

605
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,790
It's fake.

606
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,400
-Watch out, Alan!
-Don't hurt Michelle!

607
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,080
Watch out!

00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,890
We were just rehearsing.

609
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,510
Why are you defending someone trying to kill you?

610
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,710
What's wrong with you?

611
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,370
Are you stupid?

612
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,700
Stay away!

613
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,200
Don't come near me.

614
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,340
This isn't a prop knife.

615
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:51,890
Go away!

616
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,510
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

617
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,570
-Let’s go!
-Go away.

618
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,220
Alan, let's go!
