00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,630
Coming.

Let's go as planned.

11
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,990
Doctor, how is she?

12
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,550
Do you think she'll wake up?

13
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,650
I'm not sure when she'll wake up.

14
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,650
Are you still telling her stories?

15
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,350
Then keep trying.

16
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Okay.

17
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,080
I visit Lu Na every day

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,510
and read comics all day.

19
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,070
I don't know when the comics will appear,

20
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,390
but I'm afraid it'll appear.

21
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,910
Is it really related to the murder?

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
The doctor asked me to continue to tell you stories.

23
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,410
Although it seems like

24
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,360
you can react to

25
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,540
the content of these comics.

26
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,140
But you know what?

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,730
Your comics seem to

28
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,680
be able to come true.

29
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,130
I don't really dare to read it.

30
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
Things that can't kill you

31
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,320

(Operation in Progress)

37
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,530
How is the patient now?

38
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
The patient has been in a coma.

39
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
The steel pierced through the lung.

40
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,880
His blood pressure keeps dropping. It's very dangerous.

41
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,510
I'm going to get rid of the steel in the patient's body–

42
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,390
Don't move!

43
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,100
Who are you?

44
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,050
I'm an intern doctor here. I joined last month.

45
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,000
Who allowed you to enter the OR like this?

46
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
More importantly,

47
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
isn't it more important to save the patient's life?

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,310
Gloves.

49
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,480
The patient was lucky. It only pierced through the lobe of his lung

50
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,180
but not the hilum or mediastinum blood vessel.

51
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,530
But it's too close to the blood vessel.

52
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,470
The most important thing now

53
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,400
is to be careful and accurate.

54
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,400
Don't make any mistakes.

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,620
If anything goes wrong,

56
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,540
it will be irreversible.

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,900
What do you think we should do?

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,480
We need to have an operation immediately

59
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,680
to ensure the patient's safety.

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,480
Scalpel.

61
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,920
Now,

62
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,990
I'm going to try to pull out the steel rod.

63
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,310
I hope I can.

64
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,800
Of course, ideals are ideals. As for the reality...

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,170
Hey.

66
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,840
What are you thinking?

67
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,740
It's your turn.

68
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,610
O-Okay.

69
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,830
It's a rare chance for an intern to get into the OR.

70
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,240
Focus.

71
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,310
Do you think appendicitis is nothing?

72
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,600
N-No.

73
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,720
What no?

74
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
You were distracted all the way.

75
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,870
You do it.

76
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,030
What?

77
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,920
What?

78
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,460
The surgery is done.

79
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,510
You stitch it up.

80
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,590
Give this to him.

81
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,830
O-Okay.

82
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,790
Hurry up.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,190
Just do your job.

84
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,580
Why are you looking at me?

85
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,650
Look at the suture location.

86
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,690
Look at the suture location. Hurry up.

87
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,530
You don't even know the basics?

88
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,270
Okay.

89
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,690
In medical terms, blood phobia is caused by

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,220
an overactive vasovagal reflex,

91
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,560
also known as

92
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,850
Elsberg syndrome.

93
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,250
In my five years at medical school,

94
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,070
I never had symptoms like this.

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,620
But the excitement of entering the OR

96
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,450
for the first time

97
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,210
made me suddenly fear blood.

98
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't study medicine if you have blood phobia.

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,950
When can you become

100
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,550
a chief surgeon at this rate?

101
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,450
I don't think you will

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,490
ever have a chance to go on an operating table agian.

(Episode 3)
(The so-called test)

105
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,130
The book says that blood phobia is actually a psychological problem.

106
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,290
It can be overcome.

107
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,170
So I tried many ways.

108
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,010
For example, eating pig blood all the time

109
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,420
and drinking all red drinks.

110
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,510
Such as watermelon juice,

111
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,630
tomato juice,

112
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,570
and pomegranate juice.

113
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,230
Anyway, I'm getting used to it.

114
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,410
At least I won't throw up when I drink it all at once.

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,200
and the other is soft.

189
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,200
Right?

190
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,810
Yes.

191
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
My surgery was done here!

192
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,910
What went wrong!

193
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,960
I...

194
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,130
I don't know.

195
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,870
I mean, it has nothing to do with me.

196
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,830
Brother!

197
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,510
Ma'am.

198
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
I just came to help temporarily.

199
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,000
Temporarily?

200
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,570
I spent so much money

201
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,840
to do this here.

202
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,370
How do I explain this

203
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,990
to my husband?

204
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,970
Did you add cement to it?

205
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,240
Are you okay?

206
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,190
Wait.

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,370
What are you doing?

208
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,170
I want to touch it again.

209
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,750
Be gentle.

210
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,670
It hurts here?

211
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,240
What about here?

212
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,320
I-It's okay here.

213
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,000
All right.

214
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,530
How is it?

215
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,840
Given my preliminary deduction,

216
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,780
it's hyperplasia.

217
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,060
Hyperplasia?

218
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,230
But don't worry.

219
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,480
It's a common occurrence.

220
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,060
Go to the central hospital for a check-up.

221
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,900
I'll recommend you a good doctor.

222
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,840
Just look for

223
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,970

You're welcome.

227
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,500
Well...

228
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,510
Does this have anything to do with the breast surgery?

229
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,160
It's not directly related.

230
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,200
Don't worry.

231
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,970
That's great.

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,480

I knew you were inside.

235

236

237
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,520

247

He's an excellent student.

248
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,500
You have to believe him.

249
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,670
Of course I do.

250
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,530
He's more like a doctor than you.

251

You can't say that.

252
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,870

290

381
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,350
Xiao!

382
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,630
X–

383
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,790
The doctor?

384
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,580
Yes, he's a doctor.

385
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,320
Save him.

386
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,880
I can't...

387
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,290
Ming... Ming!

388
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,890
Ming!

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
What's wrong with him?

390
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,690
Bro, he has blood phobia.

391
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,950
Are you kidding me?

392
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,340
Are you kidding me?

393
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,240
Ming...

394
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,790
If you can't save my bro,

395
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll kill you now!

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,750
We will!

397
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,830
Go away!

398
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,040
What's going on?

399
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,870
I asked them to go to the hospital, but they refused.

400
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,150
You're the only doctor I know.

401
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,350
I had no choice.

402
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,970
Bro!

403
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,170
Sunglasses?

404
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,000
Are you feeling better?

405
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,890
You're fine now?

406
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,070
Scissors.

407
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,830
Scissors.

408
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,800
Scissors!

409
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,400
There's something in his throat.

410
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,220
What?

411
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,110
There's something in his throat.

412
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,480
Fruit candy.

413
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,850
(International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies)

414
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,720
A candy?

415
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,770
Forceps.

416
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,020
Hurry.

417
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,200
Open his mouth.

418
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,840
Hurry!

419
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,840
Bro.

420
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,680
Are you feeling better?

421
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,770
-What happened?
-What happened?

422
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,800
Bro!

423
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,160
Oh no!

424
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,020
It's a hemopneumothorax.

425
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,780
What do you mean?

426
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,520
Layman terms!

427
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,000
That is, air entered the chest

428
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,110
through the wound,

429
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,160
compressing the heart

430
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,030
and lungs.

431
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,300
This causes him to be unable to expel the gases in his lungs.

432
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,170
He may suffocate at any time.

433
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
What should we do?

434
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,030
We need surgery.

435
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,280
Get ready.

436
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,380
Scissors first.

437
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,670
Ming.

438
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,550
Ming.

439
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,990
Are you sure?

440
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,400
Do you have a better idea?

441
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,240
Ming.

442
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,700
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,000
You got involved because of me.

444
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,020
But I had no choice.

445
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,460
They forced me with a gun.

446
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,050
I asked them to go to the hospital, but they refused to.

447
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,010
They asked me to find a doctor.

448
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,480
I didn't know who I to look for.

449
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,070
All I could think of was you.

450
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,300
I could only call you.

451
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,620
Of course.

452
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I knew

453
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,590
if I called you,

454
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,120
you'd come save me.

455
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,120
Hurry up!

456
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,720
Save him first.

457
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,510
Saving him is more important.

458
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,260
Alcohol.

459
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,970
Hold him.

460
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,160
Bro!

461
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,970
-Knife.
-Knife.

462
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,690
C-Can you do it?

463
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,990
Hurry up.

464
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay, I got it.

465
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,190
Ming.

466
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,240
I have experience

467
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,420
in chest surgeries.

468
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,660
How about you tell me how to cut it?

469
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,540
I'll cut it.

470
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,370
Just tell me the location.

471
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,300
Where is it?

472
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,320
It's...

473
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,080
The middle rib.

474
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,930
The middle rib.

475
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,890
Between the second rib.

476
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,190
Between the second rib.

477
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,720
About one centimetre wide.

478
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,960
Here?

479
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,980
Yes.

480
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,580
Bro.

481
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,210
Hurry up!

482
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,310
I know, I know.

483
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,290
Hold it.

484
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,990
Get up. Let me do it.

485
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,930
Can you do it?

486
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Let me try.

487
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,700
Okay, no hurry.

488
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,020
Bro...

489
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,910
Bro!

490
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,340
He...

491
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,330
He fainted.

492
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,390
Prepare the bottle and tube.

493
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,790
I can do it.

494
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,790
Here.

495
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,480
Take it.

496
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,750
Bro.

497
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,680
Ming.

498
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,210
It's still not bubbling.

499
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,510
The gas is coming out.

500
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,060
Bro.

501
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,300
Bro.

502
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,000
Great.

503
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,560
Something has changed.

504
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,080
A robber?

505
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,790
The robber was injured while robbing a gold shop.

506
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,590
This doctor with blood phobia saved him.

507
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,050
Thank you for saving my bro.

508
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,400
You're welcome.

509
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,180
But I advise you to take him to the hospital.

510
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,150
Although he's out of danger now,

511
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,790
he still needs

512
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,160
further examination and treatment.

513
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,480
You'd better go now.

514
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,590
Yes.

515
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,130
Don't worry about that.

516
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,610
We will leave on our own.

517
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,850
That's great.

518
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,970
But sorry.

519
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,810
You saw our faces.

520
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,690
Bro.

521
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,640
Bro, what are you doing?

522
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,350
We saved your bro.

523
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,920
We know nothing.

524
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,790
Ms. Hong?

525
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,530
-Ms. Hong!
-Ms. Hong!

526
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,170
-Ms. Hong, calm down!
-Calm down!

527
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,510
-Let me go!
-Ms. Hong, calm down.

528
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,110
They killed my husband!

529
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,380
Hold her.

530
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,130
Let go of me.

531
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,400
You'll go to jail, Ms. Hong!

532
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Let me see.

533
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,910
I'm going to kill them!

534
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,940
Calm down!

535
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,960
Let go of me!

536
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,750
Stop her!

537
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,590
You'll go to jail, Ms. Hong.

538
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,790
Come and help!

539
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,160
Ming.

540
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,770
I can't hold her down anymore.

541
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,540
Let go!

542
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,810
Ms. Hong!

543
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,390
Ms. Hong!

544
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,500
-Ms. Hong.
-Ms. Hong.

545
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,170
Calm down.

546
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,510
-Ms. Hong.
-Let go of me!

547
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,640
What happened?

548
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,330
You didn't see it?

549
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,880
He was here. He scared me.

550
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,720
Honey...

551
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,900
Honey...

552
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,470
Honey...

553
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,790
Honey!

554
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,960
Don't go.

555
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,590
Close the door.

556
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,310
Honey!

557
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,070
Drive!

558
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,340
Honey, don't go!

559
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,710
They killed my husband!

560
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,070
Ms. Hong.

561
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,930
Knife! Ming! The knife!

562
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,350
-I can’t hold her down anymore.
-Let go!

563
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,450
Ms. Hong!

564
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,240
Ms. Hong–

565
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,540
Cut the crap.

566
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,500
You can find another man.

567
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,790
You deserve to die.

568
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
Bro.

569
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,110
Don't blame me.

570
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,570
The first person I saved...

571
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,980
is a murderer.

572
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,900
I tried so hard to save you. You murderer.

573
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,140
Go to the dock with me.

574
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,830
I told you,

575
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,920
you can only go to the hospital now.

576
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,200
You can't go anywhere else.

577
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,230
You won't be able to hold on...

578
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,590
Drive.

579
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,590
I tried so hard to save you.

580
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,480
Now you want to die?

581
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,850
Go!

582
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,380
Ming.

583
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,390
Ming.

584
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,330
Follow him.

585
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,960
Hurry, drive with him.

586
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,350
Drive faster.

587
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,580
I'm driving fast enough.

588
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,140
You can drive faster.

589
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,760
What are you doing?

590
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,010
Are you all right?

591
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,160
Xiao!

592
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,670
Xiao!

593
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,650
Xiao!

594
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,680
Go straight.

595
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,510
Dock!

596
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,380
I'm turning right. We're going to the hospital first.

597
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,760
I told you to go to the dock!

598
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,090
I'll take you to the hospital!

599
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,030
Dock!

600
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,680
Hospital!

601
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,220
Dock!

602
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,870
Stop fighting! Let go!

603
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,510
It's going to crash. Let go!

604
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,510
Go to the dock!

605
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,670
Let go!

606
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,580
Xiao...

607
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,500
Xiao...

608
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,750
Get off.

609
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,450
Let's go.

610
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,790
Let's go to the hospital.

611
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,350
Come with me.

612
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,630
-Be careful.
-Be careful

613
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,990
Xiao.

614
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,010
Xiao.

615
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,570
Let's go to the hospital.

616
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,590
Let's go.

617
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,200
You don't have blood phobia anymore?

618
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,750
I saw it just now.

619
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,360
If I can't escape,

620
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,590
both of you will die.

621
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,780
Leave me alone.

622
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,650
I can't leave.

623
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,360
No.

624
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,050
-Let’s go to the hospital.
-I can't...

625
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,940
Let's go. We can go.

626
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,170
We can go. Hurry up!

627
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,050
Get up!

628
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,210
If I can't escape,

629
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,200
both of you will die.

630
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,000
How dare you...

631
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,590
Go to the hospital now.

632
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,180
I don't believe in hospitals.

633
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,960
I believe in fate.

634
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,230
Put it down.

635
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,350
Put it down.

636
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,260
You traded your life for this.

637
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,310
Do you want it?

638
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,820
Put it down.

639
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,830
Okay.

640
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,930
Put it down–

641
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,900
I said you can't make it to the dock.

642
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,710
Hang in there.

643
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,290
We'll be there soon.

644
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,409
Three, two, one, go.

645
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,340
Hang in there. Let's go to the hospital.

646
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,100
Let's go.

647
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,469
Go.

648
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,030
Let's go.

649
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,680
Ms. Hong's Chicken Rice?

650
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,140
The stolen goods?

651
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,380
The dock?

652
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,470
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

653
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,820
Are you sure it was last night?
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

654
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:22,840
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

655
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,800
-Yes.
-Yes.
(Shanglan Port District Police Station)

656
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,120
When Situ Xiong and Scar ran away,

657
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,310
they hid in my cousin's clinic.

658
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,250
Then,

659
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,030
Ms. Hong came inside and killed Scar.

660
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,460
Situ Xiong forced me and my cousin

661
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,750
to take him to the dock.

662
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,010
He said he was going to escape.

663
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,150
And then you got into a car accident?

664
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,600
Yes.

665
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,870
No, sir.

666
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,710
He shot my cousin

667
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,890
to force me to drive.

668
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,590
I wanted to take my cousin to the hospital.

669
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,800
But he insisted on going to the dock.

670
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,110
Then we had a fight

671
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,070
and got into a car accident.

672
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,500
Then the stolen goods fell off the dock.

673
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,760
Yes.

674
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,470
Situ Xiong then died because of his severe injury.

675
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,770
You're good at making up stories.

676
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,580
These are two cases.

677
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,170
First, Situ Xiong and Scar robbed the gold shop.

678
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,560
Second,

679
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,260
you and your cousin wanted those stolen goods.

680
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,550
You killed Situ Xiong and hid the stolen goods.

681
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,660
I didn't!

682
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,780
It's true! At that time–

683
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,840
He shot my cousin.

684
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,190
I was in a hurry to send him to the hospital

685
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,280
so I got into an accident.

686
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,530
No need to explain.

687
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,480
You killed him.

688
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,550
How do you explain that?

689
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,260
Sign this.

690
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,440
With your Huaya.

691
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,350
Sir...

692
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,510
Lai?

693
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm investigating a case. What are you doing here?

694
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,080
There's still something suspicious about this.

695
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,340
Do you recognize this?

696
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,370
Yes, I do.

697
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,900
Sir,

698
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,820
these are what Situ Xiong stole.

699
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,340
He shot my cousin.

700
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,720
I threw it into the pier in a fit of anger.

701
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,300
Really!

702
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,410
I found these at the wharf.

703
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,200
If he wanted to keep the gold for himself,

704
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,760
why would he

705
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,150
tell us where he threw it out at?

706
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,630
He didn't expect us to find it.

707
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,000
If he wanted to kill him,

708
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,230
he could have done so

709
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,320
in the clinic.

710
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,800
Right?

711
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,190
Situ Xiong and Scar had a gun. How would he dare to?

712
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,300
Bring the convicted in.

713
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,310
Ming.

714
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,350
Ms. Hong.

715
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,860
You're not dead?

716
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,250
I'm not dead.

717
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,000
The bullet hit

718
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,350
the steel mould your cousin gave me.

719
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,070
What can this prove?

720
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,150
Officer,

721
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
I wanted to kill Situ Xiong

722
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,000
in a fit of anger

723
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,480
to avenge my husband.

724
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,940
Luckily Ming stopped me

725
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,190
before I can do anything more.

726
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,110
He wouldn't let me kill him.

727
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,550
How could he kill him himself?

728
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,080
Ming is a kind kid.

729
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,480
Besides,

730
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,640
Situ Xiong

731
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,070
is the murderer.

732
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,860
He deserved to die.

733
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,250
He deserved to die...

734
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,620
All right.

735
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,670
The truth is out.

736
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,560
Go back and take good care of your cousin.

737
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,290
You're a good doctor.

738
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,330
I'm not a good doctor.

739
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,070
Situ Xiong could've survive.

740
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,660
If I...

741
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,410
If I insisted on taking him to the hospital,

742
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,120
he might not have died.

743
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,190
But he threatened me

744
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,620
threatened me with my cousin's life.

745
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,840
I was too scared,

746
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,850
-so I had to listen to him...
-All right.

747
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,740
Don't feel guilty.

748
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,550
He was seriously injured.

749
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,640
Even if you took him to the hospital,

750
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,950
he wouldn't have made it.

751
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,310
I know you are a responsible person.

752
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,050
You can save more people, right?

753
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,920
Yes.

754
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,760
Thank you.

755
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,560
See you.

756
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,910
Okay.

757
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,260
See you.

with comics that can predict murders.

766
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,190
Who would believe that?

767
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,360
I don't know who you are,

768
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,860
but I think

769
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,880
you're not a bad person.

770
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,930
♫Give me a time and a direction♫

771
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,530
♫I have a hunch that you and I are a match made in heaven♫

772
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,600
♫I am your person♫

773
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,740
♫We've been a match since before we knew it♫

774
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:47,960
♫Love is being blindfolded; a fog that cannot be cleared♫

775
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,750
♫Time is a winding, lost path, with no way back, no step forward♫

776
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,370
