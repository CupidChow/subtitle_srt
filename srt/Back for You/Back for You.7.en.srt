193
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,450
Mr. Bai Lang!

194
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,510
It's really you!

195
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,000
Hey.

196
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,990
Don't you think

197
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,820
you're a bit too eager?

198
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,630
Why were they chasing you?

199
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,250
Probably because

200
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
they thought I impregnated

201
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,250
their leader's woman.

202
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,080

You sure are bold.

241

Not bad.

You don't have to comfort me.

I don't know.

That's your secret recipe.

Otherwise,

why's the whole city obsessed

Then tell me,

When baking,

295
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,740
there must first be a sense of formality

296
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,480
to show our respect to food.

297
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,150
Step one: hollow out the cake.

298
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,590
Step two: make the strawberry lava.

299
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,210
Since it's a lava cake,

300
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,400
there must be liquid

301
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,030

304
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,300

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,110
Come on! Be the judge!

570
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,310
-Look!
-What’s wrong?

571
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,680
Nothing. Ignore her.

572
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,840
She's looking for trouble.

573
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,780
What's wrong?

574
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,610
Bullying your customers, huh?

575
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,410
Try it

576
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,390
and tell me if it's a cake for humans.

577
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
P-Please calm down.

578
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,220
I'll try it.

579
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,450
I'll give you a refund right away.

580
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,950
See?

581
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,240
This lady's more reasonable.

582
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,270
I'm really sorry.

583
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,600
Thank you, Miss.

584
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,790
Unlike this young fellow, making excuses.

585
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,360
She was looking for trouble.

586
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,630
The cake's fine.

587
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,720
Isn't it delicious?

588
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,440
No problem.

589
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,480
It's delicious,

590
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,000
right?

591
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,230
Bai.

592
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,940
Have you been too tired lately?

593
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,450
You used salt instead of sugar.

594
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,170
You...

595
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,070
Why did you drink so much?

596
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,090
What's wrong?

597
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,630
Nothing.

598
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,810
Bai.

599
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,160
Come here!

600
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,590
Check out the latest cake recipe I developed.

601
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,520
Want to try it?

602
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,870
How is it?

603
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,520
Delicious.

604
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,170
I have something to do tonight.

605
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,340
I might be back late.

606
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,200
Going out again?

607
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,700
Didn't you promise me to stop drinking?

608
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,450
I've been exhausted from

609
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,700
making cakes all day every day.

610
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,450
Why are you busy every night?

611
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,880
Didn't we agree to open 200 shops?

612
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,440
Someone's interested

613
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,830
and wants to talk about it.

614
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:23,890
Then...

615
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,910
don't be too late.

616
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,380
Okay.

617
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,110
[Mr. Bai Bakery]

618
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,590
Where are you going?

619
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,590
I'm going out.

620
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,370
Didn't he go out in the day?

621
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,160
Where is he going now?

622
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,030
When are you

623
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,550
going to come clean with Lily?

624
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,130
Now that you've developed the cake recipe,

625
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,720
what do you still need her for?

626
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,750
Baby, don't be angry, okay?

627
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,980
If she has other better ideas,

628
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,600
we can make more cakes.

629
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,440
We'll be richer then,

630
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,060
right?

631
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,900
And

632
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,560
when will it be the end, Lang?

633
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,700
Don't be angry, okay?

634
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,810
So everything you said was a lie.

635
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't want to stay here anymore.

636
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,469
How'd I get back?

637
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,020
Why did I come back after being hit by a car?

638
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,290
The one who should be hit

639
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,800
is that scumbag.

640
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,400
All that talk about liking me.

641
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,770
He was just using me.

642
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,590
What strawberry lava cake?

643
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,909
I'll make it with chili powder

644
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,070
and ginger.

645
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,639
I don't want to make cakes anymore.

646
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,190
It's all a lie.

647
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,510
I don't want to be a baker anymore.

648
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,990
I want to forget him.

649
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,420
I must throw away

650
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,500
all his things.

651
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,150
Lily.

652
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,520
I accidentally called out your name today,

653
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,750
before I realized you've been gone for a week.

654
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,960
Lily, I’m sorry.

655
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,170
I only lied to you about this one thing.

656
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,670
Will I get a chance to make it up to you in my next life?

657
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,450
I'm a doctor.

658
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,880
I can only save lives.

659
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,430
I can't help you lie.

660
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,040
If I don't do this,

661
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,740
Lily would have to watch me become weaker,

662
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
watch me collapse, watch me die,

663
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,150
and watch me be buried.

664
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,630
Isn't that cruel?

665
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,920
Is she gone?

666
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,760
Yes.

667
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,180
When I went to the market today,

668
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,610
I remembered the first time we met.

669
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,610
I smiled to myself for a long time,

670
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,710
but I fainted after a while.

671
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,000
I can't hold on anymore.

672
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,920
Lily.

673
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,430
I dreamed of you last night.

674
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,920
You tried your best to coax me

675
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,630
to drink the bowl of medicine

676
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,750
in your hands.

677
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,700
But I've completely lost my sense of taste.

678
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,520
I can't tell if it's bitter or not.

679
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,320
Lily.

680
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,550
I changed

681
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,570
our shop's name from Mr. Bai Bakery to LoveLy Cakes.

682
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,150
Love-Ly.

683
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,000
Lily.

684
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,320
I'll love you forever.

685
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,640
Four strawberries look better.

686
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,550
Because

687
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,840
one is for time,

688
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,080
one is for dreams,

689
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,580
one is for you,

690
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,180
and one is for me.

691
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,520
I brought back the taste of his cake.

692
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,030
But

693
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,510
I can never go back.

694
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,860
I didn't expect it to be such a tragic story.

695
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,710
You appeared suddenly like Lily.

696
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
Will you leave suddenly like her too?

697
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,750
This is the story of Mr. Bai and me.

698
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,880
I helped him create the best cake.

699
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,830
But

700
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,480
because he was seriously ill,

701
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,680
he chose to commit suicide

702
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
so as to not drag me down.

703
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,590
If it weren't for Officer Lai

704
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,190
clearing my name,

705
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,930
I might be wrongly accused as the one

706
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,670
who killed Bai Lang.

707
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,890
Besides,

708
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,630
not long after,

709
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,610
a miracle drug was developed.

710
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,610
He didn't...

711
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,620
have to die.

712
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,750
Many people

713
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,440
live their whole lives

714
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,860
without ever experiencing the love you two share.

715
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,260
Miss,

716
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,000
here's the old case file you're looking for.

717
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,110
Thank you.

718
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,630
[Back For You]
