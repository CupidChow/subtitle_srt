OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,117
Can we go around
and share the first thing you'd wanna do

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,536
if we can go somewhere without zombies?

6
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,333
Ah, I wanna go to my mom and dad's house,
and have a hot bath,

7
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,044
and then eat my mom's cooking.

8
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,754
No! Oh, gosh!

9
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,802
I just wanna lie down and sleep in peace.

10
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,763
Oh! Crap! Argh!

11
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,181
There were a lot of scary moments,

12
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,099
but it's been really nice
being together, right?

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,690
Why…

14
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,985
You get away from me! Get back!

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,405
The door opened?

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,199
He's unconscious. He's not moving at all!

17
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,035
Wake up. Open your eyes!

18
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,871
Hey, noona, stop kidding around.
Not again.

19
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,998
Everyone, thank you and I'm sorry.

20
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,041
Hold on!

21
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,460
It feels like
we're getting closer to death.

22
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,377
Yeah.

23
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,255
Don't you feel like
we're inching closer and closer to death?

24
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,383
Hey, snap out of it. Wake up!

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,970
Oh, man.
Where do we go from here? Where?

26
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,598
Hey, I think they're gonna kill us.

27
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,143
They're gonna kill us all. No, no!

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,686
How did this happen?

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,814
We don't have a choice.
We're screwed if we get bitten.

30
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,774
Na-rae!

31
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,109
Noona!

32
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,279
No, no! They're getting bitten!
No, no, no!

33
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,322
Oh, no!

34
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,033
Let me tell you something.
All the men wanna stick together.

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,286
You can't blame us for this.
Because this is a matter of life or death.

36
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,789
Where are you guys?

37
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm scared and it's cold.

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,377
But I don't think I can go with you.

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,420
We've made it this far together.

40
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,381
You said we were family!

41
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,591
Where are you?

42
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,177
We have to get to a safe place together.

43
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,303
Oppa!

44
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,430
Please help me! Help me!

45
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,682
You killed them.

46
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,267
That's how we survived.

47
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,608
Found you.

52
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,305
-Hey!
-Hi!

53
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,932
Ms. Lee,
why don't we drop the honorific too?

54
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,101
-Oh, okay sure.
-We work together now, right? Yeah?

55
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,312
Aren't you younger than me though?

56
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,688
No, I'm your hyung. I mean, oppa.

57
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,149
-Oh, what year were you born?
-I'm 44.

58
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,359
I see. I was born in 1982, so I'm 41.

59
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,444
You're not as young as I thought.

60
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,070
Why did I think you were a lot younger?

61
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,697
Oh, come on.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,617

00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,915
Oh, gosh.

65
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,208
-Excuse me.
-Sorry, gosh. Nice to meet you.

66
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,419
-Oh, hello!
-Are you wearing the thing?

67
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,254
-How did you break it?
-Look.

68
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,297
-Gosh!
-Oh, poor you!

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,381
-Does it ache?
-Oh.

70
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,175
-It does.
-Oh, no.

71
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,720
NA-RAE IS UNDERGOING PHYSICAL THERAPY
FOR HER TORN CRUCIATE LIGAMENT

72
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,723
-Oh, hi, good to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Tsuki.

73
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,644
-Oh. Oh, you're from Japan! Hi.
-Hi, nice to meet you too.

74
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,895
Tsuki, does you name
have a meaning?

75
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,563
-It means "the moon."
-So the tsukidashi

76
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,856
we get at restaurants, is that…

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,942
Come on, oppa,
that's not it. Hey.

78
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,361
That's not the same.
How could you even ask that?

79
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,071
-Sorry. Right, I'm sorry. Yeah.
-No, it's similar, yeah.

80
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,740
Sorry. I asked because I wasn't sure.
I'm very curious.

81
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,003
You're here.

82
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,800
-Shall we get ready?
-Okay.

00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,395
I'm so excited. I'm so excited.

86
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,771
Na-rae, I'm so excited.

87
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,690
-Let's get started.
-Okay.

88
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,109
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

89

LOVE HUNTER FILMING BEGINS

91
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,989
-You know her, right?
-Yes.

92
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,532
-Hello.
-We just have to sit back and watch.

93
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,449
Right?

94
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,078
I mean, our show is Love Hunter
and we have an actual hunter with us.

95
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,997
So I think
things are gonna get fierce today.

96
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,623
Hello, I'm Love Hunter's main host.

97
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,500
-It's time to get your feelings on!
-It's starting.

98
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,710
-It's finally starting. Yeah!
-He's so energetic.

99
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,128
-Yeah, I feel his energy.
-Let's go!

100
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,214
Can a man and a woman who've never met

101
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,801
fall in love when they get intimate?

102
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,761
-Oh, I'm so curious.
-Find out on Love Hunter.

103
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,972
All these couples are meeting
for the first time, right?

104
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,349
Right. So this is like a jungle.
They're all hunters.

105
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,650
Let's get right into it.
That's how we do it on Love Hunter.

106
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,694
I wish I were in the show.
They're going for it.

107
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,280
-People move fast in relationships.
-Yeah, they really do.

108
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,948
Go ahead and kiss her.

109
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,491
-Hey, this is…
-Oh!

110
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,618
Hold on!

111
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,663
-Oh, gosh, wow, did you see that?
-No! What?

112
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,914
Isn't this too fast?

113
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,208
-All of a sudden like that?
-Oh, my heart hurts.

114
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,294
This is how they do it
on Love Hunter, see.

115
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,837
Let's move on to our second couple.

116
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,756
Whoa!

117
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,802
Oh, my gosh! Wow!

118
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,013
Wow! They do not hold back.
Right to it.

119
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:47,972
I love this.

120
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,474
I wanna be on the show. I do.

121
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,808
It does pack a punch.

122
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,025
-Did you see that?
-Things are already heating up.

123
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,402
-Oh gosh.
-Now, the couples that are left…

124
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,491
But the female guest of our third couple

125
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,367
seems a bit shy.

126
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,454
Is she drunk?

127
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,750
I wonder how this will turn out.

128
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,347
-Oh, come on.
-No, nope, she wasn't shy at all!

129
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,183
She's diving right in!
That is one deep kiss!

130
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,102
-Whoa!
-Wait, hey,

131
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,062
isn't that a little too hot?

132
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,189
-Wow!
-Unbelievable.

133
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
What the heck?

134
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,786
What the heck?
Wait, is that… is that blood?

135
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,913
That's blood!
What the heck? What's happening?

136
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,332
Huh? What the hell?
What is it? Shoot!

137
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,171
Whoa, what… what's happening?

138
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,757
-What's going on?
-What?

139
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,842
What, what, what?

140
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,100
This is Zombieverse,
a world where zombies are real.

141
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,197
Huh? Everyone… everyone's leaving.

142
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,832
You need to get out of here!

143
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,250
Now! Run! Now!

144
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,253
-What?
-You have to get out of here! Get-- Argh!

145
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,337
What?

146
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,594
They will not be given
any information from now on.

147
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,846
-Out, out, out!
-Oh, shoot.

148
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,389
-What is it?
-Out, out, out!

149
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,391
Wait for me.

150
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,518
From now on,
they will overcome difficulties

151
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,062
by thinking and making decisions
on the spot.

152
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,403
Currently, this area is full of zombies.

153
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,161
And their first mission
is to escape this place safely.

154
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,296
The quest begins.

155
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,380
FIRST QUEST

156
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,548
ESCAPE THE AREA
WHERE ZOMBIES APPEARED

157
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,635
WATCH HOW THESE FIVE ACT
IN THIS UNSCRIPTED SITUATION!

158
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,802
Where's the exit?

159
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,887
What do we do?

160
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,682
-Is there a way out?
-Where?

161
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,858
Noona!

162
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,153
Get up! Get up!

163
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,281
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!

164
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,874
Oh, shoot!

165
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,835
Oh, no!

166
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,878
Let's go. Go! Go!

167
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,055
Run! Hurry! Come on!

168
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,224
-Na-rae. Where is Na-rae?
-Na-rae!

169
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,225
Oh, no!

170
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,435
Oh, gosh! Just go without me.

171
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,023
To the right!

172
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,943
To the right! Turn right!

00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
Oh, they're coming!
They're coming! They're coming!

174
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,075
Where do we go? Where?

175
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,953
Oh, no! Oh, no!

176
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,374
Wait for us!

177
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,959
-Oh, no!
-Come on! Go right!

178
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,919
Go right!

179
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,588
Look!

00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,674
Hey, hey! This way!

00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,888
What is going on?
What's happening?

182
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,806
What the hell?

183
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,600
Oh, no! Oh, no!

184
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,059
-Oh, man.
-Wherever we can.

185
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,436
Where do we go from here? Where?

186
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
Fight… or run?

187
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,232
Don't come closer!

188
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,110
Trust the other or betray them?

189
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,031
If it were you, what would you choose?

190
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,409
Welcome to Zombieverse.

-Come on, hurry!
-Anyone down there?

209
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,448
No? There's a car!

210
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,492
-It must be the production crew.
-Oh, it's the crew's car.

211
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,494
-Let's get in!
-Get in.

212
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,704
Oh, thanks. Gosh.

213
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,414
Hurry.

214
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,460
There's no cell signal.
I can't connect to the Internet either.

215
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,712
I'm so worried. I wonder if my mom's okay.

216
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,173
What the hell?

217
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,925
"Central Disaster

218
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,761
Breaking news.
An unidentified contagion is spreading

219
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,389
in the downtown area of Mapo-gu, Seoul.

220
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,849
Around 7:00 p.m. tonight,
on a busy street near Hongdae

221
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,851
with lots of restaurants and bars…

00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,813

We'll report on any updates.

HEADING TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF SEOUL

227
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,413
So…

228
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,872
I have no idea what is happening.

229
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,584
So does that mean it's fine
as long as we get out of Mapo-gu?

230
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,086
Hey, haven't we come a long way?

231
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,004
It can't be dangerous here too, right?

232
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,464
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

233
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,882
-Huh? It's a grocery store.
-Huh?

234
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,717
-Where?
-Huh? A grocery store?

235
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,262
-Look.
-Could I go get some chocolate? No, right?

236
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,347
-Jeez, oppa, in this situation?
-It's closed.

237
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,057
-You want chocolate now?
-I'm craving something sweet.

238
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,392
Then you can just get off here.

239
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,145
Come on. Hey, we have to stick together.

240
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,689
HE'S THE ONE WHO LEFT THEM
AS SOON AS IT STARTED

241
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,774
By the way, she kept up really well
despite her hurt leg.

242
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,317
HE RAN OFF WITHOUT LOOKING BACK

243
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,278
-You were running really fast.
-Come on.

244
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,114
Get out of the car. Get off, really.

245
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:29,874
THERE ARE OTHER PASSENGERS
IN THE PRODUCTION VAN

246
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,585
By the way, what… what is this car for?

247
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,712
Isn't that the sound director?
When did you get on?

248
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,589
That's what I'm saying.
What is this car for?

249
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,008
How did we, like…
How did this car happen to be there?

250
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,677
-What… happened to the others?
-I'm not sure either.

251
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,263
-Who knows.
-What on earth is going on here?

252
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,307
Hey, is this
the audio team's van then?

253
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,441
-No, but…
-I don't think he heard you.

254
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,401
-He didn't hear you.
-Sir.

255
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,153
-Are you okay?
-Come on.

256
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,074
Where are we going?
Where are we going right now?

257
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,618
Where are we going?

258
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,163
Wait, the gas. The low fuel warning light
came on a while back.

259
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,499
-What?
-The light came on before, yeah.

260
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,626
Really? Oh, we shouldn't be stopping.

261
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,921
We need to find a…

262
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,047
-A gas station.
-Yes.

263
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,298
-A gas station. A gas station.
-A gas station.

264
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,050
This is making me nervous.

265
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,468
I've got a bad feeling about this.

266
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,347
Can we… uh, can we just
get off here? Should we just get off, huh?

267
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,265
Unni,
what are you talking about?

268
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,477
We can't stop, no. We don't know
where they might pop out from.

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,853
But… just among us,

270
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,397
you have to be honest
and tell the others if we get bitten.

271
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,315
-Right, yes.
-Yes. Really.

272
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,858
Let's be honest with each other.

273
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,901
-Even if you get scratched.
-Yes.

274
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,194
You have to tell us
even if you get scratched.

275
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,654
-Yes.
-You too, sir.

276
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,156
-You have to tell us if you get bitten.
-Okay. Okay.

277
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,616
-Huh? There!
-Oh!

278
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,825
-It's a gas station!
-Where? Where?

279
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,119
-Is the light on? It is!
-Sir, a gas station over there!

280
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,079
The light's on.

281
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,497
Hey, let's close the windows
just in case.

282
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,624
-Okay. Okay. Unni, unni.
-Just in case.

DESERTED GAS STATION

284
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,711
They've arrived at a new place.

285
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,559
-No one's here.
-There isn't anyone.

286
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,227
-There's a car over there.
-Where?

287
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,104
There's a car there too.

288
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,941
Why did they all
leave their cars behind?

289
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,776
Why would you leave your car behind?

290
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,374
-Sir.
-Oh, don't take out the key.

291
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,709
No, leave the key behind.

292
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,460
Don't take it out, just leave it there.

293
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,004
Just… you aren't planning
to leave me behind and run--

294
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,046
-No way!
-Of course not.

295
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,381
-Oh, no!
-No way!

296
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,216
Oh, no way, I promise.

297
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,217
Just leave the key behind.

298
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,303
You're not planning
to leave me behind and run?

299
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,763
What is with him?

300
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,611

00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,477
-The car key.
-Did he take it?

307
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,394
-No…
-He took it?

308
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,395
He took it.

309
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,647
Wait! Wait!

310
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
Wait! Wait!

311
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,858
What? No way! Hey!
What do we do? Hey, hey, hey!

312
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,817
No, the car is out of gas.

313
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,527
Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh!

314
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,863
No!

315
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,449
Oh! Oh, gosh! He bit him! He bit him!

316
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,076
Lock it! Lock the door! Crap!

317
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,452
-Here! Here!
-Lock the door!

318
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,955
-Oh, no!
-Hey! He's bleeding! Look, there's blood!

319
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,873
For now, block it! Here. Block it.

320
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
Should we get out? What do we do?

321
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,377
Where is he going?
Oh, the blood!

322
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,631
-Lock the door. Hurry. Lock it!
-I locked it!

323
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,592
Oh, they're coming.
They keep coming.

324
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,886
-No, no!
-Huh? Hey, where is he going?

325
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,721
Look at where he's going. There, the key!

326
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,223
-Our key!
-That way! He went in that way.

327
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,349
The car wash machine.
The car wash!

328
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,309
-Huh?
-The car wash machine.

329
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,978
He went inside the building.

330
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,147
He went inside the building.

331
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,816
What do we do? But he's already…

332
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,943
Oh, hey look, hey.
He's climbing the car. Look.

333
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,575
Oh, shoot!
What the hell? Oh, gosh.

334
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,370
Oh, no! Getting bitten must hurt, right?

335
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,579
Be quiet, be quiet.

336
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,260
I don't think they know we're here.

337
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,511
-No.
-You're right.

338
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,429
I'm so scared.

339
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,055
Oh, look at him.

340
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,973
Look…

341
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,811
You don't become a zombie right away.

342
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,188
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!

343
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,566
Be quiet.

344
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,609
-He must have seen us.
-Stay still.

345
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,445
No, it's okay. The door is locked anyway.

346
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,031
What if the window breaks?

347
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,825
-But it's not…
-Huh? Hey, there's more coming.

348
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,744
-Where?
-Look, there are more.

349
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,954
What do we do?
Should we get out of the car?

350
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,581
-But…
-But we'll die if we get out.

351
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,666
-Yeah. Hey, hey.
-Be quiet.

352
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,001
Come on. Stay still.

353
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,839
So, I don't think…

354
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,466
I don't think they can see us.

355
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,384
They must not be able to see very well.

356
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,469
They can't.

357
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,095
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR THEM
TO CLEARLY SEE OBJECTS IN THE DARK

358
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,644
The diesel fuel is ready.

359
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,898
Please open the fuel cap
and dispense with the green nozzle.

360
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,193
Wait, do they react to sound?

361
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,111
What do we do? Crap.

362
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,698
This is…
Oh, gosh, I'm going crazy here.

363
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,825
Hey, since we kept quiet,

364
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,368
they all went that way.

365
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Wait, do you have music?

366
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,622
Music?

367
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,124
Yeah, we can turn it on
and drop it over there.

368
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,710
No, don't drop it.
You can open the window a little.

369
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,212
We can play it through there
and then close it again.

370
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,380
-Open this up…
-Jeez, hey. We're scared too.

371
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,673
I'll try it.

372
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,342
WOW, SI-YOUNG BRAVELY STEPS UP!

373
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,384
Okay, unni.

374
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,179
She can do almost anything.

375
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,432
Hey, don't play a song.
Let's use an alarm or something.

376
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,642
The alarm. Change it to that.

377
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,477
Should I change it to the alarm?

378
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,437
What do you need an alarm for?
We just make noise.

379
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,564
-Hey.
-Hey!

380
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,399
Oh, gosh.

381
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,363
Hey, close the window!
They react to sounds, yes!

382
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,572
-It's the sound!
-That's it.

383
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,908
Oh!

384
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,995
-Be quiet.
-We just need to be quiet.

385
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,126
THEY ENCOUNTER ZOMBIES AGAIN
AT THE GAS STATION

386
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,547
THEY CAN'T SEE WELL,
BUT THEY CLEARLY RESPONDED TO SOUND

387
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,843
Hey, so did he fill up the gas?

388
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,136
-He didn't.
-No.

389
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,012
He was going to but they got him.

390
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,597
-Wait, but…
-But wait, where's that guy?

391
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,765
He has the car key.

392
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,058
Oh, look. There.

393
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,602
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THE DRIVER TOOK THE KEY

394
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,729
Let's do this then,
we'll make a noise here,

395
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,023
-get the key, and refuel.
-Wait…

396
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,400
THEY NEED TO REFUEL
AND FIND THE KEY TO ESCAPE

397
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,361
Hey guys, you've pumped gas before, right?
You know which buttons to press?

398
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,988
It's really hard. You have to--

399
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,906
-You have to insert a card.
-Do you have a card on you?

400
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,284
-He chose diesel before he--
-Hey, the card's in the reader.

401
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,327
You just have to pump the gas.

402
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,912
Yeah, you just have
to pump the gas. Yes, yes.

403
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,248
-Let's refuel first.
-I think you'll be the best at it, oppa.

404
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,916
-At pumping gas?
-Yeah.

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,376
-Pumping gas?
-Because you have

406
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,795
-the most experience here. Yes.
-At pumping gas?

407
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,590
Raise your hand
if you know how to pump gas.

408
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,008
-Well, I know how.
-If you can do it on your own…

409
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,010
-I can do it.
-I don't know how. Sorry.

410
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,888
-I really, really don't know very well.
-You really don't know how?

411
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,889
-Really.
-You can do it, right?

412
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,056
-You have a car.
-Can you do it?

413
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,726
-I do but…
-Yours isn't electric car, right?

414
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,978
-You have a car too.
-Mine's electric, it's an EV.

415
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,937
Stop kidding around. You don't have an EV.

416
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,439
You have the Cayenne!

417
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,815
I sold it a long time ago.

418
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,526
Don't talk about stuff like that.

419
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,279
Hold on, you don't know
how to pump gas because you sold

420
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,072
-your car?
-Unni, I'm sorry. It's my leg.

421
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,032
-Yeah. Yeah, right.
-Hey, wait…

422
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,326
-Oh, right, you hurt your leg, but…
-It's because of my leg.

423
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,452
Hey, I'm really sorry, but…

424
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,370
I think my leg hurts too. It hurts.

425
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,497
Just unbelievable.
You're driving me crazy.

426
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,958
I'm really sorry, but…
I'm sorry, but let's be serious.

427
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,336
-One of us needs to sacrifice ourselves.
-Okay.

428
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,963
Oh, but it's so scary.
I really do wanna go, but…

429
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,090
Then I'll pump the gas.

430
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,717
-Oh, really? But…
-But in return…

431
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,761
Okay, okay then. Let's do that first.

432
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,055
There are a lot of things
that make noise over there.

433
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,015
-Yes.
-Cans, water bottles.

434
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,850
But that means
we have to go out there.

435
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,561
Let's try knocking them over.
Because they aren't fast right now, right?

436
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,647
-Who's going to knock them over?
-You.

437
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,191
You want me to knock those down,
then come back and pump gas?

438
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,610
-He can't do that.
-That's ridiculous. You think I'm crazy?

439
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,695
-Why would--
-I'll go. I will.

440
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,782
No, you came all the way here
to another country to work.

441
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,825
-Oppa, you do it.
-Oppa, you do it.

442
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,826
Hyung,
you're 12 years older than me.

443
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,662
-It's because I'm all the way in the back.
-Oppa, you ride a motorcycle.

444
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,330
-Come on.
-Oppa, you just have

445
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,790
-to climb up over here.
-Okay. If they attack

446
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,625
when I'm making noise there,
you're gonna close the door, aren't you?

447
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,752
-We wouldn't do that.
-No, jeez!

448
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,670
Just in case.

449
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,088
I'm gonna be so mad if you lock the door.

450
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,382
-Hey, Oppa, hurry up.
-Jeez, I can't believe it.

451
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,549
-Have people been lying to you…
-Hyung…

452
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,051
-…your whole life?
-…what kind of life have you been living?

453
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:01,969
You know, I've been conned.

454
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,762
-Yeah, I do, I do.
-Okay, okay. Then…

455
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,600
Okay, so I'll check how big of a noise
is needed to make them come.

456
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,310
-What?
-The sound it makes.

457
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,770
Oh, you mean at what decibel they react?

458
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,688
To see when they react.

459
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,231
-I see…
-You're a real professional.

460
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,149
Let's try it then.

461
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,443
-After you're done pumping gas…
-Come right back in.

462
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,153
I'll throw that over that way
so you can pump the gas.

463
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,613
-Okay. Okay, okay.
-Let's go. Let's go.

464
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,198
-When they go over there.
-Okay, okay, okay.

465
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,825
Remember that I'm the one
who volunteered to go.

466
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,493
Shoot.

467
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,246
Be careful.

468
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,498
DinDin,
you have to fill up the tank, okay?

469
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,625
Be careful.

470
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,627
Close the door.

471
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,796
Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry.

472
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,510
The quest begins.

473
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,594
BEGINNER'S QUEST
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION

474
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,847
Hey, they don't know
he's there. They don't. Look.

475
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,099
-You're right.
-You just need to be quiet.

476
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,726
Okay, let's get going too.

477
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,103
Keep an eye on that
when the door's closed.

478
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,730
-If that locks over here…
-Okay.

479
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,773
Oppa, you have to leave
through here. Through the front.

480
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,067
Hey, he is going after all.

481
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,323
Be careful.

482
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,373
-Sorry, I'm so scared.
-Hurry it up. Hurry up.

483
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,180
Please touch…

484
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,557
Please touch…

485
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,850
THE MACHINE MAKES A LOUD NOISE

486
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,393
-Please select how much…
-Shoot.

487
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,146
-Select how much…
-Shoot.

488
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,690
Please select your method of payment.

489
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,612
Please insert…

490
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,405
SAVING REWARDS POINTS
JUST MIGHT TAKE YOU TO THE AFTERLIFE

491
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,448
Shoot, I don't have a rewards card.

492
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,367
Oppa, did you do it?

493
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,161
Oh, shoot.

494
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,957
If they attack,
you're gonna close the door, aren't you?

495
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,375
-We wouldn't do that.
-No, jeez!

496
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,668
Hey, hey, hold on.

497
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,672
Lock the door, now.

498
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,509
-Over there.
-Oh, gosh.

499
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,480
-Close it.
-How far did you get?

500
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,941
It asked if I wanted to earn points,
so I pressed "No".

501
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,150
Stupid points, jeez.

502
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,361
DinDin, how about you go
when Hong-chul throws those.

503
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,695
-When he throws it…
-Okay.

504
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,665
Wait. What… what is he doing?

505
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,501
-It's because he's scared.
-Oh, come on, seriously?

506
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,503
You have been timed out.

507
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,505
-We ran out of time.
-It timed out.

508
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,465
-There's nothing we can do about it.
-I told him there's a time limit.

509
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,177
Why isn't he doing it?

510
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,350
That's it.

511
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,228
-I'm going now.
-Oppa, yes. Hurry.

512
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,022
-Don't scream. Don't scream.
-Oppa, now. You have to go now.

Please touch-- Please select--

Insert your rewards--

517
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,003
Insert-- An error has occurred
while reading your card.

518
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,630
-The IC chip cannot be detected.
-Oh, shoot.

519
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,465
Please insert your card into the reader.

520
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,927
-He can't come back now.
-What's with him?

521
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,640
-Please check the total amount.
-Okay, okay, okay.

522
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,603
-Oh, shoot. Holy shoot.
-Oppa, you have to make more noise.

523
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,687
-No, no, no, I can't.
-Oppa!

524
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,147
-You have to keep going. Come on, hurry!
-You have to, you have to.

525
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,899
-Starting to pump diesel.
-He's so…

526
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,901
Faster!

527
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,485
-Damn it, this isn't working.
-Are you doing it?

528
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,112
Ah, you have to keep holding it.

529
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,156
-Is the gas going in?
-It is, but he has to keep holding it.

530
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,490
He has to keep holding it?

531
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,034
THE NOZZLE LOCKING CLIP IS BROKEN

532
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,494
But there's like a little tab
to lock the handle in place.

533
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,348
Dispensing has stopped.
Dispensing has stopped.

534
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,682
A LOUD ALARM HAS GONE OFF!

535
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,392
Please keep dispensing.

536
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,146
Dispensing has stopped.

537
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,607
Please keep dispensing.

538
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
-They're coming this way.
-No.

539
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,319
-No, no, no!
-Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh!

540
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,529
-They're coming!
-Hurry! Hurry!

541
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,828
-Oh, gosh.
-Look at him.

542
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,507
-No, no, no!
-Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh!

543
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,800
-They're coming. They're coming.
-Come on, hurry up!

544
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,093
-Come on!
-Hurry!

545
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,263
-Hurry! Hurry!
-They're coming.

546
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,769
Hey, hey, hey.

547
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,729
Be quiet.

548
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,069
-That was really scary. Oh, gosh.
-Look. They're looking at us.

549
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,279
Hey, are you okay?

550
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,118
-I can't do it.
-Did you take it out?

551
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,995
-I pumped the gas. It's done.
-Please remove

552
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,621
-your card.
-Okay. Good job.

553
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,164
What decibel level was it?

554
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,332
TIME TO PRESENT THE RESULTS

555
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,709
-As you can see…
-Huh?

556
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,670
They react
when the volume is around here, zero.

557
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,839
-So, how loud is that?
-Huh? What?

558
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,677
So it needs to be at least as loud
as when Hong-chul threw stuff over there.

559
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,346
ROUGHLY THIS LOUD?

560
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,682
THEY CAN'T HELP
BUT LAUGH AT THE RESEARCH

561
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,767
Are you kidding me?

562
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,686
We can figure that much out
without all that.

563
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,147
You go… Hey, hey. What is this?
I mean, what is this?

564
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,024
We just risked our lives out there.

565
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,150
I mean, who doesn't know that.

566
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,985
They swarmed over there
when I threw the stuff.

567
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,278
-What's the point…
-We're talking, right?

568
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,363
-…of having a sound tech here?
-So it needs to be louder than this.

569
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,824
We don't need him. I think
we can send him on his way, Si-young.

570
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,201
-We just need the key, yeah.
-Hey, wait.

571
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,829
You only pumped 20,000 won worth of gas?

572
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,955
WITH THAT AMOUNT,
THEY'D NEED TO STOP AGAIN

573
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,332
AT ANOTHER GAS STATION SOON

574
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,333
We can pump more.

575
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,625
-Let's go pump more.
-Hey…

576
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,626
-This is driving me crazy.
-We'll pump more.

577
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,337
Come on, don't be like that.

578
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,838
-No. No, I'm not criticizing you.
-No.

579
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,631
-We know how brave you are.
-No, I'm not…

580
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,550
-I already went out there.
-You're the best.

581
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,135
Hey, this is for the better.

582
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,137
-Think of it as training.
-What? Training?

583
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,388
Let's all go one by one.

584
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,976
Let's see if you can move fast enough.

585
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,354
THE ONE WITH THE LEG INJURY
HAS BEEN SELECTED

586
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,230
A TRUE EGALITARIAN
HAS BEEN HERE ALL ALONG!

587
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,690
-Yeah, they're slower than you think.
-She's faster than you think.

588
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,233
No.

589
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,320
We've got perfectly healthy people.
Why keep telling Na-rae to go?

590
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,030
Because she has to live in this world too.

591
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,031
No, I'll go. I will.

592
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,282
No, no.

593
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,034
-No, no.
-No, I mean she's saying she'll go.

594
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244
-Okay then. Do you wanna try?
-No. I… No, I'll go.

595
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,662
-Okay.
-I'll go make the noise.

596
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,831
-Why would you make noise?
-Oh, gosh.

597
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,749
Because you do have a point.

598
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,876
-I have to move around and run.
-No, but then…

599
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,462
-Let's…
-No, I'm really okay.

600
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,172
I'll go take a look at the other cars.

601
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,508
-Okay.
-Si-young and Tsuki can try.

602
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,718
And bring back… bring back
some food if there is any.

603
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,220
You're unbelievable!

604
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,430
WORRYING ABOUT FOOD
LIKE THE ELDEST SHOULD

605
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,973
-Seriously?
-I like sweets.

606
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,433
It'd be better to use this door.

607
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,394
-I am starving, to be honest.
-Me too.

608
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,311
Could you bring me some sweets?

609
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,021
And I want water so bad right now.

610
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,899
So I'll go first
and you guys follow me.

611
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,692
DINDIN ENDS UP GOING AGAIN

612
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,112
So Tsuki, you make some noise
wherever you can, okay?

613
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,697
-Okay.
-Now. Go. They're far away.

614
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,408
Tsuki, be careful.

615
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,551
Now, us. Be careful.

616
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:53,273
ALUMINUM TRASH CAN:
PERFECT FOR MAKING LOUD NOISES

617
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,736
Oh, shoot!

618
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,112
HE SAW A ZOMBIE INSIDE THE CAR

619
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,782
Noona, get in the car.
I'm sorry!

620
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,537
-Noona, get in the car!
-Huh? Why is he yelling?

621
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,373
Hey, hey, get in. Hey, that gas.
That door won't open. That door!

622
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,375
Noona, get in the car.
Take it out!

623
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,218
Jeez, she…

624
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,645
How is she going to outrun them?

625
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,398
They're chasing her!
They're chasing her!

626
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,572
Tsuki's back there. There!

627
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,990
Wow, she's amazing.

628
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,326
I heard Japan has a lot of ghosts.

629
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,162
What on earth
are you talking about? Seriously.

630
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,705
She must be less afraid of them.

631
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,210
What's that sound? Huh?

632
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,555
HER SCREAMS WAKE UP
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CAR WASH

633
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,396
A new zombie has appeared.

634
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,581
It's following her! It's following her!
Why is it following her?

635
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,500
-Why is it chasing her?
-What? What's going on?

636
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,918
Why did it get so fast?

637
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,131
Si-young, why is it so fast?

638
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,009
-He got fast all of a sudden.
-Oh, gosh! What's happening?

639
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,481
THIS ZOMBIE IS WAY FASTER
THAN OTHER ZOMBIES!

640
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,984
Maybe they speed up if you make a sound.

641
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,652
We're screwed.

642
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,696
Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh!

643
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,450
-What do we do?
-The blue one is too fast.

644
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,001
Hey, hey! The fast one!
The fast one, it's going after her!

645
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,421
THIS ZOMBIE HAS A STRONG ENGINE
BUT A BROKEN STEERING WHEEL

646
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,511
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH GAS

647
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,139
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION: REFUEL

648
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,182
Where is Tsuki?

649
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,454
Wait, hold on. What do we do?

650
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,553
Oh, no. They couldn't get out of there.

651
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,305
Oh, that zombie's way too fast.

652
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,057
The blue one, he's too quick.

653
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,684
What do we do? We have to rescue them.

654
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,442
Ah, jeez. What do we do?
What do we do?

655
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,914
HE GETS SURROUNDED
THE MOMENT HE STEPS OUT

656
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,383
HE UNINTENTIONALLY BECOMES A HERO
WHILE TRYING TO RUN AWAY

657
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,804
Gosh.

658
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:02,063
THEY LOOK FOR THE KEY
WHILE ZOMBIES CHASE AFTER HONG-CHUL

659
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,986
Hey, do you think it'll work?

660
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,446
Hey, hey, hey.
Do you think you can get it? Do you?

661
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,698
They're looking at us.

662
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,701
Oh, shoot.

663
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,369
Will you please budge?

664
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,998
HE DEFINITELY PUT THE KEY
INSIDE HIS CHEST POCKET

665
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,378
Hey, careful. Hey, he's moving.

666
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,897
What? What? What? What?

667
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,816
-Oh, blood.
-What?

668
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,859
-What? What?
-Blood.

669
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,698
-Blood.
-Huh? Oh, gosh.

670
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,910
Get it, get it, get it.

671
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,164
Okay, go. Go, go, go, go!

672
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:09,172
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION: GET THE KEY

673
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,679
A NEW ZOMBIE
HAS BEEN ADDED

674
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,698
THIS ZOMBIE… HAS TERRIBLE BALANCE!

675
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,495
…A CAR BEGINS TO MOVE?

676
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,295
HE'S DRIVING THE CAR QUIETLY
TO ESCAPE FROM THE SCENE ALONE

677
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,885
HE NOTICES THE ESCAPEE

678
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,059
What? What? What? What?

679
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,228
Hyung, we found the key.
We got it. Get out of the car.

680
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,938
-What?
-Right now. We got the key.

681
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,231
Okay, okay, I will. Jeez.

682
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,690
Why would you…

683
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,567
-Argh! Get out!
-Okay. Wipe your eyes.

684
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,694
It looks like you got bitten!

685
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,114
I'm gonna park the car.

686
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,283
Hey! Jeez…

687
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,705
THEY'RE READY TO ESCAPE!
EVERYONE JUST NEEDS TO GET IN THE CAR

688
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,124
I'm scared.

689
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,917
Hey. Get in.

690
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,615
-No!
-I didn't get bit!

691
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,826
-Go away!
-No! Go away!

692
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,996
Go! Go! Go! Go! No! Go away! No!

693
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,248
-Go! Go! Go!
-No, hey.

694
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,382
Huh? Why is he over there?

695
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,176
Did you really get the key?

696
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,468
We did.

697
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,639
-Oh, that was terrifying.
-Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

698
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,767
Hey, are you okay?

699
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,852
You didn't get bitten?

700
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,729
-Hold on.
-DinDin, you…

701
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,147
THE DRIVER
HANGS AROUND HIS STOLEN CAR

702
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,610
Step on it.

703
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,946
-Oh, gosh.
-Okay. Is everyone here?

704
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,281
We're all here?

705
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,619
Go! Go, go, go!

706
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,745
Go! You can just go!

707
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,580
-Go! Just… Just go!
-Yeah, we can turn here.

708
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,501
-Go!
-Hurry!

709
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,465
-Man, he was cute.
-This place…

710
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,717
I can't believe it.

711
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,427
Oh, gosh. Oh, man.

712
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,306
Quest complete.
Everyone survived.

713
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,478
ALL FIVE ESCAPED

714
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,771
I think I'm gonna cry.

715
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,565
I have no energy left.

716
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,323
Let's stop here first.

717
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,243
-That hurts. I ran into it. Ouch!
-That was…

718
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,410
Na-rae, did you get scratched?

719
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,996
-Did you get bitten?
-He grabbed my shoe. My shoe.

720
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,873
-You didn't get bitten?
-No, she didn't.

721
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,416
-We were… You saw that, right?
-Look.

722
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,751
-Look.
-Let's see your foot.

723
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,254
-We were…
-But there's blood, see?

724
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,380
-Blood.
-Turn on the flashlight.

725
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,757
-No. No, he didn't touch my skin.
-Let's see.

726
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,050
-Sir, turn on the flashlight.
-Here.

727
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,260
See?

728
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,428
Fortunately, over here…

729
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,055
-Because of her socks.
-Yes.

730
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,765
Her cast protected her
from getting bitten.

731
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,100
So maybe she didn't get bitten,

732
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,810
-just got some blood on her.
-Uh, DinDin,

733
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,938
-you got a lot of blood on your face.
-No, the blood just got on my skin.

734
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,773
-It's a splatter, really.
-Hey! You're the one we should be…

735
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,608
What are you talking about?
You were right next to me.

736
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,527
Maybe it got in your eyes or something.

737
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,696
Yeah, what if you can get infected
through your eyes?

738
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,989
My eyes are clean.

739
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,532
You saw the driver back there, right?

740
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,409
-It's because I'm tired.
-How long did it take for him to change?

741
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,160
No, it didn't get in my eyes.

742
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,329
Ah, my voice is all hoarse.

743
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,291
DinDin, can you turn the heater off?
It's hot in here.

744
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,168
This is crazy.

745
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,087
You're hot? Why are you getting so hot
all of a sudden?

746
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,006
-Because I ran so hard.
-You didn't get bitten, right?

747
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,923
-I didn't.
-You're hot?

748
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,300
-But it's cold in here.
-I'm burning up.

749
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,260
Hey, it's not hot at all in here.

750
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,928
Let's rest for a bit.

751
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,722
DinDin, I'll drive later.

752
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,265
I'm starving.

753
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,977
And thirsty
and I really wanna sleep.

754
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,237
Hey, you keep rubbing your eyes.

755
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,948
Why do you keep rubbing your eyes?
