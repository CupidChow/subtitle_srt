1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,427
No! Murderer!

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,220
We have to kill all of them!

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,933
Stay right there! Attack!
Kill all of them!

4
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,893
Why are you doing this to us?

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,812
-No!
-It was an accident!

6
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,605
-An accident.
-Let's go!

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,316
Kill them!

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,569
Hey! Go that way!

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,820
Oh, shoot!

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,280
Hey!

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,117
Be careful!

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,000
THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE SUBWAY STATION:
PATHWAY TO THE PLATFORM

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,293
Get out!

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,544
Be careful!

15
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,754
Slowly!

16
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,755
Oh, darn it…

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,047
So many followed us.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,507
-Get out.
-Slowly!

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,425
Careful.

20
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,804
Look at me. Are your glasses on?

21
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,181
-Yeah.
-Don't take them off.

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,558
Are you okay?

23
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,018
Why did you do that?

24
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,770
It couldn't be helped.

25
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,396
No, you shouldn't blame someone for this.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
It's okay.

27
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,317
-It was a zombie anyways.
-That's what should've been done.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,860
Or one of us could have turned
into a zombie.

29
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,944
Yes, good job.

30
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,154
She must be really shocked too.

31
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,114
It all happened so quickly.

32
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,450
People turned on us in an instant.

33
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,161
They were completely
witch-hunting us from both sides.

34
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,871
Just kill it!

35
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,539
TAEYEON WAS FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE

36
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,374
I can control him! Don't do it!

37
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,584
Don't kill him!

38
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,170
Hey!

39
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,214
INSTEAD OF SIDING WITH THE BROTHERS,
THE PRO-ZOMBIE FACTION,

40
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,924
SHE CHOSE TO SUPPORT
THE ANTI-ZOMBIE AGITATORS

41
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,513
WITH THIS DECISION, THE GROUP
ENDED UP WITH THE ANTI-ZOMBIE FACTION

42
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,390
Oh, that lady and everyone came.

43
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,768
It must've been a bit
uncomfortable to stay there.

44
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,229
We would've died if we stayed.

45
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,064
We were right, weren't we?

46
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:46,981
I agree.

47
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,024
Yes, that's true.

48
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:48,983
What do we do?

49
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,777
Do we have to stay here with these people?

50
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,279
Are we getting on the subway together?
What are we going to do?

51
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,532
Wouldn't it be better
not to talk about the subway?

52
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,451
But in a way, they ended
up here because of us.

53
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,121
I don't know what
we're supposed to do with this situation.

54
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,331
If you're in a lot of pain,
I could carry you on my back.

55
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,126
Yes, it hurts so much
that I can't even walk.

56
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,877
Then I'll stay by your side.

57
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,795
Yes, thank you.

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,046
Thank you.

59
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,134
Hey, over there.

60
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,093
Why is that American…

61
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,136
Why is he here?

62
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,053
-Jonathan!
-It's Justin.

63
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,430
-Oh, Justin.
-It's Justin, not Jonathan.

64
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,933
-Justin Harvey.
-It's not Jonathan, right?

65
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,060
-Isn't he the fiery one?
-He scares me.

66
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,436
I don't like him.

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,688
He was gambling earlier and…

68
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,605
That's right.

69
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,649
He's really strong.

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
THREE HOURS AGO
AT THE TEMPORARY SHELTER

71
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,695
Eun-bi is good.

72
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,071
I'm so frustrated!

73
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,156
What?

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,116
Oh, hello.

75
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,367
Who is he?

76
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,119
MET A FOREIGNER
WHO SEEMED TO ALREADY KNOW DINDIN

77
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,121
I'll start.

78
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,123
You need to guess where it is.

79
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,250
-It's in the middle.
-No, this side?

80
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,502
Thank you.

81
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,879
Isn't this guy a scammer?

82
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,758
HE FLIPPED THE TABLE
AFTER LOSING TWO CANS OF SPICY TUNA

83
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,926
-A scammer!
-No!

84
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,012
-No!
-What's wrong?

85
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,307
Justin, where's your destination?

86
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,392
My destination? The airport.

87
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,435
-The airport?
-Yes.

88
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,312
Why does Justin scare me so much?

89
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,063
He keeps circling around us.

90
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,940
If you ask me,
he's the most dangerous one.

91
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,109
JUSTIN HARVEY, A SOUTH AFRICAN ACTOR

92
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,861
Yes, I'm here to help them.

93
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,030
-Yes.
-They're injured.

94
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,573
Don't stare like that.

95
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,949
Well, you said you have a bad feeling…

96
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,451
No, just look this way.

97
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,828
-Just don't look that way.
-But I have two eyes.

98
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,954
Don't get involved.

99
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,872
What do we do with Justin?

100
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,956
-What?
-Justin.

101
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,208
I don't like him…

102
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,627
But he's got a good physique.

103
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,629
That's why I don't like him.

104
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,548
I saw him holding down
the judo guy from earlier.

105
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,383
JUSTIN USED HIS STRENGTH
TO HELP SUBDUE THE CHAOS

106
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,843
You'll get bitten!

107
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,056
Make your decision!

108
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,725
-He seems like he's obsessed with money.
-Really?

109
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,145
Yes. If he realizes who Hong-chul is,
he's going to lose it.

110
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,647
Just say he has cataracts.

111
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,565
No, Justin is fine.

112
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,650
He's a friend of mine.

113
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,276
-It's okay.
-But it's five billion won.

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,237
You never know with people.

115
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,533
But isn't it weird
to leave someone behind?

116
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,451
-I agree.
-That's true.

117
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,994
We can't even take care
of ourselves right now.

118
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,079
How can we take care of them?

119
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,830
Please help us.

120
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,123
-We have to go together.
-Take us!

121
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,750
-We don't know exactly either.
-Please save us.

122
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,377
We don't know for sure.

123
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,797
All of you are in better shape than us,
so please take us with you.

124
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,593
Everyone, wait. Firstly…

125
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,097
Raise your hand
if you're planning to take the subway.

126
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,098
We all need to get on.

127
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,474
Anyone who wants to stay?

128
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:30,937
So about the short-tempered lady…

129
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,690
From what I see, we need to keep
that lady away from Hong-chul.

130
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,941
Yeah, you're right.

131
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,235
Then if we find and bring them,
it's five billion?

132
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,904
IF HONG-CHUL'S STATE IS REVEALED,
THE 5-BILLION-WON HUNTERS WON'T STAY IDLE

133
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,657
That woman and the foreigner.

134
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,825
Harvey? Okay.

135
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,868
Why don't we do this?

136
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,579
Si-young and Hong-chul
can take some people.

137
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,331
The rest will go with Harvey.

138
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,375
Let's regroup after we find out
where the subway is.

139
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,501
Ma'am, go this way.

140
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,628
UNINTENTIONALLY ENDED UP
WITH A GROUP OF 20 PEOPLE

141
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,796
Take care of yourself.

142
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,756
Since we're a group,
we need to move together.

143
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,133
EACH TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 10 PEOPLE

144
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,678
IT WON'T BE AN EASY ESCORT
WITH THE ELDERLY AND INJURED

145
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,015
Since the subway splits
into two directions, we'll take this way.

146
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,433
What is this place?

147
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,434
Let's go.

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,478
Are we going the right way?

149
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,396
Yes, we are.

150
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,148
DEFCONN, DINDIN, SUNG-JAE, EUN-BI, JUSTIN
IN ONE TEAM

151
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,734
HONG-CHUL, SI-YOUNG, DEX, SAE-HO,
TAEYEON, CODE KUNST ON THE OTHER TEAM

152
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,986
It's suddenly getting scary here.

153
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,823
But where do we…

154
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,450
It's scary.

155
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,077
-Feels like something's about to come out.
-Everyone's scared.

156
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
But we have to be careful.

157
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,540
We have to trust each other.

158
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,083
We're sticking together
until the end, right?

159
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,585
Yes, you're right. Watch out.

160
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,423
ESCORT 20 EVACUEES SAFELY TO THE SUBWAY

161
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,883
Oh, what's that?

162
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,842
There's something here.

163
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,635
Quiet down now.

164
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,803
There might be zombies coming.

165
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,013
-There might be zombies.
-Watch out.

166
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,723
Ma'am, get closer.

167
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,684
RESTRICTED AREA: CONTROL ROOM

168
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,561
Wow, this must be the control room.

169
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,818
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

170
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,195
Quiet down a little.

171
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,112
There's something there.

172
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,031
-What's this?
-Wow, it's a room?

173
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,699
There are monitors.

174
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,910
This is…

175
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,286
-It's the CCTV.
-There are walkie-talkies.

176
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,704
I see them!

177
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,419
All of these people are dead.

178
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,254
-Zombies!
-There are zombies.

179
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,881
They got bitten while they were at work.

180
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,676
A HORDE OF ZOMBIES SPOTTED
INSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM THROUGH THE CCTV

181
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,429
RESTRICTED AREA WORKER ZOMBIES

182
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,640
VISION AND HEARING IMPAIRED
DUE TO UNDERGROUND WORKING ENVIRONMENT

183
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,225
-How do we get through?
-Isn't there another way?

184
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,727
Wait, this looks like night vision mode.

185
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,771
That means it's really dark in there.

186
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,398
THE AREA VISIBLE ON THE CCTV IS PRESUMED
TO BE COMPLETELY DARK

187
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,900
We can't go in. No way.

188
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,489
But which is the first?
Number one should be the first, right?

189
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:51,327
THEY MUST PASS THROUGH THIS MAZE
AND AVOID THE ZOMBIES ALONG THE WAY

190
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,620
It's a maze.

191
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,539
So this… Yeah, it is.

192
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,208
Hong-chul, I have a flashlight.

193
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,626
Should we take a quick look inside?

194
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,544
Sure.

195
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,338
There's a ladder over there too.

196
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,798
-Can you…
-Go ahead if you want to see.

197
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,383
THE IMMUNE SEMI-ZOMBIE STEPS BACK

198
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,634
Dex wants to take a look inside.

199
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,094
I'll shine the light inside real quick.

200
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,011
Okay.

201
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,389
Check how far you can see on the CCTV.

202
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,645
Hey, Dex. Look at this.

203
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,646
-Can you see?
-Number one.

204
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,730
Look at camera number one.

205
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,023
Yes, it's the right one.

206
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,445
REACTING STRONGLY TO THE SUDDEN LIGHT

207
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,821
No, it's tied down right now.

208
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,620
Close it now!

209
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,372
-They reacted to the light.
-Did something jump out?

210
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,624
They reacted to the light.

211
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,043
STOPPED MOVING AS SOON
AS THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED

212
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,336
I guess we shouldn't shine any light.

213
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,381
Wait a minute. Why is everyone
suddenly putting on helmets?

214
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,924
THE 10 EVACUEES
ARE STARTING TO GET NERVOUS!

215
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,676
-We have to survive.
-Of course.

216
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,470
I told them to put them on.

217
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,429
Good job.

218
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,514
I couldn't see anything in front of me.

219
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,434
As soon as we turn on the light,
the zombies will come.

220
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,187
You could guide me through
the way with the walkie-talkie.

221
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,313
MUST GET THROUGH WITHOUT LIGHT

222
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,023
You couldn't see anything at all, right?

223
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,149
No, I couldn't see anything.

224
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,444
So, we will guide from here
and Dex will go ahead to check it out?

225
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,113
It doesn't have to be me.
Hong-chul, you can go instead.

226
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah, Hong-chul should go.

227
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,410
But we can't let
these people find out, right?

228
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,914
We can't blatantly use
Hong-chul like that.

229
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,540
-You're right.
-Put on some gloves too.

230
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,210
Since we have walkie-talkies,
let's split into teams.

231
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,461
-Let's split up.
-Come this way.

232
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,795
-Come here first.
-Split into two groups.

233
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,297
Five people need to stick together.

234
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:31,969
THE PASSAGE FULL OF BLIND ZOMBIES:
COMPLETE ESCORT MISSION IN THE DARK

235
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,763
DEX, SAE-HO, AND 5 EVACUEES GO FIRST

236
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,181
Let's go. You can do it.

237
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,016
I don't think I can.

238
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,684
Hold onto my shoulder.

239
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,230
Be careful.

240
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,859
It's okay.

241
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,777
We got this.

242
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,989
Don't worry. It's tied down.

243
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:52,949
Close the door quickly.

244
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,243
THE REST SHOULD WATCH THE CCTV
AND GIVE PRECISE GUIDANCE

245
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,410
Hold on to me tightly.

246
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,871
The light! Close the door quickly!

247
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,504
COMPLETE DARKNESS BEGINS

248
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,258
NOTHING IS VISIBLE INSIDE

249
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,765
Dex, to the left from there.

250
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,975
Slow down a little.

251
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,892
It's tied down. It's okay.

252
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,978
It's getting so close.

253
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,271
It's touching them.

254
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,064
Stick to your left as much as possible.

255
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,066
Stick to your left as much as possible.

256
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,152
OH, NO! THAT'S YOUR RIGHT!

257
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,783
Dex, not that way.

258
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,451
-To the left.
-Yes, your left.

259
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:43,332
GOOD AS DEAD IF THEY ENCOUNTER
A ZOMBIE IN THE DARKNESS

260
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,667
It's okay.

261
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,463
THEY CAN'T EVEN SEE
THE ZOMBIE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM

262
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
-It's okay.
-It must be really dark.

263
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,217
Dex, there's a woman zombie
right in front of you.

264
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,552
You need to crawl.

265
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,803
You need to crawl.

266
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,265
NAVIGATE THROUGH THE DARKNESS WITH
PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS AND STRICT EXECUTION

267
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,143
All right, get down.

268
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,815
Crawl to the right. That's right.

269
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,984
-Yes, keep going in that direction.
-That's right. Keep going.

270
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,445
-Everyone needs to crawl.
-Follow each other.

271
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,113
Follow right behind, like you're tailing.

272
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,781
To the right. Stay low.

273
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,618
THE ZOMBIES ARE INSENSITIVE TO SOUND!
JUST DON'T BUMP INTO THEM, AND YOU'RE SAFE

274
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,249
We're halfway there now. Be careful.

275
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,584
SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THROUGH
THE FIRST DANGER ZONE

276
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,419
Wait, stop there.

277
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,964
Dex, you have to head
to the right from there.

278
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,930
-Watch your head.
-Up there!

279
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,641
Crouch.

280
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,892
Everyone, stay low.

281
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,103
Okay.

282
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,814
-Crawl as low as you can.
-Don't stand.

283
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,650
Don't stand up. Keep crawling.

284
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,486
Watch out above you.

285
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,403
There's a zombie there.

286
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,990
Second to last, crawl.

287
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,825
-We have to crawl.
-Second to last, crawl.

288
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,452
Everyone, sit down.

289
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,579
A zombie's hand is above us.

290
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,750
Shoot.

291
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,460
Watch out!

292
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,254
ZOMBIES MIGHT APPEAR
IN THE CCTV BLIND SPOTS

293
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,506
Watch out!

294
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,008
There's one down there too. Oh, no!

295
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,927
Let's go. Move forward.

296
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,516
To the right.

297
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,518
Now, let's go together.

298
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,686
No!

299
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,316
It's okay!

300
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,694
-He's bitten!
-He's bitten!

301
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,864
I told you to stay low.

302
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,867
THIS WILL HAPPEN
IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS

303
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,705
-Calm down.
-Hold on.

304
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,541
Will this person turn into a zombie too?

305
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,584
-That's right.
-There will be more zombies!

306
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,044
It'll take some time before they do.

307
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,630
Zombie.

308
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,592
I told you, we have to stay down.

309
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,137
It's okay. Hang on tight.

310
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,555
Hang on tight.

311
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,891
Sae-ho, there are zombies up ahead.

312
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,976
Be careful. Zombies ahead.

313
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,394
-You have to stay down.
-Stay down.

314
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,854
Get down!

315
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,230
-They're here.
-Right here.

316
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,524
ARRIVED AT THE NARROW PATH
GUARDED BY A ZOMBIE

317
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,109
-Can you crawl to the left?
-Dex, to the left.

318
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,193
Crawl, just crawl.

319
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,486
Crawl. Stay down.

320
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,947
Now, watch your feet.

321
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,158
Crawl ahead.

322
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,412
DANGER! THERE'S A ZOMBIE IN THE BLIND SPOT

323
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,955
Crawl ahead.

324
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,417
A LITTLE FARTHER
AND THEY'LL BE AT RISK OF GETTING BITTEN

325
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,255
Dex, go straight ahead!

326
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,673
Wait, hold on, Dex.

327
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,885
Dex, there's a zombie to your left.

328
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,886
My left?

329
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,347
You have to stick to your right now.

330
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,640
PHEW! SI-YOUNG TO THE RESCUE

331
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,228
Dex, stick a little more.
Good job. That's it.

332
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,025
COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH THE PERSON IN FRONT

333
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,779
Oh, no!

334
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,534
We have to keep going.

335
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,662
ALTHOUGH NOT VISIBLE,
THERE'S AN EXIT RIGHT AHEAD

336
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,706
Watch your head.

337
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,041
What's that zombie doing?

338
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,013
It came down!

339
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,973
Right ahead… Go.

340
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,350
Everyone, get out first.

341
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,060
Go!

342
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,645
Hurry up!

343
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
Close the door.

344
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,403
Where's everyone in the middle?

345
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,072
They're dead!

346
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,615
Why didn't they duck down?

347
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,995
Block it!

348
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,082
Don't worry. It's okay.

349
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,125
But…

350
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,962
We've arrived, but two people…

351
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,089
They were bitten.

352
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,264
Make sure to hold on
to each other's shoulders tightly.

353
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,224
When you're laying low,

354
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,601
follow the footsteps of the person
in front and keep moving forward.

355
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,811
Okay.

356
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,355
I want to be at the front.

357
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,356
I'll be at the front.

358
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,149
THE EVACUEES ARE STARTING TO PANIC

359
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,527
Why don't we let
the injured ones go first?

360
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,654
No, wait.
It's not about who's going ahead.

361
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,281
It's blocked here.

362
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,949
-So stay calm.
-Then you need to explain clearly.

363
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,576
Yes, we will.

364
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,370
If the number of zombies
keep increasing like this…

365
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,123
It'll be advantageous to go first.

366
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,040
Go first?

367
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,834
HE REALLY NEEDS TO READ THE ROOM

368
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,295
Seriously, I can't see anything.

369
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,379
I can't see a single thing.

370
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,589
It was a close call earlier.

371
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,966
There was a zombie on my left
and I didn't know.

372
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,927
After you passed by,
their feet started moving.

373
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,804
I freaked out.

374
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,475
Listen up. If we don't hurry, those who
have been bitten will turn into zombies!

375
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,186
The number of zombies will increase.

376
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,605
THIS SEMI-ZOMBIE NEEDS TO SHUT UP!

377
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,522
-Let's go.
-Come on.

378
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
Now, everyone.

379
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,191
The longer this drags on,
the more we lose.

380
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,568
-Hang on properly.
-Okay.

381
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,569
Let's do this!

382
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,612
We're going in.

383
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,324
CODE KUNST AND TAEYEON LEAD THE WAY
WHILE HONG-CHUL AND SI-YOUNG STAY BEHIND

384
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,868
Oh, dear.

385
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,580
We'll walk by the left.

386
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,214
Close the door.

387
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,219
I can't see. What do we do?

388
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,472
It's darker than I expected.

389
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,438
You're almost at the corner now.

390
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,857
You need to stick to the left
and avoid the boxes.

391
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,735
You need to stick to the left
and avoid the boxes.

392
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,028
Avoid the boxes.

393
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,407
THE PACE OF THE LINE ISN'T QUICK ENOUGH

394
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,955
-The zombie!
-No, it's tied down.

395
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,122
You need to get through quickly.

396
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,920
Get through it quickly!

397
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,046
Hurry and get going.

398
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,090
The people back there need to hurry up.

399
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,133
Get through it quickly!

400
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,512
THEY WENT COMPLETELY
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

401
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,475
RIGHT FROM THE START, TWO PEOPLE ARE OUT

402
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,518
That person…

403
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,063
Get through it quickly.

404
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,277
You know, right?
After the boxes, you need to cross over.

405
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,281
Cross over to the right corner.

406
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,659
Okay, good job.

407
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,495
Hurry! Get going!

408
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,122
Wait, the back hasn't caught up yet.

409
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,249
ONE EVACUEE HAS FALLEN BEHIND

410
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,756
WEAK EVACUEES ARE BEING CAUGHT HELPLESSLY!

411
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,843
Is everyone getting bitten on the way?

412
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,560
THREE PEOPLE WHO FAILED TO KEEP UP
WITH THE LINE MET A TRAGIC END

413
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,813
Move forward and turn right from there.

414
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,440
You need to go straight ahead.

415
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
Isn't there someone
on the ground to the right?

416
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,902
DEAD EVACUEE ON THE RIGHT

417
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,363
HIDDEN ZOMBIE ON THE LEFT

418
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,448
To the right?

419
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,660
HIDDEN SPOT WHERE
THE ZOMBIE ISN'T VISIBLE ON CCTV

420
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,837
SUCCESSFULLY FENDED OFF
A ZOMBIE ATTACK IN THE DARKNESS

421
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,173
TAEYEON, move to the left and avoid it.

422
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,097
Be careful. Stick close.

423
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,099
You need to duck here.

424
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,476
There's a zombie above you.

425
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,813
THE AREA WHERE THE FIRST VICTIM WAS TAKEN
BY THE ZOMBIE FROM ABOVE

426
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,319
BACK TO LOW CRAWLING LONG AFTER
BEING DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY

427
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,987
To the right? Or the left?

428
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,905
It's blocked.

429
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,822
REACHED A DEAD END

430
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,783
I'm sorry. I can't see right now.

431
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,244
THE BLIND SPOTS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO GIVE DIRECTIONS

432
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,081
Hey, go! Code Kunst, move!

433
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,123
Move!

434
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,918
Go right, turn left and move forward.

435
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,837
If you're on the right,
turn left and move forward.

436
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,303
SAFELY MAKING THEIR WAY
OUT OF THE BLIND SPOT

437
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,596
So, move forward?

438
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,389
They're out. Over here.

439
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,516
Yes!

440
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,267
REACHED THE TRICKY AREA
WHERE THE SECOND VICTIM FELL

441
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,936
Straight forward.

442
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,145
Okay, I got it.

443
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,065
THE AREA WHERE DEX ALMOST GOT KILLED

444
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,034
Code Kunst, once you get here,
you just need to move quickly.

445
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,620
Get on the floor.

446
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,252
-Oh, hey!
-Go!

447
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,211
No, don't…

448
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,885
CODE KUNST BOLDLY GOES BACK
TO RESCUE THE EVACUEES

449
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,886
Oh, hold on.

450
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,472
The person who stopped halfway,
stay right there. Good job.

451
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,560
Is someone behind us?

452
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,353
TAEYEON GOT LEFT BEHIND ALONE

453
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,314
The line got cut off. You need to…

454
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,567
Who's here now?

455
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,484
Me? Yes?

456
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,319
-Who's this?
-Me?

457
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,196
Is TAEYEON back there?

458
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,239
Yes.

459
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,448
Now.

460
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,449
You can be quick.

461
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,285
You don't need to crawl.

462
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,413
ONE WRONG MOVE, AND YOU'RE ZOMBIE FOOD

463
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,340
TURNED ON THE LIGHT BRIEFLY
TO LOCATE THE ZOMBIE

464
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,676
-Okay. She's here.
-I'm here.

465
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,137
Oh, good job!

466
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,722
TAEYEON HAS GROWN A LOT IN JUST A FEW DAYS

467
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,265
TAEYEON is really quick.

468
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,474
Is this funny to you?

469
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,978
-What?
-Do you find this situation funny?

470
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,731
It's kind of funny
when you look at it from here.

471
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,274
They can escape if they sprint.

472
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,859
ONE LAST STEP TO THE EXIT

473
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,902
Head to the door.

474
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,572
Now, let's crawl.

475
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,160
Crawl over and stay low.

476
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,289
One at a time. Run.

477
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,000
Behind you.

478
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,811
GRABBED BY THE LEG AND TOOK A HARD FALL

479
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,863
Get out!

480
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,745
SECOND COLLISION WITH THE EVACUEE

481
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,210
Let's go!

482
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,338
-Are you okay?
-Were you bitten?

483
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,258
-Are you okay?
-I think she's injured.

484
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,844
Was she bitten?

485
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,432
Are you alone?

486
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,642
No, I'm with my siblings here.

487
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,227
MEANWHILE, DEFCONN IS
ON THE MOVE WITH 14 OTHERS

488
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,484
-What?
-Someone is mopping the floor over there.

489
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,029
Hush.

490
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,741
-They're zombies.
-Are they cleaning?

491
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,243
No, they're zombies.

492
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,662
They're zombies! Hush!

493
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,208
UNDERGROUND PASSAGE: MAINTENANCE ZONE

494
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,466
Don't make any noise.

495
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,226
We have to cut through here, right?

496
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,602
Yes, we have to go this way.

497
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:57,441
THEY MUST PASS THROUGH THIS AREA
TO REACH THE SUBWAY PLATFORM

498
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,734
Should we just run?

499
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,235
Running is out of the question.

500
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,029
-We have injured people.
-There are so many of them.

501
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,530
Running might be too much for everyone.

502
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,117
WEARY AND FRAIL EVACUEES CAN'T RUN
THROUGH A CROWD OF ZOMBIES

503
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,910
Should I go first?

504
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,828
-You?
-Yes.

505
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,788
Let's check it out first.

506
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,248
-So Eun-bi will go first?
-But…

507
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,626
Try walking over,
and if it doesn't seem safe, come back.

508
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,586
Go and check it out.

509
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,296
She used to run track.

510
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,213
-Really?
-Yes.

511
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,673
She used to sprint.

512
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,842
What is she thinking?

513
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,427
-What's she doing?
-Go check it out.

514
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,596
-Just go ahead a little.
-It's right in front of her.

515
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,105
THE ZOMBIES LIVED UNDERGROUND
FOR A LONG TIME,

516
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,523
SO THEY HAVE IMPARIED VISION AND HEARING

517
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,959
WHAT A RUN! LIKE A TRUE SPRINTER!

518
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,797
THE ZOMBIES HAVE AWAKENED
AFTER SENSING A SUDDEN MOVEMENT!

519
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,382
I'm scared!

520
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,843
I'm okay!

521
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,303
Great!

522
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,596
-I'm okay!
-Nice!

523
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,140
THE ZOMBIES ARE AWAKE,
BUT AT LEAST SHE MADE IT!

524
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,475
You saw that, right?

525
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,477
You just need to run like Eun-bi.

526
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,187
How are we supposed to run?

527
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,855
-There are so many zombies!
-Hush!

528
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,483
-That's insane.
-Decibel down!

529
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,528
Just think of another way!

530
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,696
It might be hard
for everyone to run through.

531
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,658
We can't get through.
On foot is impossible.

532
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,911
THEY MUST FIND A WAY TO ESCORT
THE FEARFUL AND COMPLAINING EVACUEES

533
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,538
Do we need to carry them across?

534
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,838
From what I see,

535
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,798
this must've been a cleaning area.

536
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,259
That's why there are trash bins
here and there.

537
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,426
They have wheels on it.

538
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,720
-Let's put them in here and…
-Push them one by one.

539
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,930
That sounds like a better plan.

540
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,348
A PLAN TO USE THE TRASH BINS
FOR THE ESCORT MISSION

541
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,350
But the problem is, if we use this,

542
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,852
someone has to pull the bin.

543
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,145
No, we can push them.

544
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,772
After they get in, we can control it
and push it over there.

545
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,400
Eun-bi is there to catch it, right?

546
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,735
Wait, sit in here.

547
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,945
Get in.

548
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,613
Okay, get on it.

549
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,241
-Check the wheels.
-Now, here…

550
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,701
-Get in closer.
-It seems to be working.

551
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,164
It goes in a straight line.

552
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,916
It's downhill,
so we don't have to push too hard.

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,334
Yes, we can all live.

554
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,044
A GOOD PLAN THAT PUTS THE EVACUEES AT EASE

555
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,462
Then, I'll go first.

556
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,840
-Stay safe.
-Be careful.

557
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,550
I'll catch you.

558
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,597
Have you tried curling?

559
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,848
Curling? No, I haven't.

560
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,600
We just need to push it properly.

561
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,019
OH! IT'S SIMILAR TO CURLING

562
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,192
EVEN AFTER DEATH, THE ZOMBIES
ARE UNABLE TO LET GO OF THEIR BROOMS

563
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,571
THEY MUST AVOID THE BROOMS
AND PUSH IT PRECISELY

564
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,033
THE PERFECT ANGLE WITH
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF POWER IS NEEDED

565
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,912
CURLING OF DEATH:
PUSH THE EVACUEES TO THE EXIT

566
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,663
Let's go!

567
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,040
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 1

568
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,416
LEAD: DEFCONN
SECOND: JUSTIN HARVEY

569
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,334
I'll just go for it.

570
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,501
-Let's go.
-Okay.

571
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,295
Now, stay calm.

572
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,631
We'll make sure to get you out safely.

573
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,926
THE KEY IS TO PUSH ACCURATELY
WHILE AVOIDING THE ZOMBIES

574
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,344
Now, let's go. One…

575
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,353
PERFECT ANGLE!

576
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,188
PERFECT POWER!

577
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,315
PERFECT POWER & ANGLE!

578
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,777
It worked!

579
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,658
It worked!

580
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,327
It's working!

581
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,334
SCORED! I MEAN, SUCCESS IN ONE GO!

582
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,213
See? We got this.

583
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,342
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 1

584
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,135
Oh, thank you!

585
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,595
We did it.

586
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,097
Good job. Come on down.

587
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,766
I'll go over and help out.

588
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,018
-We need one more person, right?
-It'll be difficult alone.

589
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,187
I agree. Eun-bi is too weak.

590
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,689
I'll help out Eun-bi.

591
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,732
Oh, shoot.

592
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,610
THE EASILY SCARED 29-YEAR-OLD MAN
WHO COMPLETED HIS SERVICE

593
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:15,365
FINALLY LEVELED UP

594
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,789
RAN AT A SPEED THAT
THE ZOMBIES COULDN'T EVEN REGISTER

595
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,252
Oh, that was good.

596
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,713
That's the quickest way to get there.

597
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,673
If this falls, it could be dangerous.

598
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,509
We definitely can't do that.

599
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,636
CAN'T PERSUADE THE STUBBORN ONES

600
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,555
What do I do? I can't go!

601
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,974
It'll be better
for the men to just run there.

602
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,726
Why don't all the men just run?

603
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,728
-What if they get caught?
-Hey!

604
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,729
Our life depends on this.

605
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,856
Let's take our time and use this instead.

606
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,733
THEY'RE LIKE THOSE BURDENSOME
EVACUEES YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES

607
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,741
AFTER LEVELING UP,
HE EXCELS IN EVERY SITUATION

608
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,075
Unbelievable.

609
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,952
When pushing straight,
it shifts to the right.

610
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,746
The left side is elevated.

611
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,080
Push it slightly to the left.

612
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,957
A THOROUGH ANALYSIS
IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS

613
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,916
DinDin!

614
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,586
If they stop in the middle,
tell them to get out and run in.

615
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,546
We should move the boxes over there.

616
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,797
Which year were you born?

617
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,215
-Oh, 1988.
-I see.

618
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,175
You lived long enough.

619
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,217
BORN IN 1988 MEANS YOU LIVED LONG ENOUGH

620
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,428
She's got plenty of years left to live!

621
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,055
Now, get ready.

622
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,765
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 2

623
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,808
It's moving the boxes!

624
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,061
One, two…

625
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:26,978
Now.

626
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,694
You catch it first.

627
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,531
CAUGHT BY THE ZOMBIE'S MOPPING!

628
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,662
Shoot!

629
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,416
FAST DELIVERY FOOD HAS ARRIVED

630
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,983
How do we get across that?

631
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,152
I can't do that!

632
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:20,448
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 2

633
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,743
-What do we do?
-No, listen up…

634
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,996
Let's stay calm
because we didn't do that on purpose.

635
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,707
-Right now, it's fifty-fifty.
-I'm scared.

636
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,918
At this point, what can we do?
It's do or die now.

637
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,253
We can't go back now.

638
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,170
We need to move forward.

639
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,880
DEFCONN'S SPEECH
ENCOURAGES THEM TO TRY AGAIN!

640
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,173
-I'll go next.
-We have to go.

641
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,717
Are you going to be okay?

642
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,635
No.

643
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,221
If you go now,
you might still catch your sister.

644
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,347
So let's send her quickly.

645
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,057
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THAT

646
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,058
I mean, who knows?

647
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,687
Even if you're in a dangerous situation,
you can survive if you stay alert.

648
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,106
Justin will take care of you.

649
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,233
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 3
SECOND: JUSTIN HARVEY

650
00:28:55,316 --> 00:29:00,238
SHOWS OFF STRENGTH 100 TIMES
THAT OF AN AVERAGE PERSON

651
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,282
Not now. They are all gathered.

652
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,249
Okay, now!

653
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,167
Push hard!

654
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,752
Please!

655
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,711
Okay, now!

656
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,004
Push hard!

657
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,215
Darn!

658
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,600
ENDED UP NEXT TO HER SISTER

659
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,768
What have you done?

660
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,021
JUSTIN'S TRUSTED PHYSICAL STRENGTH
LET THEM DOWN

661
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,147
Darn it!

662
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,982
What have you done?

663
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,279
I'm scared!

664
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,074
No, but she said she wanted
to see her sister anyway.

665
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,034
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

666
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,368
Then, it can't be helped, can it?

667
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,663
Darn! What are they on about?

668
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:56,252
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 3

669
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,004
BUT THEY CAN'T STOP NOW!

670
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,547
Be careful!

671
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,674
Look at that zombie. It looks so gross!

672
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,426
It's horrifying!

673
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,013
SINCE JUSTIN FAILED, LEAD DEFCONN STEPS UP

674
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,307
You need to push it to the left
with a little bit of side spin.

675
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,893
From the bottom!

676
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,312
Sung-jae says
you should push from the bottom.

677
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,439
Like pushing the cart…

678
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,732
But that will…

679
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,734
OVER AND UNDER COMBO GRIP

680
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,528
A GRIP WITH NO PROPER FORM,
HOLDING BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM

681
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,987
FIRST USED BY DEFCONN IN 2024

682
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,991
EVEN DICK FOSBURY'S HIGH JUMP
TECHNIQUE WAS LAUGHED AT INITIALLY

683
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,911
THIS IS HOW HISTORY IS MADE!

684
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,621
Now's the time!

685
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,539
Let's do it now!

686
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:37,001
With more power!

687
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,047
Oh, no!

688
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,260
What was that?

689
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,637
THE SPIN WAS TOO STRONG

690
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,721
What was that?

691
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,977
Oh, no!

692
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,982
Sorry!

693
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,942
THE EVACUEE'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE…

694
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,943
It just turned. Damn…

695
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,445
-What the hell? What's he doing?
-He abandoned them.

696
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,408
Or…

697
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,493
Do you want to quickly get on right now?

698
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,619
PATH IS WIDE OPEN AS THEY'RE BUSY EATING

699
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,746
It's open right now!

700
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,873
You have to do it now.

701
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,875
-We need to go now. Get on.
-Go right now.

702
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,792
We have to make this work.

703
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,252
-Make it work no matter what.
-It's okay.

704
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,920
-Now!
-Push it hard!

705
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,341
One, two, three! Let go!

706
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,014
THE ANGLE AND POWER WERE SPOT ON!

707
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,223
Nice!

708
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,394
THE DEAD SISTERS TOOK THEIR REVENGE

709
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,979
Shoot! It got caught!

710
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,572
What do we do? Is there another way?

711
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,531
I'm sorry!

712
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,782
What are we going to do?

713
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,035
What should we do?

714
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,453
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 5

715
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,039
I don't think even half of us
will make it out alive.

716
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,709
DEFCONN AND HIS CREW'S
ESCORT MISSION IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY

717
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,461
Are you okay?

718
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,841
-Is that TAEYEON?
-Yes.

719
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,802
I'm okay.

720
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,012
-TAEYEON, are you okay?
-Yes.

721
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,263
She's okay!

722
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,475
PHEW! SHE WAS GRABBED
BUT LUCKILY NOT BITTEN

723
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,644
That was terrifying.

724
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,438
Hold on.

725
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,107
Honestly, I'm already scared.

726
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,611
ONLY TWO PEOPLE ARE LEFT

727
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,404
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO MONITOR THE CCTV

728
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,322
Hold on.

729
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,367
Just think of it as walking
with your eyes closed.

730
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,578
To be honest, it makes sense
for Hong-chul to be the last one to stay.

731
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,579
We don't have a choice.

732
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,247
But do you think he'll even come?

733
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,042
SI-YOUNG DECIDED TO STAY BEHIND
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE SEMI-ZOMBIE

734
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,585
How are you going to come?

735
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,671
If I keep giving instructions,
I can memorize the map.

736
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,714
Are you sure you can memorize it?

737
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,758
Let's just try it out first.

738
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,593
We go in.

739
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,553
We turn left when we reach the box.

740
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,514
Then go that way and turn right.

741
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,933
After turning,
there will be a dead person on the right.

742
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,059
Turn around the corner.

743
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,978
Why are my legs shaking?

744
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,145
Are you going to betray me?

745
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,355
Hong-chul.

746
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,691
Bite this.

747
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,234
Geez. Hey.

748
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,152
How can I bite this? I'm not a dog!

749
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,447
Biting this with my eye like this…

750
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,241
-I'll be okay.
-I'm so scared right now!

751
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,661
They don't react to sound. I think
it's better if you bite on it instead.

752
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,579
Don't act like it doesn't smell.

753
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,747
I can smell it from here.

754
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,332
Geez. It smells.

755
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,668
-You'd be the one screaming.
-Listen. I can't trust you.

756
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,211
But even if I scream…

757
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,258
TA-DA! HIS MOUTH AUTOMATICALLY OPENED

758
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,845
What are you trying to do?

759
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,888
THERE'S STILL ONE MORE THING LEFT?!

760
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
A PROP THAT WAS BROUGHT
ALONG FOR A MOMENT LIKE THIS

761
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,892
We can hit them with a belt.

762
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,519
There's a lot to collect.

763
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,312
A MUZZLE IS PERFECT FOR AN UNRULY ANIMAL

764
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,772
I'm so sorry, Hong-chul.

765
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,025
I'm so terrified.

766
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,277
I'm drooling!

767
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,154
-You're bleeding?
-No, I'm drooling.

768
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,407
HE NEEDS TO SPEAK IN HUMAN LANGUAGE

769
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,491
What are you saying?

770
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,035
I'm drooling!

771
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,494
-You're drooling?
-Yes.

772
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,746
Oh, you're drooling…

773
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,206
I'll let you go soon. I'm sorry.

774
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,292
I'm really sorry. I really am.

775
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,961
Si-young.

776
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,255
I'm heading out now.

777
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,799
There are two zombies
right outside the door.

778
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,301
That means you guys need to help out.

779
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,552
Do you understand?

780
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,262
We'll take care of this area. Don't worry.

781
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,014
Hong-chul, please just cooperate.

782
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,099
Got it. I trust you, guys.

783
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,225
You can do it. Be careful!

784
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,769
Let's go.

785
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,020
Okay.

786
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,605
Let's do this.

787
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,611
Be quiet.

788
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,697
Quiet down.

789
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,867
There's someone on the floor.

790
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,910
We'll see some people.

791
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,204
There will be two dead people.

792
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,538
They were bitten.

793
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,539
Oh, they're here!

794
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,792
Look out. Next to you.

795
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,419
The box.

796
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,837
We will reach a box.

797
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,589
Shift a little to the left.

798
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,007
Then follow the boxes and turn.

799
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,470
WOW! THEY'RE MOVING
EXACTLY AS SHE MEMORIZED

800
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,555
There will be a zombie on the left.

801
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,601
Come to my left.

802
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,436
ADJUSTS HER SHIELD ACCORDING
TO THE ZOMBIE'S LOCATION

803
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,687
There's a zombie on my left.

804
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,607
After the zombie on my left…

805
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,070
Left side. After that…

806
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,988
Be quiet. Then turn right…

807
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,158
WOW! SHE DOESN'T EVEN NEED
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

808
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,662
THEY HAVE REACHED THE AREA
WHERE A VICTIM PREVIOUSLY FELL

809
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,247
After sticking to the right,

810
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,249
there's a dead person
at the right side on the floor.

811
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,087
Dead person on the right.

812
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,425
THEY'LL PASS THROUGH
WITH EASE IF THEY KEEP IT UP!

813
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,058
-No way!
-What the heck?

814
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,519
No way!

815
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,478
What is going on?

816
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,773
THE LIGHTS ARE UNSTABLE!

817
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,527
THE ZOMBIES ARE STARTING TO GO CRAZY

818
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,613
Oh, shoot! Hurry up!

819
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,748
Hey! It's biting!

820
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,667
THE BIG DOG IS SHOWING HIS LOYALTY!

821
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,713
Let's hold them back.

822
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,510
Watch out!

823
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,265
-Hurry!
-Go!

824
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,391
Go!

825
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,895
Come in quickly!

826
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,646
Get in!

827
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,606
Okay.

828
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,358
Gosh. That was scary.

829
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,986
What happened? Why did the lights turn on?

830
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,321
-What?
-Are you okay?

831
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,238
Are you feeling okay?

832
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,574
Hey, I saved you
when the lights turned on.

833
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,034
Hold on, Hong-chul. Your glasses.

834
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,076
Oh, yes.

835
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,621
AT THE MOMENT OF CRISIS
WHEN THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY CAME ON,

836
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,625
HONG-CHUL BLOCKED
THE ZOMBIES OFF WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

837
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,919
-Hey, I saved your life.
-You guys made it out.

838
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,128
Let's untie this now.

839
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,088
Hey, Si-young. Let's untie this.

840
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,466
You trust me now, right? I saved her.

841
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,218
I saved her by blocking her
twice like this…

842
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,136
Thank you, really.

843
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,513
Let's get out of here first.

844
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,390
-You trust me now, okay?
-I'm sorry.

845
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,975
I'm sorry about the muzzle.

846
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,102
-Let's go.
-Let's head out first.

847
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,395
That really startled me.

848
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,069
Gosh!

849
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,612
You're a genius!

850
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,245
I feel like he'll get bitten.

851
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,413
Keep going. It's okay.

852
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,756
SMALL MOUSE WAS HIDING IN IT

853
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,466
DinDin, you're going to hurt your back.

854
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,260
-Nice try though.
-Wow, that was terrifying!

855
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,303
-Told you it's heavy.
-This is so scary!

856
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,763
TRIED TO PULL A TRICK
DURING THE CURLING GAME

857
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,973
It's scary because I can't see.

858
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,517
Wait, how about this?

859
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,519
What if we flip it over and then push?

860
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,273
-It works, right?
-The bin is really wobbly.

861
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,318
It's working.

862
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,487
Stay still!

863
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,948
-Is someone in there?
-Yes.

864
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,491
They're placed like this now.

865
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,495
5 MINUTES AGO
5 EVACUEES WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT ACROSS

866
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,579
Now!

867
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,665
Push it hard until the end!

868
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,166
We got it.

869
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,836
It's working.

870
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,380
THEY ARE SETTING UP GUARDS
LIKE ACTUAL CURLING

871
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,424
Just go, Justin. You can do it!

872
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,472
Run! Hurry!

873
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,975
Not yet! Don't run yet!

874
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,227
DANGER! MISCOMMUNICATION

875
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,687
At least he closed the lid.

876
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,441
Even though Justin pushes it hard,
it doesn't reach the end.

877
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,901
GIVEN UP SENDING THEM IN ONE GO

878
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,987
NOW THEY ARE POSITIONING THEM
NEAR THE EXIT

879
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,406
Wait, we messed up.

880
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,367
Hold on to it to keep it closed!

881
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,954
Run! Oh, no!

882
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,750
Why did he have to run to the corner?

883
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,127
THIS DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE
A PERFECT PLAN EITHER

884
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,212
Get in there quickly. Separate the boxes!

885
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,297
The blue bin!

886
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,842
-Look at Justin!
-It's coming!

887
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,344
It's coming.

888
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,096
-We saved two people.
-Really? They made it out alive?

889
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,181
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 8

890
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,641
He was in there for too long.

891
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,643
How many of us are dead?

892
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,979
Five are dead.

893
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,397
Let's just think about the ones we saved.

894
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,732
GOOD VIBES ONLY FOR DEFCONN

895
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,442
-Let's think about them.
-We didn't do that bad.

896
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,777
Please take good care of me.

897
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,362
-My life depends on this.
-Ma'am.

898
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,404
Take care of me.

899
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,989
People like you end up living long lives.

900
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,199
-So don't worry.
-Thank you.

901
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,951
What are you planning to do
by keeping the zombies around?

902
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,287
NEXT UP IS SOMEONE WHO MADE IT THIS FAR
WITH A STRONG WILL TO LIVE

903
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,748
Please help us. Take us!

904
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,334
God, Buddha, Jesus, please save me.

905
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,378
BUSY PRAYING EVEN INSIDE THE BIN

906
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,545
Oh, this slides pretty well.

907
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,631
-Do it properly.
-I'll push it to the left.

908
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,258
Don't get out if it stops in the middle.

909
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,224
THE DIRECTION…WHAT'S GOING ON?

910
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,183
Oh, shoot!

911
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,268
Darn!

912
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,520
Do you think it's that easy?

913
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,604
It doesn't slide.

914
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,605
To the left…

915
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,318
You dumped it over there!

916
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,740
Push it over now!

917
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,450
-Now's the time!
-Let's go.

918
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,831
HARDEST PUSH THEY'VE DONE SO FAR!

919
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,583
POWER CRITICAL!

920
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,970
-It worked!
-Nice!

921
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,806
JUSTIN'S PHYSICAL STRENGTH
FINALLY PULLED THROUGH

922
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,851
-Are you okay?
-I'm alive?

923
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,061
-Oh, gosh.
-You're alive.

924
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,355
She's going to survive
no matter what happens.

925
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,816
CHARACTERS LIKE HER NEVER DIE!

926
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,277
Oh, thank you!

927
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,906
For the last one, all three of us
should run when the path is open.

928
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,116
With him on board.

929
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,160
-Run while pushing him?
-Yes.

930
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,245
But one of us might not make it.

931
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,498
PUSH AND RUN STRATEGY
WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT GET CAUGHT

932
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,004
Can you do me a favor and hold onto this?

933
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,089
It might work as a protective gear.

934
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,467
It's actually Hong-chul's feed.

935
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,594
Okay, I'm ready.

936
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,511
What's your name?

937
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,180
-I'm Tae-hyeon.
-Tae-hyeon?

938
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,931
Do you want to leave
a video message for your parents?

939
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,433
TSK! YOU'RE NOT HOSTING A VARIETY SHOW

940
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,310
-You're going to save me, right?
-Of course.

941
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,853
If you fall, just run.

942
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,855
-Just in case.
-If you fall.

943
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,523
Let's save him!

944
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,278
Let's save him!

945
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,831
FAILED TO CHANGE DIRECTION

946
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,337
SHOULD HAVE LEFT THAT VIDEO MESSAGE…

947
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,759
What do we do?

948
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,676
Oh, Tae-hyeon!

949
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,844
Tae-hyeon, run!

950
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,888
Run!

951
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,015
He's bitten!

952
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,434
I'm so sorry, Tae-hyeon.

953
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,854
He died while hugging the snack.

954
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,651
ZOMBIEVERSE HUMAN CURLING, END 10

955
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,821
DEFCONN'S TEAM HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY DEFEATED

956
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,907
Do we go straight ahead?

957
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,076
Hang in there.

958
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,623
THE EVACUEES WHO MADE IT THROUGH
THE CURLING HELL ARE UNWELL

959
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,582
-Are you okay?
-Are you good?

960
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,335
Wait, a zombie!

961
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,966
UNDERGROUND PASSAGE:
MYSTERIOUS ONE-WAY ROUTE

962
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,136
Get up! Hurry!

963
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,137
-To the right!
-Hurry!

964
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,055
Hurry! Over here!

965
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,223
-Get in first!
-Get in!

966
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,432
Over here!

967
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,475
In here!

968
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,394
Slowly!

969
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,728
Watch your leg!

970
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,398
ENDED UP ESCAPING TO A DEAD END

971
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,037
Where are they going?

972
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,455
-What?
-They're just passing by.

973
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,083
They're moving in a single file.

974
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,335
It looks like a Spanish bull run.

975
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,713
The zombies are acting weird.

976
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,384
ALL THE ZOMBIES ARE WALKING
WHILE STARING AT THE GROUND

977
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,594
-What?
-They're not looking.

978
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,054
They can't see. They're walking like this.

979
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,764
-Are they just following the line?
-Yes.

980
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,684
It looks like they're just
following the color of the line.

981
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:29,231
THE ZOMBIES ARE FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE
LINES AND MOVING IN AN ORDERLY FASHION

982
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,441
MINDLESS ONE-WAY ZOMBIES

983
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,443
THEY ONLY FOLLOW THE LINES
DUE TO THEIR DETERIORATED VISION

984
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,361
AND THEY ATTACK IF THEIR PATH IS BLOCKED

985
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,239
If the zombies approach,
we just avoid them by moving to the side.

986
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,699
To a different colored line?

987
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,243
Yes. They can't see us anyways.
They're only looking at the floor.

988
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,911
But we'll get bitten if we bump into them.

989
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,080
I'll give it a go to see what it's like.

990
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,707
THE NEW BRAVE SUNG-JAE STEPS UP

991
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,791
Look.

992
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,670
SCARED?

993
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,005
Just stand like this.

994
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,465
Then like this.

995
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,966
Move to the side.

996
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,720
OH! IT'S LIKE A GAME

997
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,473
To the other side.

998
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,516
That's not bad.

999
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,226
You just need to move forward like this.

1000
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,606
-That looks doable.
-Follow the green line.

1001
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,275
Switch to the red. Then back to the green.

1002
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,527
I'm too tired. I can't walk anymore.

1003
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,447
EMERGENCY! THE EVACUEES
ARE ACTING UP AGAIN

1004
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,740
Are you sure you can't walk?

1005
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,534
Seriously. How are they all unable
to walk? Like it's been planned.

1006
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,120
I MEAN… THEY MUST'VE PLANNED
THIS WITH SOMEONE!

1007
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,372
Look. It's a wagon.

1008
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,624
WAGONS READY AND WAITING LIKE
THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT

1009
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,501
I'll take care of her.

1010
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,586
As for the men, let's just run.

1011
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,505
Apparently, he just broke his leg.

1012
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,219
Wait, aren't you the one
who sprinted out of the bin?

1013
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,514
Maybe he has osteoporosis
from not eating enough.

1014
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,391
RIDICULOUS!
BUT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO

1015
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,394
Hey, guys. We've already lost
so many people.

1016
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,062
So we have to do whatever we can…

1017
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:50,979
Yes, we should…

1018
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,148
We'll do our best to stick together.

1019
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,150
We should each take responsibility
for one person.

1020
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,070
Shoot! Why are you so heavy?

1021
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,071
I'm not heavy.

1022
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,490
You're weaker than you look.

1023
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,784
Let's go.

1024
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,786
Let's save them!

1025
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,914
Eun-bi, lead the way
by calling out red or green.

1026
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,332
Okay!

1027
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,417
Listen up!

1028
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,668
They're coming!

1029
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,045
-They're coming!
-They're here.

1030
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,755
They're here.

1031
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:23,095
ONE-WAY ROUTE OF DEATH: TAKE THE EVACUEES
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

1032
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,596
They're here.

1033
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,934
Guys, follow the red line!

1034
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:30,853
The red line!

1035
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,856
Green line!

1036
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,732
Green line!

1037
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,113
This is harder than I thought.

1038
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,911
Red!

1039
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,496
Green!

1040
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,168
Red!

1041
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,379
LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE IT!

1042
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,757
Red!

1043
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,303
THEY HAVE REACHED A CHALLENGING SECTION,
A SHARP TURN IS NEEDED

1044
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,806
LITTLE TIME TO REACT
SINCE IT'S A CURVED PATH

1045
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,810
It's hard to change directions.

1046
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,521
Guys! Green! Red!

1047
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,857
Green!

1048
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,282
TERRIBLY SLOW AT CHANGING DIRECTIONS

1049
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,377
I'm so sorry!

1050
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,671
Sorry! I'm so sorry!

1051
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,340
I'm sorry!

1052
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,549
SO MUCH FOR LEVELED UP SUNG-JAE

1053
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,718
I'm sorry!

1054
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,514
HER WILL TO LIVE BURNS
EVEN STRONGER AS SHE WITNESSES DEATH

1055
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,974
This is tiring! What's wrong with this?

1056
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,310
Darn!

1057
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,108
THE EVACUEE SUNG-JAE
ABANDONED IS BLOCKING THE PATH

1058
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,077
People like you end up living long lives.

1059
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,078
So don't worry.

1060
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,541
Shoot! No!

1061
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,751
SEEMS LIKE SHE'S NOT GOING TO LIVE LONG

1062
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,587
I'm sorry!

1063
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,423
HER LUCK RAN OUT

1064
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,967
I'm sorry!

1065
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,761
I'm so sorry!

1066
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,972
-Sorry!
-What happened?

1067
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,225
Hold on!

1068
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,643
Here! Shoot!

1069
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,020
Let's at least save this person.

1070
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,065
DANGER! JUSTIN IS STILL AT THE BACK

1071
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,738
Green!

1072
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,448
Red!

1073
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,410
THE FINISH LINE IS FINALLY IN SIGHT

1074
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,912
We're almost there!

1075
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,999
We're here!

1076
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,293
EVERYONE MADE IT THROUGH SAFELY
EXCEPT FOR JUSTIN

1077
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:09,803
Oh, no!

1078
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,430
-Justin!
-What do we do?

1079
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,938
THE FIRST TWO LEFT THE EVACUEES BEHIND

1080
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,360
And most importantly, I hate losing.

1081
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,739
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO BE TREATED
THE SAME AS THEM

1082
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,702
Hurry! Get back on!

1083
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,121
I can save you! Get back on!

1084
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,789
Harvey!

1085
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,667
Harvey!

1086
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,840
Harvey! This way!

1087
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,804
JUSTIN'S LAST BURST OF EFFORT
SAVED ONE MORE PERSON

1088
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,431
At least we saved two people.

1089
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,016
Damn…

1090
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,267
Let's go now.

1091
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,769
Let's head out quickly.

1092
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,520
Let's go before more zombies show up.

1093
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,230
-Okay.
-I can see the light!

1094
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,607
-Really? You see something?
-Yes!

1095
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,942
DEFCONN'S TEAM
TWO EVACUEES SURVIVED

1096
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,570
SI-YOUNG'S TEAM
FIVE EVACUEES SURVIVED

1097
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,821
Let's head out first.

1098
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,036
Where does this road end?

1099
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,289
We just need the subway to come now.

1100
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,918
But what if, after all this,
the subway doesn't show up?

1101
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,755
I'm starting to think maybe it won't
since it hasn't passed by yet.

1102
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,845
-Let's try going up.
-Okay.

1103
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,058
There's something romantic about this.

1104
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,604
My whole body hurts.

1105
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,439
These bright lights!

1106
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,823
SEOUL STATION

1107
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,081
-Is this the right way?
-Yes.

1108
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,624
It's the right way.

1109
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,543
Oh, yes! It's the platform.

1110
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,172
We're here.

1111
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,300
Oh, it really is the subway station.

1112
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,137
We're here.

1113
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,432
SUBWAY PLATFORM
SEOUL-BOUND

1114
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,891
Wow, it's been so long.

1115
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,769
Oh, you're here?

1116
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,188
You made it out.

1117
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,481
Wow, this is amazing!

1118
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,483
-Were you okay?
-Yes, we were fine.

1119
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,860
You're alive.

1120
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:30,986
Everyone's alive.

1121
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,488
-We survived.
-Everything seems to be running here.

1122
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,993
Many from your group made it out alive.

1123
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,077
But what happened to you guys?

1124
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,328
-What happened?
-It was tough for us.

1125
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,329
It really was…

1126
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,291
Something smells good.

1127
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,460
Oh, I smell something.

1128
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,462
I smell something here.

1129
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,338
There are some manjoos! From Deli Manjoo.

1130
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,673
I think it's a zombie.

1131
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,092
IT SEEMS THEY COLLAPSED WHILE EATING
THE SUBWAY STATION'S SIGNATURE SNACK

1132
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,177
No, he's just dead.

1133
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,554
Where's the manjoo?

1134
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,306
Dang!

1135
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,478
THE BIG DOG IS EYEING THE HUMAN'S FOOD

1136
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,562
Why are you eating that?

1137
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,814
Seriously, that guy will never change.

1138
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,649
-What are you doing?
-Just let him be.

1139
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,276
It tastes good. Not spoiled at all.

1140
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,277
It does look tasty.

1141
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,488
TAEYEON.

1142
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,240
Can we eat this? I'm hungry.

1143
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,575
Since this team didn't save many people,

1144
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,076
they can grab the ones on the ground.

1145
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,870
SI-YOUNG'S TEAM ENJOYS
A SMALL VICTORY PARTY

1146
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:26,208
How did you guys save so many people?

1147
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,542
Nothing special.

1148
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,836
Just that I saved Si-young.

1149
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,338
-What?
-Really?

1150
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,549
Now that we've built some trust,
let's stop doing things like this, okay?

1151
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,510
Why are you bringing this up now?

1152
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,345
No, let's talk it out and untie this now.

1153
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,185
Don't you think it's okay now?

1154
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,978
-But just among us…
-You saw me earlier, right?

1155
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,438
It's not just us here though…

1156
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,065
Let's just untie this now.

1157
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,942
I'm worried they might get suspicious.

1158
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,152
Don't you think it'll be okay?
They'll get suspicious.

1159
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,403
Do you think he'll run away?

1160
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,155
Hong-chul, then promise me.

1161
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,865
Don't take off your glasses.

1162
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,700
-Okay. I won't.
-If you do, you'll be in danger.

1163
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,910
I won't take it off.

1164
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,453
Did anyone ask about him earlier?

1165
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,371
They did.

1166
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,872
We almost got caught in the end.

1167
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,249
Did they find out?

1168
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,458
Kind of.

1169
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,002
-Hey, I saved your life.
-You guys made it out.

1170
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,879
I saved you twice. Remember?

1171
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,298
Are you okay? Did you get bitten?

1172
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,383
Excuse me.

1173
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,426
Why didn't the zombies
try to bite Hong-chul?

1174
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,344
Oh, that's true.

1175
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,762
How did he make it without getting bitten?

1176
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,013
What?

1177
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,098
He didn't get bitten.

1178
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,225
THE SECRET HAS BEEN EXPOSED
DURING THE MISSION

1179
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,601
The muzzle was weird too.

1180
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,437
That's not important right now.

1181
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,814
We need to head out now.

1182
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,858
We have to meet up with the others.

1183
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,194
I think you're right.

1184
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,364
Look at the mark it left.

1185
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,867
-What? Why?
-No.

1186
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,243
-No.
-What are you doing?

1187
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,995
Why are you doing that?

1188
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,538
-His eyes look weird.
-But we did save you.

1189
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,747
I'm telling you, he's a zombie!

1190
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,957
He's not!

1191
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,542
He is! He's worth five billion won!

1192
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,710
No, he's not!

1193
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,589
Why are you doing this?
We survived together.

1194
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,594
No. He's not.

1195
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,429
-We definitely saw it.
-No.

1196
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,722
-We saw it.
-He's our teammate.

1197
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,764
No.

1198
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,602
No, he's not a zombie.

1199
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,271
Oh, the subway is here!

1200
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,315
It's here!

1201
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,566
The subway is here!

1202
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,650
Oh, what?

1203
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,737
We'll get on first.

1204
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,654
I'm speaking clearly too.

1205
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,740
Be quiet, Hong-chul.

1206
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,326
-Stay put. Don't get involved.
-Okay. They're talking about me.

1207
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,702
You saw it, right?

1208
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,203
Don't let them get on.

1209
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,122
-Stop them.
-I'm telling you, I'm right!

1210
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,498
Don't let them get on!

1211
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,126
He's worth five billion won!

1212
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,628
It's not him!

1213
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,713
-Oh, dear!
-Why?

1214
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,924
Hold on!

1215
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:39,883
It's not him!

1216
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,010
-Is it that serious?
-Five billion won!

1217
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,137
-That's not true!
-Five billion won!

1218
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,138
What do you mean?

1219
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,015
He's not worth five billion won!

1220
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,350
No!

1221
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,935
Why are you making us use force?

1222
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:51,853
It's done.

1223
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,396
Why can't you trust us? Geez.

1224
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,314
We don't have a choice.

1225
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,649
How can we go on together
when the trust is broken?

1226
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,566
Ro Hong-chul!

1227
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,735
I told you to stay quiet.

1228
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,236
Geez, Ro Hong-chul.

1229
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,446
There were too many people.

1230
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,158
What do we do with them?

1231
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,618
They can catch the next one.

1232
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,750
I'm really upset about this.
We saved them by risking our lives.

1233
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,669
That's true. I almost died for real.

1234
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,128
We were crawling
on the ground to save them.

1235
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,590
Just a minute ago, we saved their lives,
but now, they just want the money?

1236
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,800
Did they do that for the money?

1237
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,301
Or were they just scared
of getting bitten?

1238
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,470
-For the five billion won.
-For the money.

1239
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,806
But this is our five billion won,
not theirs.

1240
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:29,724
OUCH! HONG-CHUL IS RIGHT THERE!

1241
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,726
"But this is
our five billion won, not theirs?"

1242
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,895
But I'm really disappointed.

1243
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,065
They kept pushing for money,
I didn't know what to say.

1244
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,734
Is this train heading towards Seoul?

1245
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,652
I think so.

1246
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,780
-We should be fine since we're on board.
-Yes, I saw Yeongdeungpo earlier.

1247
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,991
I think we're almost there.

1248
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,369
-This train was urgently…
-Oh, I hear it.

1249
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,286
Oh, wait!

1250
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,414
…arranged to transport supplies
during the disaster.

1251
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,540
It's an emergency train.

1252
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,959
It will run express to downtown Seoul.

1253
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,919
Let me repeat.

1254
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,464
This train was urgently arranged
to transport supplies during the disaster.

1255
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,718
It will operate nonstop
to the center of Seoul.

1256
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,722
The journey to downtown Seoul is expected
to take approximately one hour.

1257
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,390
-One hour.
-One hour to downtown Seoul.

1258
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,434
So, we're heading there straight.

1259
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,812
There must be soldiers there
to guard the supplies, right?

1260
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:16,980
It'll be safe then.

1261
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,648
Can we take a little break on the way?

1262
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,858
I think we can take a break now.

1263
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,110
Now I feel like I can joke around a bit.

1264
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,323
And please, stop doubting me.

1265
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,034
Can we trust Hong-chul?

1266
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,661
This time, Hong-chul…

1267
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,620
-Did he help out a lot?
-Yes.

1268
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,497
-He earned our trust by…
-Let's trust him then.

1269
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,749
-I didn't see it myself.
-I saved her.

1270
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,250
-I put myself on the line.
-Okay.

1271
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,711
That's true. We have to admit what's true.

1272
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,297
Still, you can't let go of your doubts.

1273
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,923
You do that.

1274
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,342
Honestly, with Justin…

1275
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,260
He's one of us.

1276
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,054
-Really?
-Yes, we completely trust him.

1277
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,056
Trust him. His physical abilities
are amazing too.

1278
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,683
I told you, Justin is really trustworthy.

1279
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,726
Let's trust him.

1280
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,188
There are ten of us.
Then it's 500 million won each.

1281
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,272
-Out of nowhere?
-You…

1282
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,815
You said you weren't doing this
for the money.

1283
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,984
I'm not. It's just a calculation.

1284
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,779
Since he's with us now.

1285
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,405
He's getting a cut too?

1286
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,698
Justin isn't aware of this.

1287
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,535
JUSTIN IS PROBABLY STILL UNAWARE
OF HONG-CHUL'S SECRET

1288
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,916
Justin. Basically, this man
is a semi-zombie.

1289
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,709
He has the cure.

1290
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,960
The vaccine.

1291
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,046
There's a vaccine for this?

1292
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,216
If we bring him to Seoul,
we'll get five billion won.

1293
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,134
Let's not attack him.

1294
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,344
He's on our side.

1295
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,929
I don't need the money.

1296
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,388
JUSTIN HAS EARNED ENOUGH TRUST NOW

1297
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,182
Being alive is enough for me.

1298
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,643
Anyway, can't we just relax
for the next hour?

1299
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,228
We won't be seeing those people anyway.

1300
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,730
As you guys know,
what does Hong-chul have to lose?

1301
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,440
He's practically invincible.

1302
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,901
But still, let's be grateful
that he's sticking with us.

1303
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:45,902
That's right.

1304
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,070
Let's get some rest.

1305
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,241
I'm exhausted.

1306
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,992
Get some rest.

1307
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,828
I'm so tired.

1308
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,996
Take a break, Si-young.
Weren't you tensed?

1309
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:13,179
52 MINUTES LEFT UNTIL THEY ARRIVE IN SEOUL

1310
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,935
I'm too anxious to relax.

1311
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,562
-What?
-Are you feeling anxious?

1312
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,816
Yeah. We should go up front
and assess the situation.

1313
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,568
Yes, I see something
stacked up over there.

1314
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,485
Let's have a look.

1315
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,863
Let's see if there's anything to eat.

1316
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,781
-We'll take a look.
-We'll be back.

1317
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,866
Bring what you can.

1318
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,325
Bring some sweets if you find some.

1319
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,035
Hong-chul needs something sweet.

1320
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,252
Why are there so many clothes?

1321
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,505
Looks like a lot of people
were fleeing from here.

1322
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,257
These aren't supplies.

1323
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,134
Something must've happened here.

1324
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,969
The evacuees must've been here.

1325
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,888
We need to hold onto stuff like this.

1326
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,806
You're right. Let's take the gloves.

1327
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,016
What's this?

1328
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,977
-There's a bubble wrap.
-This is pretty good too.

1329
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,104
We can wrap ourselves with these.

1330
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,189
Why is it so messy?

1331
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:08,026
It seems like something went down here
during the supply transport.

1332
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:08,943
You think so?

1333
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,615
Man, there's so much stuff.
Definitely plenty to eat.

1334
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,122
Hey, this is going to rot.

1335
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,416
Shoot.

1336
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,796
Shoot.

1337
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,714
Hey.

1338
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:31,925
Hey, we're in trouble.

1339
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,399
Shoot.

1340
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,359
Hey.

1341
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,117
Hey, we're in trouble.

1342
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,539
Let's bring them over here first.

1343
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,290
-Go and let them know.
-Let's go.

1344
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,380
I'll hold it! Sung-jae, go quickly!

1345
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,340
Get them here fast!

1346
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:14,592
Quickly!

1347
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,472
Emergency!

1348
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,557
Why?

1349
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,767
-In the front cart…
-Isn't that a zombie?

1350
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,561
What's that?

1351
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,271
There's a bunch of them?

1352
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,772
One hour to downtown Seoul.

1353
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:28,773
So, we're heading there straight.

1354
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,733
If it's a direct route,
the doors won't open.

1355
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,319
Yes, he can't escape then.

1356
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,196
We need to block them now!

1357
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,031
Here we go again. Geez!

1358
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,908
-We're doomed!
-Gosh.

1359
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,744
-Hong-chul, stay here.
-There's nowhere to go.

1360
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,625
They'll get through. Push the door.

1361
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,586
Try blocking with this.

1362
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,795
-Cover their sight.
-Cover it?

1363
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,511
This is bad. There's a baseball team.

1364
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,679
Are they zombies?

1365
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,308
Baseball players
have insane physical strength.

1366
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,310
Shoot, no way!

1367
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,811
Did we get on the wrong train?

1368
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,106
Si-young, should we go check it out too?

1369
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,608
-What?
-Something doesn't seem right.

1370
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,526
Lay these at the front and move back.

1371
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,444
Okay.

1372
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,361
Stuff like this.

1373
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,279
Drag them there.

1374
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,530
Block the way.

1375
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,782
Stack everything up for now.

1376
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,076
Here we go again.

1377
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,494
How many are there?

1378
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,412
It's full over there.

1379
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,539
We can't block that many of them.

1380
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,749
Give me something heavy.

1381
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,167
We don't have anything heavy.

1382
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,044
-Wait.
-How do we block them with Styrofoam?

1383
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,420
The door's opening!

1384
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,588
What do we do?

1385
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,091
We can wrap ourselves with these.

1386
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,259
This will be useful.

1387
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,385
Hold on.

1388
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,847
Let's use this to block the area.

1389
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,770
That's good, Justin.

1390
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,771
Let's block it.

1391
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,439
With plastic wrap? That's smart.

1392
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,817
At the top.

1393
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:04,118
I think we have a good chance.

1394
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,037
They can't get through
if we wrap it all the way around.

1395
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,456
Even if they do, it'll take awfully long.

1396
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,334
Did the door open when you touched it?

1397
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,752
No, it's a manual door.

1398
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,130
It opens up a little
when the zombies slam into it.

1399
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,465
-Really?
-Yes.

1400
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,802
But isn't there a way
we can make use of Hong-chul?

1401
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:21,719
Like what?

1402
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,763
We could tie him up at the front.

1403
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,851
It should be safe with this up.

1404
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,812
It's already hard
for people to get through.

1405
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,188
What do we do with this?

1406
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,648
We can tie it up in here.

1407
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,032
If we fall…

1408
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,327
-It's no joke.
-There are so many of them!

1409
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,453
It really is no joke.

1410
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,746
What's happening?

1411
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,790
No joke. They look so fit!

1412
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,084
Eun-bi, look! Did you take a look?

1413
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,794
You can come through here.

1414
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,255
-I see them.
-There are so many.

1415
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,965
Monitor them from the side!

1416
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,508
This is no joke.

1417
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:01,551
Just one hour.

1418
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,010
Eun-bi, come in here.

1419
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:05,847
Come in this way.

1420
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,766
Hong-chul, get out.

1421
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,561
Eun-bi, it's dangerous. Look.

1422
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,521
-Can you see through the gap?
-Yes.

1423
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,649
Look this way, Eun-bi.

1424
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,109
-Look.
-Hong-chul.

1425
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,951
Don't do anything foolish.

1426
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,413
Don't do anything foolish.

1427
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,874
What's happening?

1428
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,126
What's going on?

1429
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,545
-What's wrong?
-Filthy bastards!

1430
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,921
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

1431
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,381
Filthy bastards!

1432
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,632
-What are you doing?
-What?

1433
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,967
What? No!

1434
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,969
-Why Eun-bi?
-Don't come near me.

1435
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,348
Five hundred million per person?
Don't come any closer!

1436
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,391
Stop him!

1437
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,893
-Stop!
-Hong-chul!

1438
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:52,977
We need to stop him.

1439
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,936
Stop him!

1440
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,854
Stay away!

1441
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,230
No.

1442
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,274
I'm going to bite her.

1443
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,984
-Wait! Don't do it.
-I will!

1444
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:00,985
-I'm biting!
-Don't!

1445
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:01,903
Calm down. Don't!

1446
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,572
Step away and let go.

1447
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,407
-Okay, fine.
-Let go or I'll bite.

1448
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,658
What's wrong with him?

1449
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,785
Why are you like this?

1450
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,994
Don't come any closer.

1451
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,623
-Why are you like this?
-Back off.

1452
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,544
Sung-jae! Get in!

1453
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,506
I'm going to bite her!

1454
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,425
Wait! Don't do it!

1455
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,760
Hey! He's biting!

1456
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,053
-No!
-Okay!

1457
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:27,970
-He's biting!
-Hong-chul!

1458
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,388
-Hong-chul!
-Wait!

1459
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,598
We'll back off.

1460
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:31,516
I'm going to bite.

1461
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,476
Calm down first. We won't do anything.

1462
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,979
-Why are you doing this? We're friends.
-Si-young, take a step back.

1463
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,022
You're crazy!

1464
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,817
-I'm biting!
-Okay!

1465
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,485
-We'll back off.
-Okay, I did.

1466
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,820
-I did it.
-I'll get out.

1467
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,112
Get outside the wrap.

1468
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:46,948
Happy now?

1469
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,574
Don't get any closer. See this?

1470
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,243
Come on, I even wiped your poop.

1471
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,911
See this?

1472
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,412
Can you see my friends?

1473
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,501
-Can you see my friends?
-Damn it!

1474
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,504
I'd choose that side over you guys.

1475
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,756
Okay! Leave Eun-bi!

1476
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,715
Let go.

1477
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,842
Leave Eun-bi!

1478
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:06,926
You crazy fool!

1479
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,178
How long do I have to keep
wearing these tinted glasses?

1480
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,596
I want to be free!

1481
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,639
Filthy bastards!

1482
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,932
Dex, don't go!

1483
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,141
Dex, I saw that.

1484
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,853
I'll give you a gift
each time you do something like that.

1485
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,230
Please!

1486
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,618
Get out!

1487
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,912
This is so annoying!

1488
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,498
Hurry!

1489
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,384
See how it feels!

1490
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,261
You didn't realize it, did you?

1491
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,304
No!

1492
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,891
Help!

1493
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,183
Do you know how I felt?

1494
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,810
-You tied me up…
-Save me!

1495
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,437
And you treated me like a zombie!

1496
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,022
We'll meet again.

1497
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,648
No, let's each go our own way.

1498
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,650
