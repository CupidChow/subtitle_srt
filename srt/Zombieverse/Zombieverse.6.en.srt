00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,968
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,022
-Wow.
-Wow, jeez.

5
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,697
-We should be careful.
-Oh, jeez.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,532
Tsuki's about
to fall off the truck.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,867
Are you okay?

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,326
-Oh, man.
-Don't fall out.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,120
6 SURVIVORS AND 3 INFECTED

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,705
Gosh.

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,208
They've arrived at a new place.

12
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,546
A HIDEOUT DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS
SALVATION OR A TRAP

13
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,141
What on earth?

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,851
-Oh, no. What happened?
-What the heck?

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,020
LAST NIGHT, THEY ESCAPED
FROM THE FACTORY WITH HIS HELP

16
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,438
What's happened? Hyung!

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,483
Hyung! Get out of there!

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,533
-Who are you? Who is he?
-Get down, everyone.

19
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,535
-Anyone hurt?
-What?

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,287
-Is he dangerous?
-Wait.

21
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,288
Jonathan, are you okay?

22
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,332
Jonathan isn't feeling so great.

23
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,793
-He's in bad shape.
-I'm so tired.

24
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,128
-Are you okay?
-Thank you.

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,546
Your eyes are
completely red now.

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,507
Jonathan's getting worse.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,175
That one seems badly hurt.

28
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,510
I'm sorry, but who are you?

29
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,637
First, let's go in and talk.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,013
I'm Kim, a reporter.

31
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,766
I came here undercover
to do a story on Hwangchon-ri.

32
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,850
What?

33
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,732
Yeah, and you totally ruined it.

34
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,733
-What?
-Thanks to the ruckus

35
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,943
you caused there,

36
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,237
the story's ruined.
That's why I saved you people.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,446
Really? Thank you!

38
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,073
I have so many questions.

39
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,367
-Thank you. I mean it.
-Here.

40
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,203
The Hwayo Newspaper?

41
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,496
Reporter Kim Sal-man.

42
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,123
Look. "Unidentified creatures."

43
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,962
Seeing you know about this stuff,
could you take a look at him?

44
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,046
Can he keep going with us?

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,464
-Something's not right.
-Will he be okay?

46
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,382
Stay still.

47
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,510
Here, look. Can you read this?

48
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,387
Sal-man…

49
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,807
He's still got his wits about him.

50
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,435
But judging from experience,
I'd say he's at least 78%.

51
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,146
-What?
-78%?

52
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,564
Yes, at least that much.

53
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,274
His eyes are so red.

54
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,192
These two got bitten too. Could you…

55
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,945
-Shall I take a look?
-Okay.

56
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,280
THESE TWO HAVE BEEN INFECTED
FOR MORE THAN 28 HOURS

57
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,616
-But the redness has spread a bit more.
-Yeah, they're red.

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,493
-Their eyes are all red.
-Come on.

59
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,495
-Let's go in first.
-Okay.

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,584
We have nowhere else
to go right now anyway.

61
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,002
What's that?

62
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,504
-What's with those mannequins?
-I know.

63
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,548
Isn't this
for shooting practice?

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,635
Okay, let's go in.

65
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,887
What are these cans?

66
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,973
THE HOUSE IS SURROUNDED
BY A ZOMBIE ALERT SYSTEM

67
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,100
He put them up
so they'll make noise.

68
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,018
I see.

69
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,061
Let's go in.

70
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,771
-Can we go in?
-Yeah.

71
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,151
This is so scary.
What are we gonna do?

72
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,113
Wow. What's this?

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,749
-What's all this?
-Wow! What is this?

74
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,459
-There are all these photos!
-Huh?

75
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,877
Wow.

76
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,380
TOWN CHIEF LEE JUN-HYEOK, SEO HO-CHEOL

77
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,176
TOWN HALL
PEOPLE GONE MISSING IN HWANGCHON-RI…

78
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,845
RICE MILL
TOWN CHIEF HIDES HIS MOTHER HERE…

79
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,687
I actually came to Hwangchon-ri
because I got a tip about a UFO.

80
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,855
So I came here undercover.

81
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,650
But then, I heard about the zombies.

82
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,320
Wait.

83
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,781
Na-rae, no, oppa.
Is this the old lady you saw?

84
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,282
-Oh, yeah! It is.
-It is! That's her!

85
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,368
It says
"the town chief's mother."

86
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,869
Yes, it says so here.

87
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,999
She encountered an outsider,
got bitten, and became a zombie.

88
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,459
Goodness.

89
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,504
Hey, this is us entering the town!

90
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,422
-There are pictures of us.
-With the town chief.

91
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,549
He was gonna
make us come here no matter what.

92
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,176
Yeah, to use us as food.

93
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,094
Everyone,

94
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,013
the town chief is already a zombie too.

95
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,181
I see.

96
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,395
Mother! What the heck?

97
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,896
Mother.

98
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,065
Mother.

99
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,822
AFTER DEX AND CREW
CAME TO TOWN

100
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,323
THE CHIEF TURNED INTO A ZOMBIE

101
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,536
JOURNALIST KIM'S INVESTIGATION

102
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,413
FOR AN EXCLUSIVE COMES
TO AN END TODAY…

103
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,872
He must really be a reporter.

104
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,626
RAN AWAY? MISSING? MORE MISSING
PERSONS IN HWANGCHON-RI…

105
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,754
THE ZOMBIE VIRUS
BELIEVED TO HAVE SPREAD FROM SEOUL…

106
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,549
Does that mean the zombies
appeared here even before then?

107
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,136
…WAS ALREADY FOUND IN HWANGCHON-RI
3 WEEKS AGO

108
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,470
Makgeolli?

109
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,222
CAUSE OF THE VIRUS = MAKGEOLLI?

110
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,975
NOTHING ELSE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED YET

111
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:14,230
BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN
"IF YOU GET BITTEN, YOU BECOME A ZOMBIE"

112
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,025
Jonathan's acting weird.

113
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,693
-What is he looking at?
-Jonathan.

114
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
-Jonathan.
-What about my brother?

115
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,071
He has bite marks, right?

116
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,865
-Oppa.
-Look there first.

117
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,782
Look at him.

118
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,284
I mean, we can still move.

119
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,869
What do we do?

120
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,370
-Jeez.
-What is it?

121
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,122
-This is bad.
-What is it? What?

122
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,374
I think he'll change any second now.

123
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,626
Whoa! Jeez! His flesh has been ripped off.

124
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,795
For now, let me do
some first aid on him, okay?

125
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,089
What's that? Can you slow the change?

126
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,050
Yes. I mean,
I can stop him from biting us.

127
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,218
-Okay.
-Are you going to gag him or something?

128
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,970
Not exactly a gag.

129
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,888
What is that?

130
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,222
-A harmonica.
-So he can communicate.

131
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,266
-What's that?
-It's a harmonica.

132
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,727
-No way.
-But he doesn't play the harmonica.

133
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,521
We'll at least know where he is
if he makes a noise with it.

134
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,107
-Oh, I see.
-And he can't bite us.

135
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,902
-He can't bite us.
-Oh, I see. It's held in place.

136
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,153
He's completely out of it.

137
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,946
Okay. Jonathan.

138
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,116
-Wow.
-Oppa.

139
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,368
SOUNDS NICE AND CLEAR!

140
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,871
-No! We can't laugh.
-He can blow on it if he wants to call us.

141
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,456
It's not
too uncomfortable, right?

142
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,501
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO COMMUNICATE

143
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,295
-This is so sad.
-Twice… no. Blow it three times.

144
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,546
Jonathan, Jonathan.

145
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,675
HE CAN EVEN PLAY A TUNE

146
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,386
-It sounds hopeful. It does.
-Hey.

147
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,305
-No, but really. It sounds nice.
-She's laughing the loudest.

148
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,473
Oppa.

149
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.

150
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,518
That's my brother.

151
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,770
Why don't you go close to him
and help him up?

152
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,813
Oppa.

153
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,234
NO NEED TO TRANSLATE THAT…

154
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,944
That means
you're going to kill her, right?

155
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,655
"When I get up, you're dead.
I'm gonna rip you to pieces."

156
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,449
-That's it.
-I can't look at you. It's too sad.

157
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,284
-Patricia.
-I'm going to cry.

158
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,247
Once the infection progresses,
you get strong.

159
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,041
Right. You get really strong
when you become a zombie.

160
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,460
It could get
to where we can't control him.

161
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,504
-We need to quarantine him.
-Oh.

162
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,589
I can quarantine him safely.

163
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,174
For everyone here…

164
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,970
"Why do I have to?"

165
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,180
It's okay.

166
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,432
-Oh, it's so…
-I'll take care of him.

167
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,935
-Help him up. Okay, let's move him.
-Oh, no. Oppa.

168
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,562
-Let's go.
-Poor Jonathan.

169
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,148
No, we'll be able to
keep an eye on him nearby.

170
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,108
-You can still see your brother.
-Okay.

171
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,860
-Maybe not.
-Go in with him.

172
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,361
-Oppa.
-Say goodbye.

173
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,249
Oppa, will you tell me the PIN?

174
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,752
To your credit card.

175
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,178
HE HELD ON TENACIOUSLY UNTIL NOW

176
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,601
BUT NOW HE'S BEEN LOCKED AWAY

177
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,159
You shouldn't be afraid
of zombies themselves.

178
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,368
-Yeah!
-You shouldn't be afraid

179
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,495
of zombies themselves.

180
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,289
-You just need to remove their chompers.
-Yeah.

181
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,666
-We just need to stop them from biting.
-That's right.

182
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,252
-So we pull out all their teeth?
-So…

183
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,338
-Oh!
-Oh, I've seen this in the movies.

184
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,049
-Hey, that's great.
-You can push away two at a time, even.

185
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,592
-Then they can't come closer than this.
-Like this.

186
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,302
I've seen this in zombie movies.

187
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,762
-But what if they do this?
-Then?

188
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,764
-You do this.
-What if they do this?

189
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,891
-You do this.
-Oh!

190
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,476
I see.

191
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,478
-They won't be able to bite.
-You can't bite me, can you?

192
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,979
Hold them from the back.

193
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,731
He can only do that
because DinDin is short.

194
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,274
-He could bite if he were tall.
-To prepare ourselves…

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,692
-So they come like this.
-Yeah.

196
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,027
-If they're taller?
-Yeah?

197
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,154
What are you gonna do
if they come at you like this?

198
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,490
If they're taller…

199
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,992
HIS BACK IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED

200
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,827
-Wait, just a second.
-You got bitten.

201
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,413
-He got bitten.
-He got bitten. He did.

202
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,250
-Hey, I bit him 12 times in that instant.
-Wait, guys.

203
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,209
12 times.

204
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,127
-Mr. Kim, hey.
-You're fine.

205
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,379
-Why did you hold it in?
-What?

206
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,381
-I bit him really hard.
-Okay.

207
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,258
He pretended
as if he didn't get bitten.

208
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,842
THIS INSTRUCTOR HAS A LOT OF PATIENCE!

209
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,386
I was demonstrating the weapon.

210
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,680
Why would you come after me
like your life depended on it?

211
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,681
I was supposed to be a zombie.

212
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,974
But, like, he held it in.

213
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,725
To prepare ourselves for them biting us…

214
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,352
Wow.

215
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,853
-You have this.
-Wow, that's great.

216
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,105
HE MUST'VE GOT BITTEN ON PURPOSE
FOR THE DEMONSTRATION

217
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,898
If we had that,
we wouldn't have been bitten.

218
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,608
Come on.

219
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,904
INFECTED IN THREE SECONDS!

220
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,990
It's so easy to move him
however I want.

221
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,242
I could've bitten his forehead
a couple of times too.

222
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,868
He's 120% infected.

223
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,412
Look,
he can't even move right now.

224
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,540
Okay, let me explain the next part.
Help me back up.

225
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,333
Put me back up.

226
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,876
He gives up really quickly.

227
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,628
Now to prepare ourselves
for that exact situation…

228
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,046
There's more.

229
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
-He's upgrading.
-Doesn't stop there, does it?

230
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,842
-We have this too. This is safe.
-Look at this.

231
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,595
-Catch a zombie with that.
-Who's strong here? Try me.

232
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,179
-That's Dex.
-Dex. He's the strongest.

233
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,390
-He's the strong one.
-So you put it on them.

234
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,267
Now try attacking.

235
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,643
There.

236
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,105
OH! YOU CAN USE THE WALL
TO KEEP IT AT BAY

237
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,983
If there's a zombie this smart…

238
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,693
-Huh.
-It works.

239
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,695
Wow. It works.

240
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,324
…THIS ISN'T A COMEDY SHOW

241
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,617
Hey, that's not bad.

242
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,327
-Look.
-Look at that.

243
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,079
He was in the special forces.

244
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,040
It's like a comedy sketch.

245
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,083
Did you two plan this in advance?

246
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,337
-Wow, look.
-It's like they rehearsed it.

247
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,464
He's just barely out of reach.

248
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
WHAT A NICE IMPROVISED SKIT

249
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,134
-You use the wall behind you.
-That means…

250
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,386
You have to keep backing up
if you're outside.

251
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,472
That's why you should only
pick the paths close to the wall.

252
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,183
-Always stay near the wall?
-But there aren't walls outdoors.

253
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,352
How far
do you have to keep going?

254
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,491
Like this.
You duck, then this, this, and bam.

255
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,329
And you get bitten here,
bitten here, bitten here.

256
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,705
-And then you're dead.
-You're practically

257
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,749
giving them your hand
to bite just like that.

258
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,257
-What's that?
-What the heck?

259
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,342
What's going on?

260
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,177
Oh. They're here.

261
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,929
-That startled me.
-What's going on?

262
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,347
-What is it?
-Let's go.

263
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,932
They're caught.

264
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,058
What?

265
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,811
They've fallen into the trap
I've set up.

266
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,397
-Really?
-A trap?

267
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,065
That's right.

268
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,829
-Wow! He's right.
-Where is it?

269
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,373
-Goodness.
-His face is gone.

270
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,125
There are two.

271
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,334
But only one got caught.

272
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,045
I can't stand to look at
that kind of stuff!

273
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,255
Here. Give me the net.

274
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,382
Careful! Oh, gosh. Oh!

275
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,301
-Oh. Got him.
-You got him. Then what?

276
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,013
That's what we did before.
Back in the living room.

277
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,350
IT LOOKED RIDICULOUS,
BUT IT WAS AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE

278
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,310
Did you two plan this in advance?

279
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,439
Oh, man.

280
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,691
What are you going to do with him
now that you've got him?

281
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,359
-The net is about to rip.
-Here.

282
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,320
Get him.

283
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,031
Get him. Take him there.
The bathroom.

284
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,533
-In the bathroom?
-The bathroom?

285
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,785
-Wow, this is unbelievable.
-The net is about to rip.

286
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,662
Where?

287
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,788
The bathroom.

288
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,124
-The net's going to rip.
-Dex, be careful.

289
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,418
-This way.
-What the heck? What's this?

290
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,253
-What the?
-Here.

291
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,421
What the heck?

292
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,048
Why would you open the door?
Don't! Stop it!

293
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,854
-What's going on?
-What is it?

294
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,981
Oh, shoot. Oh, man.

295
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,566
It's fine, they're all tied up.

296
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,526
Shove him in there.
Push him inside. Come on.

297
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,995
Oppa, that way!

298
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,168
Hurry up, the door's open.

299
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,670
-Don't open the door.
-Hey, Si-young's coming.

300
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,297
-You weren't bitten, were you?
-Did you get bitten? Did you?

301
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,466
-No. We got him.
-You got bitten. You did.

302
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,759
-We got him.
-Listen.

303
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,428
He has a bunch of zombies
locked up in the bathroom.

304
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,554
He has them locked up?

305
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,140
-There are seven of them. Seven.
-Seven of them?

306
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,558
This reporter's the real deal.

307
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,102
It's me.

308
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,442
-Wow!
-It might look like a silly butterfly net,

309
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,653
but with this…

310
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,987
JOURNALIST KIM'S CREDIBILITY HAS GONE UP

311
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,447
Look at that bloodstain.

312
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,490
This is so scary. What the heck?

313
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,826
Seriously. We went out
and there were two zombies. Okay.

314
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,328
-Two of them?
-One of them died.

315
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,788
He set up a trap there
and the zombie must have sprung it.

316
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,831
So one's dead.
Its head's gone.

317
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,043
There's a place here
to lock them up.

318
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,795
-Where?
-Go see for yourself. Go.

319
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,797
-But they all have harmonicas…
-It's true.

320
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,049
…like stapled into their faces.

321
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,134
Wow. I mean…

322
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,135
We're gonna go look.

323
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,846
Go. Wow.
This reporter is the real deal. He is.

324
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,057
-He was legit.
-Wait, but…

325
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,856
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my. What is it?

326
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,571
Oh!

327
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,494
-Let's go back. Come on.
-That's terrifying.

328
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,247
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,838
Oppa, what if he puts a harmonica
in our mouths later?

330
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,298
No. That won't happen.

331
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,257
Pull out all our teeth?

332
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,675
No, we just have to keep talking.

333
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,343
-You think?
-They said it'll be fine

334
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,261
as long as you talk.

335
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,346
Oh, I feel like
I'm looking at my future.

336
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,015
We have to keep talking.
Even when we sleep.

337
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,350
Let's keep talking, okay?
If I fall asleep,

338
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,227
-slap me in the face, okay?
-No, we can't sleep anymore.

339
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,812
Slap me, okay? Slap me.

340
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,606
That was so scary.

341
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,317
So they're being kept
in the same house as us?

342
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,235
He said he did all of that
and tied them up

343
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,113
before they had fully changed.
Like how Jonathan is right now.

344
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,197
Oh.

345
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,450
So then,
should we put Jonathan in there too?

346
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,994
How can we stay in the same place?

347
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,183
HE'S BRINGING IN A ZOMBIE?

348
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,976
-Oh, I can hear him.
-He's back.

349
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,229
Why would he bring him here?

350
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,148
-He's bringing the zombie?
-That's the one we saw out front.

351
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,192
-Oh!
-That's a full-on zombie.

352
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,736
Jeez, that's freaking scary.

353
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,446
-He communicates?
-He's 100% zombie?

354
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,989
Gosh, that's scary.

355
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,742
Uh, wait. Mr. Kim. Hold on.

356
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,827
Mr. Kim. Hold on.

357
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,497
Uh, wait. Mr. Kim. Hold on.

358
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,040
Uh, wait. Mr. Kim. Hold on.

359
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,625
Wait!

360
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,793
-He's coming.
-He's heading straight here.

361
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,877
Like,
he's not even looking at them.

362
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,837
-There you go. See?
-I must look like easy prey.

363
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,297
This means we don't have to worry.

364
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,967
-Maybe we're just not his type.
-Come here.

365
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,388
-We're not food.
-He's coming to us, oppa.

366
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,223
-No.
-Oh, gosh. What do we do?

367
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,060
Huh?

368
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,478
Hold on.

369
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,106
-He's coming to us!
-He's coming toward us!

370
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,404
Oh! Oh, my! Oh!

371
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,449
Oh! Oh, my! Oh!

372
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,952
-Stop him!
-Come on. Let's go.

373
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,912
Oh, gosh.

374
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,539
My chest hurts.

375
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,999
He's a full-on zombie.

376
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,917
Yeah, he's completely changed.

377
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,670
We've been working together
for a long time.

378
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,755
He took all these pictures here.

379
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,507
-I see.
-The cameraman?

380
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,302
Yeah. I'm also waiting to see
if they develop a cure.

381
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,222
So that's why
I'm protecting them.

382
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,515
THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS THE ZOMBIES

383
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,685
How long has it been
since he was bitten?

384
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,603
Well, it's been over a week now.

385
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,733
Well, I'm going to
take him back down, okay?

386
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,193
-It's time to get some rest.
-Okay.

387
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,361
Poor guy.

388
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,488
-That's so sad.
-I know.

389
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,115
They look so close.

390
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,037
A WORLD WHERE
THE ZOMBIE VIRUS HAS SPREAD

391
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,794
Here, drink this.

392
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,588
Here.

393
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,924
REGARDLESS, THERE ARE PEOPLE
YOU CAN'T ABANDON

394
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,427
Oppa, get some rest. Keep yourself warm.

395
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,928
And stay alert.

396
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,098
Jeez, your socks. Did you crawl here?

397
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,224
You're okay, right?

398
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,397
Okay, you need to be able
to protect yourselves too,

399
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,608
-so you need to train.
-I'm in.

400
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,777
We can learn
to survive too, right?

401
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,863
Right. So a way
to utilize various objects.

402
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,865
-Okay.
-Even something like this.

403
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,284
You can use this to get around
when there are zombies.

404
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,203
-How?
-You go in and…

405
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,038
-Huh?
-No way.

406
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,790
-You can't see him!
-Wow!

407
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,333
-You're right.
-That's great!

408
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,709
-It's so cute.
-It's so cute.

409
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,419
NOTE: ONLY USABLE
BY PEOPLE WITH A CUTE HEIGHT

410
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,797
-There is a reason he survived so far.
-Okay, now…

411
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,924
-Roll!
-Without even looking?

412
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,383
No!

413
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
THE SECRET TO UNDERCOVER JOURNALISM
HAS BEEN REVEALED

414
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,887
Oh, gosh!

415
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,597
-Are you okay?
-Is he dead?

416
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,723
Are you all right?

417
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,476
You can roll down here easily like this.

418
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,894
-He's right.
-Let's try it.

419
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,979
-See if it works for others.
-I'm dizzy.

420
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,733
-I have the most similar build.
-You will? Okay.

421
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,944
Watch your head.
You know, head first.

422
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,529
You can also evade attack.

423
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,446
Wait.

424
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,823
-Oh, it's a great fit.
-Oppa.

425
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,324
-Wait.
-It's so cute.

426
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,660
Sit. Sit down.

427
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,245
-Wow! You'd never realize he's there.
-Sit.

428
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,872
Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,207
-I'll roll you now.
-Come on!

430
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,834
His feet.
He needs to tuck them in.

431
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,627
-Hey!
-Oppa!

432
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,505
-Hey, hey!
-Oppa! Oppa!

433
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,006
-Tsuki, move! Tsuki!
-Oppa!

434
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,426
-Did you see Patricia kick it?
-Are you okay?

435
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,096
ALMOST WENT TO HWANGCHEON
IN HWANGCHON-RI

436
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,389
Hey, are you okay?

437
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,808
-Are you okay?
-She kicked you hard.

438
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,394
I thought she was Hwang Hee-chan
for a moment. The soccer player.

439
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,813
You're better off just dying.

440
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,857
I thought I was falling off a cliff.

441
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,442
Mr. Kim. I can't remember the last time
we laughed like this.

442
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,903
All right. A fun survival training.

443
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,029
-Yeah.
-This is great.

444
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,573
So, we have a gun.

445
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,824
-Oh, a gun?
-A gun?

446
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,825
Yeah, I'll show you.

447
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,993
-You have a gun?
-Yeah, that's great.

448
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,995
THE SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING ZOMBIES WITH THEIR BARE HANDS

449
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,246
Open the door. Open it.

450
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,251
BUT THEY WERE HELPLESS
WHEN THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY THEM

451
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,255
-Oppa.
-Hyung, what do we do?

452
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,090
THEY DESPERATELY NEED A WAY
TO FIGHT THE ZOMBIES FROM A DISTANCE!

453
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,134
Now, I made this.

454
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,844
It's a potato gun.

455
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,262
-What?
-A potato gun?

456
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,347
Is this why there were
all those potatoes back there?

457
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,772
JOURNALIST KIM'S SURVIVAL CLASS
POTATO GUN TRAINING

458
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,358
-It just looks like a plain pipe.
-Yes, I made it out of a pipe.

459
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,777
-PVC pipes.
-Wow. But this can shoot?

460
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,778
Yes.

461
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,822
HANDMADE POTATO GUN:
SHOOTS OUT POTATOES

462
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,616
MADE WITH READILY AVAILABLE PVC PIPES

463
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,658
POWER YET UNKNOWN

464
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,952
-It all sounds great, but…
-I don't think it'll work.

465
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,829
-We need a demonstration.
-Right.

466
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,206
-You want me to show you?
-Yeah!

467
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,415
Show us.

468
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,667
-Potato.
-Load.

469
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,086
Oh!

470
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,923
Wow.
You block it completely like that.

471
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,300
-Now, this is what you all use at home.
-That's an insecticide spray.

472
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,135
-You use this.
-Yeah. An insecticide.

473
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,137
-With the gas.
-And that works?

474
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,599
INJECT THE HOUSEHOLD SPRAY
INTO THE GUN BARREL

475
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,021
-Okay.
-Ignite!

476
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,698
-Wow.
-Okay.

477
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,161
THE POWER IS MORE IMPRESSIVE
THAN EXPECTED!

478
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,080
-Amazing.
-Wow, it shot off.

479
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
That's so cool!

480
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,375
-I mean…
-That's unbelievable.

481
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,044
DON'T KNOCK IT UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT

482
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,712
-Wow!
-It's pretty powerful.

483
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,632
The potato bits leftover
from making the bullets…

484
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,676
-Yeah.
-You save them to be eaten later.

485
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,220
THE ZOMBIE WEAPON
EVEN USES THE SHELLS

486
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,388
Incredible.

487
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,014
-Si-young, let's try it.
-Go on, try it.

488
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:06,974
I want to try.

489
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,267
-Okay, let's get started.
-Be careful.

490
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,602
-First, you open the chamber.
-It's not like a revolver.

491
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,853
-Oh, yeah.
-Wow!

492
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,481
-Let's do this first too. Like he did.
-Open the chamber. And then?

493
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,984
-Then you load the potato.
-Load the potato.

494
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,735
Pack it in so there aren't any gaps.

495
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,072
LOADING FAILED! LOADING FAILED!

496
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,907
-It's not easy.
-You made a diagonal slice on the potato.

497
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,409
She's a housewife.

498
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,452
She loads like she's preparing to cook.

499
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,329
-Wait, hold on.
-She always cooks for her kid.

500
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,622
-Yeah, diagonal slicing.
-Right.

501
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,082
You need to pack it in.

502
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,376
There's our dinner.
Let's have potatoes for dinner today.

503
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,503
Okay! Potato sounds good.

504
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,131
-Now.
-You can make one on the spot like that?

505
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,508
Here. You press here.

506
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,639
-That went so far.
-It's not too strong?

507
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,851
My ears hurt a little,
and there's a slight kickback too.

508
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,228
-It fires great. It's actually good.
-But with some practice

509
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,814
and a higher aim,
I think I can hit the target.

510
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,691
Okay, let's split into pairs.

511
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,818
-Six people, gunners and assistants.
-We have three men and three women,

512
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,237
so let's pair up
into gunners and assistants.

513
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,613
-Why don't you do it with me?
-Okay.

514
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,365
-And Tsuki, let's pair up.
-Okay, great.

515
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,950
Okay, who'll be the main gunner?

516
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,493
Can you do it?

517
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,704
Tsuki will do it.

518
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,621
Wow, jeez.

519
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,541
HE STRONGLY RECOMMENDS SOMEONE
WHO'S NEVER USED A GUN BEFORE

520
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,543
-It's important to experience it.
-Wow, seriously.

521
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,627
It's not that I'm scared.

522
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,713
-You're so…
-I've done military service.

523
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,797
Tell me when you're ready.

524
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,215
-Ready!
-Ready!

525
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,133
Fire lane one is ready!

526
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,259
Load potato.

527
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,720
-Okay.
-Load potato.

528
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,597
REPEATING THE ORDER!
A BASIC RULE OF TRAINING!

529
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,390
-Loading complete!
-Loading complete!

530
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,017
-Loading complete!
-Open chamber.

531
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,518
Open chamber!

532
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,395
Now inject gas.

533
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,730
-Gas.
-Inject gas.

534
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
-Go!
-Wait.

535
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,693
-Done.
-Fire!

536
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,944
Huh?

537
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,572
WHAT? THE GUN ISN'T WORKING

538
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,992
It's not working!

539
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,452
Malfunction!

540
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,953
You're all dead.

541
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,456
Shouldn't we be the ones
killing you for this, Mr. Kim?

542
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,499
Why isn't it working?

543
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,502
The spark won't work
if there's moisture inside.

544
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,711
Oh, I see.

545
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,879
IT DIDN'T WORK DUE TO THE WEATHER

546
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,591
IT DOESN'T WORK WELL IN KOREA
WHERE THERE ARE FOUR DISTINCT SEASONS!

547
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,218
Let's try to hit at least one thing.

548
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,386
GIVEN HER PERSONALITY,
SHE WANTS A BULLSEYE

549
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,347
-Prepare to fire.
-Prepare to fire.

550
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,015
-Fire!
-Why isn't ours working?

551
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,810
TSUKI FIRES SUCCESSFULLY!

552
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,061
Why isn't ours working?

553
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,646
Yeah!

554
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
-Yeah!
-Fire!

555
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,317
-What's wrong with it?
-Let's put more in.

556
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
Fire!

557
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,656
IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
TO BE EATEN ALIVE BY ZOMBIES

558
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:31,993
Wow.

559
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,286
Wow.

560
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,579
THE JAPANESE WOMAN
WHO'S NEVER ENLISTED

561
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,622
IS GETTING THE MOST EXPERIENCE

562
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,540
Fire.

563
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,416
-Are you trying to fire now?
-Oh, darn it.

564
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,961
Oh, this is so frustrating, seriously.

565
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,755
This is killing me. Gosh.

566
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,257
Oh, jeez.

567
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,843
This is terrible, really.

568
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,678
THE INSTRUCTOR
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

569
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,971
Mr. Kim.

570
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,098
This has no power to destroy anything.

571
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,724
If it fires only some of the time,

572
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,770
-we'll die trying to fire it.
-That's the one tiny, tiny drawback.

573
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,647
Come on.

574
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,982
-Yes, so…
-He knew about this drawback?

575
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,151
I really wasn't gonna show you this, but…

576
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,533
JOURNALIST KIM BRINGS OUT
HIS ULTIMATE WEAPON!

577
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,826
What's this?

578
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,952
That's huge.

579
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,246
A FUEL TANK THAT CAN SUPPLY GAS STABLY

580
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,374
The downside is that
it's a bit heavy.

581
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,669
-Whoa.
-Wow.

582
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,962
-Jeez.
-Wow.

583
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,257
-This one will actually work.
-I'll show you.

584
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,010
THIS ONE IS NO DOUBT NETFLIX QUALITY!

585
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,308
IT'S POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO OBLITERATE THE POTATO!

586
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,767
Yeah, you did.

587
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,603
That's so cool!

588
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,146
Always a surefire.

589
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,398
-That's what I'm talking about.
-This is it!

590
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,026
-So cool.
-It's practically a cannon.

591
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,739
JOURNALIST KIM PUNISHES
THE FAILED POTATO GUN

592
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,282
Whoa, Mr. Kim.

593
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,450
No, Mr. Kim.
You should save your strength.

594
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,367
That's gotta hurt.

595
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,660
We don't know when they'll come again.

596
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,413
-It just made me angry. Okay.
-No. Conserve your energy.

597
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,165
Now, let's start
with the first group.

598
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,750
-First group.
-Firing lane one.

599
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,585
-Ready?
-Ready!

600
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,753
Loading complete.

601
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,879
Loading complete.

602
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,342
SHE AIMS BY USING THE TRIGGER?

603
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,468
-Fire.
-Okay!

604
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,677
-Fire!
-Fire!

605
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,182
-That was so powerful just now.
-Wow.

606
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,892
It was powerful? Yeah!

607
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,518
All right, sharpshooter.

608
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,645
Okay.

609
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,355
Fire.

610
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,524
THE FIREPOWER IS INCREDIBLE!

611
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,943
Wow. It's super strong.

612
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,027
So cool!

613
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,488
-Wow. That was so fun.
-It's super strong.

614
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,990
-Okay. Let's go.
-Ready!

615
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,951
-It's the real deal.
-Ready.

616
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,078
Here it goes!

617
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,999
SHE SHOT THE RIGHT ARM! FIRST HIT!

618
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,085
-I got it!
-No!

619
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,003
Yeah!

620
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,505
That's amazing!

621
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,881
-Yeah! She got it!
-Yeah!

622
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,467
-Wow! She hit it.
-You hit the right side of the chest.

623
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,593
I used to be a top marksman.

624
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,428
THE COMMANDER CAN'T JUST SIT BACK

625
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,721
All right, ready to fire.

626
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,182
-Ready to fire.
-Ready to fire.

627
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,061
HIS SHOOTING FORM MAKES ONE QUESTION
IF HE WAS IN THE MILITARY

628
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,689
Target the third zombie.

629
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,357
-And fire!
-Yeah!

630
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,784
THE POTATO BASICALLY LEAKS OUT

631
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,202
Wait, oppa.

632
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,537
Guess it depends on who fires it.

633
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,538
Oppa.

634
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,292
Hey, wait, oppa.

635
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,584
Where did you say you served?

636
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,877
-Mr. Kim.
-You did well.

637
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,337
Mr. Kim, help me save face here.

638
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,422
HE'S TOO ASHAMED TO LOOK UP

639
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,590
-This is too embarrassing.
-One side was leaking.

640
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,175
I guess you need
good characters to fire it.

641
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,427
-Your character?
-I mean…

642
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,053
-I'll give it a try then.
-Great.

643
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:37,971
Okay.

644
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,723
THE LEADER STEPS IN
TO MANAGE THE SITUATION

645
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,890
Okay.

646
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,767
-Now. Get ready to fire.
-Okay.

647
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,185
Ready.

648
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,687
He makes it look so light.

649
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,318
THEY CHEER
UPON SEEING HIS TEXTBOOK FORM!

650
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:02,120
Okay. Aim at the third zombie.

651
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,756
Fire at the third zombie!

652
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,715
FIRE!

653
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,018
HITS THE WEAK SPOT!

654
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,312
Incredible!

655
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,732
SAFETY ON!

656
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,027
WE'RE ALL WITNESSES

657
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,946
TO "THE REAL TOP MARKSMAN"

658
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,786
I wanna try shooting! I'd like to go.

659
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,120
DESPERATE TO REDEEM HIMSELF

660
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,080
You can do it!

661
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,456
-I can shoot!
-No, wait.

662
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,459
Hey, there aren't that many potatoes left.
That's enough firing now.

663
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,919
-I can shoot!
-Oppa.

664
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,004
-I can shoot.
-He can shoot!

665
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,382
I can shoot!

666
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,550
EVEN HIS YELL SOUNDS PATHETIC

667
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,719
Okay, fire at the third zombie.

668
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,974
Oppa, just come here.

669
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,603
I mean… the barrel was pointed down.

670
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,647
WE'RE ALL WITNESSES

671
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,648
TO "THE MAN WHO HANGS HIS HEAD"

672
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,941
You should have pointed it upward.

673
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,193
-You did great, really.
-Mr. Kim.

674
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,236
He can do it!

675
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,240
This has a greater chance
it'll hit the target.

676
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,282
True.

677
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,451
What are you doing?

678
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,411
RIGHT IN THE GRILL

679
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,954
THERE'S BEEN A SIMPLER WAY ALL ALONG!

680
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,957
-This might hurt them more.
-It's a lot more powerful.

681
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,917
This is more power.

682
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,090
-You can do the most damage by kicking.
-Yeah, it's true.

683
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,175
Then why did we do all this?

684
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,844
What did we do this for?

685
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,726
Jeez. Man.

686
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,020
THE SUBLEADER IS HESITANT TO GO INSIDE

687
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,772
Mr. Kim,
can I try it on my own?

688
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,690
Oh, yeah. Sure.

689
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,571
SINCE SHE WAS SELECTED
AS THE SUBLEADER

690
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,157
SHE HASN'T SHOWN
ANY OUTSTANDING ABILITIES

691
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,367
Wow, you're amazing!

692
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,870
Wow!

693
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,204
Incredible!

694
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,376
Wait.

695
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,462
THE SUBLEADER'S
COMPETITIVENESS IS ON FIRE

696
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,924
-All good?
-Yes.

697
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,557
-Wow!
-Yeah!

698
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,017
You did it.

699
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,145
-A headshot.
-I hit the head!

700
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,440
-I finally got the hang of it. Yeah!
-Ten out of ten! Yeah!

701
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,110
Turns out the best one was here.

702
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,946
NO ONE SAW,
BUT THE SUBLEADER REDEEMED HERSELF!

703
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,824
I mean,
there could be an antidote.

704
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,076
They can't do this.

705
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,790
They discarded Jonathan like a used tissue
and they'll leave us behind too.

706
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,999
Those jerks.

707
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,083
-I mean, not jerks.
-Really!

708
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,002
-Dang it.
-Oh, those jerks.

709
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,295
At least I got married.

710
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,130
But you couldn't even
get a chance to do that.

711
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,423
THE HALF-ZOMBIES ENJOY DRINKS

712
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,425
I thought I'd get married one day,

713
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,095
so I even froze my eggs, dang it.
I'm screwed.

714
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,848
You even froze your eggs?

715
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,142
It's more expensive
if you're single, you know?

716
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,269
You can't get any government funding.

717
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,647
-Cost me five million won.
-Five million?

718
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,317
Imagine all the makgeolli
you could have bought with five million.

719
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,152
I wish I'd bought drinks.

720
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,030
They'll be left without an owner.
What good are they now?

721
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,575
-You need sperm to use the eggs, you know?
-Oh, gosh.

722
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,036
Five million won.

723
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,747
I don't wanna die.

724
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,875
Not like this.

725
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,806
Hi. Hello.

726
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,142
I'm Jonathan.

727
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,480
I turned 23 this year.

728
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,065
JONATHAN STARTS RECORDING HIS WILL

729
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,692
I wanted to turn 24 and…

730
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,320
do more fun things.

731
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,615
Get a driver's license and drive around,

732
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,494
date someone, and get married at 25.
That was my dream.

733
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,748
And I haven't even had the chance
to enjoy college yet.

734
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,083
A YOUNG MAN'S DREAM WITHERS AWAY

735
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,043
I won't be able
to do any of that now.

736
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,129
This is so unfair.

737
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,594
At least if I leave this stuff…

738
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,941
I'm afraid this will be my final vlog.

739
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,280
So I'll record how I change step by step
and keep it safe.

740
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,241
So be sure to click hard
on the like, subscribe…

741
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,659
A VIRAL VIDEO CAN HELP HIS SISTER!

742
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,703
…and notification buttons.

743
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,872
Thanks so much.

744
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,332
Come on let's get one million,

745
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,958
50 million views.

746
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,257
What is it, Jonathan?

747
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,550
Jonathan, what is it?

748
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,062
A ZOMBIE PLAYING THE HARMONICA…
THIS IS PERFECT FOR YOUTUBE!

749
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,481
I hear the harmonica.

750
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,899
-It's the harmonica.
-It's Jonathan.

751
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,150
Is there really
something here?

752
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,234
What is this place?

753
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,611
I'm surprised
a place like this even exists.

754
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,196
There's some kind of prison here.

755
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,156
-Oh, really?
-What is this place?

756
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,533
-Is this a house?
-I can hear the harmonica.

757
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,410
-Jeez, what's this?
-What is it?

758
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,414
It's the zombie
that Dex caught.

759
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,208
Get him. Okay, let's go.

760
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,294
A CAPTIVE ZOMBIE PLAYS A TUNE
IN A SUSPICIOUS PLACE

761
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,638
PHYSICAL: 005 HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

762
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,973
Come on in.

763
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,349
-We just go in?
-It's safe.

764
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,518
-What is this?
-The building is so…

765
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,603
-What's this?
-Is it dangerous?

766
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,189
Come on in,
where I've made things safe for you.

767
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,316
-No, don't open the door.
-He's going in.

768
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,609
-Why would you?
-Whoa.

769
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,737
-What's he doing?
-Oh, gosh!

770
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,947
What's he doing?

771
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,454
What the heck's he doing?

772
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,248
-Oh, gosh.
-What?

773
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,167
We've been training
to use weapons so far.

774
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,420
This time, it's hand-to-hand combat.

775
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,632
How to escape
when you encounter a zombie unarmed.

776
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,385
Why didn't we think of this?
We were the ones on the run.

777
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,387
We were always
the ones running away.

778
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,016
You'll all practice how to
take down at least one zombie right now.

779
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,435
-What?
-One-on-one?

780
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,311
Wait. That's so scary.

781
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,022
-Hug them from behind.
-Get behind them?

782
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:44,939
Yeah.

783
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,275
-Roll him up in the mat.
-What is he doing?

784
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,317
Roll the zombie up in the mat.

785
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,694
We only have to make sure
they can't bite.

786
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,405
As long as they can't bite you.

787
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,243
HIS MOUTH HAS BEEN SEALED FOR SAFETY

788
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,830
-This is all so…
-He wants us to go in.

789
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,874
-Hey, look over there.
-Go on in.

790
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,543
Okay, who's going first?
I showed you how.

791
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,336
-Si-young.
-Gosh.

792
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,380
-What is wrong with you?
-What?

793
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,966
Si-young, it's you.

794
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,427
THE FORMER BOXER SUBLEADER
IS A GOOD FIRST CANDIDATE!

795
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,471
-The fighter enters.
-Let's go!

796
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,223
-You can do it!
-Come on, national athlete!

797
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,349
Yeah, you can do it!

798
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,476
Hug from behind.

799
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,603
Show us your boxing skills.

800
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,771
What the heck?

801
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,938
Show us your boxing skills.

802
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,905
-What the heck?
-Nice.

803
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,948
-How's she so good?
-Yeah! A wrestling move.

804
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,451
Oh!

805
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,913
EXACTLY AS SHE WAS TOLD

806
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,752
Oh, wow! Awesome!

807
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,212
Wow!

808
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,546
I can't tell who's the zombie.

809
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,881
Wow! She's so cool.

810
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,091
SHE TOOK HIM DOWN EASILY

811
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,509
-Perfect.
-Cheers for Si-young.

812
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,386
I feel a little bit braver
now that I've tried it.

813
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,807
A CUTE FELLOW ENTERS PATHETICALLY

814
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,978
No, don't anger the zombie!

815
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:06,979
He's poking him.

816
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,357
Oh! Get him!

817
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,650
SUFFERING AFTER A HIKE IN THE WOODS

818
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,110
What are you doing?

819
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,029
-Wait! I'm sorry!
-What are you doing?

820
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,032
-He's faster now.
-Poke him!

821
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,120
Mr. Kim.

822
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,579
Go on. Have fun.

823
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,997
THE ATHLETIC LEADER IS UP NEXT

824
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,375
-You can do it!
-Put the harmonica back on.

825
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,003
THE ANGRY ZOMBIE'S GAG CAME UNDONE!

826
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,173
Close the door.

827
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,384
HE DIDN'T SCREAM TO HELP DEX…

828
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,386
Why did this have to happen on my turn?

829
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,638
If Dex gets bit, it's over for us.

830
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,390
Dex is
who caught this one before.

831
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,142
PERHAPS HE REMEMBERS
DEX'S HUG FROM EARLIER

832
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,318
-Jeez!
-Oh!

833
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,490
Unbelievable.

834
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,700
HE EASILY TOOK HIM DOWN, OF COURSE

835
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,035
I can't believe he did that.

836
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,078
Wow.

837
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,454
Hey, be careful, Dex.

838
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,206
The harmonica is loose.

839
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,708
WATCH THE MOUTH! HE MIGHT GET BITTEN

840
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,625
Oh! Your arm!

841
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,549
HE MUST FINISH UP QUICKLY AND ESCAPE!

842
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,138
HE DEMONSTRATES AN INSANE FINISH

843
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,807
THE MAN WHO HAS NO LIMITS

844
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,727
KIM DEX

845
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,228
I think he's gone crazy.

846
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,150
-All right. You learned a lot.
-Yeah.

847
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,444
-Now, we'll do it with two.
-Okay.

848
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,361
Wait, why?

849
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,448
A ZOMBIE WILL BE ADDED
FOR THESE TOP STUDENTS

850
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,579
THIS TRAINING IS A MUST
TO FACE THE HORDES OF ZOMBIES!

851
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,749
You can't get bitten anyway.

852
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,126
When else are we gonna get a chance
to fight them like this?

853
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,253
-I knew it. She's something else.
-I'll give it a go.

854
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,338
THE SUBLEADER KICKS IT OFF

855
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,380
A warrioress!

856
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,430
AFTER SHE HUGS ONE FROM BEHIND,
THE OTHER APPROACHES IMMEDIATELY

857
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,015
She went straight for it!

858
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,605
SHE QUICKLY IDENTIFIES
THE MOVING TARGETS!

859
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,275
She needs to keep fighting. Keep going!

860
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,657
SHE'S GOOD, BUT 2:1 DOESN'T LOOK EASY

861
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,492
Unni, you're so awesome.

862
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,535
We can't get bitten anyway, right?

863
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,247
Bring it on.

864
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,042
HE THROWS HIM DOWN
RATHER THAN HUGGING HIM FROM BEHIND

865
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,502
Like real combat.

866
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,469
HE QUICKLY EVADES THE BITING ZOMBIES

867
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,180
HE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO FIGHT
MULTIPLE ZOMBIES ALONE!

868
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,306
It's not too bad.

869
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,769
He's more at ease.
Wow, he's so relaxed. Jeez.

870
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,064
NOW THAT HE'S RELAXED,
HE EVEN USES THE OBJECTS AROUND HIM

871
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,565
Amazing. Wow!

872
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,442
-Oh!
-Wow.

873
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,194
WITH SUCH SKILLS, HE'D NEVER GET BITTEN

874
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,153
Be careful.

875
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,364
Wow. His whole body itself is a weapon.

876
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,826
-Jeez. Man.
-Cool.

877
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,869
Dang.

878
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,954
Wow.

879
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,923
Move!

880
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,428
That'd mean he got bitten! He got bitten!

881
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,014
THE GAG TOUCHED HIM!

882
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,098
He got bitten. He's dead.

883
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,101
HE'D BE DEAD WITHOUT THE GAG!
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN

884
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,437
That's what happens
if you get too cocky and show off.

885
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,980
He was so great.

886
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,150
THE TRAINING CONTINUES
FOR A WHILE AFTER

887
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,401
Help!

888
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,069
-Oh! She's dead!
-She's dead!

889
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,031
WHILE THEY PASSIONATELY
CONTINUE THEIR TRAINING…

890
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,867
Will they yell
at us zombies because we ate the ramyeon?

891
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,952
-Cheers to the half-zombies!
-This is great. Cheers!

892
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,204
-World of the half-zombies.
-Yeah!

893
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,666
THEY'RE STILL HAVING A DRINKING PARTY
AND SNACKING ON RAMYEON

894
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,668
-Humans are weak.
-Yeah, that's it.

895
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,254
-Cheers!
-All right, cheers to… Oh?

896
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,214
-What's going on?
-"Cheers"?

897
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,799
We're just making ramyeon.
Perfect timing.

898
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,468
-"Cheers"?
-They're drunk.

899
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,719
-We found some liquor.
-Are you drinking right now?

900
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,220
We're making ramyeon.

901
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,847
And we were only drinking
what was left over.

902
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,973
What? Are you drinking?

903
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,308
And we were only drinking
what was left over.

904
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,684
Man, what's all this?

905
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,895
-Jeez, how many did you eat?
-What the heck?

906
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,024
There's ramyeon over there
and potatoes too.

907
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,651
If we make ramyeon for them,
do you think they'll take us?

908
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,320
Should we ask them if they want ramyeon?

909
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,197
SADLY, THEY WERE PREPARING FOOD
NOT TO GET ABANDONED

910
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,948
Oppa, let's say, "Want some ramyeon?"

911
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,077
-We've been working hard, you know.
-What's going on?

912
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,996
We've been putting our lives on the line.

913
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,914
Hold on.

914
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,458
I saved you
and you ate all my precious food?

915
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,834
Mr. Kim.

916
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,420
I've been eating it
only a little at a time to save it.

917
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,714
We have to stay here for a long time.

918
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,883
So I've been eating it
only a little at a time

919
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,303
and soaked it as much as possible
to make it more filling.

920
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,847
But you ate it
when it's in its smallest state.

921
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,140
We boiled potatoes too.

922
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,102
But these are our bullets.

923
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,145
THEY CLUELESSLY DEPLETED
THE PRECIOUS BULLET SUPPLY

924
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,939
-Load potato.
-Load potato.

925
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,109
THEY'RE JUST ORDINARY POTATOES NOW

926
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,236
-But these are our bullets.
-Unbelievable.

927
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,320
Wait. Listen.

928
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,864
-Those are bullets?
-Who boils potatoes like that?

929
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,658
-No, really.
-We didn't have a colander.

930
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
I mean…

931
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,701
Wait. Listen.

932
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,287
What? Did you disinfect them?
What is this?

933
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,872
But this is how I boil them to eat.

934
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,582
You don't do this even for potato soup.

935
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,960
Try it first.
Don't eat it if it tastes bad.

936
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,378
FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN SCOLDED
FOR COOKING POTATOES BADLY

937
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,295
You people…

938
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,047
-Is it good?
-He's eating this because he's starving.

939
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,257
Yeah. Hey, it's good.

940
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,174
It's delicious.

941
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,927
-He's really good at cooking potatoes.
-I mean… for goodness sake.

942
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,556
I've been boiling potatoes for 30 years.
Seriously, come on.

943
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,434
AFTER SCOLDING THEM HARSHLY,
SHE ENJOYS THE POTATOES

944
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,186
We can cook four
and soak them so we can all share.

945
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,980
-Oppa, the potato is good.
-It's so good.

946
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,274
Si-young,
you really shouldn't eat it, though.

947
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,484
You said this isn't
the right way to make them.

948
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,861
The potato is so delicious.

949
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,945
Mm, it's good.

950
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,071
Isn't it?

951
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,239
-It's good.
-Thanks.

952
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,784
So how many people need to share
the four packets of ramyeon?

953
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,994
Ten people.

954
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,746
-Wow, ramyeon.
-I really want to eat ramyeon.

955
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,331
-It smells so good.
-It looks delicious.

956
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,667
-We need to make this last.
-It smells great.

957
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,753
We'll soak the noodles as much as possible
before we eat it, okay?

958
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,338
YOU SHOULD EAT SOGGY NOODLES
TO FEEL FULL

959
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,383
But ramyeon is better when it's firm.

960
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,968
If you want it firm, then don't eat it.

961
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,553
-Jeez.
-I like it soggy.

962
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,096
-Me too.
-Me as well.

963
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,598
I love eating it totally soggy.

964
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,476
There's a way to make them.
Soaking the noodles isn't enough.

965
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,768
-Soak them. Yeah.
-Worms. He has worms!

966
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,686
What's that?

967
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,146
-These aren't worms, come on.
-Oh. Isn't that bracken?

968
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,105
Oh. It's bracken.

969
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,690
FERNBRAKE, A PLANT EASILY FOUND
ON HILLS IN KOREA.

970
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,983
I don't like it.

971
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,110
-You don't? Then don't have any.
-Yes. You're out too.

972
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,403
Okay, one less person.

973
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,863
-I like bracken.
-All right.

974
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,448
I love bracken.

975
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,867
Oh, we're adding
as much bracken as noodles?

976
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,619
IT'S SLOWLY BECOMING ENOUGH
TO FEED TEN PEOPLE

977
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,204
It's fine as long as
it tastes like ramyeon.

978
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,080
-I'll give it a taste.
-Hey!

979
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,707
THE SUBLEADER VOLUNTEERS
TO BE THE GUINEA PIG

980
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,709
-Just a taste.
-I'll cut off your hands.

981
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,377
Just one bite. Like this.

982
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,337
Hey! Come on!

983
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,963
THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A SMALL BITE

984
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,257
Are you trying to break up the group here?

985
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,800
-Yeah.
-Come on.

986
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,969
You're used to a strict diet.
What's with you?

987
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,100
-Looks delicious.
-Wow!

988
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,769
THEY LOSE THEIR MINDS

989
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,687
AS THEY HAVEN'T HAD RAMYEON
IN A LONG TIME

990
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,231
It's not bland.

991
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,107
Wait. It doesn't have enough protein.

992
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,653
Looking at the state of you all,
you need protein. Just ramyeon won't do.

993
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,489
Hey, protein. That means meat.
He's going to serve us meat.

994
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,533
-Here.
-What is that?

995
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,659
What the heck is that?

996
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,577
From what I saw today,
you're not strong enough.

997
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,620
-What is that?
-So…

998
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,664
Aren't they mealworms?

999
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,583
TA-DA! IT'S THE PROTEIN-PACKED
FOOD OF THE FUTURE

1000
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,377
Wait, they're bugs! Oh!

1001
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,504
-We need to eat it before he adds it.
-No!

1002
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,838
-Wait, I…
-No!

1003
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,382
Don't add them, no! Stop!

1004
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,841
No!

1005
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,176
Stop!

1006
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,056
That's disgusting.

1007
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,892
They're maggots! Gross!

1008
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,769
INSTANT RAMYEON HAS TURNED
INTO HEALTHY FOOD

1009
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,605
You have no idea
just how rich and delicious this is.

1010
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,816
I've never eaten
ramyeon like this in my life.

1011
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,818
-He took his portion so quickly.
-Seriously.

1012
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,111
CUTE DINDIN REFUSES THE PROTEIN

1013
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,572
-He's such a sneaky punk.
-How could you?

1014
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,614
We're out.

1015
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,868
I can't look at it.

1016
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,036
GIVE ME SOME

1017
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,374
Are you supposed
to eat them like this?

1018
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,750
I can't look at it.

1019
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,504
DRAMATIC REACTIONS
UPON SEEING SUCH A MIRACLE!

1020
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,924
-My stomach can't handle that.
-Dex, you can't eat it either?

1021
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,634
Makes me wanna vomit.

1022
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,261
This is just mind-boggling.

1023
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,888
What is that?

1024
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,850
Are those grasscrickets?
What are they?

1025
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,102
THEY'll RUIN YOUR HARVEST

1026
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,521
BUT THEY'RE PROTEIN-RICH
AND CAN MAKE YOU FEEL FULL!

1027
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,398
What are grasscrickets?

1028
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,484
Tsuki is dying over there.
Come back to life. Look at her.

1029
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,320
Is it grasshoppers or crickets?

1030
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,487
-What's wrong with her?
-What are grasscrickets?

1031
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,823
I can't.
This is driving me crazy.

1032
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,492
I eat these as a snack with beer.
It's great with beer.

1033
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,286
-What are those?
-Grasshoppers. Yeah.

1034
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,579
He's something else.

1035
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,122
HE CONTINUES TO PARADE
THE FOOD OF THE FUTURE

1036
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,541
They're too much to handle.
What are those?

1037
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,877
-What?
-Crickets.

1038
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,670
DRIED CRICKETS:
FLAVORFUL AND NUTRITIOUS EDIBLE INSECTS

1039
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,089
THE LATEST ESG STRATEGY TO OVERCOME
THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS

1040
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,633
I'm about to cramp up.

1041
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,760
It smells so weird.

1042
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,720
Oh, that's insane!

1043
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,847
She's too funny.

1044
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,184
Too funny.

1045
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,354
How do you hate these
more than the zombies?

1046
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,023
Wow, this won't be easy.

1047
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,399
Let it settle for a bit.

1048
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,693
-Let it settle so it can expand.
-How is this possible?

1049
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,196
Everyone, when you eat like this,
it can be really delicious.

1050
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,114
-Is she okay?
-Expands your taste buds.

1051
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,742
-She seems…
-Tsuki.

1052
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,036
She didn't get bitten,
but it looks like she's starting to turn.

1053
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,829
-No, really.
-What's wrong with her?

1054
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:26,872
Should we move you
to the bathroom?

1055
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,624
It's so shocking.
This one too.

1056
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,751
You said we should put it all in.

1057
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,836
IT FINALLY LOOKS LIKE
IT'D BE ENOUGH FOR TEN PEOPLE

1058
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,254
Great, it's really expanded.

1059
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,215
It's all swollen now.

1060
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,467
But it really did expand a lot.

1061
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,094
The mealworms are plump now.

1062
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,429
We might even have leftovers.
Even if all of us ate.

1063
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,223
They've soaked up
all the liquid, so they're all big now.

1064
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,600
They've gotten plump.
They're all so plump now.

1065
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,352
The mealworms are growing.

1066
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,730
Oh, come on.

1067
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,565
-She's making me laugh.
-How could you?

1068
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,608
It got softer.

1069
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,276
She wasn't as scared
of the zombies.

1070
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,194
It got softer.

1071
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,655
-Can we really eat these?
-Tsuki, are you scared of bugs?

1072
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,198
Well, I mean… gosh…

1073
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,783
We need to eat if we're gonna survive.

1074
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,660
Dex, you aren't gonna eat?

1075
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,578
Don't Navy Seals eat things like this?

1076
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,580
NOTE: THERE IS NO CONNECTION
BETWEEN UDT AND MEALWORMS

1077
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,124
You can't eat bugs?

1078
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,669
SHE CHEERFULLY PROVOKES HIM

1079
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,046
Sure, I can.

1080
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,549
HIS PRIDE CONTROLS HIS WORDS

1081
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,342
Give me the chopsticks, please.

1082
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,389
If you look carefully,
they look like shrimp.

1083
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,891
If that's the case, then Tsuki,
you should eat it first.

1084
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,268
Okay, but if I eat it…

1085
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,396
-You don't eat it over at UDT?
-I thought Navy Seals eat stuff like this.

1086
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,690
I was still a soldier then.
I'm not active anymore.

1087
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,108
Here's the dinner service for tonight.

1088
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,693
Dinner service.

1089
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,112
No, I meant you should eat up.

1090
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,655
SHE LOVES CRAPPY JOKES LIKE THIS

1091
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,739
What is it?

1092
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,451
What do you want with your ramyeon?
The bracken?

1093
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,744
-You pick. Chef's choice.
-Mealworms?

1094
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,622
-Mealworms?
-A small portion, please.

1095
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,249
Oh, gosh.

1096
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,463
Did you try it?

1097
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,589
Should we go for it?

1098
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,888
-I think I vomited a bit just now.
-You're fine.

1099
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,809
SHE'S CHEWING IT PEACEFULLY
AFTER MAKING A FUSS

1100
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,104
Oh, wow.

1101
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,027
WOW… SHE'S REALLY SCARY

1102
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,445
-It's good, right?
-Is it good?

1103
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,113
Yes, it's good.

1104
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,531
My shoulders are getting tight.

1105
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,949
What a mess.

1106
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,659
-No choice.
-Eat up.

1107
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,245
I think we'll have to keep
eating this as long as we're here anyway.

1108
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,081
-We have to eat it. There's no choice.
-Acclimate your taste buds.

1109
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,125
But he said this is all protein.

1110
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,835
-It helps you lose weight.
-Total protein.

1111
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,754
It's the protein-rich food
of the future.

1112
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,671
That's a lot.

1113
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,882
I can't see it,
nor will I look at it.

1114
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,968
He's enjoying it.

1115
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,678
The portion doesn't get smaller.

1116
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,268
We were worried we wouldn't have
enough ramyeon, now there's too much.

1117
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,020
How do we have leftover ramyeon?

1118
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,189
-Hey, I'm full.
-It's like magic.

1119
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,024
-Let's save some for Jonathan.
-I'm on a diet.

1120
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,776
Anyone hungry? No one, right?

1121
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,114
You really hate it.

1122
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,540
You don't know
what this is, do you?

1123
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,918
-I can't take the smell.
-Give me just a bit. Just a little.

1124
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,211
Look at Jonathan.

1125
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,754
He keeps having convulsions.

1126
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,632
What's wrong with him?

1127
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,342
I think
he's turning into a zombie.

1128
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,471
-He keeps doing this. Like this.
-Hey, look. Look at his eyes.

1129
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,769
Something's wrong
with Jonathan.

1130
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,771
-His veins are all swollen.
-He's in a bad state.

1131
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,064
They're bulging like bracken.

1132
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:42,067
He's been like that for a while.
Let's bring him some ramyeon.

1133
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,069
-Jonathan.
-Jonathan.

1134
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,780
-He's sleeping. Leave him alone for now.
-Okay.

1135
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:12,472
THE JORDAN RIVER
THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH

1136
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,318
He seems hungry. He's breathing heavily.

1137
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,986
Then let's just give
him some noodles.

1138
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,987
Okay.

1139
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,280
Just some noodles.

1140
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,287
-Oppa, I brought you some ramyeon…
-The way he's moving is kind of weird.

1141
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,247
What is it? Go take it to him.

1142
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,377
Oppa, have some ramyeon.

1143
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,967
Oppa, have some ramyeon.

1144
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,868
I brought ramyeon.
You said you wanted it earlier.

1145
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,080
Oppa.

1146
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,790
Oppa!

1147
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,251
Something's wrong with my brother.
Could someone come here?

1148
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,586
-What? What is it?
-Oppa, get in here.

1149
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,463
Don't joke around.
He was fine earlier. What is it?

1150
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,132
Something's wrong with him.

1151
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,800
He's not moving.
He's not eating the ramyeon.

1152
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:12,718
He's fine.

1153
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,931
Hey, Jonathan. Hey!

1154
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,141
-Hey!
-What's going on?

1155
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,226
Oh, man. This is bad.

1156
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,061
What is it, oppa?

1157
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,690
Come on, hurry. Get in here. Now.

1158
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,316
-Oppa.
-What is it? What?

1159
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,068
-Oppa! Oppa, what's wrong?
-Jonathan!

1160
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,570
Oppa!

1161
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,239
-What is it?
-Oppa, what's wrong? Oppa, breathe!

1162
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,407
What's wrong with his veins?

1163
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,867
Oppa, what's wrong?

1164
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,784
Jonathan.

1165
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,662
Jonathan.

1166
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,627
