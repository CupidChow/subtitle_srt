00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,968
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,283
How about we each share
the first thing we want to do

5
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,119
when we get somewhere free of zombies?

6
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,333
I want to take a warm bath
at my parents' house

7
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,044
and have a meal made by my mom.

8
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,671
Oh, no! What do we do?

9
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,802
I want to sleep comfortably
without any worries.

10
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,053
-Oh, no!
-Stop!

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,181
There were many scary moments,

12
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,099
but it was great
when we were together, right?

13
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:04,939
Well, earlier…

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,985
Get away from me!

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,405
The door opened?

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,199
He's unconscious. He's not moving.

17
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,035
Wake up. Open your eyes!

18
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,871
Come on, don't joke around.
What's wrong with you?

19
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,998
-Everyone. Thank you and I'm sorry.
-Wait.

20
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,627
We're getting closer to death.

21
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,672
We're getting closer and closer to death,
don't you think?

22
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,383
Hey, get ahold of yourself.

23
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,970
What do we do? Where should we go?

24
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,390
We're going to die.
They're going to kill us all.

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,434
No!

26
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,686
We went through so much to come this far.

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,814
We have no choice.
If we get bitten, we die.

28
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,440
Na-rae!

29
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,109
Na-rae!

30
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,279
Oh no, he got bitten. No!

31
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,322
What do we do?

32
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,033
Let me tell you something.
The men only look out for themselves.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,245
You can't blame us.
Because our lives are on the line.

34
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,205
Where are you guys?

35
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,207
I'm so scared and cold.

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,334
But I can't go alone.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,420
We made it this far together.

38
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,381
You said we were family.

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,799
Where are you?

40
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,677
We have to get somewhere safe together.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,303
DinDin!

42
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,430
Please help me!

43
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,682
You killed them.

44
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,267
That's how we survived.

45
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,108
I found you.

46
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,825

ON THE SET OF THE DATING SHOW LOVE HUNTER

48
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,798
-Mics.
-Get the mics. Good luck.

49
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,804
-My goodness.
-Hello.

50
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,182
-Si-young, let's speak casually.
-Sure.

51
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,518
We're colleagues now, you know?

52
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,353
Aren't you younger than me?

53
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,646
I'm older than you.

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,440
-What year were you born?
-I'm 44 years old.

55
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,734
I was born in 1982. I'm 41.

56
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,987
What? No way!
I thought you were much younger.

57
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,905
Seriously?

58
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,617
THE CAST IN THE WAITING ROOM
ARE GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER

59
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,495
Everyone, this place is beyond exciting.

60
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,122
-It's getting hot in here.
-My goodness.

61
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,666
I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,751
Hello!

63
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,836
-I injured my leg.
-Do you have a brace?

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,546
-Oh, no.
-Yes, I do.

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,756
Does it throb?

66
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,175
Yes, it throbs.
I can't walk properly right now.

67
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,720
NA-RAE IS UNDERGOING PHYSICAL THERAPY
FOR HER TORN CRUCIATE LIGAMENT

68
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,723
-It's nice to meet you.
-My name is Tsuki.

69
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,851
-Are you Japanese? Hello.
-Yes. I look forward to working with you.

70
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,604
-Tsuki, what does your name mean?
-It means "the moon."

71
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,773
What about the tsukidashi
we eat at restaurants?

72
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,984
Gosh, Hong-chul.
Don't call her tsukidashi.

73
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,486
-Don't call her that.
-Yes, that's right.

74
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,570
Oh, it is tsukidashi?

75
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,905
-Tsukidashi.
-I'm sorry.

76
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,490
I didn't know. I'm very curious.

77
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,003
Hello, welcome.

78
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,964
This way.

79
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,840
Shall we get ready?

80
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,800
Sure.

81
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,100
We'll get started.

82
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,434
One, two, three.

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,771
I'm excited. Na-rae, I'm excited.

84
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,606
-We'll get started.
-Okay.

85
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,524
Let's go!

86
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,109
-We can do it.
-Okay, Love Hunter.

87
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,777
Today's guest is Lee Si-young.

88
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,529
6:57 P.M.
LOVE HUNTER FILMING BEGINS

89
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,989
-You all know her, right?
-Yes.

90
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,449
-Hello.
-Make yourself comfortable and watch.

91
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,536
We have a professional fighter
as a guest on Love Hunter today.

92
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,037
It's going to be fierce today.

93
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,207
Hello, I'm the main host of Love Hunter.

94
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,500
-It's finally starting.
-So energetic.

95
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,128
-It's finally starting. Let's go!
-So energetic.

96
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,464
When a man and a woman who just met
become intimate,

97
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,759
will they be able to fall in love?

98
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,720
-I'm really curious.
-Find out on Love Hunter.

99
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,471
-They're all meeting for the first time?
-Yes.

100
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,349
It's like a jungle here
and they're all hunters.

101
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,025
We'll get started right away.
That's how we do it on Love Hunter.

102
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,694
I want to participate too.
They go for it right away.

103
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,321
Things move fast nowadays.

104
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,656
-Right, they move really fast nowadays.
-Kiss her.

105
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,576
-Gosh, this is… Oh, my God!
-Wait a minute.

106
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,286
-What?
-Oh, my goodness.

107
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,163
-My gosh!
-That's too fast!

108
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,081
This show is too unpredictable.

109
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,624
-Out of nowhere?
-My heart's beating fast.

110
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,460
This is how we do it on Love Hunter.

111
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,879
Next, here is the second couple.

112
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,008
-My goodness!
-Oh, my!

113
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
-My goodness!
-Wow!

114
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,512
-They don't hesitate.
-Hey!

115
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,972
-Wow!
-I love it.

116
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,974
I want to participate.

117
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,984
-Things are getting hot already.
-Oh, my.

118
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,402
Then the next one up--

119
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,491
But the female guest of the third couple

120
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,367
seems a little shy.

121
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,454
Is she drunk?

122
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm curious to find out what will happen.

123
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,429
My goodness.

124
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,102
-What?
-What in the world?

125
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,062
That's too much, don't you think?

126
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,566
Wow, it's insane!

127
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,610
What the heck?

128
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,866
What's going on?

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,743
What's happening? What's that?

130
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,537
It's blood! What's going on?

131
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,455
-What's that?
-What do we do?

132
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,332
-What?
-Oh, my God!

133
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,503
What the hell is that?

134
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,171
What the heck is going on?

135
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,715
What's wrong with his neck?

136
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,842
What's that?

137
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,100
This is Zombieverse,
a world where zombies have appeared.

138
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,197
What? They're all leaving.

139
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,832
Now… You need to escape now!

140
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,250
You need to escape now!

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,878
You need to escape--

142
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,671
What?

143
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,261
No more information
will be provided to them from now on.

144
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,929
-Get out of here now.
-Quickly.

145
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,389
-Get out.
-Hey.

146
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,391
Wait for me.

147
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:00,062
From now, they must overcome challenges
by making split-second decisions.

148
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,403
Currently, this area is full of zombies.

149
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,161
Their first mission
is to safely escape the area.

150
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,296
The quest begins.

151
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,548
FIRST QUEST
ESCAPE THE AREA WHERE ZOMBIES APPEARED

152
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,802
WATCH HOW THESE FIVE ACT
IN THIS UNSCRIPTED SITUATION!

153
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,887
What do we do?

154
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,682
-Is there an exit?
-Where?

155
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,153
-Hey, come this way.
-Hey!

156
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,822
My goodness.

157
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,492
-Which way?
-This way?

158
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,498
What the hell?

159
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,878
Let's go.

160
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,846
Faster! This way!

161
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,224
Where is Na-rae?

162
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,435
What do I do? Just leave me here.

163
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,522
Hey, they're coming after us!

164
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,606
They're coming!

165
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,484
They're coming toward us.

166
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,696
Hey, they're coming!

167
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,698
Jeez.

168
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,657
Where do we go?

169
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,033
Hey, over there!

170
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,786
Hey, over there!

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,373
Wait for us!

172
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,166
Hey, wait for us!

173
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,626
Hey, they're coming toward us!

174
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,806
-What's going on?
-What the heck is this?

175
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,683
What do we do?

176
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,852
What do we do? Where should we go?

177
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,814
Will they fight back or run away?

178
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,232
Stay away from us!

179
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,110
Will they trust or betray one another?

180
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,031
If it were you, what would you do?

181
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,993
Welcome to Zombieverse.

182
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,036
Turn right!

183
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,079
Which way do we go?

184
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,332
RO HONG-CHUL

185
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,083
Na-rae, hurry!

186
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,794
LEE SI-YOUNG

187
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,754
Come up.

188
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,256
We have nowhere to go. It's blocked!

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,174
PARK NA-RAE

190
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,722
Hurry up!

191
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,723
DINDIN

192
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,060
TSUKI

193
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,521
JONATHAN, PATRICIA

194
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,773
YOO HEE-KWAN, DEX

ZOMBIEVERSE

197
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,196
-Let's go quickly.
-Hurry.

198
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,739
-I'm relieved.
-No zombies here?

199
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,074
-No one's here?
-It's the crew.

200
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,451
It's a production car. Get in.

201
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,494
Get in.

202
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,620
What a relief.

203
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,414
Hurry.

204
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,876
There's no cell service.
I can't connect to the Internet.

205
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,712
I'm very worried. I want to call my mom.

206
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,173
What's this?

207
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,050
-"Central Disaster Relief Headquarters…"
-Breaking news.

208
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,095
It appears that multiple people
have been infected

209
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,389
by an unknown disease
in downtown Mapo-gu, Seoul.

210
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,850
Around 7 p.m., on a street near Hongdae
with many restaurants and bars…

211
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,812
Breaking news.
The number of victims is rising

212
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,314
due to a riot
in Seoul's Mapo-gu college town.

213
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,774
We repeat.

214
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,236
Around 7 p.m. tonight
near Hongdae Sangsangmadang…

215
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,531
Further updates will be provided
as the situation unfolds.

216
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:44,203
9:12 P.M.
HEADING TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF SEOUL

217
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,872
I don't understand what's going on.

218
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,084
Do you think we're safe
now that we're out of Mapo-gu?

219
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,127
We came quite far.

220
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,337
It happened in Mapo-gu.
It should be safe here.

221
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,839
I feel like throwing up.

222
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,882
Hey, there's a supermarket.

223
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,717
-Where?
-Oh, it's a supermarket.

224
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,053
-What?
-Can I go buy some chocolate?

225
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,347
-This isn't the time. Seriously.
-It's closed.

226
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,057
-You want chocolate?
-I'm craving sweets.

227
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,308
Just get out then.

228
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,145
Hey, we have to stay together.

229
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,105
HE'S THE ONE WHO LEFT THEM
AS SOON AS IT STARTED

230
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,774
She injured her leg,
but she kept up with us quite well.

231
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,443
HE RAN OFF WITHOUT LOOKING BACK

232
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
You ran quite well.

233
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,114
Get out, Hong-chul. I mean it.

234
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:29,874
THERE ARE OTHER PASSENGERS
IN THE PRODUCTION VAN

235
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,585
Sir, what is this car for?

236
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,712
-How did the sound director get here?
-Exactly.

237
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,838
What was this car for?

238
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,966
How were we able to…
How was this car available?

239
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,218
-What happened to the others?
-I'm not sure.

240
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,137
-He wouldn't know.
-Seriously, what's going on?

241
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,265
Is this our audio team's van?

242
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,441
-But…
-I don't think he heard you.

243
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,734
-He didn't hear you.
-Sir.

244
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,153
-Are you okay?
-Come on.

245
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,074
Where are we going right now?

246
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,618
Where are we going right now?

247
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,163
The low gas warning light
came on a while back.

248
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,499
-Sorry?
-It came on a while back.

249
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,626
Really? But we can't stop.

250
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,921
A parking lot…

251
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,298
-A gas station.
-I mean, a gas station.

252
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,468
I feel really anxious. Seriously.

253
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,137
Can we just get off here? Should we?

254
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,473
-No, Si-young. That's nonsense.
-No, we can't.

255
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,557
We can't do that.

256
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,267
They might pop out around here.

257
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,853
Seriously, let's be honest among ourselves

258
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,772
and tell each other clearly

259
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,315
-if we get bitten.
-Yes.

260
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,399
We have to be honest.

261
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,609
-Yes.
-Even if you get scratched.

262
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,194
Even if it's just a scratch.

263
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,239
Sir, you have to promise to tell us
if you get bitten too.

264
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,156
Okay.

265
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,825
-It's a gas station!
-Where?

266
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,119
-Is the light on? It is!
-Sir, there's a gas station.

267
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,497
-There's a place with lights on.
-Let's close our windows just in case.

268
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,624
-Okay. Si-young, that one.
-Just in case.

269
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,042
DESERTED GAS STATION
GAS SELF-SERVICE

270
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,711
They have arrived at a new location.

271
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,475
-There's no one here.
-It's empty.

272
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,601
There's a car.

273
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,519
Where?

274
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,104
Over there too.

275
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,941
Did everyone abandon their cars?

276
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,776
Why would they do that?

277
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,374
-Sir.
-Don't remove the key.

278
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,167
-Leave the key.
-Don't remove the key.

279
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,460
Leave it plugged in.

280
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,004
What if you run away without me?

281
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,046
-No.
-Of course not.

282
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,381
-Please leave it in.
-No.

283
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,216
-No way.
-We wouldn't do that.

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,634
Please leave the key.

285
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,303
What if you run away without me?

286
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,763
What's wrong with him?

287
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,611
Please touch the anti-static pad
with your hand.

288
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,196
Please select the fuel type.

289
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,574
Please select the payment method.

290
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,076
Please swipe your rewards card--

291
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,953
Please insert your credit card.

292
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,832
Would you like a receipt?

293
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,626
Checking the credit card.

294
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,477
-He has the key.
-Did he take it?

295
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,728
I think he left it…

296
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,647
This is insane.

297
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
What do we do?

298
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,316
-Hey!
-What do we do?

299
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,817
-Hey.
-The car is out of gas right now.

300
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,782
What do we do? He got bitten again!

301
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,575
Lock the car!

302
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,869
-Lock the doors!
-What do we do?

303
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,997
-He's bleeding!
-Go outside with this.

304
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,707
Should I get out? What do I do?

305
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,001
-Where is he going? The key!
-No!

306
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,420
-We need the key. Where is he going?
-He's bleeding.

307
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,631
-Lock the car. Hurry.
-I already did.

308
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,009
-Hey, they keep coming.
-No!

309
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,803
-Where is he going?
-It's locked.

310
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,721
Watch where he's going. The key!

311
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,722
-Where did he go?
-There.

312
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,848
-Our driver.
-The car wash.

313
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,600
-The car wash.
-What?

314
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,978
He went inside the building.

315
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,856
What do we do?

316
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,233
We can't do anything now.

317
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,527
Hey, he's climbing up.

318
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,243
-What are they doing?
-Gosh.

319
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,619
What do we do?

320
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,579
-Getting bitten looks painful.
-Be quiet.

321
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,927
-I don't think they know we're here.
-Right.

322
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,429
-This is so scary.
-What do we do?

323
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,055
THE DRIVER IS DYING
THEY ARE THE ONLY SURVIVORS

324
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,973
It looks like…

325
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,020
you don't turn into a zombie right away.

326
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,566
Jeez, what do we do?

327
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,317
-I think he saw us.
-Stay still.

328
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,445
It's locked, so he can't come in.

329
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,905
What if the glass breaks?

330
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,242
-He can't see us.
-Another one is coming!

331
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,161
-Where?
-What should we do?

332
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,996
-They can't see us.
-Should we get out?

333
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,581
But we'll die if we do.

334
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,666
-Hey.
-Be quiet.

335
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,001
Stay still.

336
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,837
And…

337
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,796
I don't think…

338
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,507
I don't think they can see us.

339
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,509
-They don't seem to recognize objects.
-No.

340
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,095
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR THEM
TO CLEARLY SEE OBJECTS IN THE DARK

341
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,269
The diesel pump is ready for fueling.

342
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,898
Please open the fuel cap
and use the green fuel nozzle.

343
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,818
Are they responding to the sound?

344
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,111
What should we do?

345
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,279
This is…

346
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,698
Gosh, this is crazy.

347
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,825
Now that we're quiet,

348
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,035
they all went that way.

349
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,370
Wait. Are any of your songs on this?

350
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,622
-Our songs?
-Yes.

351
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,124
Let's play their songs
and drop the phone outside.

352
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,212
Don't drop it. Open the window a little,
then close it after you play the song.

353
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,380
-This…
-I'm scared to try.

354
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,673
I'll try it.

355
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,342
WOW, SI-YOUNG BRAVELY STEPS UP!

356
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,384
Okay, Si-young.

357
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,179
Si-young will end up doing most things.

358
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,765
Hey, don't play songs. Use a siren.

359
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,642
-Play an alarm.
-Change it to an alarm.

360
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,477
Should I change it to an alarm? Okay.

361
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,854
Why play an alarm? We can just make noise.

362
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,564
-Should I shout?
-Hey!

363
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,649
Hey!

364
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,363
-Hey, they're responding.
-The sound.

365
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,572
They respond to sound.

366
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,245
Be quiet.

367
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,126
THEY ENCOUNTER ZOMBIES AGAIN
AT THE GAS STATION

368
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,547
THEY CAN'T SEE WELL,
BUT THEY CLEARLY RESPONDED TO SOUND

369
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,009
Hey, he already refueled the car, right?

370
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,219
He didn't.

371
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,012
-He was about to but got caught.
-What do we do?

372
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,765
Where is he? He has the car key.

373
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,058
He's over there.

374
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,935
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THE DRIVER TOOK THE KEY

375
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:05,853
Then…

376
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,980
let's make some noise here,

377
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,107
go get the key, and refuel.

378
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,400
THEY NEED TO REFUEL
AND FIND THE KEY TO ESCAPE

379
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,611
You've pumped gas yourselves, right?
You know what to press?

380
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,155
The touch screen is really hard.

381
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,906
-You need a credit card.
-Do we have one?

382
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,284
-He selected diesel--
-He inserted a card already.

383
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,327
We just need to fuel up.

384
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,248
-Let's fill up first.
-Hong-chul would be the best.

385
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,041
-At pumping gas?
-Yes.

386
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,085
-Pumping gas…
-Because you're the most experienced.

387
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,712
-We set the timer.
-Pumping gas?

388
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,590
Then raise your hand
if you know how to pump gas.

389
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,008
-I know how.
-I do.

390
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,635
-I don't know how. I'm sorry.
-I really don't know how.

391
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,220
You really don't know how?

392
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,638
-I'm serious.
-Seriously?

393
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,015
-But you have a car.
-Do you know how?

394
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,726
-I do have a car, but…
-Your car isn't electric.

395
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,352
-You have a car too.
-Mine's electric.

396
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,937
Are you kidding? I know it's not.

397
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,439
She drives a Porsche!

398
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,815
I sold it.

399
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,859
Don't do this to me.

400
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,153
Wait, you can still pump gas
even if you sold your car.

401
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,905
I'm sorry. It's because of my leg.

402
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,198
-Right.
-Hey, but…

403
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,575
Right, her leg is injured.

404
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,452
I'm sorry to say this…

405
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,370
My leg is in pain too.

406
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,997
I feel pain in my leg too.

407
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,958
-I really feel pain in my leg.
-I'm sorry to say this,

408
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,336
but let's get serious now.
Can someone go do it?

409
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,963
I want to go, but I'm so scared.

410
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,090
Then I'll pump the gas.

411
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,467
Are you serious? But…

412
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,761
-Okay, then he goes first.
-Okay.

413
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,055
Those things over there
can make some loud noise.

414
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,349
There's a tin can and a water jug too.

415
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,850
But we have to get there.

416
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,561
Let's flip that over there
since they're not very fast.

417
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,647
-But who's going to do it?
-You.

418
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,691
-I go flip that over and then refuel?
-That won't work.

419
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,610
That's nonsense.
I'd be nuts to do that myself.

420
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,695
I'll do it.

421
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,782
No. You came all the way here
from another country to work.

422
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,242
-Go for it.
-Hong-chul, go for it.

423
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,701
You're 12 years older than me.

424
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,662
-I'm in the back.
-You ride motorcycles.

425
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,330
-Just come up.
-Fine.

426
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,790
When I make noise

427
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,251
and they rush over,
you'll close the door, won't you?

428
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,752
-No.
-Are you sure?

429
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,088
Don't you dare lock the door, okay?

430
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,714
-Got it, Si-young?
-This is exasperating.

431
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,049
-You must've been deceived a lot.
-Hong-chul,

432
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,467
what kind of life have you lived?

433
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,219
-You know I've been scammed.
-Yes, I do.

434
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,470
Okay. Then let's…

435
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,680
When you throw it,

436
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll check at what noise level
they actually come.

437
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,810
-With what?
-With the sound.

438
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,688
At what decibel level would they respond?

439
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,106
Great. You're very technical.

440
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,149
Let's try it then.

441
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,901
-Come right back in after refueling.
-Yes.

442
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,195
I'll throw it over there,
so you can pump here.

443
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,405
-Sounds good.
-Let's go.

444
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,282
-When they rush over there.
-Here we go.

445
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,825
Don't forget. I'm doing this.

446
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,620
Be careful.

447
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,498
DinDin, you have to fill it up.
All the way.

448
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,625
Be careful.

449
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,627
Don't close the door--

450
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,796
Oh, gosh. He made noise.

451
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,510
The quest begins.

452
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,594
BEGINNER'S QUEST
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION

453
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,764
They don't know.
Just don't make any noise.

454
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,099
REFUEL, GET THE KEY, DRIVE AWAY

455
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,393
Okay, you can go now.

456
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,603
When the door shuts, please check, okay?

457
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
In case it locks…

458
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,773
-Okay.
-Hong-chul, you have to go out that way.

459
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,067
Hong-chul is going after all.

460
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,072
Be careful.

461
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,826
Hurry up.

462
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,539
-Sorry, I'm too scared.
-Go.

463
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,595
Go quickly.

464
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,180
Please place your hand…

465
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,557
Please place your hand…

466
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,017
THE MACHINE MAKES A LOUD NOISE

467
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,393
-Please select…
-Damn it.

468
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,855
-Please select…
-Just go.

469
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,107
Please select the payment method.

470
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,612
Rewards card…

471
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,448
-Rewards card…
-Shit, what rewards card?

472
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,824
The card…

473
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,993
-Hong-chul, hurry!
-What do we do?

474
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,161
Oh, shit.

475
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,622
They saw us.

476
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,665
…you'll close the door, right?

477
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,375
No.

478
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,129
Lock the door.

479
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,092
-Jeez.
-Oh, my God.

480
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,480
How far did you get?

481
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,108
It asked me if I had rewards
and I pressed no.

482
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,150
Rewards?

483
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,361
-I see.
-When Hong-chul throws that, will you go?

484
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,403
-Yes.
-Will you?

485
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,748
What is he doing?

486
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,166
Because he's scared.

487
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,501
Gosh, seriously.

488
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,503
You exceeded the time limit.

489
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,505
IT RESET AS THE TIME LIMIT WAS EXCEEDED

490
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,465
-It can't be helped.
-That's what happens.

491
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,177
What is he waiting for?

492
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,556
Hold on.

493
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,226
-Good. Go now.
-I'll go now.

494
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,352
I'll go now.

495
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,938
-Hong-chul, don't move.
-DinDin.

496
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,022
Go now.

497
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,195
Please place-- Please select fuel type--

498
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,864
Please select the payment--

499
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,906
The fuel amount--

500
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,284
Rewards card-- The card--

501
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,916
Rewards card--

502
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,003
The card-- An error has occurred.

503
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,630
-The IC chip is not being recognized.
-Shit.

504
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,465
Slide the card in the magnetic…

505
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,927
-What's he doing?
-They can't come back now.

506
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,640
-Please check the payment amount.
-Okay.

507
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,684
Select the installment…

508
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,019
You need to keep going.

509
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,229
-No, I can't do it.
-You have to, quickly!

510
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,147
Go back out now.

511
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,940
The diesel pump is ready for fueling.

512
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,485
-Shit, it's not working.
-Really?

513
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,613
Do I have to hold onto it?

514
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,156
It's working, but he has to hold it.

515
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,490
He has to hold it?

516
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,034
THE NOZZLE LOCKING CLIP IS BROKEN

517
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,911
There should be something
to lock it in place.

518
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,721
Fueling has stopped.

519
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,682
A LOUD ALARM HAS GONE OFF!

520
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,392
Please continue fueling.

521
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,146
Fueling has stopped.

522
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,607
Please continue fueling.

523
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
-Please continue…
-Oh, no.

524
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,319
-No.
-What do we do?

525
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,529
-They're coming.
-They're coming.

526
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,703
-Oh, gosh.
-Look at him.

527
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,756
-Oh, no!
-What do we do?

528
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,216
They're coming.

529
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,759
Hurry!

530
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,728
-Hey.
-Be quiet.

531
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,527
-Great job.
-They're looking inside.

532
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,279
Hey, are you all right?

533
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,993
-I can't do it.
-Did you take it out?

534
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,119
I finished refueling.

535
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,912
-All done.
-Good job.

536
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,164
What decibel level was it?

537
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,165
TIME TO PRESENT THE RESULTS

538
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,709
-Take a look.
-Seriously?

539
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,670
If this reaches about zero,
they react to it.

540
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,839
-So how loud is that?
-What did you say?

541
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,677
It's roughly as loud as it was
when Hong-chul threw it.

542
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,346
ROUGHLY THIS LOUD?

543
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,682
THEY CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH AT THE RESEARCH

544
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,935
We don't need the device
to figure out that much.

545
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,936
-Sir.
-Hey.

546
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,813
Hey, seriously. What the hell?

547
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,024
We put our lives on the line just now.

548
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,985
Anyone can figure that out.
The zombies swarmed to the sound.

549
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,321
Why is the sound director here?

550
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,406
We don't need him. We can let him go.

551
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,201
-We just need to go get the key.
-Hey, hold on.

552
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,829
We only filled up 20,000 won worth of gas?

553
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,332
WITH THAT AMOUNT, THEY'D NEED TO
STOP AGAIN AT ANOTHER GAS STATION SOON

554
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,958
We can refuel. Let's do it again.

555
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,626
-Hey, over there…
-I'm going crazy.

556
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,337
Don't scold me like that.

557
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,838
No, I'm not scolding you.

558
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,631
-You were brave.
-I didn't mean it.

559
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,550
-I pumped the gas.
-Yes, you're the best.

560
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,135
Hey, this is a good opportunity.

561
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,137
-Let's consider this training.
-Training?

562
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,430
Let's take turns.

563
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,976
Let's see if you can be fast enough.

564
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,354
THE ONE WITH THE LEG INJURY
HAS BEEN SELECTED

565
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,230
A TRUE EGALITARIAN
HAS BEEN HERE ALL ALONG!

566
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,690
They're not as fast as you think.

567
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,233
You can't.

568
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,320
But everyone else isn't injured.
Why ask Na-rae?

569
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,946
Because, if she is to survive…

570
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,031
No, I'll go.

571
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,282
-I'll--
-No.

572
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,034
-But she wants to go.
-No.

573
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244
-Do you want to try it?
-I'll go out there.

574
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,662
-Okay.
-I'll go make noise.

575
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,122
Okay, make some noise.

576
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,749
Because Hong-chul's got a point.

577
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,876
-I need to be able to run around.
-No.

578
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,878
-Then…
-No, I'll really be fine.

579
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,547
-I'll go look around the other cars.
-Great.

580
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,675
Si-young and Tsuki can go together.

581
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,719
And bring back food if you see any.

582
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,222
WORRYING ABOUT FOOD LIKE THE ELDEST SHOULD

583
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,431
-Seriously?
-Go this way.

584
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,849
-I like sweets.
-Okay.

585
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,768
Honestly, I'm so hungry too.

586
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,021
-I want to eat something sweet.
-I really want some water.

587
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,899
Then I'll get out first. Follow me, okay?

588
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,692
DINDIN ENDS UP GOING AGAIN
(+SI-YOUNG AND TSUKI)

589
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,862
-Tsuki, please make noise wherever, okay?
-Okay.

590
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,614
Go now. They're far away.

591
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,408
Tsuki, be careful.

592
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:53,273
ALUMINUM TRASH CAN:
PERFECT FOR MAKING LOUD NOISES

593
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,736
Holy shit!

594
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,112
HE SAW A ZOMBIE INSIDE THE CAR

595
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,782
Sorry, Si-young. Get in now!

596
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,828
Hey, why is he screaming?

597
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,997
Hey, they're getting in. Open the door!

598
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,624
-The door!
-Sorry, Si-young. Get in now!

599
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,584
Pull it out.

600
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,218
What's with her?

601
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,314
-How is she going to get away?
-Oh, no. Those zombies.

602
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,482
They're following her.

603
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,572
-Over there in the back.
-There she is.

604
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:43,990
Wow, she's great.

605
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,326
I hear there are many ghosts in Japan.

606
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,162
What the heck are you talking about?

607
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,705
It's probably less scary for her.

608
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,542
-What's that sound?
-Oh, gosh!

609
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,555
HER SCREAMS WAKE UP
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CAR WASH

610
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,396
A new zombie has appeared.

611
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,581
He's following her.

612
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,500
-What's going on?
-Why is he following her?

613
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,918
How is he so fast?

614
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,131
How is he so fast, Si-young?

615
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,009
-He got faster all of a sudden.
-What's going on?

616
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,481
THIS ZOMBIE IS WAY FASTER
THAN OTHER ZOMBIES!

617
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,984
Maybe they get faster
when they hear a noise.

618
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,402
We're screwed.

619
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,696
What do we do?

620
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,450
-What do we do?
-The blue one is so fast.

621
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,039
There's Tsuki.

622
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,001
Hey, the fast one's chasing her.

623
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,421
A ZOMBIE WITH A FAST TOP SPEED
BUT A BROKEN STEERING WHEEL

624
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,511
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH GAS

625
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,139
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION:
REFUEL

626
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,182
Where is Tsuki?

627
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,902
Oh, no.

628
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,454
Wait. My chest hurts.

629
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,553
Oh, no. They can't get out of there.

630
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,057
He's too fast.
The one in the blue is too fast.

631
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,684
We need to rescue them. What should we do?

632
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,483
What do we do?

633
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,914
HE GETS SURROUNDED THE MOMENT HE STEPS OUT

634
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,383
HE UNINTENTIONALLY BECOMES A HERO
WHILE TRYING TO RUN AWAY

635
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:02,063
THEY LOOK FOR THE KEY
WHILE ZOMBIES CHASE AFTER HONG-CHUL

636
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,151
Hey, can you do it?

637
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,446
Hey. Do you think you can do it?

638
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,698
I'll keep watch.

639
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,369
Move. It won't come out.

640
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,998
HE DEFINITELY PUT THE KEY
INSIDE HIS CHEST POCKET

641
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,918
Wait, but his chest…

642
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,378
Careful, he's starting to move.

643
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,680
It won't come out…

644
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,897
What? What's wrong?

645
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,816
-Gosh, the blood.
-What's wrong?

646
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,443
The blood.

647
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,948
-The blood.
-Shoot.

648
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,575
What now?

649
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,910
Get it out now.

650
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,413
Careful.

651
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:09,172
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION:
GET THE KEY

652
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,679
A NEW ZOMBIE (FORMERLY THE DRIVER)
HAS BEEN ADDED

653
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,698
THIS ZOMBIE… HAS TERRIBLE BALANCE!

654
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,495
…A CAR BEGINS TO MOVE?

655
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,295
HE'S DRIVING THE CAR QUIETLY
TO ESCAPE FROM THE SCENE ALONE

656
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,885
HE NOTICES THE ESCAPEE

657
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,059
What?

658
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,311
Hong-chul, get out of the car.
We got the key.

659
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,270
-What?
-Get out now.

660
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,231
-We got the key.
-Okay. You punk.

661
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,690
I'll get out.

662
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,026
-Get out now.
-No, I can't.

663
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,694
-Get out now.
-Okay, fine.

664
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,238
What about parking?

665
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,448
You little…

666
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,283
Damn it.

667
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,789
THEY'RE READY TO ESCAPE!
EVERYONE JUST NEEDS TO GET IN THE CAR

668
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,165
Gosh, I'm scared.

669
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,917
Let's get in the car.

670
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,025
Go away!

671
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,826
-Get off!
-No!

672
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,996
No! Go away!

673
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,581
No!

674
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,382
What is he doing over there?

675
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,176
Hey, did you really get the key out?

676
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,427
Yes, we did.

677
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,513
I'm going crazy.

678
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,767
Are you okay?

679
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,852
You didn't get bitten?

680
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,729
DinDin, over there.

681
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,147
THE DRIVER HANGS AROUND HIS STOLEN CAR

682
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,773
Are you okay? What's wrong?

683
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,610
Step on it.

684
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,904
-It's working.
-I'm relieved.

685
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,280
Is everyone in?

686
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,285
-Step on it.
-Go.

687
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,745
Go. We can go now.

688
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,829
Go.

689
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,164
Just go.

690
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,501
Go!

691
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,923
-Darn it.
-Bye, you bastards.

692
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,966
Goodness.

693
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,427
ESCAPE THE GAS STATION:
DRIVE AWAY

694
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,721
Quest complete.

695
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,306
Everyone has survived.

696
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,353
ALL FIVE ESCAPED

697
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,354
I'm so annoyed.

698
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,858
I have no energy left.

699
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,698
It hurts. I bumped into something.

700
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,367
-That was so scary.
-Darn it.

701
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,827
Na-rae, you didn't get scratched?

702
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,496
-Did you get bitten?
-They grabbed my shoe.

703
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,873
-You didn't get bitten?
-Didn't Na-rae get bitten earlier?

704
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,416
Earlier… You saw it, didn't you?

705
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,751
-Look.
-Show us your foot.

706
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,419
-I said they got my shoe.
-Blood…

707
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,629
-Right.
-You're bleeding.

708
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,130
-No.
-Turn on the flashlight.

709
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,632
No, he didn't touch my skin.

710
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,050
Turn on the flashlight.

711
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,260
See?

712
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,428
Luckily, that part is…

713
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,097
-Because of the sock…
-Right.

714
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,640
She didn't get bitten thanks to the cast?

715
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,600
-Right.
-Blood just got smeared on it then?

716
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,103
DinDin, you got so much blood
splashed on your face.

717
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,813
I just got splashed, that's all.

718
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,439
You're the one who got…

719
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,941
What? You were right there.

720
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,527
-No, I meant…
-What if it got into your eyes?

721
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,696
-It's not good if it got into your eyes.
-No, it didn't.

722
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,989
My eyes are clean.

723
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,198
You saw that driver, right?

724
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,409
-It's because I'm tired.
-How long did it take for him to turn?

725
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,160
No, it didn't get into my eyes.

726
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,538
Gosh, that was seriously…
I'm even losing my voice.

727
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,622
DinDin.

728
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,249
Turn off the heater. I'm hot.

729
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,168
This is crazy.

730
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,087
Hot? Why do you feel so hot?

731
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,588
You didn't get bitten, did you?

732
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,007
-I didn't.
-You feel hot? It's cold.

733
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,300
It's so hot.

734
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,260
You can't be hot at this temperature.

735
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,928
Let me get some rest first.

736
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,722
I'll switch with you later.

737
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,265
I'm so hungry.

738
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,977
I'm really thirsty,
and to be honest, I want to sleep.

739
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,237
He keeps touching his eyes.

740
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,948
Why do you keep rubbing your eyes?

741
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:55,351
