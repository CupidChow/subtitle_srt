ONE MONTH AGO
HWANGCHON-RI

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,767
Son! Son!

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,353
-Oh, Mother, I could've gotten it.
-There you are.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,397
Why are you carrying
heavy stuff like that?

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,606
Oh, here. Try one.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,941
-Say, "Ah."
-Ah.

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,902
Oh, goodness. It's so tasty.

11
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,946
Even a pebble would taste good
if it came from you.

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,699
Oh, is that so?
Oh, you're such a good boy.

13
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,867
Mother, let me put on

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,326
-a fun show for you.
-All right.

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,747
Ta-da!

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,340
-What's that?
-What's that?

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,552
Mother. I'll be right back,
so just sit tight for a bit, okay?

18
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,387
Sir! Sir!

19
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,972
Sir!

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:03,021
THE 5 OF THEM ARE DEEP ASLEEP
IN COMPLETE DARKNESS

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,866
What is this?

22
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,785
Hey.

23
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,204
-Jonathan. Our hands.
-What?

24
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,498
Hyung, our hands are tied up.

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,749
Our legs, too.

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,376
-Noona, noona.
-Ah! I can't see anything.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,087
-It hurts.
-Our hands are tied up.

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,338
What's going on?

29
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,881
Why are my hands tied?

30
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,591
-Hyung!
-Hm?

31
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,926
-Patricia!
-What's going on?

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,011
-Hong-chul!
-Patricia.

33
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,930
-Patricia. Is she not here?
-Hong-chul.

34
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,728
I wanna live.

35
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,733
-It's not working.
-Our hands.

36
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,028
Like this?

37
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,908
I broke my ties.

38
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,911
I can get my hands out. I got it,

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,248
Dex, no!
It hurts! Stop! You're killing me.

40
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,125
-Seriously?
-They did a terrible job.

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,334
We're all untied now.

42
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,420
What else can we do?
Our hands are free, though.

43
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,131
-Hey!
-Na-rae!

44
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,132
Park Na-rae!

45
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,341
Park Na-rae!

46
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,384
Kkwachu!

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,718
Kkwachu!

48
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,470
-You in there?
-Doctor!

49
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,555
Kkwachu Hyung!

50
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,974
-Na-rae!
-Doc! Doctor!

51
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,191
6 HOURS AGO
HWANGCHON-RI TOWN HALL

52
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,113
THE 10TH TOWN CHIEF, LEE JUN-HYEOK

53
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,657
Man, I'm so tired. Wow.

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,575
Oh.

55
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,536
THEY ARRIVED AT THE PROVIDED LODGING
ROARING DRUNK

56
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm so sleepy.

57
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,873
I'm just now wiping of the blood.

58
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,375
-DinDin, there…
-It's an award plaque.

59
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,294
I'm so happy
we get to sleep somewhere warm.

60
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,211
I love it.

61
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,255
We'll get to sleep
lying down peacefully.

62
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,506
-Let's sleep.
-It's so nice.

63
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,758
I'm going to sleep now.
There's even a chamber pot, look.

64
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,635
-A chamber pot?
-A chamber pot.

65
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,887
-Wanna torment this lot?
-Oh, no.

66
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,139
-Just go to the toilet here at night.
-No, thanks.

67
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,266
Why is your arm like that?

68
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,392
Huh?

69
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,227
Gosh, what do I do?

70
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,770
THE BITE WOUND IS DEFINITELY WORSE
THAN THE DAY BEFORE

71
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,565
-It looks so gross.
-Jeez, your arm…

72
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,401
It must be so painful.

73
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,864
-Um, I'm sorry to say this…
-Wow. Seriously.

74
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,616
We've all been together
up until now, right?

75
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,618
-Yes, we have. And we will.
-You haven't turned into zombies yet.

76
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,161
-We won't. It'll be fine.
-We won't.

77
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,078
But you don't know.

78
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,830
Your wound has gotten worse, right? Hyung…

79
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,958
What are you talking about?
It's itchy, so I just scratched it.

80
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,920
-No. It's fine.
-Don't do that!

81
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,755
It's just my skin. Look! That's it.

82
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,342
Seriously, that's the problem.
We'll be defenseless at night.

83
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,593
-What if you turn suddenly?
-That's what I'm saying.

84
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,470
-Then we'll all die.
-How many hours have we been together?

85
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,763
-Yeah, we've been together…
-We haven't changed.

86
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,931
-…and we haven't changed.
-But that was during the day.

87
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,098
-But it's about time.
-Right.

88
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,016
Time for what?

89
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,601
Oh, oppa, it's time for you to go?

90
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,518
No.

91
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,437
-Then what if…
-Oppa, it must be your time.

92
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,356
You spend the night outside.

93
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,359
And then if you're still fine,
we'll be able to trust you completely.

94
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,319
I think the leader
should make the decision.

95
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,029
Are you kidding me? It's so cold.

96
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,281
It's cold out. This is the only warm room.

97
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,991
-It's freezing.
-It's so cold outside.

98
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,910
Not outside. There are many rooms.

99
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,328
It's so cold out there.

100
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,455
It's freezing there!
I thought I was outside.

101
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,581
We'll give you some blankets.

102
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,250
You shouldn't have been bitten then.

103
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,880
Dang it, you little punk.

104
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,173
Noona. Hold on.

105
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,217
-Seriously.
-You know I'm right. You know it.

106
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,469
-Which one should I bite?
-You're not wrong.

107
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,720
-Not me.
-Eenie…

108
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,180
-Did you enjoy it?
-…meenie.

109
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,556
It's been fun, right?

110
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,017
-Go outside.
-Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

111
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,145
How would they do it in Japan?
They should sleep outside, right?

112
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,357
Tsuki, please.

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,276
-The Japanese hate inconveniencing others.
-Right.

114
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,194
-It's too cold.
-Can you sleep in the same room?

115
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,738
-In Japan, the culture there…
-I don't know.

116
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,199
So, don't take this the wrong way.

117
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,243
We're not asking you to go outside.

118
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,120
-We'll just be in different rooms.
-Right.

119
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,747
-It's freezing out there. Freezing!
-It's really cold.

120
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,207
It's not that warm in here either.

121
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,709
It's so cold in here.

122
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,043
What do you mean? It's hot.

123
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,045
-It's not boiling hot though.
-Hey, wait. You find the room hot?

124
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,964
It's not hot at all.
Maybe only zombies find it hot.

125
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,632
-Suddenly it feels cold.
-It feels cold.

126
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,092
Isn't it? Then go sleep outside.

127
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,011
-It's cold there too.
-Gosh, seriously.

128
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,596
No, I don't want to go outside!

129
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,188
-Then let's keep the door open.
-Should we? Let's do that.

130
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,273
-Keep it open.
-And sleep.

131
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,400
-We can communicate.
-Just put your legs inside. Okay?

132
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,445
Let's go outside. Come on.

133
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,821
-Blankets.
-Give us some blankets.

134
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,197
We'll give you the thicker one.

135
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,534
-Good night, Na-rae.
-I'll open it for you.

136
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:30,371
-Open the door.
-It's so cold.

137
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,541
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO THEM…

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,460
Good night, Na-rae.

139
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,586
Good night.

140
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,130
Na-rae.

141
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,840
Park Na-rae!

142
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,677
-Good night.
-Oppa, good night.

143
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,721
-Doctor!
-Kkwachu Hyung!

144
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,139
Kkwachu!

145
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,475
Kkwachu!

146
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,155
It's freezing. So cold.

147
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,991
-My entire body hurts. Wait.
-My body is stiff.

148
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,118
I slept so uncomfortably.

149
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,120
My body is so stiff
from the cold.

150
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,664
Na-rae, we're locked in here!

151
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,501
What? Wait a second. We're cold.

152
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,461
-Are you cold? Wake up!
-Na-rae!

153
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,837
-Help us!
-Wake up.

154
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,881
Na-rae,
someone tied us up in here!

155
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,966
Someone locked us up!

156
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,635
-Kkwachu Hyung!
-We're locked in here!

157
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,552
The door is locked!

158
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,679
-Kkwachu!
-We can't get out!

159
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
Quiet down.

160
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,563
What's wrong?

161
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,981
-What's wrong with your face?
-What happened?

162
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,108
What happened?

163
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,150
The veins on your face.

164
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,194
-Your veins are bulging.
-Me too?

165
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,488
Your eyes are bloodshot too.
What do I look like?

166
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,405
Yours are red too.

167
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,576
Na-rae's condition worsened.

168
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,791
I can't move my arm.
Maybe because we slept in the cold?

169
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,834
Hold on.

170
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,879
Kkwachu Hyung's condition worsened.

171
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,465
I can't move my left arm.

172
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
I can't move my right arm.

173
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,428
Na-rae, someone tied us up in here!

174
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,806
-I'm sure you're sleeping fine. What now?
-Kkwachu Hyung!

175
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,350
Please open the door. Please!

176
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,894
-What?
-Wait, who locked this?

177
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,938
Did you lock it to keep us out?

178
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,691
-I think the town chief did it.
-Oh, gosh.

179
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,443
-The drinks we had…
-He must've drugged us.

180
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,778
-…he must have drugged it.
-Okay.

181
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,322
If only Hong-chul were missing,
I'd assume he had fled.

182
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,825
-Yeah.
-But Patricia is missing too.

183
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,578
-So why did you kick us out?
-Exactly.

184
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,290
-Kick us out?
-Exactly.

185
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,251
-So why did you kick us out?
-Exactly.

186
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,670
-This isn't the time to talk about that!
-Na-rae.

187
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,968
-My arm isn't working.
-My arm. It feels weird.

188
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,347
THE TABLES HAVE TURNED
FOR THE HALF-ZOMBIES AND THE HUMANS

189
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,766
Doctor! Na-rae!

190
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,685
We don't have the key.

191
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,354
Go look for it on your side.
In your room.

192
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,023
Wait a second.

193
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,066
"Go look for it on your side"?

194
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,402
-"Go look"?
-Are you ordering me around?

195
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,820
-He didn't mean to.
-No.

196
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,031
Na-rae, it's because we're desperate.

197
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,909
We're sorry, he misspoke. We're sorry.

198
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,577
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,623
Na-rae. We're friends.
Our fate depends on you and oppa.

200
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,292
I'm sorry, but…

201
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,793
"I'm sorry, but"?

202
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
-I'm truly sorry.
-Okay.

203
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,839
Please find the key and help us.

204
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,924
THEY'RE BOWING DOWN AND PLEADING!

205
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,383
It'd be great if you could help us.

206
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,427
You're not standing, are you?
You're all on your knees?

207
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,470
-Of course.
-Yeah.

208
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,721
-We believe you.
-Of course.

209
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,890
Try asking more sincerely.

210
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,101
Na-rae, Na-rae, Na-rae! Kkwachu oppa,

211
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,605
we've been through
so many crises together.

212
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,148
I told you I can take care of myself.

213
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,816
-Sit down here.
-What do we do?

214
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,193
-What's this?
-Clothes. Clothes.

215
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,613
Whoa!

216
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,825
SI-YOUNG'S PLEA CONVINCED THE ZOMBIES

217
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,662
There are five of us in here.
Help us just this once.

218
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,497
-Please save us.
-Noona.

219
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,916
-I do feel bad for Si-young though.
-I'm so scared.

220
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,584
-It's not like we can just save her.
-I know.

221
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,336
-Noona, Kkwachu Hyung.
-Yeah?

222
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,131
Listen, we stayed with you
even though you became half-zombies.

223
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,093
Don't call them half-zombies, yeah?
They're regular human beings.

224
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,052
-Watch what you say.
-I don't feel so good

225
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,053
after sleeping out here.

226
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
Na-rae, you're a hero.

227
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,597
Okay, seriously.

228
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
I'll help because Si-young
gave me this jacket.

229
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,394
Oh, thank you so, so much.

230
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,603
Thank you.

231
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,773
A new quest has been created.

232
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,692
ESCAPE THE ROOM
FIND A WAY TO OPEN THE LOCK

233
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,321
This is the last door left.
The only other room here.

234
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,241
-What's this room for?
-Oh, my. Oppa.

235
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,994
What's going on?
What's this?

236
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,874
THEY DISCOVER A CCTV MONITORING ROOM

237
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,918
-What's this? These are real.
-Wait.

238
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,837
Wait. There they are.

239
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,963
-Jonathan and Si-young.
-Right.

240
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,798
Wave your hand if you can hear me.

241
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,592
They can hear us.

242
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,635
-They can hear us.
-Then what should we do?

243
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,597
Let's tell them to go
to the other door, over there.

244
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,098
They should move toward the center.

245
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,308
Listen, you five!

246
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,934
Take three steps back.

247
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,354
-Wait. Left foot first.
-One, two, three.

248
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,524
-One, wait… Hang on.
-Left foot? Left foot!

249
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,943
-But your left foot is my right foot.
-It doesn't work.

250
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,153
Si-young's left foot.

251
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,404
-This is funny.
-Hey.

252
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
They're not synchronized at all.

253
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,700
One, two.

254
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,578
-One, two.
-One, two. Be careful.

255
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,455
-Is it working? Is it?
-No.

256
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,458
Jonathan, here, we need to move together.
At the same time when we say two.

257
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,959
HE CAN'T EVEN OPEN HIS EYES TO WALK

258
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,919
-Should we move forward again?
-Yeah.

259
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,921
-Okay. One, two.
-One, two.

260
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,424
-Hey, don't move forward.
-Don't move forward.

261
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,301
Si-young, turn counterclockwise.

262
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,345
-This way. One.
-One, two.

263
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,555
-Two.
-But why are they asking us to do this?

264
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,223
THEY'RE BEING TRAINED LIKE DOGS

265
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,100
There's a wardrobe in front of you.

266
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,018
Open it.

267
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,519
-DinDin and Si-young.
-Open this?

268
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,105
There's a wardrobe
by DinDin and Si-young. Open it.

269
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,190
-Okay, Doctor.
-That's it.

270
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,529
-What's wrong? What?
-What?

271
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,031
BOWLS: STAINLESS STEEL BOWLS
FROM THE TOWN FESTIVAL

272
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,199
They're rice bowls!

273
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,285
They're just rice bowls.
It's okay, they're harmless.

274
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,371
They're harmless. It's fine.
There are no zombies.

275
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,497
Wait a moment.

276
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,415
So why are you making us open this?

277
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,876
Well, we don't know what's what…

278
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,836
-Wait. DinDin.
-Did he just yell at us

279
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,922
-about opening the door?
-Did you yell at us?

280
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,383
I'm gonna kill them when I get out.

281
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,510
DinDin. DinDin.

282
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,762
-He didn't yell at you.
-No, he didn't.

283
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,847
HE SPEAKS IN A NEW TONE
TO MANAGE THE SITUATION

284
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm sorry.

285
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,184
We're trying to figure it out too,

286
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,102
DinDin.

287
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,396
-He didn't.
-I didn't yell at you.

288
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,147
What did you do wrong, DinDin?

289
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,066
I raised my voice.

290
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,401
That's right.

291
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,693
THANKFULLY, NA-RAE
ISN'T AS ANGRY ANYMORE

292
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,070
-Yes, you did.
-Yes.

293
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,530
-It's all our fault. It is.
-Let's hurry.

294
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,365
It was a misunderstanding.

295
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,325
-Now…
-I'll kill them right away, really.

AT THE ZOMBIE MOTHER'S DINNER TABLE

302
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,768
Over there! There!

303
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,061
-What the?
-Oppa!

304
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
SHE'S BEEN STARVING,
INSISTING ONLY ON LIVE PREY

305

Help! Save us!

306
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,654
-Wait.
-Stay calm.

307
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,948
Look, she's tied over there. She's tied.

308
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,408
Hey, she can't come closer.

309
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,909
Is that right?

310
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,327
She can't reach us.

311
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,746
HER MOVEMENT IS RESTRICTED
AS SHE'S TIED TO A ROPE

312
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,542
Did she recognize the town chief earlier?

313
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,754
Mother, it's me. Mother. Mother?

No, she doesn't recognize anyone.
She doesn't.

318
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:45,973
FOOD SHOULDN'T TALK

319
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,974
She can't.

320
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,602
What if we start a fire with the candles?

321
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,811
Huh? What?

322
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,271
CANDLES: LAVENDER-SCENTED.
CAREFUL, OR YOU'LL BECOME COOKED MEAT.

323
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,731
Wait, she can't come over here.

324
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,317
The candles. That's it, yeah.

325
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,694
Look, the way it's tied.

326
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,738
It's a boating knot.

327
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,615
You tie it that way
so you can easily undo it.

328
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,908
Wow.

329
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,455
Like this? Like this?

330
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,042
If I pull at it a little,
it might come undone.

331
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,127
-Patricia.
-Should we pull it together?

332
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,420
-Where should I hold on?
-I'm sorry.

333
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,338
Oppa.

334
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,048
-I think it got tighter.
-Oppa.

335
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,591
IT'S TIED QUITE TIGHTLY NOW

336
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,676
-It's got even tighter.
-Gosh, oppa.

337
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
-It got even tighter. Oh, jeez.
-Hold on.

338
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,514
Let's think. Let's think.

339
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,224
-Like this…
-Oh?

340
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,267
Hey, it worked.

341
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,644
THE FOOD WASN'T PACKAGED PROPERLY

342
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,103
Hey, I think it'll work.

343
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,522
What if that snaps?

344
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,106
This one, how do you do it?

345
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,191
I got it.

346
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,192
Ma'am.

347
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,735
Please, ma'am. I wanna live.

348
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,237
-Ma'am. Almost there.
-I got it.

349
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,947
-Okay, great. I've got it.
-Almost.

350
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,782
Oppa, wait, one second.

351
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,535
-Oppa, were you gonna betray us?
-Hey, I…

352
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,037
-You were. Okay.
-No, I didn't do this. Trust me.

353
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,540
-She must be hungry.
-Oppa!

354
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,501
Hey, I got it. Almost. Wait.

355
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,044
SHE HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO WATCH HER PREY GET AWAY

356
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,337
Let's get outside first.

357
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,007
It's locked from the outside.

358
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,218
Is it? Can we check that side over there?

359
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,845
-Which side?
-Can you draw her attention?

360
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,806

-What do we do?
-It's blood. Blood!

THE OLD LADY CAN'T BELIEVE HER EARS

379
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,975
There's no way to get out of here.
There's no door either.

380
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:53,893
The window!

381
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,562
-What?
-It's flapping. There.

382
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,230
THEY DISCOVER A SMALL WINDOW
IN THE BACK

383
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,441
-Isn't that a window?
-But can we get over there?

384
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,570
Not to mention,
we have to climb all the way up there.

385
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,156
-We need a step. Wait. Okay.
-Let's make it fair.

386
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,199
It's risky
to be in front of her.

387
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,035
-Right. Right.
-She can reach over there.

388
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,495
We'll distract her, then one person
goes over there to stack something.

389
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,997
-Okay. Yeah.
-Then we'll switch.

390
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,457
And the other person distracts her.

391
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,416
Do you wanna go there first?

392
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,710
Sure. Okay, Oppa.

393
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,712
I mean, you normally shouldn't make
the other person go first, right?

394
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,297
Should I go first then? You can do it.

395
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,132
You go first, Oppa. Then I'll do it.

396
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,634
First, that basket there.

397
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,177
I'll draw her attention this way.

398
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,345
You put something there.

399
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,763
-Oppa.
-Yes?

400
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,847
-Oppa.
-Don't worry.

401
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,223
-You trust me, right?
-Yeah, completely.

402
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,433
-Absolutely.
-I trust you too.

403
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,062
Ma'am. Here.
Here, here, here. Hold this, please.

404
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,522
Do you want to go first or should I?

405
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,483
Oh!

406
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,400
You little…

407
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,860
Gosh. She's abandoning me, jeez.

408
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,487
PATRICIA STABS HIM IN THE BACK FIRST!

409
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,657
Oh, come on.
Wow, Patricia. I can't believe her!

410
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,452
HE CAN'T JUST LET HER ABANDON HIM

411
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,703
Hey! Oh, gosh!

412
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,915
-Yah!
-Hey, wait!

413
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,005
EMERGENCY!
HER PANTS ARE ABOUT TO FALL DOWN

414
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,758
Hey!

415
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,593
Oppa!

416
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,844
Did you make it?

417
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,763
PATRICIA ESCAPES FIRST!
HONG-CHUL DID NOT SEE THIS COMING!

418
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,682
-Oppa!
-Yeah?

419
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,599
Wait.

420
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,768
I'll come back.

421
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,438
Oh, no. This is so scary.

422
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,857
HONG-CHUL GETS BETRAYED
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 31 HOURS

423
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,984
MEANWHILE, AT DOG TRAINING

424
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:25,901
One, two.

425
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,695
One, two.

426
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,905
I think the key is inside the jewelry box.

427
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,031
Something weird.

428
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,951
Some squeaky thing. Dentures too.

429
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,162
It's important for someone.
Don't throw it away.

430
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,580
Keep the denture.

431
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,250
-Take four steps back.
-Four steps.

432
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,960
One, two.

433
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,295
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED
FROM THE CONTINUOUS TRAINING

434
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,255
One…

435
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,590
Look behind Tsuki and Jonathan.

436
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,843
Is this it? What is this fruit called?

437
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,885
What is it?

438
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,637
Aren't they ripe persimmons?

439
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,889
Ripe persimmons?

440
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,516
Ripe persimmons!

441
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,184
-Ripe persimmons?
-Yeah.

442
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,562
Are they well-ripened?

443
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,397
Come on. We're really suffering over here!

444
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,066
-I don't really know either.
-Seriously.

445
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,818
The key could be in them, right?

446
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,279
-You might find the key as you eat them.
-Gosh.

447
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,159
THEY GROW EXHAUSTED

448
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,121
AT THE HALF-ZOMBIES' JOKES

449
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,081
I found something.

450
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,834
Shoot, it's the chamber pot. Dang it!

451
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,169
-Are you okay?
-A chamber pot!

452
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,628
What's a chamber pot?

453
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,006
You pee in it.

454
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,340
Is there anything inside?

455
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,759
-It stinks.
-Dang it.

456
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,344
HALF-FULL CHAMBER POT:
A PORTABLE TOILET USED BY MAYBE 50 PEOPLE

457
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,804
It's partly full. Dang it.

458
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,972
There's a chamber pot?

459
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
-Yeah.
-Open the lid.

460
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,142
-Did you put your hand inside?
-Yeah!

461
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,353
-What's inside?
-This isn't gonna work.

462
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,564
THE LEADER HAS BLOWN UP

463
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,483
-When I get out…
-Yeah?

464
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,109
…I'll kill both of you immediately.

465
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,903
-I'm gonna kill you too.
-Fine.

466
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,112
-Wait. No.
-Listen. Earlier…

467
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,906
-Don't do this, seriously.
-No. Earlier,

468
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,908
I saw a wooden board earlier over there.

469
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,618
-I see.
-The Senior Community Center sign.

470
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,411
-Let's break down the door.
-Let's go to the back.

471
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,580
-Let's get out, first.
-To the back. One, two.

472
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,791
-Wait.
-They're breaking down the door?

473
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,335
Wait! One second! Hold on! Wait!

474
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,003
Wait. Stay calm. Take it easy.

475
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,880
-Everyone, I got the board.
-You got it?

476
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,341
The quest has been suspended.

477
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,886
-Oppa, run!
-Stop.

478
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,846
HONG-CHUL ALSO ATTEMPTS
TO ESCAPE USING A TOOL

479
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,431
Over here, here, here, here.

480
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,850
-No. Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

481
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,019
-Oh, gosh, ma'am.
-Oppa, run!

482
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,479
Uh, please, ma'am.

483
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,314
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I'm sorry.

484
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,524
One, two, three.

485
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
Oh, jeez.

486
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,110
One, two, three.

487
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,361
Okay, one more time.

488
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,362
Oppa.

489
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,530
SHE'S COMPLETELY DRAINED

490
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,573
-I'm so sorry, ma'am.
-Oppa.

491
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,037
Okay, one last time.

492
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,455
One, two, three.

493
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,124
-Okay! It's open.
-We did it!

494
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,212
OW! THE KNEECAPS!!

495
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,676
My shoulder hurts.

496
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,094
Oppa, are you okay?

497
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,304
-Are you okay?
-It's dislocated.

498
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,222
Okay!

499
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,306
We did it!

500
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,474
Hey, that worked.

501
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,143
Let's kill them.

502
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,523
-Wait. We…
-Hold on. Listen.

503
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,984
No.
No need to explain. Nope, it's fine.

504
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,069
-Jonathan.
-Who tied you up?

505
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,404
-You weren't lying.
-Wait. They've turned so pale.

506
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,072
-One.
-Come on.

507
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,408
It's because we slept
in the cold room without any heating.

508
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,701
-Your veins are bulging out.
-It was cold.

509
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,619
-On your right side.
-Wow, look here.

510
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,954
-Why it get so cold?
-This room is nice.

511
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,414
AS EXPECTED,
THE HALF-ZOMBIES DON'T LOOK SO GOOD

512
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
Come on. Let's go.

513
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,333
It's what happens
when you sleep in the cold.

514
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,543
-Try it.
-Watch your legs.

515
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,669
One, two.

516
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,838
-Let's go with them.
-We'll come too. Okay.

517
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,882
Wait. Hold on.
We'll go out first.

518
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,092
Fine. Man, you're so on edge.

519
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,469
-Why are you being like that?
-Everyone out?

520
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,014
-Yeah.
-One, two.

521
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,309
One, two. One…

522
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,435
This is working.

523
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,104
One, two.

524
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,981
FIVE OUT OF SEVEN ESCAPED

525
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,316
Slowly.

526
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,486
Gosh, Oppa, thank you so much, really.

527
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,863
No, you did it yourself.

528
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,781
You even let me go first.

529
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,116
-I let you?
-Thank you.

530
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,659
-I let you go first? Sure.
-Thank you.

531
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,329
-You did great.
-Ouch. That stings.

532
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,748
TWO ESCAPED

533
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,796
One, two.

534
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,716
One, two.

535
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,384
One, two.

536
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,303
One, two.

537
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,555
Wait.

538
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,893
Which way should we go?

539
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,102
Let's hide first.

540
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,314
They've arrived at a new place.

541
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,691
-Let's go.
-One, two.

542
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,110
-One, two.
-One, two.

543
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,030
-One, two, one.
-One, two, one.

544
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,406
They'll come if we turn
the lights on, right?

545
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,491
Over there.

546
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,500
Let's go this way. To the right.

547
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,584
This way?

548
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,920
-One, two.
-One, two.

549
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,213
-One, two.
-One, two.

550
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,006
-One.
-One, two.

551
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,633
They must not know
we got out, right?

552
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,760
I don't know.
We have to get out of here now.

553
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,554
Darn it.

554
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,101
Two… One…

555
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,228
Anything here? Look around.

556
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,729
I see something. There.

557
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,564
Isn't that a saw on the right?
A saw?

558
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,565
Yes, there is.

559
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,860
-Cable cutters over there.
-Cable cutters? Nice. Great.

560
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,155
-Let's cut it. Come on.
-Yeah.

561
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,159
I can't believe this happened.

562
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,579
That's much better.

563
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,420
We can hide in here.

564
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,841
IT'S QUIET IN THE FACTORY
AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE AROUND

565
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,759
There's plenty of space up there
we can go.

566
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,679
Shouldn't we hide somewhere up there,
at least until the sun comes up?

567
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,763
It's dangerous, so…

568
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,182
-Everyone, put them on.
-Everyone? No, I'm good.

569
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,059
These must belong
to the factory employees.

570
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,394
We can hit our heads.

571
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,604
Let's go and look first.

572
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,939
-Okay.
-Think about what to do.

573
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,234
-Si-young.
-Let's go look.

574
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,586
I'm going that way.

575
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,214
Are you all right?

576
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,885
-I'm scared.
-Careful.

577
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,014
Careful. Careful.

578
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,477
It's the safest here, don't you think?

579
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,353
We can defend ourselves here
when they come up.

580
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,773
-We can block them here.
-Since it's steep.

581
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,155
What was that sound?
I heard something. Is there a zombie?

582
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,410
There are zombies.

583
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,854
THESE ARE THE WORST ZOMBIES
THEY'VE SEEN BY FAR

584
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,276
What the…

585
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,907
FACTORY FULL OF ZOMBIES
A FILIAL LOVE GONE WRONG

586
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,202
There's a cage.

587
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,374
Someone locked up the zombies
in here.

588
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,084
Look over there.

589
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,796
Someone locked them in here.

590
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,173
It's like a zombie prison.

591
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,009
-It looks awful.
-What happened? Who did this?

592
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,974
What do we do?

593
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,904
Oh, no!

594
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,907
Hide. Hide. Everyone, hide.

595
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,200
Get away from me!

596
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,245
What's all this, huh?

597
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,496
Get over there!

598
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,665
It's the town chief.

599
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,086
You little…

600
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,011
The town chief.
He must have done all this.

601
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:36,766
THEY'VE BEEN HANDLING AND KEEPING
THOSE WHO WERE ZOMBIFIED BY MOTHER

602
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,358
Those jerks.

603
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
Shoo! Away. Away!

604
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,368
Don't you dare.

605
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,206
Hey, hey! Block them.
Block them. Block them.

606
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,420
Hyung, what happened to your arm?

607
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,464
Is that… Isn't that blood?

608
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,008
Go bring the iodine.

609
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,135
Now that I've gotten hurt,

610
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,679
I feel braver.

611
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,767
I wanna get those punks
and crush them in the machine.

612
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,852
So what happened, hyung?

613
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,854
My mother…

614
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,650
They tied her up like a dog and ran away.

615
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,693
-What?
-Those punks!

616
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,405
Mother!

617
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,324
What happened?

618
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,535
Who did this? Get up. Get up.

619
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,246
Get up. Come on.

620
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:43,959
Mother!

621
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,835
It's me, your son!

622
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,004
I'm your son.

623
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,633
Darn it, what the heck? What the heck?

624
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,512
Mother, are you okay? Those punks.

625
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,641
Mother, just sit tight, okay?

626
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,268
Sit tight.

627
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,985
Those little…

628
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,989
I think they're talking about us.

629
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,866
I told you
not to roam around, didn't I?

630
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,703
Didn't I?

631
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,207
THEY LET OUT A STRONG REACTION
TO THE VICIOUS BLOW

632
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,252
Hold on.

633
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,586
What was that sound?

634
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,173
There's a rat in here. A very big one.

635
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,384
Isn't there?

636
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,846
Over there,

637
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,389
there,

638
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,725
-and there.
-There.

639
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,143
-Look around.
-Okay.

640
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,061
Hey, you guys come with me.

641
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,188
What do we do?

642
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,358
Hide all you want!

643
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,986
-Come on.
-Stay low.

644
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,070
Let's get out of here.

645
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,530
I'll go up this way.

646
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,949
You go that way. And you go that way.

647
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,912
I think it'll be better
to go over there.

648
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,664
HIDE-AND-SEEK
HIDE FROM THE TOWN CHIEF'S MEN

649
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,208
THE FACTORY'S SECOND FLOOR ISN'T BIG

650
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,753
THEY NEED TO SEPARATE

655
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,039

LEE SI-YOUNG, DINDIN, TSUKI

660
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,978
You better hope
I don't find you.

661
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,662
You all are like a rat in a trap.

662
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,503
You don't see them?

663
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,095

THE TOWN CHIEF'S UNDERLINGS
HAVE FINISHED THEIR SEARCH

666
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,799
Step aside.

667
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,925
Okay, hyung.

668
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,969
My goodness.

669
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,806
I got you! There you are.

670
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,558
What are you doing here?

671
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,185
No!

672
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,395
-What are you waiting for?
-No!

673
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,813
Come on. Get her!

674
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,982
Help! Si-young!

675
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,859
Stay still!

676
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,028
Get her.

677
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,155
Where do you think you're going?
Stop right there.

678
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,824
Stop! Where do you think you're going?

679
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,201
-Hold on to her tightly.
-Take her.

680
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,037
Hold her as you go down.
I got your back.

681
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,955
And clean this place up. Clean it up!

682
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,333
Clear the way for Jun-hyeok.

683
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,751
Don't try to run, just follow him.

684
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,590
-Hey, open the door.
-Bring her.

685
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,884
Hey, put her up here.

686
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,844
-Go up.
-Hyung, I'll do it. Yeah.

687
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,554
Get up. Now.

688
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,392
Oh, God! No!

689
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,269
-Stay in there, okay?
-Oh, no!

690
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,940
THE PRISONER NEXT DOOR WELCOMES HER

691
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,318
You can't do this.
You can't do this to me!

692
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,070
Make sure it's locked.

693
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,364
Yes, hyung.
We won't make the same mistake.

694
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,741
Look. It's locked tight this time.

695
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,080
-Hyung, what happened?
-I think Tsuki got caught.

696
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,881
What do I do?

697
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,300
Move aside. Move, move!

698
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,178
What are you doing? Stop that.

699
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,432
What is that?

700
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,268
Listen carefully.

701
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,144
Where are the rest of them?

702
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,688
I don't know.

703
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,814
Tell me now!

704
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,775
I said I don't know. I really don't.

705
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,153
I really don't know,
but I don't think they're in here.

706
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,905
-I was the only one here.
-Go.

707
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
THE YOUNGEST COMMENDABLY
DOESN'T BETRAY THEM

708
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,367
-Go, go.
-I'm really scared.

709
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,910
Listen out there!

710
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,580
I'll find you no matter what.

711
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,963
DinDin.

712
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,341
DinDin. Dex?

713
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
THEY EMERGE FROM THEIR HIDING SPOTS

714
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,303
-Jonathan.
-Yeah?

715
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,554
-Where is Dex?
-Come out, Jonathan.

716
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,180
-Where's Jonathan?
-He's coming down.

717
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,183
Tsuki.

718
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,184
Yeah?

719
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,020
Are you okay?

720
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,314
I'm… I'm not okay.

721
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,607
SHE'S STUTTERING DUE TO FEAR

722
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,734
-I'm not okay.
-Hang in there, Tsuki.

723
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,110
We'll rescue you.

724
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,447
Help me. Please.

725
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,991
THEY MUST RESCUE HER
WHILE THE TOWN CHIEF IS AWAY

726
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,409
But the problem is,

727
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,621
it's too dangerous for us to go ourselves.

728
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:59,042
Oh, if Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung were here,
they could have gone and saved her.

729
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,253
We shouldn't have abandoned them.

730
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,089
We should've brought them along.

731
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,259
Actually, it wasn't me who abandoned them.

732
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,847
When I get out,

733
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,766
I'll kill both of you immediately.

734
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,434
I'm going to kill you too.

735
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,811
-Let's go with them.
-Wait. Hold on. We'll go out first.

736
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,772
Why are you being like that?

737
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,318
THEY HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES

738
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,614
Is it that way?

739
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,201
Did they really go that way? No way.

740
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,787
Why can't we walk properly?

741
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,957
I keep… I keep slowing down.

742
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,166
Really?

743
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,841
-Dang.
-Gosh, my heart. Seriously.

744
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,760
We can't let our guard down here either.

745
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,261
Oh, jeez.

746
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,681
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SCREAM
IN A PLACE FILLED WITH ZOMBIES

747
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,183
-Oh, man.
-What? What's this?

748
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,310
Be careful.

749
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,438
Oh, shoot!

750
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,899
What was that?

751
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,109
Come on.

752
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,778
-Jeez.
-Huh?

753
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,822
-I hear something.
-My brother's voice.

754
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,703
Si-young! I'm still here!

755
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,123
We need to go now.

756
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,416
Seriously?

757
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,459
-You scared me.
-Oh, hey.

758
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,794
-You scared me.
-What's this? What the heck?

759
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,466
Oh, darn.

760
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,427
Oppa.
Tsuki is locked up over there.

761
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,469
Oh, shoot!

762
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,972
Hong-chul! Help me!

763
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,227
-What…
-Where were you?

764
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,937
-We were…
-Did you two leave?

765
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,022
-What happenen?
-We didn't.

766
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:44,939
We were dragged off by someone.

767
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,190
I'm over here!

768
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,317
Save me!

769
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,319
The town chief is the bad guy.

770
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,030
-The town chief locked up Tsuki.
-Yeah, he is the bad guy.

771
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,573
-Really?
-Yeah. So he took us.

772
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,909
The town chief's mother became a zombie,
and he tried to feed us to her.

773
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,827
Alive?

774
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,120
-Yeah.
-Yes.

775
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,540
Does that mean all these people here
were bitten by his mother?

776
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,791
Hey, he's looking at us.

777
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,709
YES, THAT'S CORRECT!

778
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,048
For us too,
when the mother tried to eat us,

779
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,718
she was tied to something and was limited
in where she could go, like them.

780
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,512
THEY REALIZE THAT
MOST ZOMBIES ARE TIED TO SOMETHING

781
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,805
Since she couldn't really move,

782
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,848
we could run away.

783
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,937
If you look down,
there are a few that aren't tied up.

784
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,981
-Gosh.
-But some of them are.

785
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,860
SOME ZOMBIES ARE SLOW
BUT CAN MOVE FREELY

786
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,784
What do we do about her?

787
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,452
What do we do?

788
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,079
Well…

789
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,331
-They locked the cage.
-The key is over there.

790
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,665
They left the key.

791
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,126
THEY SEE THE KEY TO THE CAGE
LEFT ON THE OFFICE TABLE

792
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,299
Should I… Should I…

793
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,510
make some noise?

794
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,594
Should I…

795
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,350
TSUKI AND THE OFFICE
ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM

796
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,897
Okay, this is what we're gonna do first.

797
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,024
-That door over there.
-Okay.

798
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,692
Inside that is a safe zone.

799
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,403
So first, I'll go get the key.

800
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,949
THE STEALING STRATEGY SEEMS PLAUSIBLE

801
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,993
When Tsuki screams,
they still rush over to that side for now.

802
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,746
When Tsuki screams,
I'll go in and get the key.

803
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,332
Let's think about the next steps
after that.

804
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,416
Okay?

805
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,338
HE CHANGED AFTER BEING APPOINTED
AS COMMANDER

806
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,904
I got it. I'll go.

807
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,823
-Tsuki.
-Go.

808
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,741
-Tsuki.
-Yeah?

809
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,201
Now.

810
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,288
Jeez.

811
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,459
Look. They're going toward her.

812
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,467
What do I do?

813
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,554
Tsuki, I'm sorry. Thank you.

814
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,108
He got the key.

815
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,988
Hey, we can't…
we can't open it for her, though.

816
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,115
How are we gonna get there?
Some of them aren't tied up.

817
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,329
HE LOOKS AROUND TO SEE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING USEFUL

818
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,793
RC CAR: A REMOTE-CONTROLLED TOY CAR.
NOT SURE WHY IT'S IN A FACTORY.

819
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
He's bringing something.

820
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,133
Did you get the key?

821
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,719
Noona, I got the key
and this too.

822
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,347
Oh, my gosh.

823
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,058
-What's wrong?
-Look at that.

824
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,226
Oh, shoot.

825
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,602
What is that?

826
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,937
THERE'S A GRUESOME DEAD ZOMBIE

827
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,021
Look.

828
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,482
Huh?

829
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,236
We can use that?

830
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,404
I think we can give her the key with this.

831
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,948
Are you sure you can drive it well?

832
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,995
HE'S KNOWN AS THE SIDE MIRROR-WRECKER

833
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:31,999
I'll have to try.

834
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,042
IT LOOKS EASY IN MOVIES

835
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,461
But you can't see the path
from down there.

836
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,172
You can see it well from up here.

837
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,799
I'll crack the door open.

838
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,259
Will you be able to see it from there?

839
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,219
-Let me try it first.
-But…

840
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,930
And if it doesn't work,
then I'll bring it back out and go up.

841
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:46,847
I'll try it first.

842
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,182
-Sure.
-Okay.

843
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,644
THEY COULDN'T PERSUADE THE COMMANDER

844
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,064
We have the key and an RC car.

845
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,482
A remote control car?

846
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,735
DinDin will put the key
inside the RC car and send it over there.

847
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,903
THERE AREN'T MANY AT THE TOP

848
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,405
I think it'll work.

849
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,531
-Hey.
-Tsuki.

850
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,368
-Yeah?
-We'll send a toy car to you.

851
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,704
-A tiny mini car.
-A mini car?

852
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,956
We'll put the key inside
and send it to you.

853
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,249
So try to get the key.

854
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,333
Okay, I got it.

855
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,377
-Unlock the door yourself.
-Okay.

856
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,796
But it might be more dangerous
if she opens it.

857
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,090
Will she be able
to get it from there, though?

858
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,516
THIS ISN'T TOP GUN

859
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,685
Okay, DinDin is ready.

860
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:39,233
THIS IS HIS FIRST MISSION AS COMMANDER

861
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,239
IT'S DEFINITELY DOABLE
IF HE NAVIGATES THE EMPTY SPACES

862
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,660
BUT HE MUST AVOID
THE BOTTOM PATH FULL OF ZOMBIES

863
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,747
The quest begins.

864
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,291
RESCUE TSUKI!
DELIVER THE KEY WITH AN RC CAR

865
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,934
IT'S GOING WELL SO FAR

866
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,811
That's harder than it looks.

867
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,195
IT'LL REACH THE CAGE
IF IT CONTINUES STRAIGHT!

868
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,281
I think it might work.

869
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,076
Hey, DinDin.

870
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,827
He can't see it from down there.

871
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,955
THE RC CAR IS OUT OF HIS LINE OF SIGHT

872
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,708
NOW HE MUST RELY ON HIS INTUITION

873
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,464
Oh, yah, the noise, the noise.

874
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,800
IT MADE SOME NOISE

875
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,597
THE ZOMBIES REACT TO THE RATTLING KEYS

876
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,571
Oh! Yah!

877
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,198
Please, please, please.

878
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,786
THEY'RE SLOWLY REMINDED
OF THE PARKING LOT NIGHTMARE…

879
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,919
IT ENTERS THE DANGEROUS AREA
FULL OF ZOMBIES

880
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,184
-Oh, no! He dropped it.
-Oh, no.

881
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,061
He dropped it? The key's on the floor?

882
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,312
DROPPED IN THE SWARM OF ZOMBIES!

883
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,982
Good job, you dropped it
right where they're all gathered.

884
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,361
-No! What are we gonna do?
-Gosh, there, right in the middle.

885
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,737
They're playing soccer with it.

886
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,823
THAT'S A GREAT BACK AND FORTH VOLLEY

887
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,288
What now?

888
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,290
It won't be easy to pick that up.

889
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,505
EVEN THE CHANCE
FOR ANOTHER TRY IS GONE

890
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,928
The quest has been suspended.

891
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,223
We should've thrown it to her from here.

892
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,142
Seriously?

893
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,352
It failed completely.
That flipped over too.

894
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,355
We should've thrown it to her
from the edge over there.

895
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,025
Why didn't you drive it from here?

896
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,903
Why do you always insist
on doing it your own way?

897
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,237
We have a leader right here.

898
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,281
This group doesn't need a leader.

899
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,158
THEIR TEAMWORK CRUMBLES

900
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,451
But that…

901
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,953
I mean, I saw something.

902
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,371
And Si-young saw it too.

903
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,706
There's a dead body over there.

904
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,167
It's like they dissected the corpse.

905
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,003
Oh, man, dang!
All the intestines are out.

906
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:51,383
But if we put zombie blood on ourselves,
they wouldn't bite us.

907
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,343
I mean it.

908
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,887
That's what happened
with Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung too.

909
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,972
If we put blood on us and then go,

910
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,266
maybe we won't get bitten.

911
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,060
-Put blood all over ourselves?
-Yeah.

912
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,939
PUTTING ON ZOMBIE BLOOD
SOUNDS TRULY AWFUL!

913
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,405
But do we really,
really have to rescue her?

914
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,450
-Tsuki?
-Oppa.

915
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,746
Please help me. Help.

916
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,289
I mean, I'm just asking.

917
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,791
-Oppa!
-Will we rescue her?

918
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,125
At any cost? What do you wanna do?

919
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,836
Oppa, she's the youngest among us.

920
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,297
That's why I was just asking.
What do we do?

921
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,011
Then you try it.

922
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,179
Me again?

923
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,764
Because you're the commander.

924
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,392
But the leader…

925
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,686
-You don't listen to me anyway.
-I mean, seriously, like…

926
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,188
what has he done as a former Navy Seal?

927
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,815
Any volunteers?

928
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,484
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-What, any volunteers?

929
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,778
Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors.

930
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,821
Fine. Then, should we do
rock, paper, scissors?

931
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,197
-Anything is fine.
-Rock, paper, scissors, then.

932
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,323
-Whoever loses at the end.
-Just one person.

933
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,534
-We're seriously…
-Let's just do anything.

934
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,743
Or will you do it, Noona?

935
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,287
Will you be okay?

936
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,956
-Wanna smear yourself with blood?
-You were in Sweet Home.

937
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,666
Please give me the key.

938
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,587
If you don't play, you go.

939
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,963
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Scissors.

940
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,051
-Okay.
-We're good.

941
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,428
HONG-CHUL AND DINDIN WON…

942
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,763
-How could this be?
-I knew I'd win. Ha!

943
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,806
I was destined to win.

944
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,266
Because I was just going to
volunteer myself.

945
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,726
-No way.
-I was gonna go too

946
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,852
-because I felt bad
-Seriously.

947
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,645
Oh, well. Too bad.

948
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,105
Rock, paper, scissors!

949
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,066
YOU CAN TELL WHO WON

950
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,693
They're that happy?

951
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,405
Si-young, I don't think I can get it!

952
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,198
THEY'RE SO HAPPY
THEY CAN'T EVEN HEAR TSUKI

953
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,742
-Be there soon.
-Tsuki, hang in there.

954
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,788
Jonathan, I'll give you
a chance to go honorably.

955
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,707
Volunteer yourself.

956
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,336
If you don't play, you're it.
Rock, paper, scissors.

957
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,171
-If you don't play, you're it.
-Wait.

958
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,505
You guys really think alike.

959
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,008
If you don't play, you're it.
Rock, paper, scissors.

960
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,509
-Oppa.
-Is it me?

961
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,427
Oppa.

962
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,846
JONATHAN, IT IS

963
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,930
Good luck.

964
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,557
HE'S ENJOYING IT QUIETLY LIKE A LEADER

965
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,393
Jonathan, don't say you did scissors.

966
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,312
Say you did a heart sign
and volunteer yourself.

967
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,564
-Yeah, Noona. Okay. Hyung.
-Yes?

968
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,192
Actually, I did a heart sign,
not scissors.

969
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,735
Cut your crap and go.

970
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,488
-Come back alive. Go on then.
-Okay. I'll go then.

971
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,868
After you put on the blood,

972
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,578
I think you'll get at least one minute.

973
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,664
-One minute?
-One or two minutes.

974
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,040
-After you put on the blood.
-After the blood.

975
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,751
Dunk your face in the bucket like this.

976
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,920
-Then check.
-Hey, seriously.

977
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,421
If that works, let's bring that to her.

978
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,716
But, oppa, how can… We can't go twice.

979
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,636
Let's put it on him first.
You never know what will happen.

980
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,304
-But…
-We'll stay with you until you put it on.

981
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,224
-Yes, come on.
-It's fine that he puts it on, but…

982
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,892
Go see your brother off.

983
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,310
Patricia, do you wanna go?

984
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,108
-I'll…
-Patricia, don't come. Don't look.

985
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,692
-What?
-You stay over there.

986
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,111
Patricia, say goodbye.

987
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,279
No,
I'll say bye to her from here.

988
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,369
Oppa, you have to come back.

989
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,038
You have to come back.

990
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,052
What's wrong?

991
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,680
Dang.

992
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,183
This is bad. What happened?

993
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,229
THE ZOMBIE'S BODY IS MORE MANGLED
THAN WHAT THEY WERE TOLD

994
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,945
HE'S ALREADY GAGGING
THINKING ABOUT PUTTING ON ZOMBIE BLOOD

995
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,365
Put this on your body.
Then pick up the key,

996
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,410
hand it to Tsuki, and return right away.

997
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,414
Okay?

998
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,250
Okay. Let's do it.

999
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,179
Gosh.

1000
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,931
-Is it warm?
-It's cold.

1001
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,809
It's cold.
Why does the blood have to be cold too?

1002
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,563
-Oh, look. Look at that.
-He touched it.

1003
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,315
It's full of intestines.

1004
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,776
Jeez, he's putting it on him.

1005
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,528
He put on a lot. A whole lot.

1006
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,322
Oh, my. Gross.

1007
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,826
HE'LL HAVE TO GENEROUSLY PUT IT
ALL OVER HIS BODY TO RETURN SAFELY

1008
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,580
-The blood really stinks.
-Raise your arms.

1009
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,166
Gosh, the smell.

1010
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,627
Wow.

1011
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,961
It's okay.

1012
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,049
Please look after Patricia for me.

1013
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,800
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

1014
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,844
THE LEADER STERNLY SCOLDS HIM

1015
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,514
But Patricia, you're really
something else too.

1016
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,141
If it were my brother going,
I'd at least offer to go instead,

1017
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,935
even if I didn't mean it.

1018
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,019
But you seem so okay.

1019
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,897
IN THIS SITUATION, YOUR OWN SAFETY
COMES BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

1020
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,358
This is enough
to make them not notice you.

1021
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,739
You never know,

1022
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,033
-so please look after Patricia.
-Okay.

1023
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,117
Jonathan.

1024
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,082
What was that?

1025
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,170
Come back right away
if it doesn't work.

1026
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,216
The quest begins.

1027
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,593
RESCUE TSUKI!
DELIVER THE KEY DISGUISED AS A ZOMBIE

1028
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:35,978
AFTER SOME TIME, THE SMELL OF BLOOD
WEARS OUT AND ZOMBIES MAY NOTICE HIM

1029
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,316
We'll know the moment he gets out
if this will work or not.

1030
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:54,204
HE MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH A ZOMBIE!

1031
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,257
Oh, it's working. It's working.

1032
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,135
-It's working.
-They're ignoring him. They are.

1033
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,344
Jonathan,
you need to move quickly.

1034
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,721
Jonathan, hurry.

1035
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:15,934
IT'S BEST TO MOVE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE

1036
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,361
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO AVOID CONTACT WITH ZOMBIES

1037
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,285
HE CAN'T MOVE AS ZOMBIES BLOCK HIS PATH

1038
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,120
He must be scared.

1039
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,080
But look, they do approach him.

1040
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,749
They do, but they don't seem to bite.

1041
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,542
They're not attacking.
But they might attack him.

1042
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,210
But they might attack him.

1043
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,754
I feel so bad for him.

1044
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,635
HE TRIES TO CLEAR THE PATH

1045
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,802
Move.

1046
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,889
Move, please.

1047
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,265
I mean…

1048
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,892
You said they couldn't see.

1049
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,144
You said they couldn't see.

1050
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,731
Jonathan, if you get bitten,
you'll end up like Hee-kwan.

1051
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,983
Move.

1052
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,446
Move.

1053
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,659
Move, please. Come on.

1054
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,787
I said, move.

1055
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,457
Move, please.

1056
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,167
HE'S WASTING TOO MUCH TIME THERE

1057
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,712
Move, please.

1058
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,800
He can't get surrounded like that.

1059
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,343
He's surrounded! He's surrounded!

1060
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:35,389
IF HE GETS SURROUNDED,
HE CAN'T COPE WITH AN EMERGENCY SITUATION!

1061
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,598
Move, please.

1062
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,812
I said, move.

1063
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,109
HE PUSHES THE ZOMBIES AWAY
BY FORCE IN THE END!

1064
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,696
Move.

1065
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,201
Oh, he's doing great.

1066
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,452
Behind you, Jonathan! Run!

1067
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,620
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT!

1068
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,871
Behind you, Jonathan! Run!

1069
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,957
-What's that?
-They're attacking. Run!

1070
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,922
THE ZOMBIES REALIZED THAT HE'S HUMAN!

1071
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,555
What?

1072
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,058
THEY'VE RECOGNIZED THEIR PREY
IN FRONT OF THEM!

1073
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,185
What? What? What?

1074
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,356
Oh, no! Go, Jonathan! Go!

1075
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,233
-They're attacking. Run!
-Run! Go!

1076
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,484
Jonathan!

1077
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,531
THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE
IS TO RUN AT FULL SPEED!

1078
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:40,537
HE STILL HAS A CHANCE
IF HE DISPLAYS HIS HERCULEAN STRENGTH

1079
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,292
-Jonathan!
-Oppa!

1080
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,002
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

1081
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,978
HE'S ALMOST AT THE EXIT!

1082
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,773
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

1083
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,191
Don't trip! Watch out!

1084
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,985
-Oppa!
-Jonathan, no!

1085
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:29,294
THE ZOMBIE WHO HAS TASTED BLOOD
TAKES DOWN JONATHAN

1086
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,340
Patricia!

1087
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
Jonathan!

1088
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,429
-Patricia!
-Jonathan, come back in!

1089
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,890
-Patricia!
-Oppa!

1090
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,312
Patricia!

1091
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,533
-Oppa!
-Jonathan, no!

1092
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,827
-Oh, gosh!
-No, Jonathan!

1093
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,246
Patricia!

1094
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,455
Patricia!

1095
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,667
Jonathan! Patricia! Patricia!

1096
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,876
Grab Dex's hand! Take it!

1097
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,836
Dex, be careful!

1098
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,132
Close the door! Hurry! Hurry!

1099
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:40,532
UNFORTUNATELY, HE GOT BITTEN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE EXIT

1100
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,876
THE HUMAN JONATHAN
IS NO LONGER WITH THEM

1101
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,139
Hey.

1102
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,393
-Are you all right?
-I don't know, Hyung, I got bitten badly.

1103
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,897
Hyung, what do we do?

1104
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,649
-Let's go see him.
-Jonathan got bitten.

1105
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,408
I got bitten all over.

1106
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,576
I got bitten here too.

1107
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,245
Jonathan got bitten.

1108
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,625
Where did he get bitten?
Why did you get yourself bitten?

1109
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,710
We saw them going for him.

1110
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,804
Why did you get yourself bitten?

1111
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,557
It didn't… The blood didn't last long.

1112
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,478
Where did you get bitten?

1113
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,813
Hong-chul, please come check me.

1114
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,149
Hong-chul, please come check me.

1115
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,779
Please come check.

1116
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,618
Are you okay?

1117
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,620
Where… where did you get bitten?

1118
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:09,788
Oh, no.

1119
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,539
Where did he get bitten?

1120
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,917
Well, starting from his arm…

1121
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,464
Which part?

1122
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,134
Here?

1123
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,219
Hyung!

1124
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,303
-Oppa.
-Is it…

1125
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,972
-Are you serious?
-Why would you do that?

1126
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,015
-Is it this side?
-Yes, this side.

1127
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,351
I think my left arm got bitten a lot.

1128
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,435
But…

1129
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,236
He's completely out of it now.

1130
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,323
-What do we do?
-I don't…

1131
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,701
Patricia, you're so…

1132
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,245
It's your brother.
Why are you standing so far away?

1133
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,205
Because I'm so worried.

1134
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,920
Patricia, don't come near me.

1135
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,714
Patricia, don't come near me.

1136
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,844
-Stay away.
-She's been standing the furthest away.

1137
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,637
She hasn't touched you at all.

1138
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,723
-She hasn't touched you at all.
-I mean…

1139
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,808
Are you sure
you guys are close?

1140
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,309
Oh, man. Yes, we are.

1141
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,186
-She hasn't touched you even once.
-Are you even siblings?

1142
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,813
-All this time.
-Oh, man. Really?

1143
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:17,731
I mean…

1144
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,982
Seriously.

1145
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,192
I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you.

1146
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,777
SHE'S IMPRESSED BY
HER BROTHER'S VENTRILOQUISM SKILLS!

1147
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,154
You'll be dead before her.

1148
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,697
That's possible.

1149
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,116
EVEN THE LEADER IS MOVED
BY THEIR SIBLING LOVE

1150
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,285
We shouldn't try
using the blood again, right?

1151
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:31,995
Do it again?

1152
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,040
Or if you're still conscious,
How about you go again?

1153
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,167
-Oppa.
-Do you want to kill him twice?

1154
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,209
-No, but…
-I mean…

1155
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,336
A BOLD IDEA THAT'S DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST

1156
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,297
Looks like…

1157
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,548
He can't…

1158
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,466
Wait.

1159
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,801
Looks like he's decided
to go with this character.

1160
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,013
-But…
-But he is right.

1161
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,097
He's already…

1162
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,099
-Listen.
-She seems to agree. Look at her.

1163
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,768
Come on. Don't laugh. Stop laughing.

1164
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,480
Objectively speaking,
Jonathan won't get bitten out there.

1165
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,356
But the problem is that Tsuki is a human.

1166
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,859
How are we supposed
to get her back here?

1167
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,862
Okay. Since he's in so much pain,
let's lay him down safely.

1168
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,489
-Let's talk up there.
-His condition is getting worse.

1169
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,823
Oppa, stop pointing that at him.

1170
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,033
-I'm sorry.
-That's too far.

1171
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,242
-I'm sorry.
-But…

1172
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,620
-Or since…
-If there isn't much left--

1173
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,704
Oh, hey, see? There.

1174
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,164
Let's go up to somewhere safe.

1175
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,875
Oppa, are you okay?

1176
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,960
THEY HAVE TO PLAN
THE NEXT STRATEGY IN A SAFE ZONE

1177
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,463
-It's so hard to rescue her.
-Come on. Here. Lie down for now.

1178
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,215
Sit down and lean against this.

1179
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,551
Jonathan, don't open your eyes.
Keep them closed.

1180
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,513
-What should we do?
-Tsuki, can you open it?

1181
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,432
-Do you have the key?
-She got it.

1182
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,725
Good job. Good job.

1183
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,644
But how do I get out?

1184
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,438
I mean, there is no way
for Tsuki to get out.

1185
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,108
Is no way you can go
one more time, Jonathan? No way?

1186
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:44,901
Sorry?

1187
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,196
If Jonathan brings her the bucket,
the problem will be solved.

1188
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,615
Jeez. He's got
so much resentment in those eyes.

1189
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,991
HE CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH
AT THEIR HEARTLESSNESS

1190
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,284
I don't know.

1191
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,704
Come to think of it,
the town chief will return soon, right?

1192
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,666
We have to resolve this before he returns.

1193
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,209
-I just noticed…
-Okay.

1194
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,752
…that there's a pulley over there.

1195
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,130
So if Tsuki can just get to that,

1196
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,507
I think we can
pull her up using the pulley.

1197
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,634
How will she get
all the way over there?

1198
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,469
The problem is
that she needs to get there.

1199
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,055
IF SHE HOLDS THE ROPE FROM BELOW,
THEY COULD PULL HER UP

1200
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,228
Honestly, we could save her right away
if Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung were here.

1201
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,771
We shouldn't have abandoned them.

1202
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,107
There's just no way.

1203
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,906
-Is this the right place?
-Is this it, Oppa?

1204
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,995
My wound!

1205
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,623
-Huh?
-Oh, jeez!

1206
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,708
Did you hear that?

1207
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,959
I think it's Na-rae.

1208
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,794
The ropes. Look at the ropes.

1209
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,754
-We've come to the right place.
-They've been freed.

1210
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,173
-Is this it?
-Park Na-rae!

1211
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,132
Jeez. Hey.

1212
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,968
-Kkwachu!
-We're over here! Where are you?

1213
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,179
We've been walking
for the past three hours.

1214
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,805
It took us so long.

1215
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,265
It will take us…

1216
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,268
a day and a half at this pace.

1217
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,936
Can we go all the way there?

1218
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,980
This is the fastest I can walk.

1219
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,649
We walked between the rice paddies
for three hours.

1220
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,109
-Na-rae.
-We're glad you're here.

1221
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,652
-Good to have you.
-We were actually thinking of you.

1222
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,779
-Good job getting here.
-So…

1223
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,865
-Did you get bitten?
-He doesn't look good.

1224
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,575
Jonathan got bitten because…

1225
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,286
Tsuki is locked up over there.

1226
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,496
-Over there?
-Yes.

1227
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:20,914
But…

1228
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,665
-I can't go there either.
-What is this place?

1229
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,754
IT'S A HORRIFYING SIGHT,
EVEN TO A HALF-ZOMBIE

1230
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,339
We found the key over there.

1231
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,257
And Jonathan got bitten
trying to get it to her.

1232
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,598
-But we can't get over there.
-Oh, jeez!

1233
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,809
-Here's what we're thinking.
-Okay.

1234
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,563
Jonathan, Na-rae,
and Kkwachu Hyung go down there.

1235
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,190
-You push the zombies back.
-Like this. Put you back together

1236
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,107
-and push them away.
-You push them.

1237
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,443
-And put Tsuki in the middle.
-And bring her here.

1238
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,695
-Okay. We'll help.
-Okay. Don't worry.

1239
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,324
THEY AGREED WITHOUT HESITATION

1240
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,618
We have to try something now.
There is no other way.

1241
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,870
I think the town chief
will be here soon.

1242
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,163
Zombie Trio, you can do it.

1243
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,832
Zombie Trio, let's go.

1244
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,253
-Thank you for coming.
-I feel much more at ease now.

1245
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,588
-I feel much more at ease now.
-Thank you.

1246
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,923
-You can do it!
-I feel bad. We--

1247
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,299
Now go save our girl.

1248
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,634
We abandoned them.

1249
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,220
-Noona, step here. Slowly.
-Be careful.

1250
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,305
Tsuki, hang in there
just a little longer.

1251
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,515
I'm coming!

1252
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,225
My gosh. Thank you so much.

1253
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,227
So the zombies won't bite you then, right?

1254
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,770
I don't think they will.

1255
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,147
-Will they not bite Jonathan either?
-Jonathan, you can do it.

1256
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,274
Don't worry.

1257
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,028
See? They're friends now.

1258
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,531
They're not so bad
once you get used to them.

1259
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,782
They're friends now.

1260
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,325
Oh, jeez.

1261
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,954
HE LOOKS LIKE A DRUNK FRIEND,
NOT A SCARY ZOMBIE

1262
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,163
They're friends.

1263
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,540
You bit me before.

1264
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,083
FRIENDS DON'T HOLD GRUDGES

1265
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,586
Nice to meet you. Oh, gosh. Oh.

1266
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,046
Why are you lying on the floor?
It's not good for you.

1267
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,673
Tsuki!

1268
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,217
THEY ARRIVE AT THE CAGE
WITHOUT MUCH RESISTANCE

1269
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,927
GET HER OUT AND BRING HER BACK!

1270
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,804
Can't get it open?

1271
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,848
Why can't you put the key in?
That's it. Hurry.

1272
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,224
-Okay. There.
-Hurry.

1273
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,018
-Can you put the key in?
-We got it.

1274
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,021
-Who are those punks?
-It's open.

1275
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,355
-What's going on?
-Don't wait. Get them!

1276
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,356
It's the town chief.

1277
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,608
-Who are those punks?
-Tsuki, hurry.

1278
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,567
What the heck?

1279
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,152
-Get them!
-No!

1280
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,695
No, no!

1281
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,740
Tsuki! Hey!

1282
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,158
It's not what it looks like.

1283
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,868
-We're not zombies.
-We're human.

1284
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,952
Don't move, damn it!

1285
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,246
How could you lock up
a person?

1286
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,252
Please help me! Help me!
Please pull me up!

1287
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,130
RESCUE TSUKI!
THE SACRIFICIAL PULLEY

1288
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,715
Someone has to go down with this.

1289
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,801
Someone heavier than Tsuki
has to go down to bring her up.

1290
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,095
But if you go down…

1291
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,684
Please pull me up!

1292
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,771
If anyone takes the rope
in front of them,

1293
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,607
their friend below will survive.

1294
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,402
However, that person will fall
into the horde of zombies.

1295
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:00,198
IF NO ONE DOES ANYTHING,
TSUKI WILL BECOME PREY TO ZOMBIES

1296
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,700
What will you do?

1297
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,039
Five.

1298
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,708
Four.

1299
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,127
Three.

1300
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,129
Two.

1301
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,173
One.

1302
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:19,967
Shoot.

1303
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:23,846
Can you do it?

1304
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,223
When Tsuki gets up here,
grab her tight, okay?

1305
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,266
-We'll grab her right away.
-Okay.

1306
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,651
Hey, Tsuki!

1307
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,736
-Tsuki, he's coming!
-Careful! Watch your feet.

1308
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,075
Be careful.

1309
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,202
Be careful!

1310
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,464
Hyung, this way.

1311
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,304
DEX ALWAYS LOOKED AFTER OTHERS
RATHER THAN HIMSELF

1312
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,772
HE WAS A GOOD LEADER

1313
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:27,994
We got her.

1314
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,163
Oh, no. What about Dex?

1315
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,417
Hyung!

1316
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,380
-Hyung!
-Where do you think you're going?

1317
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,591
-Don't move!
-Hyung! Move!

1318
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,717
Dex, you have to live!

1319
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:48,890
Hyung!

1320
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,769
NO ONE EXPECTED THIS SCENARIO

1321
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,770
Dex!

1322
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,494
He's safe.

1323
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,501
-Come on. Just a little more.
-Let's pull him up.

1324
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,835
Come on. Let's pull the rope.

1325
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,929
Just a little more. Just a little more.

1326
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,056
-You can do it!
-Just a little more, Dex.

1327
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,225
-A bit more!
-You're almost there!

1328
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,977
Wow, you're amazing!

1329
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,479
-Wow, incredible!
-Wow!

1330
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,731
-You did it!
-Amazing!

1331
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,399
-Thank you so much!
-That was great!

1332
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,901
Thank you so much.

1333
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,027
You made it.

1334
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,529
HE IS A GOOD LEADER!

1335
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,199
Wow, good job. Okay. We're next.

1336
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,492
Please help us!

1337
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,535
Don't move!

1338
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,411
-Hyung!
-Doctor!

1339
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,539
-Hyung!
-Jonathan!

1340
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,542
You have nowhere to escape, got that?

1341
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,919
-Just go!
-Run now!

1342
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:00,962
You jerk!

1343
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,255
-Just go!
-Don't you move!

1344
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,798
Town chief, you're horrible!

1345
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,007
Hold them tightly.

1346
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,136
-What's that?
-What?

1347
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,721
Hey, what's that?

1348
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,940
What's that?

1349
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,155
A new survivor has appeared.
