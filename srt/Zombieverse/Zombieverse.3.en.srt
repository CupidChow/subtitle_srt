1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,010
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,363
Look up over there.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,906
My goodness.

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,824
Hee-kwan died.

7
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,367
-Where?
-In the middle. The top right.

8
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,123
Yoo Hee-kwan's death
has been confirmed.

9
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,129
If you throw these,
they'll move towards the sound

10
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,172
so take some with you.

11
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,423
Wow. Seriously?

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,391
-Let's go and bring her back.
-What?

13
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,768
Let's go and bring her back.

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,791
Noona, I'll go!

15
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,627
They have Na-rae. Somebody has to
come with me. They have Na-rae!

16
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,888
He went out to help and now he's gone.

17
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,014
Let's get out of here.

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,100
We have water and food already.

19
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,686
There's no point
in sacrificing more people here.

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,315
MANY WERE KILLED
WHILE SECURING SURVIVAL SUPPLIES

21
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,610
THEY MUST ESCAPE THIS PLACE
TO PREVENT FURTHER LOSSES

22
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,196
-Sir, how can we get to the exit?
-What are the ways out of here?

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,615
Uhm, there's an exit in the middle.

24
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,202
And in the camping section.
There's another exit on that side.

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,413
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OUT
OTHER THAN THE MAIN ENTRANCE

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,876
And I noticed, zombies can't come closer
if we use the cart.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,004
So we should stand back-to-back
with the carts.

28
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,465
The stronger people
should pair up and push them.

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,468
I think it'll be better
for Na-rae to go with the stronger guys.

30
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,137
-Yeah, that's better.
-All she has to do is walk in the middle.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,431
TO INCREASE THEIR CHANCE OF SURVIVAL,
THEY WILL DIVIDE THE FOOD

32
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,183
AND MOVE AS TWO TEAMS

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,353
-They're coming.
-Let's go. Let's go.

34
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,896
-They're coming.
-Come on! Come on!

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,023
-Who's there?
-We should go.

36
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,318
Oh! The door! The door! The door!

37
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,070
Help! Help him. Get that door.

38
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,613
-The door!
-I'll help hold the door.

39
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,784
-How will we get out?
-It's insane.

40
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,077
Let's keep it down.

41
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,037
If we do that,
maybe they'll go somewhere else.

42
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,999
-If we're going out there…
-We're splitting up.

43
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,000
…you should wrap your arms.

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,917
-Let's do that.
-We should all wrap up?

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,377
-Yeah, let's.
-Yeah, let's.

46
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,633
Earlier, I saw them go
for Hee-kwan's back.

47
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,345
-We used it all up.
-We're out?

48
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,599
They're quieting down.

49
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,642
I think we should hurry
and get out now.

50
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,895
-Let's meet again alive.
-There are people out there.

51
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,688
Let's pay a tribute to Hee-kwan.

52
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,189
-Shall we?
-He was one of us.

53
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,316
Will you start us off, hyung?

54
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,568
Okay, everyone, pay a silent tribute.

55
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,077
If I get bitten,
I'll come get you as a zombie.

56
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,205
They're doing great.

57
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,292
RIP HEE-KWAN

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,712
WE'LL REMEMBER YOUR SMILE
FOR A LONG TIME…

59
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,590
At ease.

60
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,092
Let's survive and meet again.
I'll see you all alive.

61
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,137
Let's survive until the end
and meet again somewhere better.

62
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,026
Hey, take that bottle.

63
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,778
Bring the bottle.

64
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,029
Where are they?

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,661
-Hey, should we…
-Go ahead.

66
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,828
There's no one there, right?

67
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,957
First, the camp.
Let's go towards the camping section.

68
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,018
I think we need to go up there.

69
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:47,203
OH, NO! HE STEPPED ON A TOY
THAT MAKES NOISE

70
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,540
HE EXITS IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENTERING

71
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,626
PLEASE KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,169
That little…

73
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,147
Hey, DinDin, the arms,
hey, hey, watch out.

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,440
The arms! DinDin, be careful!

75
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,400
-Okay, we can do this.
-All right.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,152
-Believe in each other.
-We can do it!

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,488
Push forward! Push forward!

78
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,159
-Let's go!
-Push harder. We can do this!

79
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,410
We can do this!

80
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,870
Let's go!

81
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,829
Let's go!

82
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
Oh!

83
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,958
Push forward!

84
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,918
-No! Let's go!
-We can do this!

85
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,338
Oh, crap.

86
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,972
-I'll go now.
-Be careful.

87
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,314
Oh, here I go, all right,
here I go, okay.

88
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,274
Here I go, all right.
Here I go. Here I go.

89
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,738
Oh, shoot, let go.

90
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,822
We can't get out?

91
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,616
-Go. Go first.
-Go.

92
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,451
This way! Hurry!

93
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,411
-It's Hee-kwan!
-Oh, my gosh.

94
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,662
-Oh, no!
-Hurry. Hurry.

95
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,539
-Let's go.
-Hurry. Come on.

96
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,416
Which way?

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,794
-Oh, crap! Hurry!
-Come on!

98
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,670
Noona, hurry.

99
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:24,175
Noona, come on!

100
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,802
Hyung!

101
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,888
THE AUTOMATIC DOOR ISN'T OPENING

102
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,056
Dex!

103
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,767
Dex!

104
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,647
A PHYSICAL FIGHT IS UNAVOIDABLE!

105
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,732
No!

106
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,115
-Oppa!
-Let's go. Come on! Let's go.

107
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,702
-We have to go.
-Let's go, Tsuki.

108
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,497
-We need to go!
-Oppa, hurry, come on.

109
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,540
Oppa, hurry!

110
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,588
Oh, gosh.

111
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,258
Dex. Hey, Dex!

112
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,009
Hey, Dex.

113
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,095
THE LONG-HAIRED ZOMBIE

114
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,013
THAT KEPT GETTING HIT
BY JONATHAN ALL DAY…

115
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,933
FINALLY HAS A CHANCE TO GET REVENGE

116
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,562
Hey, no! No!

117
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,730
They're going out of control.

118
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,899
Come on. Get over here. Let's go.

119
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,110
Open the door!

120
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,528
This way!

121
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,864
EX-SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER DEX
BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN

122
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,241
-Get out!
-Open it!

123
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,784
Everyone, go! Go!

124
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,998
The door wasn't automatic.

125
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,875
No, it wasn't.
We needed to open it.

126
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,751
-Is your leg okay?
-Yeah.

127
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,753
-How is it?
-It's okay.

128
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,963
My gosh.

129
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,465
STAR MART
CUSTOMER PARKING ONLY

130
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,259
DELIVERY AVAILABLE

131
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,936
There is a zombie over there. Look.

132
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,653
They've discovered a new place.

133
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,747
STAR MART CUSTOMER REST AREA

134
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,290
We need to find the other team.

135
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,334
Duck down low. Lower.

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,758
Are you okay?

137
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,219
Did anyone get bitten? No one?

138
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,553
There are so many of them.

139
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,140
What's going on? What the…

140
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,767
What's going on? What the…

141
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,656
What's going on?

142
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,616
Is that a zombie?

143
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,952
-Look.
-What is that?

144
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,039
Oh, no!

145
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,753
Oh, my goodness.

146
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,131
It's a person! Oh, no!

147
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,132
Oh, no!

148
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,145
PARKING LOT BEHIND THE SUPERMARKET

149
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,148
A GRAVEYARD FOR THOSE
WHO COULDN'T GET AWAY

150
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,159
NOSTALGIC RICE PUFFS

151
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,829
For now, let's hide first.

152
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,872
Come on.

153
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,043
-Okay. Let's sit down.
-Gosh.

154
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,671
-Everyone made it, right?
-I'm gonna take this off.

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,881
-Wait. Hold on. What about our food?
-Right. One second.

156
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,091
Where are the carts?

157
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,802
The cart was gone
by the time I came to my senses.

158
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,513
I'm sorry.
But we had to abandon the carts.

159
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,431
We would've died otherwise.

160
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,849
We were running away
in such a hurry.

161
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,017
But we went inside to get those.

162
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,893
-Hear me out.
-We came because of all that.

163
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,145
We almost died, seriously.

164
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,771
We almost died. So we had no choice.

165
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,107
At least we have
some water and other things in here.

166
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,068
-Oh good. Great.
-Such a relief.

167
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,987
-I brought these.
-Huh? What is it?

168
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,447
I brought this.

169
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,781
I put one in here.

170
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,617
Darn it.

171
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,285
You brought toilet bowl cleaners.

172
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,996
SHE MUST'VE SLIGHTLY WET
HER PANTS FROM FEAR

173
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,414
She got toilet bowl cleaners.

174
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,167
Still. Good job.

175
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,253
At least we managed
to bring something out.

176
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,422
Hey, look. There are car keys. Car keys.

177
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,341
FOUR CAR KEYS WERE LEFT
AT THE CUSTOMER REST AREA

178
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,092
This is the customer rest area.

179
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,218
There are cars.

180
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,970
Which ones are left?

181
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:42,600
THERE MAY BE AN OPERABLE CAR HERE

182
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,147
THEY REMEMBER
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPORTATION

183
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,107
-What's this?
-What's that?

184
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
It's an old model.

185
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,069
Right. Yes.
There are different car models.

186
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,612
-We have to insert the keys.
-This is a Hyundai.

187
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,614
-We can guess by the model.
-This is also Hyundai.

188
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,282
I didn't see a Daewoo out there.

189
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,623
THE DOCTOR EXAMINES THE CAR SITUATION

190
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,554
A TOTAL OF 19 CARS CONFIRMED

191
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,765
There are a lot of cars
out there now, right?

192
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,100
So we can move around
and avoid the zombies

193
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,226
by hiding behind the cars.

194
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,394
If it gets dangerous,

195
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
-someone can make noise.
-Hey, hey.

196
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,147
-I checked them.
-Okay.

197
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,149
They're mostly Hyundai cars.

198
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,193
Except the fourth one,
that's an old Daewoo Tosca.

199
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,112
-Just that one.
-Yeah, right.

200
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,155
-Is someone gonna go out there now?
-I'm gonna go now.

201
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,866
Jonathan, Dex, and me. The three of us.

202
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,992
All four of us go?

203
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,702
-No, you can't.
-No, no, no.

204
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,787
All four of us go?

205
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,788
-No, you can't.
-No, no, no.

206
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,957
-We shouldn't.
-Hong-chul and I will go get a car.

207
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,500
HONG-CHUL HAS BEEN PICKED TO GO FIRST

208
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,751
-What?
-You're gonna go out first?

209
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,253
He took off his clothes. Hyung, let's go.

210
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,463
-Yes. Go on, oppa.
-You should go.

211
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,798
Let's go.

212
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,550
But I think Hong-chul would be
the best at it.

213
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,343
-Okay, you should go.
-Oppa, go for it.

214
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,594
Hyung,
you're 12 years older than me.

215
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,929
-It's because I'm in the back.
-You ride motorcycles.

216
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,390
-Hong-chul, you go get backpacks.
-We go first?

217
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,641
COME TO THINK OF IT,
HE WAS ALWAYS FORCED TO VOLUNTEER

218
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,184
You two are the tallest too. Go, now.

219
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,019
-Go, oppa.
-Yeah, you should go.

220
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,937
Let's go.

221
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,439
Hyung, let's go.

222
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,773
It doesn't work like that.

223
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,233
It's not a smart key, oppa.

224
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,901
IT NEEDS TO BE OPENED MANUALLY

225
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,361
It doesn't work like that.

226
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,784
STAR MART
CUSTOMER PARKING ONLY

227
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,412
The quest begins.

228
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,457
ESCAPE THE PARKING LOT
SECURE AN ESCAPE VEHICLE

229
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:36,839
THEY NEED TO FIND A CAR THAT WORKS
WITH THE FOUR REMAINING KEYS

230
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:43,053
ESCAPE THE PARKING LOT:
FIND THE RIGHT CAR, START THE ENGINE

231
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,683
This way.

232
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,935
Over there.

233
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,439
Go straight.

234
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,868
Hyung, let's get through this alive.
I'll see you later.

235
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,869
Okay.

236
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,211
Okay, okay. Let's go.

237
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,761
Oppa, hurry up and go.

238
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,821
Hong-chul.

239
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,615
Over there. There! Over there!

240
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,784
Oppa, get going.

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,044
HE BEGINS CRAWLING
THROUGH THE WIDE-OPEN PARKING LOT!

242
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,420
Oppa, what are you doing?

243
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,181
-Hong-chul's crawling.
-What?

244
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,110
Strange behavior has been detected.

245
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,488
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY HE'S DOING THIS?

246
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,450
Go straight. Just get up and go.

247
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,618
There's no one there.

248
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,833
Watch out.

249
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,670
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,225
HE EXITS WITHIN 50 SECONDS

251
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,977
I don't think that'll work.

252
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,604
-Yeah, I don't think so.
-We're in trouble now.

253
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,771
Which way should I go?

254
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,690
DinDin went over there by himself.

255
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,697
There, there, there! Oh, my goodness.

256
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,327
Shoot.

257
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,245
Hong-chul abandoned Dex, didn't he, noona?

258
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,247
He went to the back. He did.

259
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,208
No doubt about it.
It's going as we expected.

260
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,629
AT THIS RATE,
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO AVOID CRITICISM

261
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,181
Oh, no, oh, no. Will he be all right?

262
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,817
THE SCAREDY-CAT GOES TO SAVE DINDIN!

263
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,455
Oh, no, the zombies.

264
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,604
HE DREW THEIR ATTENTION
BUT IS NOW SURROUNDED BY ZOMBIES

265
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,620
Hurry, hurry, while Hong-chul is there.

266
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,920
THEY ALL HEAD OUT WHILE THE
ZOMBIES' EYES ARE ON HONG-CHUL

267
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,008
Damn it. Hey!

268
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,318
BLACK, WHITE

269
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,070
HONG-CHUL

270
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,199
Shoot.

271
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,121
NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR A HANDSHAKE

272
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,042
Jeez.

273
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,752
Darn it.

274
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,763
HE FINDS AN UNLOCKED CAR

275
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,434
A ZOMBIE PASSENGER WELCOMES HIM!

276
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,191
BINGO! HE FINALLY FINDS A CAR
THAT WORKS WITH THE KEY

277
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,942
The black car.

278
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,454
THIS TIME, A ZOMBIE WELCOMES HIM
FROM THE BACK SEAT

279
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,830
Oh, shoot.

280
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,376
AS PLAYFUL AS A DING-DONG DITCH!

281
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,355
DEX FINDS A CAR THAT OPENS WITH HIS KEY

282
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,210
THE CAR WON'T START

283
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,589
THE BATTERY SEEMS TO BE DEAD

284
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,174
Gosh. Darn it.

285
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,638
Black car. White car.

286
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,142
Are they all right?

287
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,021
HIS MIND AND BODY ARE SUFFERING
FROM TOO MANY HANDSHAKE REQUESTS

288
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,314
Gosh, darn it.

289
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,242
DOING YOGA TO CALM HIS MIND

290
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,081
Draw their attention.
Look, he's in danger.

291
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,332
Whoa!

292
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,501
HE DIDN'T MEAN HERD THEM LIKE COWS

293
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,503
Come out.
Hong-chul is about to die over there.

294
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,424
…PROBABLY BEST
IF HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

295
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
OH, NO… HE'S LACKING IN CORE STRENGTH

296
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,142
Uh! No, quickly…

297
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,352
Hey! What the hell?

298
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,021
Hey, hey!

299
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,816
Help him! Jonathan, help him now. Hurry!

300
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,777
There. Throw it over there.

301
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,447
It doesn't make any sounds! Damn it.

302
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,781
THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL

303
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,381
Go!

304
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,226
Wait. Everyone, come back.

305
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,185
Come back.

306
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,269
Come back.

307
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,146
KKWACHU HYUNG ORDERS THEM TO RETREAT

308
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,483
Let's check to see where we're at.

309
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,068
We need to know which ones opened
and which ones didn't.

310
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,779
A strategy meeting.
Everyone, come inside. Come on.

311
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,822
My goodness. Good work.

312
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,033
-Come on. Wait.
-Why didn't you come down?

313
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,951
So terrifying.

314
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,744
-Why didn't you come down?
-It was so… so terrifying.

315
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,955
Where is Si-young?

316
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,165
-I know.
-She went to the back. Goodness.

317
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,875
-Oh, no! Si-young!
-Is she alone?

318
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,877
Let's bring her back. We have to.

319
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,545
-I'll watch from up there again.
-Did we try them all?

320
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,176
Oh, shoot.

321
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,813
Let's bring back Si-young.

322
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,815
Where is Si-young?

323
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,405
THE FIRST ONE TO RUN AWAY
THREE TIMES IN A ROW!

324
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,447
Jeez.

325
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,375
SHE IS CORNERED

326
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,626
She's over there! Hurry! Come on.

327
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,269
Distract them, come on.
Draw their attention to the right.

328
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,688
Draw their attention
to the right. Hurry!

329
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,608
DEX FOLLOWS ORDERS
AND ENTERS THE AREA

330
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,038
WITNESSING
THE LAST REAL MAN OF THIS ERA

331
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,548
Distract them!

332
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,299
Jonathan, distract them.

333
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,343
Get… get their attention.

334
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,479
Wait, that's so scary.

335
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,277
You did well.

336
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,655
It's good to keep watch
from up there, but the keys…

337
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,324
Take out the keys. Hold onto your own,
so we don't get them mixed up.

338
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,784
-No, no.
-Which ones did you open with these?

339
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,494
-This one--
-Hyung, the last two…

340
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,495
there are zombies in them.

341
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,330
Where? Which ones?

342
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,874
On the far right.

343
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,834
-Here?
-On the far right.

344
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,752
-You mean this one. Okay.
-Yes, that one.

345
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,177
And none of these work, either.

346
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,386
I checked all of them.

347
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,598
THEY RISKED THEIR LIVES
BUT ONLY MANAGED TO CHECK THREE CARS

348
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,933
So if you look out there,

349
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,686
there's a car that has
a dead body leaning against it.

350
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,397
THEY COULDN'T CHECK ONE CAR
BECAUSE A DEAD BODY IS LEANING ON IT

351
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,191
But I don't think
we can go to that car

352
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,026
with the person leaning against it

353
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,652
because there are too many zombies.

354
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,029
But what I'm thinking now is,

355
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,406
-you know the boards we were standing on?
-The pallet?

356
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,241
PALLET: BOARD FOR MOVING GOODS
WITH A FORKLIFT

357
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,826
KKWACHU HYUNG USED IT
AS A WATCHTOWER

358
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,245
That one. If we have two people
holding it up…

359
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,831
-Block the zombies.
-And then if you and I hold it like this

360
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,417
and go while blocking the zombies,
we'll be invincible.

361
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,586
But can we even carry that? Hm?

362
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,546
Let's try. If it works,
we can have four people.

363
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,007
-I bet those are really heavy.
-Which car are we targeting right now?

364
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,177
-The one at the very end.
-No, no. The car next to the Santa Fe.

365
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,271
IT'S PRETTY HEAVY,
EVEN FOR AN ADULT MAN

366
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,524
We can't hold these up.

367
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,776
No, we can't hold them up.

368
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,527
-We can't, we can't. Nope, no.
-It's about 20 kg.

369
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,988
You can't move holding that.

370
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,241
-Those are really heavy.
-That's about 25 kg.

371
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,492
It's about 25 to 40 kg.

372
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,119
-No, it's risky.
-25 kg is doable, isn't it?

373
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,621
But to keep moving
while carrying it?

374
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,664
Why couldn't we?

375
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,957
The pallet… It's too heavy.

376
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,541
THE FRUSTRATED BOXER GOES HERSELF

377
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,002
-Take a look here. Which car is it?
-I…

378
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,170
This one is a Santa Fe,

379
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,922
and this one is a SsangYong,
so that won't work.

380
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,508
I'm saying we should go like this.

381
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm saying we should go like this.

382
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,136
THAT'S POSSIBLE?

383
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,263
So you can lift it like that.

384
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,223
See? Like this.
We can hold it up like this.

385
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,599
WE'RE NOT ALL WARRIORS…

386
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,185
If we hold it up like this,
we can have four people go, right?

387
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,521
If we're gonna do that,
then it should be Si-young, Dex…

388
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,939
-I can go.
-Jonathan…

389
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,107
Hong-chul…

390
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,859
HE'S TOO EXHAUSTED TO EVEN RESPOND

391
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,362
Then, for now,
this is our first target, here.

392
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,197
-The middle part.
-The black car.

393
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,282
The black car.

394
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,033
We have to go there.

395
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,202
But it will be hard to get there
holding pallets.

396
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,537
Okay.

397
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,081
Just like how Si-young
climbed up on that truck earlier, right?

398
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,542
And draw their attention
from somewhere higher.

399
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,004
And you pass through. I'll keep watch.
Then we can divert their attention.

400
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,756
You? You're all talk, though.

401
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,091
-I know, he…
-Over there.

402
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,843
-I'll go up where I was before.
-Exactly. What's wrong with him?

403
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,094
-I'll go up there.
-He's all talk.

404
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,887
-You need someone--
-Hyung, that's way too freaking easy.

405
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,306
-I mean…
-The more I think about it…

406
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,933
What you said is true,
but the more I think about it…

407
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,018
Who wants to go up there?

408
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,520
-Okay, fine. I'll go out there…
-It's not like… You're not a nutcracker.

409
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,772
SHE MEANT PUPPETS, NOT NUTCRACKERS

410
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,401
The quest begins again.

411
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,695
THE QUEST RESUMES
SECURE AN ESCAPE VEHICLE

412
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,618
HE CLAIMS THE EASIEST POST AGAIN

413
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,245
Tsuki said
she'll go up on the truck.

414
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,705
THESE TWO ARE IN CHARGE OF
AGGRAVATING THEM

415
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,624
-Oh, those two are going to go up?
-No. You have to go, too. Yeah.

416
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,625
I do?

417
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,961
They're all scattered right now.

418
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,546
You can't go right now. No! Not now!

419
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,964
Jeez! Be quiet!

420
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,758
Okay.

421
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,025
HE'S MORE SKILLFUL
NOW THAT HE'S DONE IT ONCE BEFORE

422
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,778
Hey! Hey!

423
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,988
Oh, gosh.

424
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,746
Jonathan, you need to go, too.

425
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,748
Someone draw their attention
over there. There!

426
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,379
Oh, she's… she's up on that car.

427
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,305
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE WENT ON THE CAR
NEXT TO THE TARGET CAR

428
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,599
Hey! Don't come near me!

429
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,768
Come on, Tsuki. That's the wrong one.

430
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,103
Tsuki.

431
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,939
Hey! Don't come near me!

432
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,360
Go and help her. Help her.

433
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,071
She shouldn't be there. Oh, no.

434
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,288
Oh, no! What do I do?

435
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,301
Hey!

436
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,481
Hey, don't come near me!

437
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,859
Hey, get away from me!

438
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,235
THE THREE-POLE SYSTEM IS COMPLETE

439
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,112
Oh, gosh! Oh, Mommy!

440
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,115
They're all scattered.
You have a good chance now, hurry!

441
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,534
Oh, no!

442
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,453
Hey, don't come near me! Go away!

443
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,246
THEY USE THE CONFUSION
TO CHECK THE LAST CAR

444
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,706
Oh, gosh!

445
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,045
Damn it.

446
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,562
Get their attention there.

447
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,775
Draw their attention up front.

448
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,068
IT'S CHAOS BOTH ON AND IN THE CAR

449
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,989
Stop that!

450
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,661
Don't come near me!

451
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,622
THE THREE POLES ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE

452
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,212
-Did she get bitten?
-Hey! They're climbing up!

453
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,047
Hey! They're climbing up!

454
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,256
No!

455
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,800
Hey, they're climbing up!

456
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,553
They're climbing up!

457
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,306
Please. No! Stop!

458
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,099
Hey, they're climbing up!

459
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,727
Hey, they're climbing up! Oh, no!

460
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,771
Hey, distract them!

461
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,523
I have to push them down. Push them down!

462
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,275
They're climbing up!

463
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,195
Oh, gosh! This is unreal!

464
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,697
Hey! Stop that!

465
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,784
Hey! Don't come near me!

466
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,328
Help me!

467
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,291
Rice puffs!

468
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,464
Oh, my gosh! What was that?

469
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,716
Huh?

470
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,724
Hey, you zombies!

471
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,228
Rice puffs are a legitimate business.

472
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,398
-I need to go to the restroom.
-I wanna get out of here!

473
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,524
This place…

474
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,527
-No, you can't!
-No, no, no!

475
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,404
Oh, my gosh! What was that?

476
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,325
What was that? Is it Mr. Rice Puff?

477
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,787
-Mr. Rice Puff?
-Hey, you zombies!

478
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,414
They're attracted to the sound of the pop.

479
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,250
Run for it, now!
Hey! Get across! Go!

480
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,167
Hey! Go away!

481
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,419
THEY ESCAPE THANKS TO MR. RICE PUFF

482
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,837
Hey, please.

483
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,923
-Stay away!
-Rice puffs!

484
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,009
Rice puffs!

485
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,099
Go away!

486
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,650
Why is Mr. Jung…

487
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,956
Be careful.

488
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,419
Wait. Why are you here?
Let's go together.

489
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,004
-Oh, you.
-You must come with me.

490
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,881
What did you come here for?

491
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,176
It's okay. We're all here together.

492
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,761
Don't be scared.

493
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,472
Okay, okay, dear.

494
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,057
AMONG THE SURVIVORS,
ONLY TSUKI SAID KIND WORDS TO HIM

495
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,184
Get in the car and flee now!

496
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,895
-No. Please come with me.
-No. I can't.

497
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,731
-You have to come with me.
-It's too late for me.

498
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,610
Okay?

499
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,070
Hurry. Go now.

500
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,114
Go now. Hurry.

501
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,451
Go.

502
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,251
THEY STILL HAVE A JOB TO DO
EVEN DURING THE EMOTIONAL MOMENT

503
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,507
Have you tried this car?

504
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,439
Gosh, I didn't get bitten, did I?

505
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

506
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,236
NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH

507
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,029
-They can climb up now.
-They climbed up.

508
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,406
I was so shocked.

509
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,116
They… they're evolving.

510
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,119
-I've got chills.
-But, like, I… I went to Mr. Jung's truck

511
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,246
and I told him to come with me.
To come with us.

512
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,749
But he said he'd been bitten already.
There was a wound on his leg.

513
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,459
So he told me
to just leave without him.

514
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,585
-I found the car.
-You startled me.

515
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,962
-I found the car.
-Good job.

516
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,088
-Which car is it?
-I found it.

517
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,172
Which one?

518
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,632
On the far right. 5209.

519
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,217
-The far right.
-On the far right?

520
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,845
-5209? Where is that? Where?
-The one on the far right.

521
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,138
The one
right next to the entrance.

522
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,327
Okay.

523
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,413
Quest complete.

524
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,458
They've secured a vehicle to escape.

525
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,626
-Did you find the car for the key?
-We found the car.

526
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
-Which one?
-DinDin. Where is DinDin?

527
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,255
-Oh, gosh.
-Where did he go off to again?

528
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,803
What if they come
because of the sound?

529
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,264
-The engine is too loud.
-I know.

530
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,432
THE ENGINE IS LOUDER THAN EXPECTED

531
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,036
The car is moving.

532
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,038
-Is it?
-The car is moving.

533
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,289
What?

534
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,000
Tsuki is inside.

535
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,959
-It's that car, yeah.
-What?

536
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,545
-The blue car at the end with the cover.
-The blue truck.

537
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,173
We're blocked in.

538
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,551
-There's no way out.
-What do we do?

539
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,053
Maybe we need to push them?

540
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,222
The car is moving. It's moving.

541
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,640
Those two are in it right now.

542
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,974
DinDin is driving it.

543
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,939
THEY'RE ATTRACTING
ALL THE ZOMBIES IN THE PARKING LOT

544
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,445
Are they coming this way?

545
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,240
-Yeah, they're coming over. What do we do?
-Is it because of the sound?

546
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,908
They're all coming. What do we do?
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

547
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,535
Wait one second. Stay still.

548
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,289
Let's turn the engine off.

549
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,635
-I think they can see us.
-I think they can see us, yeah.

550
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,011
Yes. They can see us.

551
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,680
They can see us. It's the engine.

552
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,057
The tape. Give me the tape.

553
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,392
The window might break.

554
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,519
Hey, they're in trouble.

555
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,104
All the zombies rushed to the car
and are rocking it.

556
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,774
They can see us.
Let's use the paper.

557
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,192
Hold on. Let's cover the windows.

558
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,321
-Okay.
-I'll tape it like this.

559
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,037
If we do this and they don't see us…

560
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,582
Oh, okay, I got it.

561
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,127
-Shoot! This might break.
-Oh, no. The windows might break.

562
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,670
Oh, no!

563
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,468
-I think this is gonna break.
-Oh, no!

564
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,019
Tape it up like this. There.

565
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,063
-Tape it up like this. There.
-Okay.

566
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,356
THEY ESCAPE DANGER BY HIDING

567
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,858
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

568
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,153
-Did they leave?
-Do you have another?

569
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,947
-The problem is…
-Yes?

570
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,035
-We can't go back over there.
-I know.

571
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,953
We can't see
in front of us either.

572
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,251
-For now…
-Yes.

573
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,795
-Let's go explain the situation.
-Yeah.

574
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,299
Let's go.

575
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,594
Run.

576
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,970
Hey! They came out of the car.

577
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,349
Hey, does the engine work?

578
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,184
-The car starts.
-The car was moving. It was.

579
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,019
The engine is fine and the car works.

580
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,605
But we can't get out. The back…

581
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,650
The truck is blocked in.
So we can't get out.

582
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,070
No other cars work.

583
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,405
It's blocked in on all sides.

584
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,782
Right. We can't even push it.

585
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,492
We can't just go over there and push.

586
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,369
It wouldn't move?
Can we get the car out?

587
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,038
-No, we can't.
-There is no path?

588
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,414
Damn it.

589
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,791
DinDin worked the hardest.

590
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,042
Yeah.

591
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,336
DinDin was so fast.
Like, practically flying.

592
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,129
All that's left for us
is to get out of here.

593
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,007
It's blocked in, but we just
need to get out some way, right?

594
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,342
Let me go look at it
one more time.

595
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,885
-Yeah. Let's take another look.
-Yeah.

596
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,429
I'll try to find a way out.
We should at least try to see, right?

597
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,848
-Okay. Do whatever you need to do. Go.
-The shortest route.

598
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,809
Or the hardest route
for zombies to attack us.

599
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,519
I'll go with you.
Let's go together.

600
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,191
The back of the truck is open,
so we can all get on.

601
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,026
-Really? How many can get on?
-We can get out.

602
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,570
I mean, okay, it could be 10, 20 people.
Since it's a truck.

603
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,989
-It is a truck?
-Yes, it is.

604
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,449
The back of the truck
is fully uncovered, Hyung.

605
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,410
But the zombies
can't get in there?

606
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,411
I think we should cover it.

607
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,413
We should
somehow cover it and go.

608
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,959
But there's no way
to get the truck out of there right now.

609
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,377
They went out to look at it now.

610
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,546
-Over there. That area we talked about.
-Yes.

611
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,757
If we move those
and lift that one and get rid of it,

612
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,802
-I think that will work for now. Okay.
-Wait, then…

613
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,555
-This. This one.
-Oh!

614
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,472
That's perfect.

615
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,974
But wait. Would that work?

616
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,685
I wonder if the engine works.
We didn't check it before.

617
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,978
No,
but before I saw that people…

618
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,354
Hey! Everyone.

619
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,524
We found this. Look.

620
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,694
Everyone, look carefully.
Oppa, please explain.

621
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,155
-If we move these two, we can get out.
-Yeah.

622
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,700
If you look here,
we can drive all this way in reverse.

623
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,953
THEY FOUND A PATH TO DRIVE IN REVERSE
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NARROW

624
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,291
And then there is this car
parked perpendicularly.

625
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,542
We need to move that one first.

626
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,545
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUSH IT
SINCE IT'S PARKED PARALLEL TO THE PATH

627
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,630
Move it off to one side
and go down all the way.

628
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,466
Then there's this car parked at an angle.

629
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,551
Pick it up, move it aside…

630
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,180
THEY'LL SECURE AN ESCAPE PATH
IF THEY CAN MOVE THIS CAR!

631
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,558
We can back up,
go around, and get out over here.

632
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,897
-We have to move it first.
-But can we even push it?

633
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,691
Like, there might be some cars
that move if we push them.

634
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,360
And some might not move.

635
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,362
-How should we move it?
-I saw something.

636
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,822
Here. There is a forklift.

637
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,032
-Here.
-A forklift.

638
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,909
-Is that a key?
-There's a key!

639
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,002
THEY KEPT PASSING BY THE FORKLIFT

640
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,715
-Do you have it?
-Here's the key.

641
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,427
It's working.

642
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,556
FORKLIFT: FOR LIFTING GOODS,
LOOKS STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT A CAR

643
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,809
Wait, but who will operate the forklift?

644
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,185
Anyone know how to drive it?

645
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,728
Also, all the sides are open.

646
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,231
But that's not the point.
Has anyone driven a forklift?

647
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,692
Well, no one here
has ever met zombies before, right?

648
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,486
You can only know if you try.

649
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,239
I have operating licenses
for boats and motorcycles.

650
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,282
-Really?
-So I'm not sure if they're similar.

651
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,326
-But isn't it just like this?
-When I took a look,

652
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,786
there are only two pedals.
No clutch either.

653
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,454
Just the brake and accelerator.

654
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,373
I'm not sure if this will help,

655
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:21,252
but on this one show I'm on, I saw a clip
of Sung-hoon getting his forklift license.

656
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,880
So I've seen how to start
the forklift and operate the levers.

657
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,715
But can you drive it
with your leg like that?

658
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,385
I mean, someone else can do it
and I can give instructions.

659
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,554
Who will drive the forklift
with me? I just need one person.

660
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,472
I'll drive the forklift,
since it's parked far.

661
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,474
-The forklift?
-Then two of us will go.

662
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,767
-But Hyung.
-Yeah?

663
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,811
The forklift will make a loud noise
so the zombies will rush toward us.

664
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,813
-Right.
-Is there a way to stop them?

665
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,606
They're not very smart,
these zombies, right?

666
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,109
-Right. Oh, yeah, tell them.
-They only go forward.

667
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,569
This place over here.

668
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,612
-Here and here.
-Like this. Yeah, like this.

669
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,573
There's this kind
of triangle area here.

670
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,784
So, if we block this area
and they rush over there,

671
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,828
I don't think they'll go
all the way around. You know?

672
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,038
-I think they'll just do this.
-Yeah, they won't go around. So…

673
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,623
Let's block this part with carts.

674
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,792
Oh, since there are a lot of carts here,

675
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,670
we can line them up
and build like a barricade.

676
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,510
THEY CAN BUILD A BARRICADE
WITH THE STACKED SHOPPING CARTS

677
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,471
They'll only go straight and get trapped.

678
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,932
So I think we should ask Mr. Rice Puff
to draw their attention.

679
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,350
-I see.
-We should ask him.

680
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,645
THEY CAN GATHER THE ZOMBIES
TO ONE PLACE USING THE LOUD POP!

681
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,108
Then I'll go to Mr. Rice Puff first
and ask him to make the noise then.

682
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,611
If he can make
the pop sound when we signal him…

683
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,362
So when Tsuki goes
and tells him to do it,

684
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,156
then when they all rush over
to that side with the pop,

685
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,325
-we'll try pushing the car.
-We go and push

686
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,077
and then make lots of noise
so they rush over to that side

687
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,245
and block them in.

688
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,581
SET UP BARRICADE USING CARTS

689
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,791
-At the same time, one person…
-Starts the forklift.

690
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,918
MOVE CAR USING FORKLIFT

691
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,337
-We'll be pressed for time.
-So Tsuki needs to go first.

692
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,630
THE PLAN LOOKS PERFECT

693
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,381
We should
get the carts right away.

694
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,884
Have a few carts ready.

695
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,846
A new quest begins.

696
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,765
A NEW QUEST BEGINS
SECURE THE ESCAPE PATH

697
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,019
SECURE THE ESCAPE PATH:
REQUEST POPPING, PUSH THE CAR

698
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,439
SET UP BARRICADE USING CARTS,
MOVE CAR USING FORKLIFT

699
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,732
Here's the forklift.

700
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,070
Whoa, we shouldn't go now.

701
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,447
They'll go after hearing
the popping sound.

702
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,033
It's completely uncovered,
so we're done for if they come for us.

703
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,494
-You're right, it's completely open.
-Yeah, there's no cover.

704
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,621
THEY'RE DOOMED IF THEY MOVE
BEFORE THE POPPING STARTS

705
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,339
TSUKI TRIES TO CONTACT MR. RICE PUFF

706
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,716
PLEASE, SIR

707
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,884
JUST ONE POP

708
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,177
LOUDLY, PLEASE!

709
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,564
Rice puffs!

710
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,108
THE SENSIBLE MR. RICE PUFF
UNDERSTOOD THE HAND SIGNAL!

711
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:54,196
REQUEST POPPING

712
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,241
Cross now!

713
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,577
-What do we do?
-They're going. They're going.

714
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,078
No, oppa, no.

715
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,163
-Hey, you zombies!
-Over there.

716
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,666
THEY GET TO THE MISSION LOCATION
AS MR. RICE PUFF TAKES ORDERS

717
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,459
Cross now.

718
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,961
I'm scared.

719
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,963
Go?

720
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,298
Come now. Come.

721
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,550
Cross now!

722
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,933
Shoot. What the hell?

723
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,810
No. But we… we can push it.

724
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:25,728
Oh, it moves.

725
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,397
LUCKILY, THE GEAR IS IN NEUTRAL

726
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,317
PUSH THE CAR

727
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,776
Noona, the cart.

728
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,986
Now the carts.

729
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,197
THE MATADOR
IS BUSY TRAINING THE ZOMBIES

730
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,574
Let's go.

731
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,409
The black car.

732
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,039
Let's put them here.

733
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,457
One more?

734
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,631
-This?
-Yeah, that.

735
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,342
This must be the accelerator.

736
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,345
Wait.

737
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,262
IT'S NOT WORKING

738
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,680
What's wrong with it?

739
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,020
STARTLED! THE BLINKER TURNED ON!

740
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,606
-Oh, hey. What's wrong with it?
-Why isn't it moving?

741
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,235
What do we do? We need to do this quickly.
What do we do now, huh?

742
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,864
Oh! Oh, move those levers.

743
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,658
-Yeah, okay. Like this?
-We need to go forward.

744
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,534
Does this lift it?

745
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,244
How come
it doesn't go forward?

746
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,162
Like this?

747
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,664
THEY'RE READY TO LIFT THE CAR

748
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,374
All we need to do now is go forward.

749
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,917
-Okay.
-We can do it.

750
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,672
THEY'RE SECURING THE CARTS
SO THAT THEY DON'T SLIDE

751
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,714
We can do it.

752
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,341
-We can do it. Come on, let's go.
-Hey, this…

753
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,468
-Hey, what's wrong with this?
-Okay, jeez.

754
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,803
-Is this it?
-Hey! Here it is!

755
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,887
-What?
-Why isn't it working?

756
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,682
Hey! I'm over here!

757
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,393
Hey!

758
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,396
Hey!

759
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,107
They're not very smart,
these zombies, right?

760
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,192
I don't think they'll go
all the way around. You know?

761
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,569
AS EXPECTED,
THE ZOMBIES COME STRAIGHT TO THEM

762
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,490
SET UP BARRICADE USING CARTS

763
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,909
It's so loud! Oh, damn it.
Don't come here!

764
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,495
-Why doesn't it work?
-Okay. That's not the one.

765
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,247
We just need to get it moving.

766
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,832
-What's this?
-This is driving me crazy.

767
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,625
Oh. Oh!

768
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,461
THEY HADN'T RELEASED THE SIDE BRAKE

769
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,547
Let's go. Okay. Go that way. That way.

770
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,464
I'll do these.

771
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,261
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

772
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,513
We have to block them.

773
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,938
Block them. We have to block them, hyung.

774
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,025
Jonathan, here. Over here.

775
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,450
Come on.
We have to hold them off.

776
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,451
Here we go.

777
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,244
You should lower it.

778
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,955
Lower it a little.

779
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,542
Back it up. Just a bit. Just a little.

780
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,169
-Little more. Back it up.
-Can it back up?

781
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,879
You have to back it up.

782
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,006
-Turn it that way.
-No, but I can't back it up.

783
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,049
-It won't back up.
-Go to the side. Go to the side.

784
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,510
-Does this reverse?
-Turn left. Left.

785
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,137
No, left. Turn left.

786
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,556
-Oh, it's working.
-It is. Oh.

787
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,392
Lower.
We need to lower it a little. A little.

788
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,144
Okay, that's fine.

789
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,982
-Hurry up!
-Hurry!

790
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,150
Okay.

791
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,322
Come on. Go further. Go.

792
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:26,241
-Straight. Go straight.
-It's moving.

793
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,618
It's moving.

794
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,162
-Wait.
-Oh, hey.

795
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,375
This way! This way!

796
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,793
OH, NO! THE CAR MIGHT FLIP OVER!

797
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,587
-Ah! No!
-No! We can't flip it over.

798
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,796
Lower it. More. Lower it.

799
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,299
THE BACKUP ALARM COULD
PUT THEM IN DANGER

800
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,177
-To the ground.
-Okay. It needs to go in more.

801
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,303
Make it so it's lowered to the ground.

802
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,804
-Go further!
-It's stuck.

803
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,767
We can't hold much longer!

804
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,769
-Push it further. Get in there.
-More, more.

805
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,479
No, it's stuck. We need to lower it more.

806
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,564
-No! Ah! No!
-Oh, gosh!

807
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,067
Wait! Lower it to the ground first.
Lower it first.

808
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,529
Lower it. We have to lower it.

809
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,574
A ZOMBIE HEADS TOWARD KKWACHU HYUNG

810
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,701
We have to lower this.
Lower this first. Come on.

811
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,453
-It never works when you need it.
-Why isn't it working?

812
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,622
-Come here.
-It's bumping into it.

813
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,040
-Throw something.
-Hurry.

814
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,085
-Hurry!
-Oppa, look! We have to block them.

815
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,962
Oppa, look! We have to block them.

816
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,421
Block them!
You have to block them!

817
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,674
-Block them! You have to block them!
-Block them!

818
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,426
Hey, this isn't the right way.
Nope, this isn't it.

819
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,804
Hey, this isn't the right way.
Nope, this isn't it.

820
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,222
Make this work. I mean, this…

821
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,642
Hey! Gosh, seriously. Hey.

822
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,102
We're screwed.

823
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,899
-Lift it.
-We have to get out of here!

824
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,442
No! Not yet.

825
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,945
Hey, this isn't the right way.
Nope, this isn't it.

826
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,321
Make this work. I mean, this…

827
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,907
Hey, this isn't the right way.
Nope, this isn't it.

828
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,158
-Make this work. I mean, this…
-Shoot!

829
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,743
Hey! Gosh, seriously. Hey.

830
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,245
This is insane. Hey, seriously.

831
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,163
-Hey, seriously. Hey!
-Guys!

832
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,582
Hey!

833
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,458
What do we do?

834
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,881
Hey!

835
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,925
Hey, run!

836
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,010
What do we do?

837
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,553
No!

838
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,430
Na-rae!

839
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,474
-Hey!
-No!

840
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,770
No!

841
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,147
Hey!

842
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,191
-No!
-Run!

843
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,654
Wait. Na-rae.

Wait. Na-rae.

-Na-rae!
-Whoa! What do we do?

848
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,108
Noona! No!

849
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,075
No!

850
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,786
No!
