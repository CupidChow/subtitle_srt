52 HOURS AGO

00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,146
ZOMBIE OUTBREAK OCCURS

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,482
47 HOURS AGO

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,778
5 PEOPLE JOIN THEM

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,696
43 HOURS AGO

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,490
YOO HEE-KWAN DIES

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,408
41 HOURS AGO

11
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,410
PARK NAE-RAE AND KKWACHU HYUNG
GET INFECTED

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,707
18 HOURS AGO

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,586
JONATHAN GETS INFECTED

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,879
AND

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,716
NOW

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,689
-This isn't good.
-Crap. What if that happens to us too?

17
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,899
Seriously.

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,116
18 HOURS AFTER GETTING INFECTED

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,826
Jonathan has died.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,286
18 HOURS AFTER GETTING INFECTED,
JONATHAN DIES AND BECOMES A ZOMBIE

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,707
What do we do now?

22
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,000
-Come out here. We better talk.
-Right.

23
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,335
What do we do now?

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,420
Wow, so you really do turn.

25
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,756
I can't look.

26
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,842
-What do we do?
-So we only have eight people left now?

27
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,843
Oh, no.

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,308
-Eight people?
-I think we let our guard down too much.

29
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,394
Since Kkwachu Hyung
and Na-rae didn't change,

30
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,564
we were having fun training,
even in this situation.

31
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,068
But seeing Jonathan like this
really makes this hit home.

32
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,031
THE REALITY IS
THAT THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST

33
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,075
ON THE BORDER
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH

34
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,701
-I know.
-Dang it.

35
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,748
Anyway, we will eventually
leave this place,

36
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,835
but to be perfectly honest, the issue is…

37
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,838
if we can take Jonathan with us or not.

38
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,840
Then let's hear from everyone.

39
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,092
If we can go together to the end--

40
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,552
You don't have to feel guilty.

41
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,304
You can say no if you want.
We won't blame you for it.

42
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,056
THE FIRST MEMBER TO BECOME A ZOMBIE

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,058
They're getting cereal. Yeah!

44
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,146
THEY DISCUSS WHAT THEY'LL DO
ABOUT ZOMNATHAN

45
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,856
Let's hear from Patricia first.

46
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,399
He's her brother.
Of course she wants to bring him.

47
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,693
-Of course she does.
-You never know.

48
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,861
What do you think?

49
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,781
I think your opinion is important…

50
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,950
-Yeah.
-…for us to make our decision too.

51
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,785
Honestly, I do wanna bring him.

52
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,370
-Of course she does.
-Yeah, it's only right.

53
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,329
As his family.

54
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,831
This isn't because I haven't been bitten,

55
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,624
but don't you all agree?

56
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,418
If I were bitten and in that situation,

57
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,129
I think I'd feel better
if you left me behind. I really do.

58
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,255
I think that's the right thing to do.

59
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,090
Because he died already,
if we're being honest.

60
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,050
I think
he'll really slow us down, you know?

61
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,387
-Yeah, it's bad.
-And it'd be better for Jonathan too…

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,638
to stay here.

63
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,641
And Mr. Gyeong-cheol,
Mr. Gyeong-cheol from before,

64
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,559
he'd be with him.

65
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,519
There's someone here who can control him.

66
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,689
I'm also waiting to see
if they develop a cure.

67
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,816
So that's why I'm protecting them.

68
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,860
-Because they might develop a cure later.
-Yeah.

69
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,780
That's why I think we wouldn't be
completely abandoning Jonathan

70
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,699
if we left him with Mr. Kim.

71
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,201
Yeah, we can leave Jonathan here.

72
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,204
But how do we know
that we can trust Mr. Kim?

73
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,916
What if he does something to Jonathan?
Like cuts off his arms.

74
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,834
What are you gonna do then?

75
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,920
Don't talk like that in front of Patricia.

76
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,087
Objectively speaking.

77
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,840
Look how rough he's treating
the zombies here right now.

78
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,009
You think he'll take care of Jonathan?

79
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,761
PERHAPS JONATHAN
MIGHT GET TREATED LIKE THIS TOO

80
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,680
How are we gonna take care of him?
Tie his arms and legs up?

81
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,599
We can't communicate with him.

82
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,351
Don't you think
that'll be even harder on him?

83
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,061
That'd be even more painful.

84
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,938
Then it clearly comes down to one thing.

85
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,106
Do we put ourselves in danger or not?

86
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,110
It's certain that we put ourselves
in danger if we take him.

87
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,528
And we don't if we leave him here.

88
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,407
If I'm considering how Patricia feels,
I wanna bring him.

89
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,536
But… it's true that leaving him
would be better for the group.

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,789
-Tsuki, what if this were your family?
-Yeah?

91
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,291
If this happened to your family
in Japan, would you leave them behind?

92
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,668
HARD TO REFUTE "YOUR FAMILY"

93
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,710
We don't know what happened

94
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,962
-to our own families.
-We don't know what happened

95
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,879
to our own families either.

96
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,715
Patricia, can you leave
your brother behind?

97
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,678
It's certain
that we put ourselves in danger

98
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,595
-if we take him.
-I think that'd be

99
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,596
-even more painful.
-And it'd be better

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,391
-for Jonathan too… to stay here.
-I'd leave him behind.

101
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,269
You can't communicate with him at all
in that state.

102
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,728
Patricia?

103
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,608
I agree.

104
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,819
DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT?

105
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,492
What on earth? Seriously.

106
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,453
But I, but I…

107
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,123
I think, I think…

108
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,250
You are one truly heartless woman.

109
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,003
I think
Jonathan's hearing is still intact.

110
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,546
He keeps yelling

111
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,464
when Patricia says
she'll leave him behind.

112
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,551
-Right?
-Are you two really even siblings?

113
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,553
BLOOD IS THINNER THAN WATER…

114
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,888
You're supposed to say
we should leave him behind

115
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,307
but you'll stay with him.

116
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,766
-Really?
-I mean,

117
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,602
-it might be a cultural difference.
-No, I…

118
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,979
I think it's a cultural difference.

119
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,148
When I think about what's best
for the group, we should leave.

120
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,441
Ro Hong-chul!

121
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,734
-Oh, dang.
-Who knows?

122
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,861
Maybe he wants us to leave him.

123
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,447
No, we can't leave him behind.

124
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,240
There's something left in him.

125
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
-Right.
-Okay.

126
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,827
Show of hands. Leave him or take him.

127
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
Who votes to leave him?

128
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,753
LET'S LEAVE HIM
HONG-CHUL, DEX, AND DINDIN

129
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,465
Who wants to take him?

130
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,012
LET'S BRING HIM
SI-YOUNG, PATRICIA, AND NA-RAE

131
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,514
ABSTAINED
KKWACHU HYUNG AND TSUKI

132
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,974
TIED AT 3 TO 3
THEY COULDN'T DECIDE

133
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,768
Let's be objective about this.

134
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,186
What if we take Jonathan…

135
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,647
and then Na-rae and Kkwachu
turn into zombies too?

136
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,357
It won't be easy.

137
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,443
Then we'd have three zombies.

138
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,237
If you two turn into zombies tomorrow,

139
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,114
our fears could become a reality.

140
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,282
Jonathan was sleeping too when he…

141
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,076
I think this is…

142
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,454
so… so hypocritical.

143
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,916
So if someone else here becomes a zombie,
you'll abandon them too?

144
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,292
We're not abandoning.

145
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,002
We'll just go our separate ways.

146
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,129
We'd be going separate ways, yeah.

147
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,341
If we can work together like we can now,
we'd take him with us.

148
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,177
But we can't communicate
with Jonathan like that.

149
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,262
You'll abandon us
if we can't communicate with you.

150
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,847
No, it's not abandoning.

151
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,974
What will you do
if you can't communicate with me?

152
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,726
I'd bring you with me.

153
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,729
How?
You can't even use your arms right now.

154
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,857
So if someone here becomes a zombie,
you'll abandon them too?

155
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,359
-How am I…
-Even if it's you?

156
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,444
-Even if it's me, of course.
-I'll stay with you. I will.

157
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,987
But I can understand
where he's coming from.

158
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,958
Hmm.

159
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,961
-Oh, oh, it's Mr. Kim.
-What? What?

160
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,380
I got it.

161
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,591
-Got what?
-I have the, uh…

162
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:10,221
coordinates for a boat
that will let you move around safely.

163
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,974
-What?
-There's a boat? A boat?

164
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,394
AN UNEXPECTED GAMECHANGER
HAS BEEN INTRODUCED

165
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,398
Oh, there is a boat.

166
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,024
He got the coordinates.

167
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,068
It leaves in two hours.

168
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
-Two hours from now?
-Yeah.

169
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,988
We have to get there
before the boat leaves

170
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,614
no matter what if we wanna take it.

171
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,907
We should get going right now.

172
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,743
-Yeah, I think we really have to hurry.
-So, to go…

173
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,704
There might be
other normal people like us

174
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,788
who got these coordinates.

175
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,498
We could team up with them too.

176
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,793
So we'll need to team up with them,
but if we have Jonathan with us…

177
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,387
I'm suddenly worried…
that with Jonathan there,

178
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,348
Na-rae and Kkwachu
might not be able to board either.

179
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,144
I'm really worried.
I just thought of that.

180
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,147
If it's just us,
they can pretend to be humans,

181
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,065
but they'd stand out with Jonathan there.

182
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,358
Noona, think about it.

183
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,361
We can't pass you two off as humans
if we take Jonathan.

184
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,322
We have to go now.

185
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,578
I say we should do as Patricia says.

186
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,871
Okay, Patricia.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,335
You make the final decision.

188
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,420
If we go get on that boat right now,
we can go.

189
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,089
But if we take Jonathan,
we can't board.

190
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,466
We'll do as you say.

191
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,857
-To be really… objective.
-It's your family.

192
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,694
WHAT?????

193
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,905
Wait.

194
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,615
Okay, we can go. We got the answer.

195
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,450
THE WORD "OBJECTIVE" SAID IT ALL

196
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,451
-Let's go.
-Let's go then.

197
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,622
-His family abandoned him.
-No, that's not what this is.

198
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,415
What can we do?
His family is leaving him behind.

199
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,876
-We're not abandoning him.
-Jonathan!

200
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,379
His family chose a new family.
There's nothing you could do about it.

201
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,047
-That's the reality. Yeah.
-Oppa!

202
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,508
Oppa, I'm sorry.

203
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,426
HER EXPRESSION AND WORDS
DO NOT MATCH

204
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,054
-Oppa, I'm sorry.
-…for real. I tried, really.

205
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,725
-Let's go, we have to go.
-We'll take the coordinates.

206
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,435
-We only have two hours.
-Hey, let's go. It's okay.

207
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,853
-You can depend on me.
-Hurry up,

208
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,147
-it leaves in two hours. Come on.
-Oppa, I'm sorry.

209
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,275
-Oppa.
-Huh?

210
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,528
We won't be able
to get on the boat anyway.

211
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,113
We can't.

212
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,161
53 HOURS SINCE THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK

213
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,581
ONE DEAD

214
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,166
ONE DEAD AND ABANDONED

215
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,337
EIGHT ESCAPED

216
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,844
2:10 A.M.
WOLMIDO, INCHEON

217
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,933
Dex, are we at the right coordinates?

218
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,393
-It is. It's here.
-It is!

219
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,394
-We made it.
-We're here!

220
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,478
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

221
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,938
-We made it!
-Hey, wait for us, humans!

222
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,567
-The living's got to live!
-We made it! Wait for us!

223
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,361
Over here. This is the location
based on the coordinates.

224
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,821
We made it!

225
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,073
-Wait.
-The boat?

226
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,325
Where's the boat?

227
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,871
It's not here.

228
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,248
But we made it in time, right?

229
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,334
-Yeah, we did. We're on time.
-We're at the right location.

230
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,793
-What's that?
-Huh?

231
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,005
Is it that boat over there?

232
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
Wait.
Did it leave already?

233
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,051
I think it left.
That small boat there.

234
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,594
-Oh, no!
-Dang it! Seriously?

235
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,012
Over here!

236
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,348
-Over here!
-There are people here!

237
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,724
-Wait!
-Oh, no!

238
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,726
-No, no!
-Seriously.

239
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,603
-You have to take us with you.
-What's going on?

240
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,772
-There are people here!
-No!

241
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,273
Take us with you!

242
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,441
This is
because we were hesitating back there!

243
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,277
If we were just 10 minutes earlier,
we could have boarded.

244
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,570
If we just made our decision

245
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,488
-about Jonathan--
-Back there, dang it!

246
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,697
Stop talking about Jonathan.

247
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,282
-Dang it!
-You're a jerk.

248
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,659
If we got here just a little faster,

249
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,660
we could've taken that boat.

250
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,286
We can see it right there! Dang it!

251
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
Are we going to die?

252
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,623
It would have saved the humans.

253
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,668
-It would have saved the humans.
-You're a horrible person!

254
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,424
But back at the house,
Mr. Kim said there were two boats.

255
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,801
-Tomorrow morning? Okay.
-There was another one

256
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,718
five hours later.

257
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,762
-Seriously.
-Then we can take the next one.

258
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,763
The next one.

259
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,972
Where can we go in and wait?

260
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,477
-How about over there?
-Where?

261
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,729
Hey, the Ferris wheel.
The Ferris wheel!

262
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,984
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-I'm going. Let's go.

263
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,820
Whoever's left living should live!

264
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,863
It's so cold. Come on!

265
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,995
Wow.

266
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,456
Let's go in here and wait,
just five hours.

267
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,837
THEME PARK AT THE END OF THE WORLD
5-HOUR UNLIMITED RIDE PASS

268
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,089
They've arrived at a new place.

269
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,676
Be careful. Just in case.

270
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,145
I think these places are actually safer.

271
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,521
But it's too quiet.

272
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,989
The Ferris wheel is up there.
So let's go up first.

273
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,533
Let's get to someplace high, oppa.

274
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,331
I really can't see a thing.

275
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,625
-Slow down.
-Slower.

276
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,878
-Okay.
-Crap.

277
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,887
Here, here. We're here.

278
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,724
-You can see everything from here.
-Whoa.

279
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,602
Wow.
It seems like there's really no one here.

280
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,812
I know. This is great.

281
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,940
The pods of the Ferris wheel
are up in the air.

282
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,902
Up there,
we'll be safe for five hours.

283
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,614
But nothing's running.
All the machines are off.

284
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,367
Even if we hide,
we can't do anything if zombies come.

285
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,787
Is there any way
we can turn the lights on just here?

286
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,957
Let's follow this wire
and see where it goes.

287
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,167
The light wires here.

288
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,960
-You're right.
-You're right.

289
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,629
This way?

290
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,589
I think it connects over this way.

291
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,091
It's a bit scary

292
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,551
-since it's so dark.
-I think this is it.

293
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,470
Is this it?

294
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,181
It looks like a big power box.

295
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,558
How do we work this?

296
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,394
Oh!

297
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,116
Wow.

298
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,786
Wow.

299
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,040
-The lights are on.
-Yeah.

300
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,376
-So cool. Huh? It's moving!
-Cool.

301
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,502
We can go up that way.

302
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,504
The lights. It's so pretty!

303
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,381
Wow. We're safe now. Wow.

304
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,696
Wow. It's so pretty.

305
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,197
Are you sure this is okay? It's so bright.

306
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,283
It's gorgeous!

307
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,604
-Huh?
-Whoa!

308
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,688
It's a theme park!

309
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,815
-Wait, there are zombies!
-Huh?

310
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,568
There are zombies! Zombies!

311
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,069
There are zombies all over here too.

312
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,404
Oh, no.

313
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,322
Crap.

314
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,207
That's the most zombies
we've seen so far.

315
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,959
But there wasn't anyone here earlier.

316
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,294
Quiet down.
Don't make a sound.

317
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,629
There are too many.

318
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,508
That's a lot of zombies. Over here!

319
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,218
Hey, hey, don't call out to them.
Don't do that.

320
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,846
-Unni, what's wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

321
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,848
-There's something wrong with Na-rae.
-What, what?

322
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,391
-No, no, no.
-She waved at the zombies.

323
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,352
No, she was just teasing them.
It was a joke.

324
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,811
Hey, hey, get it together. Come on.

325
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,939
-Oppa, I feel nauseous.
-Oh, jeez.

326
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,107
Everyone that was here
must have been bitten.

327
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,318
They must have come out
because of the lights.

328
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,569
I mean…

329
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,489
We wouldn't have ever known
if we hadn't turned the lights on.

330
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,994
ZOMBIES POURED OUT IN RESPONSE
TO THE LIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF THE RIDES

331
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,956
Wait, I think there's someone there.

332
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,208
-Hey, there are people! Humans!
-Over there.

333
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,250
-Hey!
-There's someone.

334
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,755
How did they manage to stay there?

335
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:11,345
THERE ARE SURVIVORS
ALL THROUGHOUT THE THEME PARK

336
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,555
Shouldn't we help them?

337
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,265
We have weapons at least.

338
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,977
-There are too many zombies. Look.
-What do we do?

339
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,358
How do we get past them?

340
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,860
We learned how. We have guns too.

341
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,405
There's a kid.
We have to rescue them.

342
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,448
Then first, only the people who are okay…

343
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,950
-Huh? Us?
-…should go down

344
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,410
and try to figure out a route.

345
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,537
-What about us? We don't go?
-What about us?

346
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,497
You stay here and give us moral support.

347
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,666
-You can't abandon us.
-Just… just wait a little.

348
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,293
-We've always offered support.
-You can't abandon us.

349
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,379
-I-I mean…
-See you later.

350
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
Shoot, look at all the zombies.

351
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,642
All the zombies here are young.

352
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,853
Because they're all visitors of the park.

353
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,979
-Right.
-Yeah.

354
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,106
Let's hide here behind the guns.

355
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,525
-Let's hide.
-Here?

356
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,736
I'm scared, okay?

357
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,657
Ah, there are gloves here.

358
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,576
Okay, okay. Let's put them on.

359
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,911
So there are people
at the Disco Pang Pang,

360
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,664
the merry-go-round, and the bumper cars.

361
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,791
There is a little kid at tagada too.

362
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,211
I don't think we should move in one group.

363
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,254
Let's split up.

364
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,256
-Small groups.
-Wait. Two, four, six.

365
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,051
-Let's... let's pair up.
-Two, two, two. Three teams.

366
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,846
The ones going to the places with a lot
of zombies... should take the weapons.

367
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,390
Oh, gosh, they're coming,
they're coming, they're coming

368
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,061
But I don't think
you need weapons for the tagada.

369
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,647
But you can shoot at the zombies
on the merry-go-round.

370
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,024
THEY'RE PERFECT TARGETS
FOR SHOOTING PRACTICE

371
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:51,195
Stop it!

372
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,614
Someone with good aim should go
where you can use a gun.

373
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,866
-So Tsuki or Si-young should go.
-I can't shoot at all.

374
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,950
-I'll go.
-You saw it yesterday.

375
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,202
Then Si-young will go
to the merry-go-round.

376
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,579
Si-young practiced with me yesterday, so…

377
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,998
-Okay, I'll go with Dex.
-I'll go rescue the kid.

378
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,209
Dex, Dex, you're really going
to the merry-go-round?

379
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,628
Well, Si-young's going.

380
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,046
We trained together yesterday, so…

381
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,130
-Really?
-Yeah.

382
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,465
-What about you?
-I…

383
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,966
What are you thinking this time?

384
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,884
Well…

385
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,762
Come on. Just a little more.
A little more, a little more!

386
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,640
HE WANTS TO KEEP DEX FOR HIMSELF

387
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,767
-No, no.
-You've got this look in your eyes.

388
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,061
I'm just worried that if I go with him,
he'll abandon me.

389
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,854
-I can't trust Hong-chul.
-I can't trust him either.

390
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,816
-I'd rather go to the tagada.
-Then let's go together, oppa.

391
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,984
-Have you ever been on a tagada?
-No.

392
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,194
Have you ever been on a tagada?

393
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,238
Do you think
you're going there to ride the thing?

394
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,823
-But Tsuki is a good dancer.
-Yeah, that one.

395
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,324
What does that have to do with this?

396
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,243
You dance on a tagada.

397
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,285
A zombie's coming. Crap.

398
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,912
DAY 3…
EVEN THE LEADER IS LOSING HIS MIND

399
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,706
-What's wrong with Dex? Seriously?
-Isn't Dex kind of funny?

400
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
HE EVEN PLAYS WHACK-A-MOLE

401
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,459
Oh, hey. Duck, duck, duck.

402
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,923
Oh, jeez.

403
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,091
Should we not go?

404
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,637
THE FATE OF THE SURVIVORS
DEPENDS ON THE LIKES OF THEM

405
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,851
Hey then, let's do this.
Patricia and I will go to the bumper cars.

406
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,060
You two go to the merry-go-round.

407
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,103
MERRY-GO-ROUND TEAM: SI-YOUNG AND DEX

408
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,981
Tsuki and DinDin will go to the tagada
since they're quick on their feet.

409
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,067
Then let's rescue
the survivors and regroup.

410
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,987
-See you later.
-Let's meet again alive.

411
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,156
-What? What is it?
-What's wrong with him?

412
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,907
-He must be infected.
-Why are you coming from there?

413
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,450
There are so many zombies over there.

414
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,286
HE'S BEEN CRAWLING
FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS

415
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,590
Seriously.

416
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,427
Huh? Why aren't these guys moving?

417
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,345
Their heads aren't cut off though.

418
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,972
Are they all asleep?

419
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,974
THEY SEE A FRIGHTENED STUDENT
IN THE FURTHEST CORNER

420
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,978
-Over there.
-There she is.

421
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,524
IT'S A YOUNG STUDENT…
THEY NATURALLY WANT TO RESCUE HER!

422
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,942
Stay there.

423
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,861
-Hey, look.
-Are they dead?

424
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,362
"An electric current
flows through the floor

425
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,323
when the ride is going. Do not enter!"

426
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,699
Jeez, a current must run
through the floor.

427
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,367
I think we have to ride one of the cars
to get there.

428
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,789
They can't step on the floor,
it has an electric current.

429
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,627
They must ride a bumper car
and save the survivor inside.

430
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:17,758
If they want to stay alive,
they must not wake the sleeping zombies.

431
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,471
Hey, which one of us should go?
It's too small for the both of us to go.

432
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,641
You're young, you like theme parks.

433
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,767
So you go.

434
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,976
Me?

435
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,603
Let's make it fair.

436
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,231
We'll distract her, then one person
goes over there to stack something.

437
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,857
-Okay.
-Do you wanna go there first?

438
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,609
Sure. Okay, oppa.

439
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,111
I mean, you normally shouldn't make
the other person go first, right?

440
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,197
-Should I go first? You can do it.
-You go first, oppa.

441
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,741
THIS ISN'T DÉJÀ VU

442
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,867
You want me to go?

443
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,619
-Then let's make a plan.
-Where should I go?

444
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,080
-I'll take this and go there.
-Okay.

445
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,165
You make way
so I can get there and back in one go.

446
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,084
Yeah, I'm doing all the dangerous work.

447
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,627
I don't think so.

448
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,047
No, no. You make the way
and I'll take all the risk and rescue her.

449
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,091
-We have great teamwork.
-Oppa, I trust you.

450
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,133
-Oppa, I have faith in you.
-Just push that, okay?

451
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,552
HE HAS NO INTENTION
OF LISTENING TO HER

452
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,223
Careful, careful.

453
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,393
This is nothing.

454
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,728
Careful. Be careful, oppa.

455
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,897
Watch what you're doing!

456
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,274
OH, NO! HIS GROIN IS SPLITTING

457
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,733
Oppa, be careful!

458
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,776
Easy does it.

459
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,070
Easy does it.

460
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,740
Hey, I think you should do it.

461
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,075
What... What?

462
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,159
Oh, gosh.

463
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,329
Me? Just try going.

464
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,416
The quest begins.

465
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,751
RESCUE THE STUDENT!
WHILE THE ZOMBIES ARE SLEEPING

466
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,888
HE NEEDS TO BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL
NOT TO WAKE ANY OF THE ZOMBIES

467
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,105
Oh, a dead body!

468
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:11,121
THE ZOMBIES AREN'T MOVING AT ALL SO FAR

469
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,541
Patricia, I think it's safe.

470
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,667
You should come too.

471
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,127
They're not moving.

472
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,297
Wait right there.

473
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,438
What do I do? Oppa?

474
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,106
Oh, wait.

475
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,993
Come here.

476
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,996
Come this way. You can step on that.

477
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,790
Come this way. You can step on that.

478
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,876
A COLLISION OCCURS!!

479
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,169
Hey, hey, oppa!

480
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,213
-Oh, gosh.
-What's wrong with this?

481
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,090
-Hey, why is it doing this?
-Oppa!

482
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,091
What's wrong with it?

483
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,675
Seriously, oppa.

484
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,636
THE ZOMBIE, SENSITIVE TO VIBRATIONS,
SUDDENLY REACTS

485
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,724
-Oppa!
-Hey, here, this way!

486
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,103
Hold on. What's wrong with this?

487
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,108
Oh, no, this isn't working.

488
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,276
Oppa, oppa, oppa, oppa!

489
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,034
Kid, kid! Come here! Kid!

490
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,744
ALL THE ZOMBIES ARE AWAKE NOW!

491
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,579
Kid! Kid!

492
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,997
What do we do?

493
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,626
I don't think this will work!

494
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,461
HE ABANDONS THE STUDENT AND FLEES

495
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,588
What are you gonna do?
What am I supposed to do?

496
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,674
Get away!

497
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,553
Get away! Get back, you!

498
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,179
Get away! Get away!

499
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,014
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Be quiet.

500
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,850
THANKS TO PATRICIA, THE PATH IS CLEAR!

501
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,435
Oppa, go!

502
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,478
Yes, get her.

503
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,230
Come here, come here.

504
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,940
Oppa, oppa, oppa!

505
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,318
THEY SUCCESSFULLY GET
THE SURVIVOR

506
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,196
I'll lure them away. I'll lure them.

507
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:15,036
Hey! Come at me.

508
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,581
Come at me!

509
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,000
Come at me!

510
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,589
HE MUST'VE BEEN A GOOD DRIVER
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE

511
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,049
Come on.

512
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,509
Oppa!

513
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,677
Oh, gosh.

514
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,933
Oppa, follow me.

515
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,561
Oppa!

516
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,985
THIS TIME, HONG-CHUL IS IN TROUBLE

517
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,278
Oppa!

518
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,073
Oppa, wait.

519
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,911
Oppa!

520
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,455
Oppa!

521
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,795
Okay, wait for me.

522
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,547
Don't you dare. Hey!

523
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,218
Oppa, wait. I'll save you!

524
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,305
Wait!

525
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,183
SHE MIGHT DIE FIRST?!

526
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,769
Wait.

527
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,729
Dang it. Whatever. Let's go!

528
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,564
Go straight! Hey!

529
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,483
What? Huh?

530
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,777
Hey, stop it! Oh, no!

531
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,612
Oh, gosh.

532
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,242
Get away! Get away!

533
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh, gosh!

534
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,871
Oppa, you can go now!

535
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,040
Oppa, go! Go!

536
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,793
Patricia!

537
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,128
Oh, gosh!

538
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,341
THANKS TO PATRICIA,
HONG-CHUL AND THE SURVIVOR ESCAPE

539
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,802
Patricia!

540
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,303
Patricia!

541
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,767
SHE HAD JUST BEGUN DRIVER'S ED

542
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,602
Oppa!

543
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,731
You made it.
To the right, Patricia. You made it!

544
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,360
Oppa!

545
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,737
You made it.

546
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,990
Good job. You did great.

547
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,491
THEY MADE IT OUT
OF THE HELLISH COURSE SAFELY

548
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,409
Patricia.

549
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,623
You did great!

550
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,042
The quest is complete.

551
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,086
QUEST COMPLETE
RESCUE THE STUDENT!

552
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,963
-Oh, zombies.
-Huh?

553
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,172
There. Zombies.

554
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,966
Shouldn't we go down there too?

555
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,175
Can you not see it?

556
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,470
Your sense of humor is back now.
No, you can't see anything like that.

557
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,347
TSK TSK… SHE CAN'T EVEN TELL
THE FRONT FROM THE BACK

558
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,308
Yeah, here. Take it, like this.

559
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,727
Look, there. Yeah. Look.

560
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,520
Wow, that's amazing!

561
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,689
One, two, three, four…

562
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,690
Five…

563
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,985
Let's just enjoy this.
This is our last moment.

564
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,194
We're too weak anyway.

565
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,076
If I knew this would happen,
I would have lived a naughtier life!

566
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,411
Naughtier?

567
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,954
Don't you think
it's plenty naughty already?

568
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,081
45 HOURS AFTER GETTING INFECTED,
THEY SENSE THE END IS NEARING

569
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,918
I struggled my way out of Mokpo
and came to Seoul,

570
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,964
and saved up all my money
while everyone said I worked too hard.

571
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,550
But now, I'm gonna die single.

572
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,221
I only told a lot of dirty stories,

573
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,140
I hadn't dated that many guys.

574
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,850
THAT'S TMI!

575
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,227
Jeez, this sucks.

576
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,690
WHILE THE HALF-ZOMBIES
CONTINUE TO GRUMBLE

577
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,943
DINDIN AND TSUKI APPROACH
THEIR MISSION LOCATION

578
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,654
We have to open that gate
and get those people out.

579
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,572
Okay.

580
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,039
What are you doing?

581
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,124
-Can you open the gate?
-Open it, please.

582
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,417
There are people in there.
Open the gate.

583
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,627
-Are you a zombie?
-No, no.

584
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,045
-I'm the DJ. The DJ.
-Neither are we.

585
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,254
-Open the gate. Come on.
-Open the gate.

586
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,964
Can you hurry?
There are people in there.

587
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh, no.

588
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,468
Are you okay?

589
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,220
-We have to go. Come on.
-Let's go.

590
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,971
-Are you okay? Were you bitten?
-We have to go.

591
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,681
-We didn't get bitten.
-Go on. Go!

592
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,266
Thank you.

593
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,143
-Oh, no.
-Hurry. Let's get out of here.

594
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,478
-Oh, no.
-Shoot.

595
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,190
THE HUMANS LEFT AND ZOMBIES RUSHED IN

596
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,527
THE DJ COULDN'T ESCAPE IN THE END…

597
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,450
-Are you okay?
-Hey.

598
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,747
-It's gone.
-Hey.

599
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,165
-What's gone?
-What do we do?

600
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,375
What is it?

601
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,878
My sister has asthma,
so she needs her medicine.

602
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,005
-We must have dropped it back there.
-It's gone.

603
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,923
The inhaler?

604
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,591
-Yeah.
-Crap.

605
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,969
-The thing you breathe in?
-You can't go without it?

606
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,887
-She can't.
-How old are you?

607
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,056
-I'm 26. Yes.
-You're 26?

608
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,602
NOT A CHILD,
JUST SOMEONE WHO LOOKS VERY YOUNG

609
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,355
What does that have to do with this?

610
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,941
Jeez, why did you ride that
with your pouch open? You're 26.

611
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,193
NO MERCY FOR AN ADULT

612
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,112
It's okay. She's cute.

613
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,530
Let's go get Kkwachu Hyung first.

614
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,407
-Okay. Should I go?
-Kkwachu Hyung is a half-zombie

615
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,617
-and a doctor, so let's get him.
-I'll go get him then.

616
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,872
You shouldn't sleep like that,
it's too cold. Na-rae.

617
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,165
You have to keep flipping over.

618
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,000
-Okay.
-So you don't freeze.

619
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,960
Yes, flip over.
There you go.

620
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,086
Man, you're smart.

621
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,088
WE SHOULD JUST LAY HER
TO REST IN PEACE…

622
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,423
-Doctor, doctor!
-Wait.

623
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,633
We were just having fun flipping her.
What is it? What?

624
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,093
No, really.

625
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,012
-We have a favor to ask. A real one.
-What favor?

626
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,055
You remember
there was a kid back there, right?

627
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,182
The kid, okay.

628
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,143
She… You know, the illness
where you breathe like that.

629
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,145
-The illness where your heart beats.
-"Heartbeat"?

630
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,147
SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE
COMMUNICATING WITH THE DOCTOR

631
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,356
She has asthma.

632
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,608
-"With asthma"?
-"With asthma"?

633
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,067
Is Asthma her friend?

634
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,069
There must be
someone named Asthma, right?

635
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,112
Miss Asthma!

636
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,323
So? Go on.

637
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,450
-She has asthma.
-She has asthma and…

638
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,826
-You have to come.
-Okay.

639
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,994
-Please.
-He has to go.

640
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,330
ALTHOUGH HALF-ZOMBIE,
HE STILL UPHOLDS THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH

641
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,123
-Okay, hurry.
-After you.

642
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,250
I'm freezing.

643
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,878
-Oh, gosh. Hi.
-Kkwachu Hyung.

644
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,254
-He's not a zombie.
-Hello. Hi.

645
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,423
-I'm still a doctor.
-I see.

646
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,509
To be honest,
the cold air could aggravate it.

647
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,385
She could be in danger
if she doesn't use the inhaler soon.

648
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,597
She could actually die.
There's no alternative treatment for this.

649
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,849
THERE'S NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO BACK AND FIND IT

650
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,559
Then they can stay here for now.

651
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,686
And since we know the ride,
you should come with us.

652
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,147
-Go with you? There? Oh, okay. Yeah.
-Yeah, we have to save the kid.

653
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,565
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

654
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,858
-Just hang tight.
-Good luck.

655
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,110
Let's do this.

656
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,698
-Hi. Open the gate, please.
-Yeah, open the gate.

657
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,659
She left her inhaler.
She has asthma.

658
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,954
HOW IS THE DJ STILL ALIVE
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED???

659
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,249
10 MINUTES AGO
THE TAGADA WAS FULL OF ZOMBIES

660
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,501
Just hang tight.
I'll spin you around in no time.

661
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,922
No, the two of you,
don't roll around together.

662
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,881
There you go.

663
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,383
All you zombies are gonna fall down.

664
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,760
HE DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
AND SHOWS THEM A GOOD WOLMIDO TIME

665
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,887
Almost all of you are passed out now.

666
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,726
Now don't ever come back.

667
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,396
THE DJ IS ALMIGHTY
WHEN YOU'RE RIDING THE TAGADA…

668
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,607
They're all kind of passed out
right now, so we need to find it fast.

669
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,363
-Crap.
-They're alive.

670
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,614
We're screwed.

671
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,959
Oh, wait. I'm a half-zombie.
They won't bite me.

672
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,168
Yeah, they won't bite you. They won't.

673
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,712
-So I can stay here.
-Oh, no!

674
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,339
-I mean…
-It's Yoo Hee-kwan!

675
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,049
-It's Yoo Hee-kwan!
-Oppa!

676
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,140
If I get bitten,
I'll come get you as a zombie.

677
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,017
Zombie food. Total zombie food.

678
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,939
EVEN AFTER BECOMING A ZOMBIE

679
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,108
HE DIDN'T FORGET HIS PROMISE

680
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,861
THE PITCHER WITH 100 WINS

681
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,157
-Oppa!
-They won't bite you. You go.

682
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,074
I…

683
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,534
Hi. No, no, no, no.

684
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,454
I'm still scared. Wait. I…

685
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,914
-Oh, no!
-Hey, spin it.

686
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,540
Spin it! Spin it! Spin it! Spin it!

687
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,960
THEY DESPERATELY NEED
THE DJ'S HELP IN THIS QUEST

688
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,549
The quest begins.

689
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,800
FIND THE INHALER
YOO HEE-KWAN'S DISCO FEVER

690
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,427
-No, Yoo Hee-kwan!
-Hey.

691
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,803
Hey. DinDin.

692
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,640
Don't come this way! Not us!

693
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,393
-No!
-He's good.

694
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,478
No.

695
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,781
Oh, no!

696
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,871
Oh, no, no, no!

697
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,292
-No!
-Oppa!

698
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:48,758
No!

699
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,301
I can't!

700
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,428
-Hey! What the heck?
-Please.

701
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,014
-It's not over?
-Hey, wait.

702
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,850
Hyung, block him!
Stop Yoo Hee-kwan!

703
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,894
ZOMBIE HEE-KWAN DOESN'T FALL

704
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,108
Why won't this zombie fall? Why? Why? Why?

705
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,073
ONLY THE INNOCENT HALF-ZOMBIE
ROLLS AROUND

706
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,871
THIS IS THE BALANCE OF A PRO ATHLETE

707
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,832
Is he a tagada master?

708
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,211
Get him! Get Yoo Hee-kwan!

709
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,798
HE'S ABOUT TO GET CAUGHT!

710
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,927
Hey!

711
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,762
-No!
-Let go!

712
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,021
Oh, no, you can't pull his pants off.
You're in big trouble.

713
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,482
Let go!

714
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,068
HIS FEEBLE LEGS ALMOST GOT EXPOSED!

715
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,821
-No!
-Yoo Hee-kwan!

716
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,489
Oppa! No!

717
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,659
AS PROMISED,
HE ONLY GOES AFTER DINDIN

718
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,874
HIS REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

719
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,500
I'm sorry, but…

720
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,628
-No! Oppa, no!
-Are you okay?

721
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,298
I'll spin you around.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

722
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,304
Oh, no! Oppa!

723
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,058
TSK, TSK…
KKWACHU HYUNG CAN'T GET UP AT ALL

724
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,101
DinDin! No!

725
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,521
I'm a zombie.
I'm a half-zombie. Half-zombie!

726
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,320
AVOIDING HEE-KWAN IS ONE THING,
BUT THEY MUST NOT FORGET THE INHALER

727
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,238
Hurry up and find the inhaler!

728
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,865
That body! That one.

729
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,200
That one.

730
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,493
Hurry up and find it! Hurry!

731
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,995
It's not easy in there.
You're doing great.

732
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,543
-You two over there…
-Found it!

733
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,171
You're looking too comfortable.
You're coming back.

734
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,839
THEY JUST NEED TO ESCAPE NOW!

735
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,757
I found it!

736
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,052
By the way, why did you get on here?
Huh? I think they're all done for now.

737
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,180
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED AFTER 2 MINUTES…

738
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,683
Yeah, I think we're good.
Yeah, okay. Just a minute.

739
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,102
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER?

740
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,311
NO WAY!

741
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,438
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

742
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,358
WITH AN IRON WILL,
HE GOES AFTER DINDIN AGAIN

743
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,031
-No!
-Oppa! Oppa, no!

744
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,452
Yoo Hee-kwan!

745
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,955
You're all really something, man.

746
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,540
-Yoo Hee-kwan!
-No!

747
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,625
HE'S NEARING THE END OF HIS LIMIT

748
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,461
There! A zombie there.

749
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,555
No!

750
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,766
-No, no, no!
-No, no, no!

751
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,356
I'll get rid of these zombies,
and open the gate.

752
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,363
IN THE END,
HEE-KWAN COULDN'T KEEP HIS PROMISE

753
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,240
Get out that way now! Hurry, hurry.

754
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,993
Come on. And rescue me too.

755
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,327
Don't just run away on your own.

756
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,787
It feels weird to be back on the ground.

757
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,998
-Hey, save me too. Come on.
-Run, run, run!

758
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,584
Jeez, Yoo Hee-kwan.

759
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,587
Quest complete.

760
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,505
QUEST COMPLETE
FIND THE INHALER

761
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,304
-Babe.
-Please.

762
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,346
Please help me.

763
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,265
Babe!

764
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,142
Oh, what's that?

765
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,185
Hey!

766
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,728
THEY FIND A SURVIVOR
ON THE MERRY-GO-ROUND

767
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,313
Please help us.

768
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,814
My girlfriend is stuck over there.

769
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,065
-Your girlfriend?
-Yeah.

770
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,192
The girl over there

771
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,776
-with the blonde hair?
-Yeah.

772
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,861
HE MADE IT OUT BUT LEFT HER BEHIND

773
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,113
She's Russian.

774
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,782
-Why did you escape by yourself?
-There are too many zombies.

775
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,201
HE ESCAPED WITHOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND…
DEX CAN'T COMPREHEND THIS

776
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,037
Please don't. Go away!

777
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,622
Come on. Help her.

778
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,373
What do you mean? You should rescue her.

779
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,833
-You're being ridiculous.
-Wait. No, no.

780
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,084
Come over here for now.

781
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,545
-Hey, come on. Follow us.
-Let's go as far as we can.

782
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,714
KOREA IS A SAFE COUNTRY!
WE CAN'T LET A FOREIGNER DIE!

783
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,382
Help! I need help!

784
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,761
There are too many on there,
so I don't think we can get on.

785
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,597
FIVE ZOMBIES
ARE SURROUNDING THE SURVIVOR

786
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,098
I think there are more than ten.

787
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,894
THE ZOMBIES ON THE CAROUSEL
ARE BUCKLED IN AND CAN'T SEEM TO MOVE

788
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,562
Can you help me?

789
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,480
Babe!

790
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,607
-Be quiet. Shush.
-Okay, okay.

791
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,817
You see the one next to her
in the school uniform?

792
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,069
-Yeah.
-Him and him.

793
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,905
IF THEY CAN GET RID OF THE THREE
ON THE RIGHT WITH THE POTATO GUN

794
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,156
-Yeah.
-If we can take out

795
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,282
just those zombies…

796
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,409
IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY CAN SECURE AN ESCAPE PATH!

797
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,036
How many potatoes do we have?

798
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,663
We only have ten potatoes.

799
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,623
-Let's see--
-Come on! Do something!

800
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,459
-Be quiet. What's wrong with you?
-Stop telling us to hurry up, man.

801
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,544
-You're the one who should have saved her.
-I mean…

802
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,545
Wait, wait.

803
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,590
The survivor
has been surrounded by zombies

804
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,842
because they turned the lights on.

805
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,886
They have only ten shots.

806
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,348
And there are three zombies to take out.

807
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,726
Come on! Do something!

808
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,355
If they fail,
the boyfriend won't let it slide.

809
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,192
-The quest begins.
-I've never shot at a moving target.

810
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,903
Aim carefully.
We don't have a lot of chances.

811
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,949
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM LAST NIGHT

812
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,575
WHEN THEY WERE HAVING FUN
AND CHEERING

813
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,576
Whoa!

814
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,414
IT'S HER FIRST TIME SHOOTING
REAL ZOMBIES INSTEAD OF MANNEQUINS!

815
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,124
-I'm nervous.
-Hurry!

816
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,042
-I know.
-This might be loud.

817
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,711
-Okay.
-What's your girlfriend's name?

818
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,629
-Tina. Yeah.
-Tina?

819
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,464
What's your name?

820
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,382
My name is I-su.

821
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,467
-I-su? I-su and Tina.
-Yeah.

822
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,428
YOU MUST MEMORIZE PEOPLE'S NAMES
TO BECOME A HERO

823
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,596
-I promise, I'll save Tina.
-Please.

824
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,473
-Is it in?
-Babe?

825
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,184
-Quiet. Be quiet.
-But you have to be quiet.

826
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,269
I'll give it a shot.

827
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,607
Huh?

828
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,359
Help me!

829
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,903
I said, help!

830
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,322
Oh, you almost hit Tina. Jeez.

831
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,865
-Wait.
-What are you doing?

832
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,242
OOPS! SHE ALMOST RUINED EVERYTHING
RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO

833
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,702
I'm too scared.

834
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,246
I didn't even think that I might hit Tina.

835
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,831
You have to save her no matter what!

836
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,124
THEY HADN'T CONSIDERED
THAT THEY COULD HIT TINA!

837
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,836
-Si-young, you can do this. You have to.
-Dang it.

838
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,921
You can do it, you can do it.

839
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,301
THAT WAS CLOSE!

840
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,677
You almost got it.

841
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,846
You have to concentrate. Come on!

842
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,015
-Are you kidding me right now?
-Seriously.

843
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,350
Do you wanna get beaten up with a broom?

844
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,392
Hurry up.

845
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,686
-What's with him?
-I know.

846
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,229
-Help me!
-What's with him?

847
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,565
-Babe!
-I told you to be quiet!

848
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,608
She keeps calling for me.

849
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,153
HE'S VERY ANNOYING FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S ASKING FOR A FAVOR…

850
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,661
Help me!

851
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,080
Oh!

852
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,460
-A headshot.
-You got him!

853
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,087
That was excellent.

854
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,005
-I got him! Wait.
-Noona,

855
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,257
-you got the zombie right in the face.
-Yes!

856
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,802
Look.

857
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,471
-I can't believe that worked. It worked!
-Did you see that, huh?

858
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,723
THE BOYFRIEND SEEMS TO HAVE
TERRIBLE MOOD SWINGS

859
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,184
I told you to wait. Come on.

860
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,396
I-su, you're too impatient. Jeez.

861
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,981
We got one.
So you need to get the one on the left.

862
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,858
Okay. Seong-jin…

863
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,984
-Seong-jin…
-Yeah?

864
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,486
-No, I-su.
-I-su.

865
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,655
-Right, I-su.
-I-su. Right.

866
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,156
Who's Seong-jin, noona?

867
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,367
Oh!

868
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,622
Did you just hit Tina?

869
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,874
SHE CAN'T LOOK UP
DUE TO EMBARRASSMENT

870
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,378
She's alive. There.
Look, she's moving around just fine.

871
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,382
That one did graze Tina's head a bit.

872
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,175
I know.

873
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,677
But she's not my girlfriend, so…

874
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,179
NOT A GOOD IDEA
TO PROVOKE THE BOYFRIEND

875
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,933
Oh!

876
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,687
IT FLEW RIGHT ABOVE HER HEAD

877
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,273
You nearly hit me!

878
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,816
You nearly hit Tina! Come on!

879
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,317
HONESTLY, SHE HAS NOTHING
TO SAY FOR HERSELF THIS TIME

880
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,694
What are you trying to pull here?

881
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,779
Get out of the way.
I'll fire the gun. I will.

882
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,906
Hurry up and put the potato in.

883
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,368
-Shove that potato in there.
-I don't wanna do this anymore.

884
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,954
Babe, just a minute! Hang tight!
I'll come save you!

885
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,623
-Stop laughing.
-Noona, you almost killed Tina.

886
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,293
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up. What are you doing?

887
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,128
-Hey, man, come on.
-Seriously.

888
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,337
THEY'D LIKE TO JUST SHOOT HIM FIRST

889
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,965
-Be quiet. Shush.
-Hey, do you think this is easy?

890
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,009
I spent so much time hitting on her
in the last two weeks.

891
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,052
-Where did you two meet?
-At a singles bar.

892
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,889
HE'S HESITATING TO HELP HIM…

893
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,557
Come on, shoot them!

894
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,393
ONLY FOUR POTATOES LEFT

895
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,646
Oh!

896
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,234
-I got a feel for it now. I got it.
-You got it? You got it?

897
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,111
SHE WAS ZEROING IN UNTIL NOW!
SI-YOUNG'S GOT THE HANG OF IT

898
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,655
-My Tina's scared.
-Get away from me.

899
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,617
I'm gonna hit it this time.

900
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,202
-Here I go.
-Okay.

901
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,163
You got it!

902
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,916
-Okay!
-You got it!

903
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,501
-You got it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,044
-You got it!
-Two down.

905
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,005
Hurry! Put another one in!
Get another one. Get them!

906
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,507
HER NEXT TARGET MIGHT BE THE BOYFRIEND

907
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,133
What's with him? Seriously.

908
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,480
You killed another one.

909
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,106
Did you see that?

910
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,691
-She never misses a shot.
-Hurry.

911
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,860
You got them.

912
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,906
PERHAPS THANKS TO THE WHINING,
SHE NEATLY TOOK DOWN THE ZOMBIES

913
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,825
NOW THEY CAN RESCUE TINA!

914
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,369
-Are you sure they're passed out?
-I think so.

915
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,828
Hurry! Go get her.

916
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,705
Babe.

917
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,333
-You're here.
-Babe, hurry! Come here.

918
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,793
Hurry, hurry.

919
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,674
I did it, I did it, I did it.

920
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,841
You're the best.

921
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,219
THEY DEFINITELY
SHOULD'VE JUST SHOT HIM…

922
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,470
You've got to be kidding me.

923
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,055
-Thank you.
-What's wrong with that guy?

924
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,140
-Huh? Wait.
-Crap! This way! Come on!

925
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,519
-Zombies.
-Hey.

926
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,853
Crap, zombies.

927
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,022
THEY ENCOUNTER ZOMBIES
BEFORE THEY COULD BE THANKED!

928
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,399
Wait for us! Wait for us!

929
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,361
Get off, you!

930
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,488
-Dang it.
-Wait, huh?

931
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,824
THEY FLEE TO A TRAMPOLINE
OUT OF ALL PLACES

932
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,703
THERE'S NO WAY OUT!

933
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,337
HUH? THE ZOMBIES CAN'T HANDLE IT

934
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,047
Bouncing zombies!
Bounce the zombies!

935
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,591
Dex!

936
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,343
-What's wrong with them?
-What do we do?

937
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,553
They're rolling around.

938
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,470
TERRIBLE BALANCE!

939
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,014
THEY FIGURED OUT
THE ZOMBIES' WEAKNESS

940
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,726
Roll around some more. Here.
Roll. Roll around.

941
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,019
Roll around.

942
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,147
I'm getting tired.

943
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,358
THIS ZOMBIE SEEMS A BIT DIFFERENT

944
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,276
Oh, come on!

945
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,779
Wait for me!

946
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,906
They're totally out of it.

947
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,368
THE ZOMBIE WITH GREAT BALANCE
KEEPS FOLLOWING THEM

948
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,411
Hey!

949
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,833
HE'D EVEN QUALIFY
100!

950
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,209
He's scaring me.

951
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,758
-Here. This way.
-Dex.

952
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,970
-Let's go, noona. Up you go.
-Jump.

953
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,889
LUCKY! THEY FOUND THE ONLY EXIT

954
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,015
Oh, come on.

955
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:18,072
Get away! Get away!

956
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,907
Get lost! Jeez.

957
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,122
Let me catch my breath. Oh.

958
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,709
They almost got me.

959
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,545
Quest complete.

960
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,840
Which way do we have to go? That way?

961
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,468
There?

962
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,970
-I can't even really see now.
-I can't see well either.

963
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,305
-Who is that?
-It's me.

964
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,182
-You're not a zombie, right?
-You were gonna hit me, weren't you?

965
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,517
What now?

966
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,477
I think we better do something. Anything.

967
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,646
-The other guys are working hard.
-Yeah.

968
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,147
But what can a half-zombie do?

969
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,649
-Then…
-Let's do something too.

970
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,859
-Let's clear the place for them.
-How?

971
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,903
How do you think?
We'll gather them up.

972
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:08,789
THE ZOMBIES GATHER AROUND
THE NOSTALGIC SOUND OF THE VUVUZELA

973
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,001
Zombies! What?

974
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,586
Stop, stop. Wait. Hold on.

975
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,964
This is him, right? Hee-kwan.

976
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,175
Poor guy. I'm sorry.
We should have moved your body at least.

977
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,094
-Oh, I'm so sorry. Hey…
-Whoa, Hee-kwan. I'm sorry.

978
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,888
…since we gathered them all here,
should we take them somewhere?

979
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,598
-Come this way.
-Let's go up.

980
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,269
The stairs are narrow.
Two at a time.

981
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,771
Okay, okay.
Use the right side of the stairs too.

982
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,692
Gosh, your joints don't bend
that much, right? I know how that feels.

983
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,403
You need to keep using them
to make them stronger.

984
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,738
Be careful.

985
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,575
Wow, we've gathered
a lot more than we thought, right?

986
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,576
-I know.
-I think we have

987
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,618
almost all the zombies here.

988
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,037
Hee-kwan, you're doing a great job
following us.

989
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,498
Be careful when you come up.
This way. Come on.

990
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,917
Sit in the back if you're a thrill-seeker.

991
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,253
Sit in the middle if you're a chicken.

992
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,046
Oh, gosh, Hee-kwan.
Oh, my goodness.

993
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,674
The P.E. majors are here too. Oh, really?

994
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,802
Let's all take a picture
since we're at a theme park.

995
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,971
Say "zombie" on three.

996
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,390
One, two, three. Zombie!

997
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,978
-Great. Of course they do.
-They love it.

998
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,399
TA-DA! THE SAFETY BARS LOWER
AND RESTRAIN THEM

999
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,944
NOW THEY CAN'T MOVE AT ALL

1000
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,739
Okay, here we go.

1001
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,036
All right. You all have fun!

1002
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,746
Wave when you go up.

1003
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,249
Oh, okay. Here we go. Great!

1004
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,709
Now the other side.

1005
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,336
They know how to enjoy the ride.

1006
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,758
Wee! Both hands in the air.

1007
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,260
Wave. Wave your hands!

1008
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,809
Wave your hands.

1009
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,019
That's great.

1010
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,480
Wave your hands!

1011
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,899
HE'S SLOWLY STARTING TO FEEL IT!

1012
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,195
THEY REACH A 90-DEGREE INCLINE!

1013
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,156
Dang it.

1014
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,284
Crap.

1015
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,787
Wait, I heard…

1016
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,665
THEY'RE JUST HEARING THINGS

1017
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:20,128
WOLMIDO'S SCARY VIKING SHIP
MAKES THEM WET THEIR PANTS

1018
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,440
I'm so sorry.

1019
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,401
-One more time.
-One more time?

1020
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,448
They're loving it

1021
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,367
-right now. Yeah.
-They love it, don't they?

1022
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,327
-Okay.
-Have a fun trip. Bye.

1023
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,495
Let's go!

1024
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,914
It's a bye-viking. Bye-bye.

1025
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,090
3 HOURS LEFT
UNTIL THE RESCUE BOAT ARRIVES

1026
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,383
The Ferris wheel.

1027
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,551
Hey, let's go.
Anywhere, let's just go.

1028
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,635
We're done now.

1029
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,766
I'm too tired to even blow on this now.

1030
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,894
Kkwachu, Na-rae… What the heck?

1031
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,104
What?

1032
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,814
What's wrong?

1033
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,942
-Are you okay?
-Oh, you scared me!

1034
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,819
We're not dead yet.

1035
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,404
-We're not dead yet.
-Are you okay?

1036
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,072
-We were having fun.
-Are you okay?

1037
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,115
-What?
-Na-rae,

1038
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,742
-open your eyes. Come on.
-Why's Hee-kwan here?

1039
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,910
We dozed off. Hey, wake up.

1040
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,120
-Their eyes are redder.
-Their eyes are so red now.

1041
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,580
Na-rae, are you okay?

1042
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,123
She just dozed off.
She's okay.

1043
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,876
Hey, who's that? He's human, right?

1044
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,086
-What the heck?
-Who is it there, huh?

1045
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,546
-In the control room.
-What?

1046
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,882
-Go check it out.
-Is he a zombie?

1047
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,008
Who is it?

1048
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,470
-Oh!
-That startled me.

1049
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,096
-That startled me.
-Are you human?

1050
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,139
-Look closer.
-Is he human?

1051
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,099
-I'm an employee here.
-Are you okay?

1052
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,019
-Oh, he's fine.
-Oh, no. You're shivering.

1053
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,855
So, we can take a boat
in just three hours.

1054
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,357
Come with us.

1055
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,942
-Please take me with you.
-Okay, okay, I promise.

1056
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,570
-It's so cold.
-How do you get on this thing?

1057
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,739
Noona, what's with you?

1058
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,282
I'm freezing.

1059
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,243
-What are you, an electric eel?
-I'm freezing.

1060
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,038
-Oh Dex, I'm so cold.
-You're cold?

1061
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,289
What is this?

1062
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,583
-It's a walkie-talkie.
-Can we borrow these

1063
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,293
-so we can communicate?
-Set it to channel one.

1064
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,045
Once you get on the Ferris wheel…

1065
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,506
-Okay?
-…you can't open the door from the inside.

1066
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,549
You can't get out
unless someone on the outside

1067
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,259
opens the door for you. Do you understand?

1068
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,220
Hang tight here for three hours,
then open the door for us.

1069
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,681
-Since you have to open for us…
-Then I'll stay and hide.

1070
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:36,765
-Yeah, stay hidden.
-Okay.

1071
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,059
How many pods can we get on right now?

1072
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,352
There are about five you can use.

1073
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,646
Put these two in first.
They've been a little contaminated.

1074
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,315
Don't say they're contaminated.

1075
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,484
-No, they've been exposed. Yeah, exposed.
-"Contaminated"?

1076
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,486
-Hong-chul.
-Get in first.

1077
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,988
-Come on. The door is open.
-Get in, hyung.

1078
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,031
Let's go in and look.

1079
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,200
Get in already before the door closes.

1080
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,284
Jeez. My goodness.

1081
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,128
Oppa?

1082
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,462
Huh?

1083
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,131
I think we're gonna die soon.

1084
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,008
No, we've held on this far.

1085
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,390
Oh, gosh. I'm so thirsty.

1086
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,562
Hey, why are you up there?

1087
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,605
-We're gonna get on.
-Well, we need to get on too.

1088
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,898
Tsuki, let's take this one.

1089
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,985
-Go. Get on first.
-Get in. Come on. Get in.

1090
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,616
-See you in three hours.
-Wait. Okay.

1091
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,577
Yeah, wow. We made it.

1092
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,871
-Hey, Patricia. Yeah!
-Wow! Wow!

1093
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,997
We made it!

1094
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,625
Hang in there for three hours
and we'll be safe. We can do it!

1095
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,961
We're safe.

1096
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,255
We're safe now.

1097
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,757
We're safe now! Look.

1098
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,384
-There's no way they can get us up here.
-We can do it. Look.

1099
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,845
Look to your right. See the ocean.
In three hours, we'll be there.

1100
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,930
-We made it.
-We just have to make it

1101
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,640
on the water,
the zombies can't swim, right?

1102
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,560
Tomorrow,
we'll escape to the ocean.

1103
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,979
-It's so pretty.
-Tomorrow!

1104
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,858
Hang in there for three hours
and we'll be safe. We can do it!

1105
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,527
-Yeah! We can do it.
-We can do it!

1106
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,283
The last three days have been so rough.

1107
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,415
I used to be afraid
of confined spaces like this.

1108
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:31,755
-But now, I'm so happy in here.
-There's nowhere better to be right now.

1109
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,090
It feels like I can finally relax a bit.

1110
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,844
I just wanna lie down
and sleep in peace.

1111
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,805
There were a lot of scary moments.

1112
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,182
But I think it was less scary
when we were together.

1113
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,350
-I know.
-Yeah.

1114
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:48,396
Wow.
It looks pretty from up high.

1115
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,356
It's nice.

1116
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,484
Get away from me! Get back!

1117
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,401
What's going on?

1118
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,153
Unni, back there…

1119
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,531
Get away from me!

1120
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,490
Oh, no.

1121
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,034
-Who is that?
-Sounds like the guy working down there.

1122
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,544
Crap! Zombies!

1123
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,461
-Did he get bitten?
-Hey,

1124
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,921
there's a whole bunch of zombies here!

1125
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,799
-The operator got bitten.
-But we can't open the door.

1126
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,050
He's not moving at all.

1127
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,472
What do we do now?

1128
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,266
Who's gonna open the door for us?

1129
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,771
Are we going to die?

1130
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,576
ZOMBIEVERSE
