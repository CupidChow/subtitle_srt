00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,968
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,903
Tsuki, be careful.

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,697
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,532
Tsuki might fly out.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,616
Are you okay?

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,326
It's making me nervous.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,120
DAY 3
6 SURVIVORS AND 3 INFECTED

10
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,208
They have arrived at a new location.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,546
A HIDEOUT DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS
SALVATION OR A TRAP

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,141
What's going on?

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,059
What?

14
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,020
LAST NIGHT, THEY ESCAPED
FROM THE FACTORY WITH HIS HELP

15
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,438
What's this? Jun-hyeok!

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,857
Jun-hyeok, I'm dying!

17
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,321
Hold on.

18
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,781
My goodness!

19
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,533
-Everybody, get out.
-What? Who's that?

20
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,035
Is anyone hurt?

21
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,496
-Sorry? Wait.
-How do we know he isn't a bad guy?

22
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,748
-Jonathan, are you okay?
-Jonathan isn't well.

23
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,208
Jonathan isn't well at all.

24
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,128
-Jonathan, are you all right?
-Thank you.

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,421
His eyes are bloodshot.

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,507
-His eyes are red.
-Jonathan's condition is…

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,175
It seems like he's badly injured.

28
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,510
Excuse me, but who are you?

29
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,887
First, let's go inside and chat.

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,388
I'm Journalist Kim.

31
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,766
I came to Hwangchon-ri
as an undercover journalist.

32
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,850
What?

33
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,732
But my work was completely ruined
because of you.

34
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,943
-Why?
-Because you messed that place up.

35
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,237
Everything is ruined.
I had to go in and save you guys.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,446
-Oh, no.
-Really?

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,073
I have a lot of questions.

38
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,367
-Thank you so much. I feel bad.
-Here.

39
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,203
The Hwayo Newspaper?

40
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,496
Journalist Kim Sal-man.

41
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,123
Unidentified creatures, I see.

42
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,962
Sir, you seem knowledgeable.
Can you take a look?

43
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,464
Can he accompany us in this condition?

44
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,382
Let me see.

45
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,510
Can you read this?

46
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,387
Sal-man…

47
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,807
He's still got his wits.

48
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,435
But based on my experience, more than 78%…

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,146
-What?
-Did you say 78%?

50
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,564
He's turned at least 78%.

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,274
His eyes became totally bloodshot.

52
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,192
Those two got bitten too.

53
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,443
Shall I take a look?

54
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,946
THESE TWO HAVE BEEN INFECTED
FOR MORE THAN 28 HOURS

55
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,739
The redness has spread a bit.

56
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,700
Right, their eyes look bright red.

57
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,493
-He can tell by looking at their eyes.
-Seems like it.

58
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,495
-Let's go inside first.
-Okay.

59
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,000
Honestly, we don't have
anywhere else to go right now.

60
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,002
What's that?

61
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,504
-What are those mannequins?
-Tell me about it.

62
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,548
Aren't those shooting targets, Hong-chul?

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,635
Let's go inside.

64
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,887
What are those cans?

65
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,973
THE HOUSE IS SURROUNDED
BY A ZOMBIE ALERT SYSTEM

66
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,475
He put them up so that they'll make noise.

67
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,061
Let's go inside.

68
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,771
-Can we come in?
-Yes.

69
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,151
This is so scary. What do we do?

70
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,113
What is this place?

71
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,248
-What's that?
-What is all that?

72
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,375
-There are pictures of us here.
-What?

73
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,380
TOWN CHIEF LEE JUN-HYEOK, SEO HO-CHEOL

74
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,176
TOWN HALL
PEOPLE GONE MISSING IN HWANGCHON-RI…

75
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,845
RICE MILL
TOWN CHIEF HIDES HIS MOTHER HERE…

76
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,478
Actually, I initially came to Hwangchon-ri
as an undercover journalist

77
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,855
because I received information
about a UFO.

78
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,650
But then, I heard about the zombies.

79
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,320
Wait.

80
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,822
Is this the old woman
that you saw, Hong-chul?

81
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,282
-That's her!
-Yes, that's her!

82
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,368
-That's her.
-It says she's the town chief's mother.

83
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,869
It says it here.

84
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,999
His mother met an outsider,
got bitten, and turned into a zombie.

85
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,459
SHE WAS BITTEN 3 WEEKS AGO

86
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,504
Look, that's when we entered the town!

87
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,672
There's a picture of us at the entrance.

88
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,800
-That's the town chief.
-He tried to bring us in at all costs.

89
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,176
He brought us in as prey.

90
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,094
Everyone,

91
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,013
the chief has already
turned into a zombie.

92
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,395
Mother! What is this?

93
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,896
Mother.

94
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,065
Mother.

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,822
AFTER DEX AND CREW (9 PEOPLE) CAME TO TOWN

96
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,323
THE CHIEF TURNED INTO A ZOMBIE

97
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,454
JOURNALIST KIM'S INVESTIGATION
FOR AN EXCLUSIVE COMES TO AN END TODAY…

98
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,872
He really must be a journalist.

99
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,626
RAN AWAY? MISSING?
MORE MISSING PERSONS IN HWANGCHON-RI…

100
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,754
THE ZOMBIE VIRUS
BELIEVED TO HAVE SPREAD FROM SEOUL…

101
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,215
Does that mean
the zombies all came from here?

102
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,136
…WAS ALREADY FOUND IN HWANGCHON-RI
3 WEEKS AGO

103
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,470
Makgeolli?

104
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,222
CAUSE OF THE VIRUS = MAKGEOLLI?

105
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,975
NOTHING ELSE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED YET

106
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:14,230
BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN
"IF YOU GET BITTEN, YOU BECOME A ZOMBIE"

107
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,025
Jeez, Jonathan looks weird.

108
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,193
-What is he looking at?
-Jonathan.

109
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,528
-Jonathan.
-What about my brother?

110
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,071
-Jonathan.
-You can see the bite marks.

111
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,656
Jonathan.

112
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,285
Oh, no.

113
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,370
-My goodness.
-What is it?

114
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,122
-This is serious.
-Why?

115
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,374
The change started immediately for him.

116
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,626
Gosh, it's torn up.

117
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,795
I'll give him first aid.

118
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,089
What kind of first aid? Can you delay it?

119
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,050
I can prevent him from biting us.

120
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,218
-That's good.
-Are you going to gag him?

121
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,970
Not exactly.

122
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,888
What's that?

123
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,222
-He can communicate.
-A harmonica.

124
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,266
-A harmonica?
-It's a harmonica.

125
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,727
My brother doesn't know
how to play the harmonica.

126
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,521
If he breathes into it,
we can at least tell where he is.

127
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,107
And he won't be able to bite us.

128
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,984
-He won't bite us.
-It's a good idea.

129
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,153
-That's right.
-He's so out of it.

130
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,946
Okay. Jonathan.

131
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,116
Jonathan.

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,368
SOUNDS NICE AND CLEAR!

133
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,871
We shouldn't laugh.

134
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,456
It's not uncomfortable, right?

135
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,251
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO COMMUNICATE

136
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,295
Beep three times.

137
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,546
Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan.

138
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,675
HE CAN EVEN PLAY A TUNE

139
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,386
That's good. It sounds hopeful.

140
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,305
She's laughing the loudest.

141
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,598
-What do I do?
-Jonathan.

142
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,600
I can't stop myself from laughing.

143
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,518
He's my brother.

144
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
Why don't you go near him and help him up?

145
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,813
Jonathan.

146
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,234
NO NEED TO TRANSLATE THAT…

147
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,944
That means, "I'm going to kill you."

148
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,946
"I'll kill you when I get better."

149
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,824
-"I'll tear you to pieces." I get it.
-What will I tell Mom?

150
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,492
This is so sad.

151
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,247
You know, once you start to turn,
you become strong.

152
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,041
-Yes, you get really strong as a zombie.
-Right.

153
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,460
-He's the strongest among us.
-He might become uncontrollable.

154
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,628
We must quarantine him.

155
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,589
We can quarantine him safely.

156
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,174
For everyone here…

157
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,970
Why me?

158
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,180
You will be fine.

159
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,432
I'll look after him.

160
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,351
Please help him walk. Let's move him.

161
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,562
-Let's go.
-I feel so bad for Jonathan.

162
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,148
We can keep monitoring him by his side.

163
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,108
-Can we?
-You can still see him.

164
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,860
-I know that.
-Go in with him.

165
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,361
-Wish him well too.
-Jonathan.

166
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,249
Jonathan, what's your PIN?

167
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,752
What's your credit card PIN?

168
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,178
HE HELD ON TENACIOUSLY UNTIL NOW

169
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,601
BUT NOW HE'S BEEN LOCKED AWAY

170
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,159
You guys really
shouldn't be afraid of zombies.

171
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,495
-He's right.
-You shouldn't be afraid of zombies.

172
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,372
There's no need to kill them.
Just remove their weapons.

173
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,666
Right, we just have to
make sure they can't bite.

174
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,335
Do we remove all their teeth?

175
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,252
So…

176
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,631
-I've seen this before.
-This is good.

177
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,049
You can even push away two.

178
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,592
-They can't come near.
-Yes, go like this.

179
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,302
-I've seen that before.
-That works.

180
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,595
What if they go like this?

181
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,764
-I know.
-What if they go like this and bite?

182
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,932
If they do that, then…

183
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,392
-Hug from the back.
-Try to bite.

184
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,353
-I can't bite.
-Right?

185
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,021
-So you grab them from behind.
-That's right.

186
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,231
It's because he's short.

187
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,274
-They might bite.
-In case they bite that way…

188
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,027
What if a zombie approaches you
and it's a bit taller?

189
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,737
-Taller?
-Then what would you do?

190
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,490
-My goodness.
-If the zombie is taller?

191
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,117
HIS BACK IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED

192
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,827
-Wait.
-You got bitten.

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,413
He got bitten.

194
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,250
-He got bitten.
-I bit him 12 times in that short span.

195
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,209
I bit him 12 times.

196
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,711
-Sir, don't pretend to be okay.
-You're okay, right?

197
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,255
-What?
-I bit him hard.

198
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,258
But he acted like he didn't get bitten.

199
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,801
THIS INSTRUCTOR HAS A LOT OF PATIENCE!

200
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,179
I was demonstrating the weapon.
Don't bite like your life depends on it.

201
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,974
He was trying to endure it.

202
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,725
In case they bite us like that…

203
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,105
HE MUST'VE GOT BITTEN ON PURPOSE
FOR THE DEMONSTRATION

204
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,898
If only we'd had that on.

205
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,983
Let's go.

206
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,946
INFECTED IN THREE SECONDS!

207
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,990
He moves however I want him to.

208
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,868
-I could've bitten his forehead twice.
-He would've been bitten 120%.

209
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,203
He's not moving.

210
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,540
Okay, let me explain what you do next.
Please pull me up.

211
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,333
And return to the original position.

212
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,918
He gives up very quickly.

213
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,628
In case of such a situation…

214
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,046
He has something else.

215
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
-It's an upgraded version.
-He has more.

216
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,758
-We have this. It's safe.
-How do you use it?

217
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,801
You can catch zombies.

218
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,595
Who's strong here? Come try it.

219
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,929
-Dex.
-Come.

220
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,390
-Dex is the strongest.
-Come here. I got you.

221
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,933
Okay, try to attack.

222
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,643
Okay.

223
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,105
OH! YOU CAN USE THE WALL TO KEEP IT AT BAY

224
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,482
That zombie is too smart.

225
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,693
It's working.

226
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,695
-It's working.
-Are you okay?

227
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,324
…THIS ISN'T A COMEDY SHOW

228
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,617
It's not bad.

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,285
Wow, seriously.

230
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,079
He was in the special forces.

231
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,332
-It's like they're doing a skit.
-It works.

232
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,666
Did they plan this ahead?

233
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,836
-Oh, my goodness!
-It's as if they planned it.

234
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,464
He's just barely out of reach.

235
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,300
WHAT A NICE IMPROVISED SKIT

236
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,386
But if we're outside,
we'll have to keep backing up.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,222
-So you have to go toward a wall.
-We'll keep backing up.

238
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,183
-But there are no walls outside.
-Exactly.

239
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,352
-You have to keep going back.
-That's right.

240
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,491
First, you evade, and then…

241
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,329
You get bitten here, here, and here.

242
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,749
-You get bitten and die.
-You're just offering your hand.

243
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,758
-What's that?
-What's going on?

244
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,177
They're here.

245
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,929
They're here.

246
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,347
Let's go take a look.

247
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,473
They're caught.

248
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,811
They've fallen into a trap that I set up.

249
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,397
-The zombies?
-So they came here?

250
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,649
Yes.

251
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,829
-It's true!
-Where?

252
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,373
-Oh, my!
-His head got cut off.

253
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,125
There are two of them.

254
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,334
But only one got caught.

255
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,045
I can't stand this kind of stuff.

256
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,255
Can you hand me the net?

257
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,673
Be careful!

258
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,301
He got him.

259
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,013
This is what we did earlier
in the living room.

260
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,350
IT LOOKED RIDICULOUS,
BUT IT WAS AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE

261
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,310
Wait. Did they plan this ahead?

262
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,439
Hey.

263
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,190
What do you do next?

264
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,359
The net is about to rip.

265
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,071
Get him.

266
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,031
Take him inside. Into the bathroom.

267
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,158
-Bathroom?
-Bathroom?

268
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,410
-Wait, seriously…
-The net is about to rip.

269
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,662
-Over here.
-Where?

270
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,830
The bathroom.

271
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,082
-The net is ripping.
-Dex, be careful.

272
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,251
What's this?

273
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,836
Here.

274
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,421
-What?
-What's that?

275
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,465
Why are you opening it? Don't open it!

276
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,854
-What's going on?
-What?

277
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:53,981
What is that?

278
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,566
It's okay, they're all tied up.

279
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,526
Push him inside.

280
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,995
So scary!

281
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,168
Hurry. Let's close the door.

282
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,586
Don't open the door.

283
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,837
-It's Si-young.
-Were you bitten?

284
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,297
Did you get bitten?

285
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,466
-We caught him.
-You got bitten.

286
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,759
-We caught him.
-Guys,

287
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,428
he gathered some zombies in the bathroom.

288
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,554
He gathered them there?

289
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,140
-There are seven zombies in there.
-Seven of them?

290
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,558
Mr. Kim is the real deal.

291
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,102
It's me.

292
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,151
Although this may seem
like an insignificant butterfly net,

293
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,653
I caught them with this.

294
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,987
JOURNALIST KIM'S CREDIBILITY HAS GONE UP

295
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,947
The bloodstains.

296
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,365
I'm scared. What's that?

297
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,824
I'm serious.

298
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,826
We went out and saw two zombies there.

299
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,328
But one of them was dead.

300
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,788
I guess they set off his trap.

301
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,831
So one died. His head got cut off.

302
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,043
He has a cell in here.

303
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,795
-Where?
-Go check it out.

304
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,797
-They have harmonicas in their mouths.
-It's true.

305
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,049
But they're nailed to their faces.

306
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,636
-We'll go look.
-You should.

307
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,846
Mr. Kim is the real deal.

308
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,474
-He is the real deal.
-Where?

309
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,522
-What the heck?
-Jeez.

310
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,565
What's wrong?

311
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,571
Oh, no!

312
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,701
Stop it.

313
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,994
What happened to them?

314
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,247
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,838
Hyung, what if they do that to us?

316
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,922
No, never.

317
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,675
-What if they remove our teeth?
-No, we'll keep talking.

318
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,052
-Are you sure?
-We'll be fine if we talk a lot.

319
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,346
How terrible. I feel their pain.

320
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,681
We'll keep talking, even in our sleep.

321
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,350
Let's keep talking, okay?
If I fall asleep,

322
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,227
-slap me in the face, okay?
-We can't fall asleep.

323
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,520
Slap me, okay?

324
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,606
I'm so scared.

325
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,317
They're staying in the same house as us?

326
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,320
Before they changed like that,
when they were like Jonathan,

327
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,196
he put it on them and tied them up.

328
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,366
Then should we put Jonathan in there too?

329
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,183
HE'S BRINGING IN A ZOMBIE?

330
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,976
-I hear sounds.
-He's here.

331
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,148
-Why's he bringing one?
-It's the one that was in the front.

332
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,192
He's totally a zombie.

333
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,445
-He's so scary.
-Can he even talk?

334
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,325
Wait. Hold on.

335
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,040
Wait. Hold on.

336
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,793
-He's coming.
-He's heading straight for us.

337
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,252
-He's not even looking that way.
-Right.

338
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,297
We don't have to worry.

339
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,967
-Maybe he doesn't like us as much.
-Come here.

340
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,096
-We aren't food.
-He's coming toward us.

341
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,013
It's okay.

342
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,391
What do we do?

343
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,230
-Wait.
-He's coming.

344
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,539
My chest hurts.

345
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,999
He's totally a zombie.

346
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,917
Yes, he's fully turned.

347
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,670
But we had worked together
for a very long time.

348
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,755
He's the one who took the pictures.

349
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,507
He's the photographer?

350
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,302
I'm also waiting
for a cure to be developed.

351
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,222
So I'm keeping him under my protection.

352
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,515
THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS THE ZOMBIES

353
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,685
How long has he been like this?

354
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,603
More than a week now.

355
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,733
I'll take him back now.

356
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,193
Get some rest in the meantime.

357
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,361
I feel bad for him.

358
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,488
-But it's so sad.
-Tell me about it.

359
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,115
They seem so close.

360
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,037
A WORLD WHERE THE ZOMBIE VIRUS HAS SPREAD

361
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,794
Drink this.

362
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,588
Here you go.

363
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,924
REGARDLESS, THERE ARE PEOPLE
YOU CAN'T ABANDON

364
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,427
Get some rest, okay? Keep your body warm.

365
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,928
And stay alert.

366
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,098
Look at your socks.
Did you crawl your way here?

367
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,224
You're okay, right?

368
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,690
You guys will have to protect yourselves,
so you'll need some training.

369
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,608
We'll do it.

370
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,401
We can learn to survive too, right?

371
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,489
There are many ways
to use various objects.

372
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,282
When you see zombies,

373
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,868
-you can use these to move.
-How?

374
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,119
You put it over yourself.

375
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,206
-No way.
-We can't see you!

376
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,333
-That works.
-That's so great!

377
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,709
-It's cute.
-It's cute.

378
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,252
NOTE: ONLY USABLE
BY PEOPLE WITH A CUTE HEIGHT

379
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,797
-There is a reason why he survived.
-Next.

380
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,924
-Roll!
-Without looking at where you're going?

381
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,383
No!

382
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
THE SECRET TO UNDERCOVER JOURNALISM
HAS BEEN REVEALED

383
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,887
What do we do?

384
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,597
-Are you okay, sir?
-Is he hurt?

385
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,723
Are you all right, sir?

386
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,476
Then you can roll down easily
all the way here.

387
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,936
-You're right.
-Let's try it.

388
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,938
-Is it because he's skilled?
-I'm dizzy.

389
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,733
-Since I have a similar build as Mr. Kim…
-Will you try it?

390
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,985
Watch your head.

391
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,529
You can evade and also attack.

392
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,446
Wait.

393
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,823
It fits him well.

394
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,324
-Wait.
-He looks so cute.

395
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,742
Sit down.

396
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,245
-He's perfectly hidden.
-Sit down.

397
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,872
Sorry, DinDin.

398
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,207
-I'll roll it now.
-Hey, come on!

399
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,208
Tuck in your feet.

400
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,627
-Hey!
-DinDin!

401
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,754
-Hey!
-DinDin!

402
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,923
-Get out of the way, Tsuki!
-DinDin!

403
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,426
-Did you see Patricia kicking it?
-Are you okay?

404
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,096
ALMOST WENT TO HWANGCHEON IN HWANGCHON-RI

405
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,389
Are you okay?

406
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,808
-Are you okay, DinDin?
-Patricia kicked it hard.

407
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,310
-Hey.
-I thought she was Hwang Hee-chan.

408
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,813
I'd rather die than do that.

409
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,857
It felt like I was falling off a cliff.

410
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,152
Sir, it's our first time
laughing like this in a long time.

411
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,903
A fun way to learn survival tips.

412
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,029
I love it.

413
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,656
I have a real gun.

414
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,824
-A gun?
-Gun.

415
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,825
Let me show you.

416
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,993
-You have a gun?
-Great.

417
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,371
THE SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING ZOMBIES WITH THEIR BARE HANDS

418
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,251
BUT THEY WERE HELPLESS
WHEN THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY THEM

419
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,090
THEY DESPERATELY NEED A WAY
TO FIGHT THE ZOMBIES FROM A DISTANCE!

420
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,134
Well, I made it myself.

421
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,844
It's called a potato gun.

422
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,262
-What?
-Potato?

423
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,347
Is that why there were so many potatoes?

424
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,772
JOURNALIST KIM'S SURVIVAL CLASS
POTATO GUN TRAINING

425
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,358
-That looks like a pipe.
-Yes, I made it with a pipe.

426
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,777
-With PVC pipes.
-But that can shoot?

427
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,778
That's right.

428
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,822
HANDMADE POTATO GUN:
SHOOTS OUT POTATOES

429
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,616
MADE WITH READILY AVAILABLE PVC PIPES

430
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,658
POWER YET UNKNOWN

431
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,952
-It sounds good in theory…
-I don't think it'll work.

432
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,829
-Can you demonstrate?
-Exactly.

433
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,206
-You want me to show you?
-Yes!

434
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,415
Please show us.

435
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,667
-Potato.
-Load.

436
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,923
Oh, you block it like that.

437
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,300
-Here. What you use at home.
-It's an insecticide.

438
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,135
-This one.
-An insecticide.

439
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,137
-With the gas.
-That works?

440
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,599
INJECT THE HOUSEHOLD SPRAY
INTO THE GUN BARREL

441
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,021
Ignite!

442
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,161
THE POWER IS MORE IMPRESSIVE
THAN EXPECTED!

443
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,080
Wow, it actually fires.

444
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
It's amazing!

445
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,375
That's awesome!

446
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,044
DON'T KNOCK IT UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT

447
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,712
It's pretty strong.

448
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,131
-And the leftover pieces of the bullet?
-Awesome.

449
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,676
-Yes.
-You can save them to eat later.

450
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,220
THE ZOMBIE WEAPON EVEN USES THE SHELLS

451
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,388
That's awesome.

452
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,765
-Si-young, go for it.
-Go ahead and try it.

453
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,268
-I want to try it.
-First, open the chamber.

454
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,894
It's not like a revolver.

455
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,481
-Let's do this first.
-Open the chamber. Next?

456
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,984
-Then, load the potato.
-Load the potato.

457
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,735
There mustn't be any leaks. Press it down.

458
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,072
LOADING FAILED!

459
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,615
You sliced it diagonally.

460
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,409
That's because she's a housewife.

461
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,619
She's slicing
as if she's cooking, not loading.

462
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,329
-Wait.
-Because she cooks every day.

463
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,622
-Diagonal slicing.
-I know.

464
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,999
It needs to go in at once.

465
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,376
That decides our dinner menu.
Let's eat potatoes.

466
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,377
Sounds great!

467
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,548
He can even make one on the spot.

468
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,508
-You need to press this part.
-Okay.

469
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,639
-It shoots very far.
-It's not too strong?

470
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,851
My ears hurt a bit,
and there's a bit of recoil too.

471
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,061
-If we practice…
-It shoots well.

472
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,814
-It shoots well.
-If we aim it a little higher, it'll work.

473
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,691
Let's get in groups of two.

474
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,860
-There are three women and three men.
-Shooters and assistants.

475
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,778
Divide into shooters and assistants.

476
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,613
-I pick Si-young.
-Okay.

477
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,365
-I'll go with Tsuki.
-Yes, great.

478
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,950
Who will be the shooter?

479
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,493
Can you be the shooter?

480
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,621
-It'll be Tsuki.
-Wow, seriously.

481
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,541
HE STRONGLY RECOMMENDS
SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER USED A GUN BEFORE

482
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,084
It's important to experience it.

483
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,836
-Right.
-It's not because I'm scared.

484
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,212
I did my military service.

485
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,797
Please tell me when you're ready.

486
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,007
-Ready!
-Ready!

487
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,133
Fire lane one is ready!

488
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,259
Load the potato.

489
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,720
-Okay.
-Load the potato.

490
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,597
REPEATING THE ORDER!
A BASIC RULE OF TRAINING!

491
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,598
Loading complete!

492
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,016
-Loading complete!
-Loading complete!

493
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,017
Open the chamber.

494
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,518
-Open the chamber!
-Open the chamber!

495
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,395
Okay, insert gas.

496
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,730
-Insert gas.
-Insert gas.

497
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
-Go!
-Just a moment.

498
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,693
-Fire.
-Fire!

499
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,572
WHAT? THE GUN ISN'T WORKING

500
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,992
It's not working!

501
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,452
Gun jammed!

502
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,953
You're all dead.

503
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,955
Shouldn't we kill you for this, sir?

504
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,082
Why doesn't it work?

505
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,502
If it's moist inside, it won't spark.

506
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,711
-Oh, no.
-I see.

507
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,879
IT DIDN'T WORK DUE TO THE WEATHER

508
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,591
IT DOESN'T WORK WELL IN KOREA
WHERE THERE ARE FOUR DISTINCT SEASONS!

509
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,218
Let's shoot something at least.

510
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,386
GIVEN HER PERSONALITY,
SHE WANTS A BULLSEYE

511
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,347
Get set. Fire!

512
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,099
-Fire!
-Why won't ours work?

513
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,352
TSUKI FIRES SUCCESSFULLY!

514
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,646
Yes!

515
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
-Yes!
-Fire!

516
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,317
-Why won't it work?
-Let's see.

517
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
Fire!

518
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,656
IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
TO BE EATEN ALIVE BY ZOMBIES

519
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,622
THE JAPANESE WOMAN WHO'S NEVER ENLISTED
IS GETTING THE MOST EXPERIENCE

520
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,540
Shoot.

521
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,916
Gosh, darn it.

522
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,377
Gosh, I'm getting angry.

523
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,755
This is making me really agitated.

524
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,257
Seriously.

525
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,843
It's really pissing me off.

526
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,678
THE INSTRUCTOR DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

527
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,971
Wait, sir.

528
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,098
It's a bit weak.

529
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,724
If it works inconsistently,

530
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,770
-we could all die.
-That's its one small weakness.

531
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,647
-Actually…
-So…

532
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,982
He knew about the weakness?

533
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,151
I wasn't going to show you this one.

534
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,533
JOURNALIST KIM BRINGS OUT
HIS ULTIMATE WEAPON!

535
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,826
-What's that?
-What's that?

536
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,952
What's that?

537
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,246
A FUEL TANK THAT CAN SUPPLY GAS STABLY

538
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,374
A LONG BARREL FOR INCREASED SHOOTING RANGE

539
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,257
I think this one will really work.

540
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,010
THIS ONE IS NO DOUBT NETFLIX QUALITY!

541
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,725
IT'S POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO OBLITERATE THE POTATO!

542
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,603
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH TO KILL THE ZOMBIES!

543
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,146
This won't fail us.

544
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,397
Why'd you bring this out now?

545
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,398
This is it!

546
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,026
-It's awesome.
-It's basically a cannon.

547
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,697
JOURNALIST KIM PUNISHES
THE FAILED POTATO GUN

548
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,282
Why are you doing that?

549
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,367
-You have to save your energy.
-Please don't.

550
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,660
Save your energy.

551
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,413
-I'm just so angry.
-Please save your energy.

552
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,165
Let's start with the first group.

553
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,750
-First group.
-Fire lane one.

554
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,085
IT'S TIME TO START TRAINING
WITH THE NEW WEAPON

555
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,879
-Loading complete.
-Loading complete.

556
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,342
SHE AIMS BY USING THE TRIGGER?

557
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
-Fire.
-Okay!

558
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,844
-Fire!
-Fire!

559
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,891
-It was really strong this time!
-Awesome!

560
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,892
All right!

561
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,518
Top marksman!

562
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,645
Okay.

563
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,355
Fire.

564
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,524
THE FIREPOWER IS INCREDIBLE!

565
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,943
It's so strong.

566
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,027
It's so cool!

567
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,987
-It's so strong.
-This is fun.

568
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,157
-Let's go.
-Ready!

569
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,951
-Ready, set.
-Fire.

570
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,286
-Let's go!
-Let's go.

571
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,085
SHE SHOT THE RIGHT ARM! FIRST HIT!

572
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,003
THAT'S IT! EQUIPMENT MATTERS, INDEED!

573
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,505
-Yes!
-Awesome!

574
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,881
-She got it!
-Si-young!

575
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,467
-She got it.
-You hit the right side of the chest.

576
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,593
I was the top marksman.

577
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,470
THE COMMANDER (SELF-PROCLAIMED
TOP MARKSMAN) CAN'T JUST SIT BACK

578
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,721
Get ready to fire.

579
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,973
-Get ready to fire.
-Get ready to fire.

580
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,061
HIS SHOOTING FORM MAKES ONE QUESTION
IF HE WAS IN THE MILITARY

581
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,065
Target the third zombie. Fire!

582
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,112
Wait.

583
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,784
THE POTATO BASICALLY LEAKS OUT

584
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,202
HE'S EMBARRASSED OF THE LIMP TRAJECTORY

585
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,537
It recognizes the shooter.

586
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,538
DinDin.

587
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,292
Wait, DinDin.

588
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,793
What did you say you used to be?

589
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,877
-It just fell.
-Sir.

590
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,754
Sir, please help me save face.

591
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,590
-I looked super uncool.
-It leaked on one side.

592
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,175
It judges the person's character.

593
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,468
The person's character.

594
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,053
-I'll try it.
-Great.

595
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:37,971
Yes, great.

596
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,723
THE LEADER STEPS IN
TO MANAGE THE SITUATION

597
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,890
Okay.

598
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,767
-Here we go. Get ready to fire.
-Okay.

599
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,185
Get ready to fire.

600
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,687
He makes it look so light.

601
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,318
THEY CHEER UPON SEEING HIS TEXTBOOK FORM!

602
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,158
(WAITING FOR THE ORDER TO FIRE)

603
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,120
Target the third zombie.

604
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,622
(MOUNTED ON THE SHOULDER)

605
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,756
The third zombie. Fire!

606
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,715
(FIRE!)

607
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,018
(HITS THE WEAK SPOT!)

608
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,312
Awesome!

609
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,732
(SAFETY ON!)

610
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,027
WE'RE ALL WITNESSES

611
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,946
TO "THE REAL TOP MARKSMAN"

612
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,786
I want to try shooting!

613
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,120
DESPERATE TO REDEEM HIMSELF

614
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,080
You can do it!

615
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,456
I can do it!

616
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,459
Hey, there aren't many potatoes left.
That's enough shooting.

617
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,919
I can shoot!

618
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,004
-I can shoot.
-You can shoot!

619
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,382
I can shoot!

620
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,550
EVEN HIS YELL SOUNDS PATHETIC

621
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,220
Okay, target the third zombie. Fire!

622
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,642
DinDin, just forget it.

623
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,769
-But…
-DinDin.

624
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,897
WE'RE ALL WITNESSES

625
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,941
TO "THE MAN WHO HANGS HIS HEAD"

626
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,193
-That was a very good try.
-Sir.

627
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,236
He can do it!

628
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,240
But this has a higher probability
of hitting the target.

629
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,282
-Yes.
-That's right.

630
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,411
(RIGHT IN THE GRILL)

631
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,912
THERE'S BEEN A SIMPLER WAY ALL ALONG!

632
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,748
-This would hurt them more.
-It's a lot more powerful.

633
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,917
This is more powerful.

634
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,090
-Kicking is the most powerful.
-He's right.

635
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,175
Then why did we do all this training then?

636
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,844
What was the point?

637
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,229
THE SUBLEADER IS HESITANT TO GO INSIDE

638
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,480
Sir, can I try it alone?

639
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,648
Yes, go ahead.

640
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,571
SINCE SHE WAS SELECTED AS THE SUBLEADER

641
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,157
SHE HASN'T SHOWN ANY OUTSTANDING ABILITIES

642
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,658
Wow, he's amazing!

643
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,204
Awesome!

644
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,376
Hold on.

645
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,462
THE SUBLEADER'S COMPETITIVENESS IS ON FIRE

646
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,924
-All set?
-Yes.

647
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,145
-A headshot.
-Did you see that?

648
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,147
-I finally got the hang of it.
-100 points!

649
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,234
The biggest winner is right here.

650
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,946
NO ONE SAW,
BUT THE SUBLEADER REDEEMED HERSELF!

651
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,283
I mean, there might be an antidote.

652
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,076
But how could they do this to us?

653
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,704
They abandoned Jonathan
without a second glance,

654
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,831
and they'll leave us in the end.

655
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,334
-Those bastards. No, scratch that.
-Gosh, seriously.

656
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,543
Those punks.

657
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,170
At least I got married.

658
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,130
You haven't yet. You must feel so robbed.

659
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,423
THE HALF-ZOMBIES ENJOY DRINKS

660
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,926
I even froze my eggs
thinking I'd get married.

661
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,470
Fuck. I'm screwed.

662
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,848
You even froze your eggs?

663
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,142
It's even more expensive
for single people.

664
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,061
The government doesn't subsidize it.

665
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,647
-I spent five million won on it.
-Five million?

666
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,733
How many bottles of makgeolli is that?

667
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,152
I could've used that to buy drinks.

668
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,947
They're separated from their owner.
What good are they now?

669
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,575
-You need sperm for those eggs, you know?
-My goodness.

670
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,036
My goodness. Five million won.

671
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,747
At this rate, I'm going to die.

672
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,875
But I don't want to die.

673
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,806
Hello.

674
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,142
This is Jonathan.

675
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,480
I turned 23 this year.

676
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,065
JONATHAN STARTS RECORDING HIS WILL

677
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,692
I wanted to turn 24

678
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,320
and do a lot of more fun things.

679
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,615
I wanted to get my driver's license,

680
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,494
date someone, and get married by 25.
That was my dream.

681
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,748
I still haven't had a chance
to enjoy college yet.

682
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,083
A YOUNG MAN'S DREAM WITHERS AWAY

683
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,002
I won't get to do any of that now.

684
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,129
I feel so wronged.

685
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,594
But I get to leave a message like this.

686
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,941
I believe this will be my final vlog.

687
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll record how I turn into a zombie
step by step and keep this video.

688
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,283
So everyone,
please smash that like, subscribe…

689
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,659
A VIRAL VIDEO CAN HELP HIS SISTER!

690
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,703
…and notification buttons.

691
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,872
Thank you.

692
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,332
Let's get a million views.

693
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,958
Let's get 50 million views.

694
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,382
What's wrong, Jonathan?

695
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,550
What's wrong, Jonathan?

696
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,062
A ZOMBIE PLAYING THE HARMONICA…
THIS IS PERFECT FOR YOUTUBE!

697
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,732
-I can hear the harmonica.
-I can hear Jonathan.

698
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,150
Something is actually here?

699
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,193
What is this place?

700
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,071
-I'm amazed that such a place exists.
-It looks like a jail.

701
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,156
-Is it a jail?
-What is this place?

702
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,533
-Is this a house?
-I hear a harmonica.

703
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,243
What the heck is this?

704
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,414
It's the one Dex caught.

705
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,499
Get him.

706
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,294
A CAPTIVE ZOMBIE PLAYS A TUNE
IN A SUSPICIOUS PLACE

707
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,638
PHYSICAL: 005
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

708
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,056
Come on in.

709
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,349
It's safe.

710
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,518
-What is this place?
-The building is…

711
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,769
-What's this?
-Is this dangerous?

712
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,189
For now, come inside after I make it safe.

713
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,316
-What? Don't open the gate.
-You're going in?

714
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,609
Why are you opening it?

715
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,070
What is he doing?

716
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,238
-What?
-What the heck?

717
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,454
What is he doing?

718
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,248
-What?
-What the heck?

719
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,168
Until now,
we've been training with weapons.

720
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,420
This time, it's combat training.

721
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,632
How to get out of a situation
when you're faced with zombies unarmed.

722
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,385
I never thought of that.
We always ran off.

723
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,886
We always ran away.

724
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,016
You'll all learn how to take down
a single zombie bare-handed.

725
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,435
-Sorry?
-One-on-one?

726
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,311
Hold on. This is so scary.

727
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,022
-Hug them from behind.
-Get behind them?

728
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:44,939
Yes.

729
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,275
-Roll him up in a mat.
-What is he doing?

730
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,694
-He rolled him up!
-It'll be fine if they can't bite.

731
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,405
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE TEETH.
YOU JUST CAN'T GET BITTEN!

732
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,243
HIS MOUTH HAS BEEN SEALED FOR SAFETY

733
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,163
-My goodness.
-It's totally…

734
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,581
He's saying to come in quick.

735
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,874
Go on in.

736
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,543
Okay, who will go first?
I just demonstrated.

737
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,336
-Si-young.
-Don't be ridiculous.

738
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,380
-Why not?
-What's wrong with you?

739
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,966
Si-young, go for it.

740
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,427
THE FORMER BOXER SUBLEADER
IS A GOOD FIRST CANDIDATE!

741
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,471
-The fighter enters.
-Let's go!

742
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,556
-You can do it!
-Let's go, national athlete!

743
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,349
-Let's go!
-You can do it!

744
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,476
Hug from behind.

745
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,686
Show us your boxing skills, Si-young!

746
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,654
What the heck?

747
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,948
-Look at her!
-That's it. A wrestling technique.

748
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,913
EXACTLY AS SHE WAS TOLD

749
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,876
-What?
-What?

750
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,546
Who's the zombie here?

751
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,881
She's really amazing.

752
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,509
SHE TOOK HIM DOWN EASILY

753
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,386
Once I was in there,
I was able to find the courage.

754
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,807
A CUTE FELLOW ENTERS PATHETICALLY

755
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,978
DinDin, don't make him angry.

756
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:06,979
The poking technique.

757
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,357
No!

758
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,650
SUFFERING AFTER A HIKE IN THE WOODS

759
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,110
-What?
-What is he doing?

760
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,112
Look out! Be careful!

761
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,863
-Oh, gosh!
-He got faster!

762
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,448
Poke him!

763
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,120
Mr. Kim.

764
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,996
-Is it me now?
-It's your turn.

765
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,997
THE ATHLETIC LEADER IS UP NEXT

766
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,375
-You can do it!
-Can you put the harmonica back on?

767
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,003
THE ANGRY ZOMBIE'S GAG CAME UNDONE!

768
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,173
Hey, close the gate.

769
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,384
HE DIDN'T SCREAM TO HELP DEX…

770
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,386
Why is he like this when it's my turn?

771
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,638
If Dex gets bitten, we're doomed.

772
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,390
Dex is the one who caught him.

773
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,142
PERHAPS HE REMEMBERS
DEX'S HUG FROM EARLIER

774
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,318
-Look at that.
-Oh, my.

775
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,700
HE EASILY TOOK HIM DOWN, OF COURSE

776
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,035
So it's possible.

777
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,078
Wow.

778
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,454
Hey, be careful, Dex.

779
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,248
The harmonica is loose.

780
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,708
WATCH THE MOUTH! HE MIGHT GET BITTEN

781
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,625
Watch your arm!

782
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,549
HE MUST FINISH UP QUICKLY AND ESCAPE!

783
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,138
HE DEMONSTRATES AN INSANE FINISH

784
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,807
THE MAN WHO HAS NO LIMITS

785
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,727
KIM DEX

786
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,228
He must be out of his mind.

787
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,150
-You learned a lot, right?
-Yes.

788
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,444
-Now there will be two.
-Oh, no.

789
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,361
-What?
-But why?

790
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,448
A ZOMBIE WILL BE ADDED
FOR THESE TOP STUDENTS

791
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,910
All right.

792
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,579
THIS TRAINING IS A MUST
TO FACE THE HORDES OF ZOMBIES!

793
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,832
We can't get bitten here.

794
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,418
-When else will we be able to do this?
-She's brave.

795
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,336
-It's just two.
-I'll go.

796
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,253
She's something else.

797
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,338
THE SUBLEADER (WARRIOR) KICKS IT OFF

798
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,380
She's a warrior!

799
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,430
AFTER SHE HUGS ONE FROM BEHIND,
THE OTHER APPROACHES IMMEDIATELY

800
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,431
She went straight for him!

801
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,605
SHE QUICKLY IDENTIFIES THE MOVING TARGETS!

802
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,691
You must keep fighting.

803
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,657
SHE'S GOOD, BUT 2:1 DOESN'T LOOK EASY

804
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,492
You're so great.

805
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,535
-We can't get bitten, right?
-You can do it.

806
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,330
Bring it on.

807
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,042
HE THROWS HIM DOWN
RATHER THAN HUGGING HIM FROM BEHIND

808
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,502
Like real combat.

809
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,469
HE QUICKLY EVADES THE BITING ZOMBIES

810
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,180
HE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO FIGHT
MULTIPLE ZOMBIES ALONE!

811
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,306
Not bad.

812
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,977
He's relaxed now.

813
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,064
NOW THAT HE'S RELAXED,
HE EVEN USES THE OBJECTS AROUND HIM

814
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:55,982
Amazing.

815
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,194
WITH SUCH SKILLS, HE'D NEVER GET BITTEN

816
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,153
Be careful.

817
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,364
His whole body is a weapon.

818
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,428
That'd mean he's bitten!

819
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,014
THE GAG TOUCHED HIM!

820
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,015
He got bitten. He's dead.

821
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,101
HE'D BE DEAD WITHOUT THE GAG!
YOU CAN'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN

822
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,437
-You can't show off.
-That's right.

823
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,980
Wow, but he was so great.

824
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,150
THE TRAINING CONTINUES
FOR A WHILE AFTER

825
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,401
Get away from me!

826
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,069
-Oh, no!
-She got caught!

827
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,031
WHILE THEY PASSIONATELY
CONTINUE THEIR TRAINING…

828
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,867
They wouldn't scold us
for eating the ramyeon, right?

829
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,910
-Cheers to the half-zombies!
-Great. Cheers!

830
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,204
To the world of the half-zombies.
It's our world.

831
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,666
THEY'RE STILL HAVING A DRINKING PARTY
AND SNACKING ON RAMYEON

832
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,876
Humans are weak.

833
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,254
-This is great. Cheers!
-Cheers to…

834
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,214
-What's going on?
-"Cheers"?

835
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,426
-What? "Cheers"?
-"Cheers"?

836
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,719
Are you drinking?

837
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,220
-You're back.
-We're cooking ramyeon.

838
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,847
There was leftover alcohol.

839
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,557
What? Are you drinking?

840
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,684
Gosh, what are you doing?

841
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,770
-How much did you drink?
-What are you doing?

842
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,024
There's ramyeon and potatoes too.

843
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,651
Hold on. If we cook ramyeon for them,
would they take us?

844
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,320
Should we ask them if they want some?

845
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,615
SADLY, THEY WERE PREPARING FOOD
NOT TO GET ABANDONED

846
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,911
We've been working hard
putting our lives on the line.

847
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,914
Wait a minute.

848
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,125
I saved you
and you ate all my precious food?

849
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,420
I've been eating it
only a little at a time to save it.

850
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,714
We have to stay here for a long time.

851
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,883
So I've only been eating
a little bit at a time

852
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,303
and soaking it as much as possible
to increase the food's volume.

853
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,847
But you ate it
when it's in its smallest state.

854
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,140
We boiled potatoes too.

855
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,185
But these are our bullets.

856
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,145
THEY CLUELESSLY DEPLETED
THE PRECIOUS BULLET SUPPLY

857
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,939
-Load the potato.
-Load the potato.

858
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,109
THEY'RE JUST ORDINARY POTATOES NOW

859
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,236
-But these are our bullets.
-Wait.

860
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,195
Wait.

861
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,864
Who cooks potatoes like this?

862
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,658
We didn't have a steamer basket.

863
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
But…

864
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,744
-The thing is…
-Did you wash the potatoes?

865
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,287
What the heck?

866
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,872
Isn't that how you boil them?

867
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,582
You don't even do this for potato soup.

868
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,960
Try it first
and don't eat it if it tastes bad.

869
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,461
FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN SCOLDED
FOR COOKING POTATOES BADLY

870
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,047
Hong-chul, you're eating it
because you're hungry.

871
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,257
-Hey.
-I'm telling you.

872
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,174
It's delicious.

873
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,927
-He knows how to cook potatoes.
-Goodness fucking gracious.

874
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,596
I've boiled potatoes for 30 years.

875
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,434
AFTER SCOLDING THEM HARSHLY,
SHE ENJOYS THE POTATOES

876
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,145
-We just boiled four.
-Is that right?

877
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,980
-Hong-chul, it's good.
-It's so good.

878
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,274
Si-young,
you really shouldn't eat it, though.

879
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,859
You made us feel so bad.

880
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,861
The potato is so delicious.

881
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,945
It's really good.

882
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,071
Isn't it?

883
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,239
Yes, it is.

884
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,784
How many people are sharing
the four packs of ramyeon?

885
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,994
Ten people.

886
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,621
-Wow, ramyeon. Seriously?
-I really want to eat ramyeon.

887
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,331
It looks tasty.

888
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,041
It smells so good.

889
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,753
Let's make the noodles
as soggy as possible.

890
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,339
YOU SHOULD EAT SOGGY NOODLES TO FEEL FULL
(ACCORDING TO JOURNALIST KIM)

891
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,799
But ramyeon should be firm.

892
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,926
If you want it firm, then don't eat it.

893
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,553
I like it soggy.

894
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,096
-Me too.
-Me as well.

895
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,598
I love eating it totally soggy.

896
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,476
There is a way to do it.
We need more than just noodles.

897
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:19,894
Those are worms.

898
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,270
-Oh, my.
-These aren't worms.

899
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,105
-Isn't that fernbrake?
-Yes, it is.

900
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,565
I don't like it.

901
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,983
I don't like it.

902
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:26,942
Then don't eat it.

903
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,110
Yes. You're out too.

904
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,403
We have one less person.

905
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,863
-I like fernbrake.
-Sure.

906
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,448
I love fernbrake.

907
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,867
-Wow.
-How much fernbrake is he adding?

908
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,285
They really look like worms.

909
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,204
It's fine as long as
it tastes like ramyeon.

910
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,080
-Let me taste it.
-Hey!

911
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,707
THE SUBLEADER VOLUNTEERS
TO BE THE GUINEA PIG

912
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,209
-I'll just taste it.
-I'll cut off your hands.

913
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,752
Just one small bite.

914
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,337
-No.
-Hey.

915
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,963
THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A SMALL BITE

916
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,257
You're ruining our camaraderie.

917
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,800
-Okay, fine.
-Got it?

918
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,969
You used to control your portions.
What's with you?

919
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,100
-That looks delicious.
-Wow!

920
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,687
THEY LOSE THEIR MINDS
AS THEY HAVEN'T HAD RAMYEON IN A LONG TIME

921
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,231
Let's eat.

922
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,107
Wait. It doesn't have enough protein.

923
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,653
We need protein.
You guys need more than just ramyeon.

924
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,489
Hey, protein. That means meat.
He's going to serve us meat.

925
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,533
-Here.
-Is it something weird?

926
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,700
What the heck is that?

927
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,494
-I see that you all lack stamina.
-No!

928
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,620
-What is that?
-So…

929
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,664
Are those mealworms?

930
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,583
TA-DA! IT'S THE PROTEIN-PACKED
FOOD OF THE FUTURE

931
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,543
They're bugs!

932
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,504
-We need to eat this as is.
-Hold on.

933
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,838
No!

934
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,173
Wait, don't pour them in!

935
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:32,841
Fuck!

936
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,176
Don't pour them in!

937
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,139
It's so gross.

938
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,892
It's full of maggots.

939
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,769
INSTANT RAMYEON HAS TURNED
INTO HEALTHY FOOD

940
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,605
These guys are very delicious.
They're full of flavor.

941
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,315
I've never eaten ramyeon like this.

942
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,818
-He took his portion so quickly.
-Seriously.

943
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,653
CUTE DINDIN REFUSES THE PROTEIN

944
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,988
He's such a sneaky punk.

945
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,614
It's all gone.

946
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,036
(GIVE ME SOME)

947
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,750
I can't look at it.

948
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,546
DRAMATIC REACTIONS
UPON SEEING SUCH A MIRACLE!

949
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,924
-My stomach can't handle that.
-Dex, you can't eat it either?

950
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,634
My stomach is upset.

951
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,261
Wow, it's so shocking!

952
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,305
-Jeez!
-What is that?

953
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,850
-What is that?
-Are those grasscrickets?

954
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,102
DRIED GRASSHOPPERS:
THEY'll RUIN YOUR HARVEST

955
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,521
BUT THEY'RE PROTEIN-RICH
AND CAN MAKE YOU FEEL FULL!

956
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,398
-He said grasscrickets.
-What are grasscrickets?

957
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,525
Tsuki can't handle it. Hang in there.

958
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,320
Are they grasshoppers or crickets?

959
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,487
What are grasscrickets?

960
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,823
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

961
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,826
-They go well with beer.
-What are they?

962
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,286
-Grasshoppers.
-Grasshoppers.

963
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,579
-He's tough.
-Grasshoppers.

964
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,122
HE CONTINUES TO PARADE
THE FOOD OF THE FUTURE

965
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,541
-Grasshoppers.
-They're too much. What's that now?

966
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,877
-What is it?
-Crickets.

967
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,670
DRIED CRICKETS:
FLAVORFUL AND NUTRITIOUS EDIBLE INSECTS

968
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,089
THE LATEST ESG STRATEGY TO OVERCOME
THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS (OMITTED)

969
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,633
I'm about to cramp up.

970
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,760
It smells weird.

971
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,178
That's insane!

972
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,846
Tsuki is so funny.

973
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,184
She is so funny.

974
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,354
How come you hate these
more than the zombies?

975
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,023
-This is insane.
-Wow, this will be a challenge.

976
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,399
Let it settle for a bit.

977
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,693
-Let it settle and expand.
-Unbelievable.

978
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,196
I think she lost her mind.

979
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,364
Is she okay?

980
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,742
-She's losing her mind…
-Tsuki.

981
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,912
-She isn't infected, but she's losing it.
-I really can't take it.

982
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,872
-What's with her?
-Want to go to the bathroom?

983
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,123
It's so shocking. This one too.

984
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,084
-Wow!
-You said you…

985
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,254
IT FINALLY LOOKS LIKE
IT'D BE ENOUGH FOR TEN PEOPLE

986
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,297
It looks like worms.

987
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,467
But it really did expand a lot.

988
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,094
It got bigger. That's insane.

989
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,512
I think we'll have leftovers.

990
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,223
-Even if we all eat, we'll have leftovers.
-It really expanded.

991
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,600
They all got plump.

992
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,935
The mealworms are growing.

993
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,730
Darn it.

994
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,524
She's making me laugh.

995
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,276
-It got softer.
-She wasn't as scared of the zombies.

996
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,655
Tsuki, are you scared of bugs?

997
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,198
I… really…

998
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,783
You should eat some to survive.

999
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,660
Dex, you aren't going to eat?

1000
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,578
Don't UDT soldiers eat things like this?

1001
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,580
NOTE: THERE IS NO CONNECTION
BETWEEN UDT AND MEALWORMS

1002
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,124
You can't eat bugs?

1003
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,669
SHE CHEERFULLY PROVOKES HIM

1004
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,046
Sure, I can.

1005
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,549
HIS PRIDE CONTROLS HIS WORDS

1006
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,925
Give me the chopsticks.

1007
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,389
They do look like shrimp.

1008
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,891
Then Tsuki, you eat first.

1009
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,685
Okay, but if I eat it…

1010
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,396
-Don't they eat this in the UDT?
-Yeah, don't they?

1011
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,690
Well, active soldiers do,
but I've been discharged from service.

1012
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,108
This is the dinner service.

1013
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,693
Dinner service.

1014
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,112
No, I mean, you should try some.

1015
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,655
SHE LOVES CRAPPY JOKES LIKE THIS

1016
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,739
What's wrong?

1017
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,451
What do you want? Fernbrake?

1018
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,829
-Yes, try it as you're recommended.
-Mealworms?

1019
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,622
A small portion, please.

1020
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,249
Oh, shit.

1021
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,463
Did you try it?

1022
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,589
Should I go for it?

1023
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,095
It makes me want to vomit.

1024
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,305
Oh, no.

1025
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,809
SHE'S CHEWING IT PEACEFULLY
AFTER MAKING A FUSS

1026
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,027
WOW… SHE'S REALLY SCARY

1027
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,445
-Tsuki, is it good?
-Is it good?

1028
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,113
Yes, it is.

1029
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,531
The back of my head hurts.

1030
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,949
It's a mess.

1031
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,827
-Eat up.
-I think we'll keep eating that anyway

1032
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,245
as long as we're here.

1033
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,623
-No choice.
-Get used to the taste.

1034
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,209
You said it's protein.

1035
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,835
-It's food for weight loss.
-It's all protein.

1036
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,795
It's the protein-rich food of the future.

1037
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,882
-I won't look at it or hear about it.
-But…

1038
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,968
He's enjoying it.

1039
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,678
OH, NO… DEX IS COMPLETELY DEFEATED
FOR THE FIRST TIME

1040
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,268
We said the ramyeon wasn't enough,
but we have a lot left.

1041
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,520
I wonder why.

1042
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,854
Hey, I'm full.

1043
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,189
It's unbelievable.

1044
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,024
-That's fascinating.
-I'm on a diet.

1045
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,776
Anyone hungry? No one, right?

1046
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,753
Look at Jonathan. Keep looking.

1047
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,421
He keeps having convulsions.

1048
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,632
What's wrong with him?

1049
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,342
I think he's turning into a zombie.

1050
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,471
-He keeps doing this.
-Look at his eyes.

1051
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,186
-Something's wrong with Jonathan.
-Look at him.

1052
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,064
His veins are all swollen.
They're bulging out like fernbrake.

1053
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:42,067
He's been like that for a while.
Let's bring him some ramyeon.

1054
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,069
-Jonathan.
-Jonathan.

1055
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,196
He's sleeping. Leave him alone for now.

1056
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:12,472
THE JORDAN RIVER
THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH

1057
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,318
He keeps breathing heavily.

1058
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,987
-Then let's just give him some noodles.
-Okay.

1059
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,280
Some noodles and…

1060
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,287
-Jonathan, I brought you some ramyeon…
-His movements seem odd.

1061
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,955
Go see him.

1062
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,377
Jonathan, have some ramyeon.

1063
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,135
Jonathan, have some ramyeon.

1064
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,868
I brought you some ramyeon.
You said you wanted it earlier.

1065
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,080
Jonathan.

1066
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,790
Jonathan!

1067
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,750
Something's wrong with him. Can you come?

1068
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,836
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

1069
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,213
-Hyung, go in there.
-Don't joke around. He was fine earlier.

1070
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,548
-What?
-Something's wrong.

1071
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,384
He isn't moving.
He won't eat ramyeon either.

1072
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,931
Hey, Jonathan. Hey!

1073
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,141
-Hey!
-What's wrong with him?

1074
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,226
This isn't good.

1075
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,061
What's wrong?

1076
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,690
Come in here now. Hurry.

1077
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,316
-Jonathan!
-What's wrong?

1078
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,068
-What's wrong, Jonathan?
-Jonathan!

1079
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,570
Jonathan!

1080
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,239
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong, Jonathan? Please breathe!

1081
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,407
What's going on?

1082
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,325
What's wrong, Jonathan?

1083
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,368
Jonathan.

1084
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,662
Jonathan.

1085
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,627
Oh no.

1086
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:49,022
