4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,891
Hello, this is Ro Hong-chul. I'm alive.

5
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,981
I believe Park Na-rae and DinDin
have been contaminated.

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,901
They got bitten, but they're denying it.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,737
-What do we do? Turn that off!
-Now…

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,739
Jung-yoon, it's Mommy. I'm okay.

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,198
What's going on?

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,700
Oh, no!

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,786
I promise I'll come to you.
You'll be good, right?

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,704
Mom.

13
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,705
What do we do?

14
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,748
No!

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,710
The passcode for my bankbook
is your birthday, okay, Mom?

16
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,670
Mom, Dad!

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,465
I hope everyone is fine.

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,220
-I don't know what'll happen…
-Give it to me!

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,847
I think DinDin and Na-rae got bitten.

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,098
We didn't. Turn that off!

21
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,836
Na-rae.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,338
Hong-chul.

23
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,924
-Hong-chul.
-What do you want?

24
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,550
Wait.

25
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,593
Oh, my gosh!

26
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,013
-What's that?
-I see smoke.

27
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,598
-What if it explodes?
-We crashed.

28
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,766
-Oh, no.
-Si-young.

29
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,477
Director.

30
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,020
Director!

31
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:46,981
Director.

32
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,274
What do we do?

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,776
-Sir!
-Oh, no!

34
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,944
What's wrong with him?

35
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,529
-What happened?
-Wait…

36
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,239
-He's dead.
-No, he isn't.

37
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,698
-He's dead.
-Oh, no.

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,033
He's not breathing.

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,493
-He's not breathing?
-DinDin.

40
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,036
What do we do? I'm scared.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,664
There are zombies out there!

42
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,005
Let's go inside and talk. Let's hide.

43
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,841
Wait, we can't leave the director.

44
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,217
If the car explodes, we all die.

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,678
-Let's pray for his soul.
-What?

46
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,346
HE'S MOVED ON QUICKLY!

47
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,557
-What's wrong with you?
-You're terrible.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,684
Come on. Look at the smoke.

49
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,145
Let's pray for his soul and go.

50
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,313
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,606
I'm so sorry.

52
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,024
Let's head toward that light.

53
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,651
11:58 PM
THEY LAY HIM AND HIS HEADPHONES TO REST

54
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,695
Wait, I see dead people lying over there.

55
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,114
-It's a supermarket.
-There are zombies.

56
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,991
-I can't get there.
-Let's do this.

57
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,785
-Na-rae, get on my back.
-No, you can't carry me.

58
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,829
-I can. Are you over 60 kg?
-You really can't.

59
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
Over 60 kg? Well, not officially…

60
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,875
…IT SEEMS THAT SHE IS!

61
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,168
-Come on.
-Oh, no.

62
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,587
Get on my back.

63
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,380
Hurry, get on.

64
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,885
-Oh, no.
-Si-young.

65
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,928
They're eating them.

66
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,763
Look at those poor people!

67
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,557
Help! Please help me up!

68
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,268
-My goodness.
-Please help me up.

69
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,478
-I'm sorry.
-Hurry.

70
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,316
-Hurry!
-We have to go!

71
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,317
She's biting her!

72
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,152
Let's go!

73
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,737
Come on. Quickly!

74
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,701
Come inside. Hurry!

75
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,244
Come quick!

76
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,997
Let's close the doors.
Hong-chul, close them now.

77
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,374
There's a button here.

78
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,376
Oh, no, it's opening!

79
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,253
We got it.

80
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,924
-Hey.
-There may be some in here too.

81
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,468
-Oh, no!
-Hong-chul, get me down.

82
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,929
My chest hurts.

83
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,555
-It really hurts.
-Be quiet.

84
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,686
They have arrived at a new location.

85
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,399
A SUPERMARKET IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SEOUL

86
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,946
IT'S EVIDENT THAT
SOMETHING HAS SWEPT THROUGH IT

87
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,824
They keep coming.

88
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
There might be some here too.

89
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,298
What?

90
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,676
-What's wrong?
-Why?

91
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,136
-What's wrong?
-Why?

92
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,304
What's wrong?

93
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,765
What are you doing?

94
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,933
Get away!

95
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm a person!

96
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,603
Be quiet.

97
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,646
I'm a human.

98
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,859
GOODNESS! IT WAS JUST
AN EMPLOYEE IN HIDING

99
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,820
-Were you bitten?
-Damn it.

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,281
There are so many zombies outside.

101
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,615
-You weren't bitten?
-Over there.

102
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
-Was she bitten?
-My crutch.

103
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,410
The door. Over there.

104
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,245
-Hurry.
-People are gathered there.

105
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,372
Someone's coming.

106
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,333
OFFICE

107
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,460
-What if she's been bitten?
-She's fine.

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,008
-We should lock this.
-Hey!

109
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,802
-Sir!
-Over here.

110
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,554
-Wait.
-Sir, please help us.

111
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,431
-It doesn't open?
-Sir, we've been…

112
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,100
A lot of people are in there.

113
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,727
-Wait!
-I'm TV personality Ro Hong-chul!

114
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,270
-No.
-Don't open it.

115
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,354
No.

116
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,441
-Tell them you're Ro Hong-chul.
-We're survivors.

117
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,484
I'm Ro Hong-chul, the TV personality.

118
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,653
I'm Park Na-rae, the comedian.

119

I'm Tsuki of Billlie. Do you know me?

120
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,824
Lee Si-young is here too.
You know her, right?

121
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,745
Oh, gosh. No!

122
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,621
-Please!
-Can you please open the door?

123
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,165
Please hurry!

124
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,834
-Please wait. Step back!
-They're coming in!

125
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,669
The door won't hold!

126
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,212
-Please let us in!
-Help!

127
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,423
-Check if they've been bitten.
-Yes.

128
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,841
We haven't been bitten.

129
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,093
Hey, Jonathan, it's you!

130
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,636
Jonathan!

131
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,263
Jonathan, open the door!

132
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,890
-No, hear us out.
-Hold on.

133
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,767
Okay. We have a doctor here.

134
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,602
-Doctor?
-Zombies have different eyes.

135
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,229
Wait, but he's a urologist.

136
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,731
-But…
-Right, he's a urologist.

137
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,024
You don't want to come in?

138
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,233
-Hurry up.
-Your eyes.

139
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,946
-Park Na-rae is okay.
-Come in if you've been checked.

140
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,532
She's okay.

141
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,951
-I'm okay too, right?
-Yes. Okay.

142
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,495
Quickly. She's okay.

143
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,122
Hey, DinDin, you just need to
show them your eyes.

144
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,207
-Show them your eyes.
-DinDin.

145
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,172
He's fine. Okay.

146
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,174
Open the door.

147
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,842
He opened it.

148
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,719
-What's taking them so long?
-Hurry.

149
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,762
-Hurry.
-Quickly.

150
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,305
-They're coming.
-Hurry!

151
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,389
We're finally inside.

152
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,058
-Close the door.
-Yes.

153
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,226
-Close it.
-Close it.

154
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,143
Damn it.

155
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,730
-Why didn't you open up?
-How were you going to face us later?

156
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,191
-So many people have died outside.
-Come on, guys.

157
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,735
-They're right there. Let's keep it down.
-Okay.

158
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,653
Have a seat first.

159
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,905
Why are there so many celebrities here?

160
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,448
We just finished a shoot.

161
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,958

00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,122
No one here got bitten?

177
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,540
-No one got bitten.
-No one.

178
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,958
It's been more than an hour.

179
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,294
Na-rae, just in case.
Please don't get me wrong.

180
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,087
We should be honest with you too.

181
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,883
While we were at the gas station
trying to pump gas,

182
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,594
she and he came
into slight contact with them.

183
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,262
-No.
-What's wrong with him?

184
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,598
STARTLED AT HIS CANDID REPORTING

185
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,349
-A doctor is here.
-What an idiot.

186
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,269
Did you see it, Hong-chul?
I was just splashed with some blood.

187
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,690
-I saw it.
-But Na-rae was scratched.

188
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,900
-The thing is…
-No.

189
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
OH NO! HONG-CHUL'S WORDS CAUSE A STIR

190
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,569
I'll tell you what exactly happened.

191
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,946
The blood splashed and got into his eyes.

192
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,949
-But they just touched my leg a little.
-She got scratched. Look.

193
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,950
No!

194
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,744
Don't! No!

195
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,330
I didn't get scratched.
It just brushed right off me.

196
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,123
It's risky if it got into his eye.

197
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,667
-Yes, that's risky.
-It didn't get into my eye.

198
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,587
We need to keep an eye
on DinDin and Na-rae.

199
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,047
-We should.
-If it got into his eye,

200
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,632
-he might be infected.
-Okay.

201
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,300
Then we'll keep our distance.

202
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,136
If we feel uneasy,
we can just throw them out.

203
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
Excuse me, Dr. Kkwachu,
why would you say that?

204
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,139
We need to survive.

205
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,517
I really enjoy
your YouTube videos, you know?

206
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,935
YouTube isn't important here.

207
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,728
HE ALMOST LOST A PRECIOUS FOLLOWER

208
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,147
Anyway, let's introduce ourselves.

209
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,609
What about you?
Are you a customer or an employee?

210
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,487
I run a business inside the supermarket.

211
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,989
-You can call me Mr. Jung.
-A business owner, I see.

212
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,909
And these people
are supermarket employees.

213
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,702
Then you must know this place well.

214
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,162
Business owner? As if.

215
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,872
-You sell rice puffs.
-Rice puffs.

216
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,750
Rice puffs are a legitimate business.
What's your problem?

217
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,293
We were going on a retreat.

218
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,004
-They're Physical Education majors.
-Physical Education? Great.

219
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,714
What about the person in the back?

220
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,550
-I'm just an ordinary citizen.
-Really?

221
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,134
I met him here.

222
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,054
He's a former UDT soldier.
He was in the special forces.

223
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,306
He's our leader.

224
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,226
You know The Iron Squad, right?

225
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,188
People like them are
all very handsome nowadays.

226
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:35,116
THE WOMEN FORGET ABOUT THE ZOMBIES
AND ARE FEELING MUCH BETTER

227
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,786
You're right. He's handsome indeed.

228
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,205
We're about to die.
This isn't the time for romance.

229
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,915
Better than dying alone, you punk.

230
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,667
-I want to date.
-So you'll date, then die?

231
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,835
You'll die before then.

232
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,630
-Shut it, you idiot.
-Those two might have been exposed.

233
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,175
-My goodness.
-What's this? Emergency alerts.

234
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,510
Emergency alerts are working.

235
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,929
I got it.
"Central Disaster Relief Headquarters."

236
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,349
"Persons presumed to be infected with
an unknown virus are increasing."

237
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,936
"Uninfected persons should find
emergency food and hide indoors."

238
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,063
"Outdoor activities are prohibited."

239
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,857
"Be prepared
for follow-up security measures."

240
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,859
-See? We can't go outside.
-It must be more dangerous.

241
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,653
But we're lucky.
We're inside and there are goods here.

242
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,114
There are CCTV cameras here too.

243
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,991
There are many of them.

244
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,702
CAN USE CCTV CAMERAS WHILE FINDING FOOD

245
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,454
We can get food here too.

246
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,706
We need water and other things too.

247
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,044
But even so,
we're basically dead being in here.

248
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,462
Don't you get what that message means?

249
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,963
WE'VE SEEN THIS ANGER IN DISASTER MOVIES!

250
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,715
But at least we're all together.

251
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,217
My point exactly.
Let's all speak one by one.

252
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,053
We were speaking one by one.

253
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,764
It's okay. We're all here together.

254
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,390
So don't be scared.

255
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,101
Okay, dear.

256
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,311
-My goodness.
-It's okay.

257
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,687
HIS ANGER COOLS AT HER WORDS

258
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,938
Okay.

259
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,149
-It's okay.
-Here. Have a rice puff.

260
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,442
-My goodness.
-What?

261
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,818
-Rice puffs?
-Just for Tsuki?

262
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,529
-You didn't give me any when I was hungry.
-I made them myself.

263
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,323
-Here you go.
-Let me have some.

264
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,034
I was so hungry. Thank you.

265
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,994
-First, I have a question.
-Yes.

266
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,539
The monster-like things
that we encountered.

267
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,916
-They reacted to sound.
-Yes.

268
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,002
They moved when we made sounds.
It didn't seem like they could see.

269
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,170
What was it like here?

270
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,421
I'll be honest.

271
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,965
We were just anxious
since our phones weren't working.

272
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,676
-We don't know.
-We don't know.

273
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,182
So the only thing that we know for now
is that they respond to sound?

274
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,393
Mr. Soldier, what should we do now?

275
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,936
We should explore, right?

276
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,898
The most important thing right now
is to secure food.

277
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,066
-I'm hungry.
-Water.

278
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,818
-And tools to defend ourselves.
-Water.

279
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,194
-We should get weapons.
-Yes.

280
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,196
-First, water.
-We need water.

281
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,990
Foods that have a long shelf life
and don't require cooking.

282
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,659
-Canned food.
-Yes, food like that.

283
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,077
Canned tuna.

284
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,287
I think canned tuna is a good choice.

285
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,997
Green grape-flavored candy.

286
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,416
Don't just say things you like.

287
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,584
But don't we need candy for sugar intake?

288
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,628
A small amount could be necessary.

289
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,047
-A small amount, but not a lot.
-Green grape candy.

290
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,591
-We said we need to be hydrated.
-Yes.

291
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,136
Cereal is delicious and also hydrating.

292
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,971
-Are you kidding?
-Jot down cereal.

293
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,224
-The sweet one with the tiger.
-Yes, the tiger. We need his energy.

294
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,809
-What…
-Everyone is different.

295
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,437
-Then get cereal for weight loss.
-Sounds good.

296
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,729
We might die.

297
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,648
-Who cares about weight loss?
-But…

298
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,941
Just eat whatever.

299
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,443
Keep it down!

300
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,444
My goodness.

301
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,779
If there's any strawberry yogurt…

302
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,282
Strawberry yogurt?

303
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,118
Strawberry yogurt with cereal.

304
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,870
-Yes, it's so good.
-Butane gas.

305
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,080
Then let's get sirloin
from the meat section.

306
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,957
-We can grill it.
-We can't cook it.

307
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,376
Making it back alive
is more important than the food.

308
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,670
Then who wants to go out there first?

309
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,425
IMMEDIATE SILENCE

310
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,969
It's better for a UDT soldier to go
rather than us.

311
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,515
In the military,
we used to have a buddy system.

312
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,892
A team of two or three.

313
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,809
We should pair up.

314
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,686
-Whether it's teams of two or three,
-I can't go.

315
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,605
-we should go.
-We can't all go at once.

316
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,940
-We'll go.
-We…

317
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,734
-Jeez.
-You shouldn't go.

318
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,527
-It's dangerous.
-We've been here for a while.

319
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,987
-You were out there?
-They're slow.

320
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,280
We saw them on the way in.

321
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,950
-The zombies are slow to react.
-Don't do it just because of your major.

322
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,702
They're young and reckless.

323
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,538
-The zombies are slower than you think.
-They're P.E. majors indeed.

324
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,916
Don't worry about us. We'll be brave.

325
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,001
Just let them go if they want to.

326
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:14,960
By the way,

327
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,421
it'd be nice to have a signal
whenever there's danger.

328
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,174
We should make a sound
when they're in danger.

329
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,509
Isn't there a PA system here?

330
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,219
-We have the supermarket jingle.
-She's a long-time employee.

331
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,512
-A jingle?
-Yes.

332
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,514
No need for words. Just play the jingle.

333
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,266
It's set up here.
You just need to press this, right?

334
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,684
-Press it.
-Press it.

335
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,270
-It's working.
-It's playing.

336
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,480
It's not here, right?

337
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,023
I think it's playing in there.

338
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,150
So many fresh foods available

339
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,610
It's gushing with excitement

340
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,445
Star Mart

341
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,282
If you're out there and hear the jingle,
come back right away.

342
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,576
You can always go back out
after you return.

343
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,661
-Watch the CCTV.
-Okay.

344
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,538
-We'll be watching you.
-You'll be okay.

345
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,622
You sound confident.

346
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,876
-Be careful.
-Will we get 30 million views?

347
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,671
He's a YouTuber.

348
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,882
THE TECH-SAVVY YOUTH DON'T WASTE
A CHANCE TO MAKE A GOOD VIDEO

349
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,842
This is bound to go viral. We'll be back.

350
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,177
Take it easy.

351
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,303
Be careful.

352
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,764
Lower your body.

353
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,017
By the way, shouldn't we lock the door?

354
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,019
-Lock it.
-We have to lock it.

355
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,230
-Lock it.
-We should.

356
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,483
-They're going.
-We can see them.

357
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,403
You should come here
and monitor the CCTV footage.

358
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,407
Zoom in wherever they go.

359
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,367
-Let's zoom in and keep watch.
-Okay.

360
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,412
-I see them.
-There they are.

361
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,329
Then…

362
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,331
Are they here?

363
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,292
-That one.
-Yes, that one.

364
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,251
-That's it.
-Yes.

365
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,627
-We got it.
-Yes.

366
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,255
I'm going to take
everything I want to eat.

367
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,424
-Let's just do what we want.
-Okay.

368
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,804
No zombies, right?

369
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,809
-Hey, help me with this.
-Hold this?

370
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,727
Yes, help me.

371
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,314
They passed that first section.

372
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,399
That middle section is blocked off.

373
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,734
We shouldn't go there.

374
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,069
They're doing a good job.

375
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,656
-Have an energy drink first?
-Yes, give me one.

376
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,076
-They're drinking something.
-Right.

377
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,370
-They're drinking something?
-That's fine. It's okay.

378
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,706
-He's putting on a cap.
-Do I look better with this on? Let's go.

379
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,710
Hey.

380
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,631
Clear?

381
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,341
Come this way.

382
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,218
-It's fine. Let's say hello.
-It's all good.

383
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,845
-To the security cameras?
-Yes.

384
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,558
They're doing great.

385
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,311
It's like watching the World Cup.

386
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,063
-Be quiet.
-The spirit of the youth.

387
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,731
-No zombies. It's okay.
-Who says?

388
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,942
-Good job.
-Good job.

389
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,193
They're doing great.

390
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,114
Any zombies?

391
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,996
Things like this. Tuna.

392
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,708
Tuna.

393
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,920
-They're packing them.
-Yes.

394
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,963
Good work.

395
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,673
-They're doing great.
-Good job.

396
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,799
They're doing great.

397
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,094
Let's take four bottles.

398
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,387
-The bag.
-Okay.

399
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,890
Bro, granola.

400
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,600
They're getting cereal.

401
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,268
-Great work!
-Yes!

402
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,603
-Yes!
-Wow.

403
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,438
-Cereal for weight loss.
-Are they?

404
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,773
-Yes, they are.
-Cereal!

405
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,942
-Chocolate puffs.
-Check the angle.

406
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,486
But is it fine to make that much noise?

407
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,656
They managed to gather that much.
They should bring it back first.

408
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,908
-They can go back out.
-They're bringing everything they can.

409
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,201
There are no zombies here.

410
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,830
But it'll be pointless if something
goes wrong before they make it back.

411
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,206
Yes. They should come back.

412
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,624
-Spam.
-They're too careless.

413
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,502
-But there are no zombies.
-They're too careless right now.

414
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,004
-It's too risky.
-Channel seven.

415
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,880
-Seven.
-Okay, seven.

416
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,591
-They're writing something.
-What if they can't return?

417
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,468
They're a little buzzed right now.

418
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,470
-They're drunk.
-What does it say?

419
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,930
-Just come back now.
-What does it say?

420
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,099
-What are they doing?
-"Everyone."

421
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,101
-"Don't worry."
-"Don't worry."

422
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,979
-Don't worry!
-There are no zombies.

423
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,607
-This isn't the time…
-What are they doing?

424
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,277
I feel anxious. It's going too well.

425
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,945
We locked the door.

426
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,405
-No.
-They're still just kids.

427
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,614
Come back now.

428
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,949
-But…
-They're just kids.

429
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,118
-They should come back. I'm scared.
-Let them be.

430
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,204
-Right, water.
-I think they said water was over there.

431
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,666
It's making noise when we drag it.

432
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,084
-Carry it together?
-Okay.

433
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:25,919
You got it?

434
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,172
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

435
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,216
-Three.
-Three.

436
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,260
A LOUD NOISE WAS MADE

437
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,344
We're screwed.

438
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,721
-My goodness.
-Hey!

439
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,139
Hey, turn on number four.

440
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,308
-Turn on number four.
-There was a noise.

441
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,684
-There.
-What?

442
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,769
-The box broke.
-No.

443
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,395
-They lifted it and it all fell out.
-Wait.

444
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,481
-Number one. That one.
-Keep it down.

445
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,440
Quiet down.

446
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,028
Damn it.

447
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,529
We're screwed.

448
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,908
Damn it.

449
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,661
Really?

450
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,925
There's a zombie.

451
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,853
-What's going on?
-What?

452
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,438
-Oh, no!
-It's a zombie!

453
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,108
Be quiet! The zombies will come to us.

454
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,698
Let go!

455
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,538
-Play the song.
-Hurry.

456
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,747
-The song.
-The song.

457
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,958
-I turned it on.
-It's too late for that.

458
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,588
So many fresh foods available

459
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,632
It's gushing with excitement

460
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,551
Star Mart

461
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,275
-Who is that?
-That's not it.

462
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,818
Zoom in.

463
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,236
-Zoom in.
-There are a lot.

464
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,492
-Channel four.
-Seven.

465
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,743
Look at the bottom one.

466
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,078
Use the mouse.

467
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,372
-What?
-There are a lot.

468
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,416
-What?
-There are a lot.

469
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,500
-Hey.
-We're doomed.

470
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,626
Be quiet.

471
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,710
Oh, no. Look!

472
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,131
Oh, no.

473
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,885
-You should've played the song earlier.
-I did.

474
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,308
-Over there.
-The storage room.

475
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,227
What do we do?

476
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,478
What's happening?

477
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,188
-Don't look.
-That's terrible.

478
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,649
This is so awful.

479
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,117
This is so awful.

480
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,495
Don't scream.

481
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,705
-Oh, no.
-Don't look.

482
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,207
-Did he get bitten?
-Yes.

483
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,429
It seems

484
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,098
it's too dangerous here.

485
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,600
-No.
-Let's get out of here.

486
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,644
-Sir.
-I…

487
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,313
-I need to go to the restroom.
-No, you can't.

488
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,773
-I want to get out.
-No!

489
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,941
-No.
-No, Mr. Jung.

490
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,234
-Sir.
-Let me go.

491
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,568
-Stop them.
-Stop them.

492
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,945
-Mr. Jung. Wait.
-Please.

493
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,571
-We'll all die too.
-Wait.

494
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,699
-No!
-Stop him from opening it.

495
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,950
He's trying to open it.

496
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,077
They want to go.

497
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,413
-But we'll all get killed too.
-No, stop…

498
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,331
They're going. Close the door.

499
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,916
-Let them go if they want.
-Why?

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,168
-They want to go.
-Hey.

501
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,546
-They wouldn't have listened.
-We were all together, though.

502
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,463
How are we to stop them?

503
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,049
-This is wrong.
-I can see them crawling.

504
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,967
They're crawling.

505
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,306
They must be out of their minds!

506
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,849
-Let me see.
-Is there a walkie-talkie?

507
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,600
-You can't go.
-I'll bring them back.

508
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,810
-No.
-No, don't go.

509
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,312
-They're right out there.
-Don't.

510
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,731
Let's not get emotional.
They already went outside.

511
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,357
-We need to survive.
-But listen…

512
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,027
Kkwachu Hyung and DinDin,
how could you be so heartless?

513
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,612
-But they left.
-Logically, we couldn't stop them.

514
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,989
How is that logical?

515
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,115
-How?
-They're going like this.

516
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,783
Na-rae, you bring them back then.

517
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,952
We should've stopped them
before they went out.

518
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,746
-What?
-What?

519
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,165
-Where is that coming from?
-What's going on?

520
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,337
They're lying on the ground.

521
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,047
I can see them on the ground.

522
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,592
-Did they get bitten?
-They got bitten.

523
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,385
That's why I told them not to go.

524
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,763
You told them to go! Look what happened.

525
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,181
What are you going to do?

526
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,559
-Did that lady get bitten?
-Yes.

527
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,144
-Seriously?
-What do we do?

528
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,157
5 VICTIMS IN JUST 30 MINUTES

529
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,539
I want to say this
to Kkwachu Hyung and DinDin.

530
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,042
Don't encourage other people to leave,

531
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,169
-even if they want to.
-But I…

532
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,879
I didn't. DinDin did.

533
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,382
I didn't encourage them.
They wanted to leave.

534
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,884
You encouraged them.

535
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,594
If they want to leave, they should.

536
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,847
We can't save them.

537
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,182
Don't fight.

538
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,391
Let's do this.

539
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,144
You two can be a team.

540
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,395
-Sounds good.
-You two are one team.

541
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,356
-The two of us?
-You two think alike.

542
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,566
THE PERFECT MATCH HAS BEEN FORCIBLY MADE

543
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,734
You two are a good match.

544
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,194
But we'll make the order fair.

545
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,738
-I'm laughing because I'm so dumbfounded.
-Hyung.

546
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,532
Sorry to do this when we just met.

547
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,784
-But I…
-You two are a team. You can do it.

548
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,911
-You guys are very strong.
-I want Dex.

549
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,454
-I want to go with Dex.
-No, DinDin.

550
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,664
-No. Dex…
-A perfect pair.

551
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,666
Dex is with me. I want him too.

552
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,128
You and Kkwachu Hyung go out there first.
I don't expect much.

553
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,880
-Bring anything, even if it's small.
-Wait a minute.

554
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,465
I get why we're a team.

555
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,093
-But why do we go first?
-We'll all take turns.

556
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,804
But we don't need to rush.
We have nothing to do.

557
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,389
Let's take it slowly, one by one.

558
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,099
-I agree.
-Slowly, one by one.

559
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,100
Let me say this.

560
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm going to be honest.

561
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,978
-We have to survive.
-Okay.

562
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,814
I tore my anterior cruciate ligament.

563
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,983
It's only been two months
since my surgery.

564
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,318
As you know,
if you tear it, you can't run.

565
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,028
Then let's do this.

566
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,198
Na-rae and Hee-kwan.
He was a baseball player, so he's strong.

567
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,659
-No, Dex is stronger.
-No.

568
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,619
You and Na-rae go out there together.

569
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,413
You can carry her, Hee-kwan.

570
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,999
-Then as for Na-rae…
-They're not on the same side.

571
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,584
How about Hong-chul? He's strong.

572
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,294
No, I don't think so.

573
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,879
No, the idea is good.

574
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,756
The injured person should be
with someone strong. Let's see.

575
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,425
-Jonathan.
-Jonathan looks strong.

576
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,594
But he's far away.
He might not understand her.

577
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,846
-So it's either Dex or…
-What? He's right there.

578
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,558
Hey.

579
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,312
JONATHAN IS LOOKING FOR JONATHAN

580
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,023
You should be with Hee-kwan.

581
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,316
Or Dex.

582
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,943
Dex, who do you want to go with?

583
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,404
-I'll be honest.
-Let's hear what he thinks.

584
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,198
-We're not going out there to die.
-Right.

585
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,283
I want to go with someone
with the highest probability to succeed.

586
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,619
Based on physique,
either Hee-kwan or Hong-chul.

587
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,370
-I see.
-I want to go with him too.

588
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,414
-Great.
-Take note. He's a total snake.

589
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,999
He is. He'll run off first.

590
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,126
I believe Dex has picked me.

591
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,336
I pick Dex too.

592
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,589
-Great.
-We can do it. The 55th Infantry Division.

593
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,216
-The 55th Infantry Division.
-Really?

594
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,467
I was in the 55th Infantry Division.

595
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,720
-Wait a second. As for Dex…
-We'll go now.

596
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,555
-He was a UDT soldier.
-I was in the 55th Infantry Division.

597
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,890
He should go with Tsuki.

598
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,226
No, it's better if
the strong people go together.

599
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,228
-You're not saving someone.
-If they see eye to eye,

600
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,854
-that's better.
-Let them go together.

601
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,272
-You two go.
-They picked each other.

602
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,232
Just go.

603
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,691
-We can do it.
-I'll go with DinDin.

604
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,692
-Just go.
-We can do it.

605
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,777
I'll go with DinDin.

606
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,779
-You won't abandon me, will you?
-Never.

607
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,156
-He's a snake.
-I'll stay with you all the way.

608
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,199
-All right, Dex.
-Yes.

609
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,617
Lower your body.

610
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,410
-They're really slow.
-From here…

611
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,081
By the way, Na-rae,
let me tell you something.

612
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,083
The men only look out for themselves.

613
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,710
Because the probability of success
is higher that way.

614
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,462
We have to put survival above all else.

615
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,426
Wait. Six people are left then, right?

616
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,844
Who wants to go with me?

617
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,513
Jonathan.

618
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,061
I was planning to go with Patricia.

619
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,655
Then since Na-rae is experienced…

620
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,573
You know a lot about zombies, right?

621
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,242
-Absolutely.
-You do, right?

622
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,077
Then I'll go with Na-rae.

623
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,329
Si-young, write it down for me.

624
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,832
Then, Tsuki and Patricia
will go together at the end.

625
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,418
-DinDin and Kkwachu Hyung.
-Okay.

626
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,961
-Dex and Ro Hong-chul.
-Okay.

627
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,671
-Who is with Tsuki?
-Patricia.

628
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,006
-Patricia.
-The two of them?

629
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,924
I'm sorry to go against what you said.

630
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,134
But I'm a bit worried.

631
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,802
-Right.
-I'm worried about women going alone.

632
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,429
Patricia and Hee-kwan then.

633
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,555
Let's just change that.

634
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,472
Patricia and who?

635
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,932
-Patricia and Hee-kwan.
-What?

636
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,475
Why don't you go, Hong-chul?

637
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,602
-My team has been decided.
-What?

638
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,354
-Wait, then…
-Because I'm so worried.

639
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,106
Then Tsuki and Kkwachu should go.

640
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,817
-Kkwachu… I mean, Kkwachu Hyung.
-Kkwachu Hyung.

641
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,652
-"Kkwachu" could be anyone.
-"Kkwachu."

642
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,447
If you say "Kkwachu,"
it could mean any man here.

643
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,990
It could be anyone.

644
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,992
-It's a bit…
-Give me a second.

645
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,953
She only focuses on acting,
so she doesn't know what this means.

646
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,415
I think Kkwachu Hyung and DinDin
should go together.

647
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,541
Patricia and Hee-kwan.

648
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,043
-Patricia and Hee-kwan?
-Really?

649
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,045
-Who am I going with?
-Si-young and Tsuki.

650
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,589
Because Si-young kept looking after Tsuki.

651
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:16,092
-She kept looking after Tsuki like a mom.
-And Tsuki listens to her.

652
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,262
I'll go with Tsuki, then.

653
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,180
Okay.

654
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,556
Hee-kwan and Patricia.

655
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,183
Na-rae and Jonathan.

656
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,851
Si-young and Tsuki.

657
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,105
-Tsuki, not Chaki.
-Oh, Tsuki.

658
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,982
It's because things are so hectic.

659
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,776
-It sounds like "car key."
-Chucky?

660
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,277
She wants to find the car key.

661
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,029
-She wants to flee quickly.
-Car key.

662
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,405
"Tsuki."

663
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,907
-Not "Cha."
-It's Tsuki.

664
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,200
-"Tsu."
-I'm sorry.

665
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,119
It's good. They're getting closer
due to the misunderstanding.

666
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,913
-Tsuki?
-Yes, Tsuki.

667
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,665
-We're all set then, right?
-Yes, all set.

668
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,626
But which one is the farthest?

669
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,462
You should tell us
which location is the hardest.

670
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,172
-The farthest one.
-The hardest?

671
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,341
Water. And then…

672
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,967
Water, ramyeon, and canned food.

673
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,137
-Well, then…
-We should get the heavier items first.

674
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,722
-Water.
-First, water.

675
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,809
-Then DinDin and Kkwachu Hyung.
-Yes.

676
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,436
-Actually, we're pretty worthless.
-I agree.

677
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,646
You two are strong.

678
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,231
-No, but…
-She's a boxer,

679
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,565
and he's a baseball player.

680
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,652
In my view,
Patricia and Hee-kwan's team is strong.

681
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,986
No, DinDin and…

682
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,988
-No, since you're men…
-Seriously?

683
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,574
Don't do that. DinDin and Kkwachu
should bring the water.

684
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,784
-Kkwachu Hyung.
-I meant…

685
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,785
"Kkwachu"?

686
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,954
"Kkwachu" can mean any man!

687
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,872
"Kkwachu" is this right here.

688
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,082
-Jeez.
-Kkwachu.

689
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,166
Come on.

690
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,668
You have to say "Hyung" too.

691
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,504
I just found out that was his name.
I'm sorry.

692
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,547
KKWACHU IS A COMMON NOUN

693
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,257
KKWACHU HYUNG (HONG SUNG-WOO)
IS A PROPER NOUN

694
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,300
What we need to decide now

695
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,302
is what we'll do after this.

696
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,512
Will we hold out here?

697
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,097
-Or escape?
-We need to escape.

698
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,557
That determines our next step.

699
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,727
We must bring things here first
and then escape from here.

700
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,520
Then we need bags.

701
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,439
How will we carry these four items?

702
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,940
-We need bags.
-He's smart.

703
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,941
We need to get bags.

704
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,860
-Let's bring back bags.
-Are there bags?

705
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:07,287
THEY COULD FACE THIS DISASTROUS FATE
IF THEY GO OUT THERE WITHOUT BAGS

706
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,205
We need bags.

707
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,874
-They should be in the camping section.
-Yes.

708
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,542
-Right.
-Yes.

709
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,669
Go left and straight to the end.

710
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,837
Toward the alcohol section.

711
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,589
You mean we follow the wall
all the way out there?

712
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,506
Yes.

713
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,216
-The camping section is here then.
-Then,

714
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,594
-Dex and Hong-chul, you go get backpacks.
-Backpacks.

715
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,845
-Right now.
-Go first.

716
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,305
-Go first?
-Wait.

717
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,973
We need backpacks the most, right?

718
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,224
You picked the strongest.

719
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,809
Don't laugh and just go.

720
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,352
-We go first?
-Backpacks.

721
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,771
The bags are most important.

722
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,023
-Go get them.
-You two are the tallest too. Go.

723
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,776
THEY'RE GOING FIRST
BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT UP THE BAGS

724
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,570
Let's insist that
water's the least important.

725
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,530
Let's put it off for as long as possible.

726
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,865
-They'll hate us.
-Let's go last.

727
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,701
Dex, how should we do this?
Should I follow you?

728
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,036
You should lead, Hong-chul.

729
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,871
-Me?
-Should I lead?

730
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,206
Well, why is that?

731
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,417
-I'll lead.
-Okay.

732
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,003
-We'll keep watch from here.
-Yes, please, Jonathan.

733
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,630
-We'll play the jingle if there's danger.
-Please do.

734
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,465
-He was looking at something else.
-No.

735
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,300
Please focus on the monitors.

736
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,928
-With utmost concentration.
-I'll watch them.

737
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,429
You played the jingle late too.

738
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,306
-That's true. I was late.
-Way too late.

739
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,900
MOUSE PAD: FOUND NEXT TO THE COMPUTER
USAGE UNDETERMINED

740
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,488
We should put this around our arms.

741
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,573
Give me your arm.

742
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,701
The teeth wouldn't be able to puncture it.

743
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,036
We should too.

744
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,788
-We should put it on too.
-He's good.

745
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,039
THIS SOLDIER IS CERTAINLY RELIABLE!

746
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,707
He's so reliable.

747
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,420
THEY CAN ATTACK WITH THEIR ELBOWS NOW

748
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,755
We must get the bags first.

749
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,007
-Bags.
-Once we get the bags,

750
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,134
-we'll return via the same route.
-Understood.

751
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,762
-Here we go.
-Hong-chul.

752
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,847
Come back alive.

753
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,891
-Okay.
-If you can, put things in the bags.

754
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,018
If it's safe, please fill up the bags.

755
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,728
-Okay. Let's go.
-If you don't bring anything,

756
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,021
we won't open the door.

757
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,314
-Got it.
-Come back safely.

758
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,233
-Okay.
-Don't overdo it, okay?

759
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,901
Let's watch the CCTV monitors.

760
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,663
The quest begins.

761
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,458
SECURE SURVIVAL SUPPLIES
SEARCH THE MARKET WHILE AVOIDING ZOMBIES

762
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,378
Lower your body.

763
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,171
SECURE SURVIVAL SUPPLIES:
AS MANY BAGS AS POSSIBLE

764
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,381
We have to close this.

765
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,592
Close it.

766
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,012
-Lock it quickly.
-Did they go?

767
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,597
All good.

768
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,682
Please be safe.

769
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,023
Thank you.

770
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,406
THE STUDENTS GOT BITTEN
ON THE WAY TO THE CAMPING SECTION

771
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,034
Darn it.
The college students are in the way.

772
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,578
-There they are.
-I think they'll turn into zombies.

773
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,122
But that side is all blocked.

774
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,878
If they attack,
I'll block their mouths with this.

775
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,129
Understood.

776
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,102
This way.

777
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,321
It's a zombie.

778
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,282
It's coming this way.

779
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,875
It's coming here.

780
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,543
Okay.

781
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:06,275
HE'S NOW USED TO SILENTLY
TIPTOEING AROUND LIKE A THIEF

782
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,494
It's over here.

783
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,791
Tell me if you see bags.
We need to get bags.

784
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,879
It's coming this way, so we'll go around.

785
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
Run that way!

786
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,206
-Oh, no.
-What?

787
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,416
-What happened?
-Turn it on.

788
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,333
Over here.

789
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,752
Run that way!

790
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,804
HE MAKES A BREAK FOR IT
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING BACK

791
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,514
-They got separated.
-Where is he?

792
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,891
Hong-chul abandoned Dex, didn't he?

793
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,018
He did. I'm sure of it.

794
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,728
-It's going as we expected.
-What?

795
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,743
A new zombie has appeared.

796
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,831
HE CARRIES OUT THE MISSION ALONE
BEFORE MORE ZOMBIES APPEAR

797
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,933
He went to get a shopping cart.

798
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,968
-No!
-What?

799
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,094
He almost got caught.

800
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,198
What do we do? Shouldn't we open the door?

801
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,658
-He's here.
-He's here!

802
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,285
-What about Hong-chul?
-We have to open it.

803
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,162
-Open the door.
-Open the door.

804
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,207
Close the door.

805
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,208
WATER

806
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,376
Where's Hong-chul?

807
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
-What about Hong-chul?
-He disappeared.

808
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,629
-Where's Hong-chul?
-What do we do?

809
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,630
Where is he?

810
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,132
Hee-kwan.

811
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,134
-Lock the door.
-What are you doing?

812
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,177
Wait, Dex.

813
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,386
He's going back.

814
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,470
He is?

815
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,689
DEX CREATED AN OPENING
BY LURING ALL THE ZOMBIES

816
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,196
We need bags the most.

817
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,573
-We must get the bags first.
-Bags.

818
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,215
-Hong-chul's getting the bags.
-He's coming.

819
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,091
Hong-chul is awesome.

820
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,469
-Sorry, I'm too scared.
-Go.

821
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,095
How unexpected.

822
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,264
NO ONE EXPECTED HIM TO BE SO BRAVE

823
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,512
THE ESCAPE ROUTE IS FULL OF ZOMBIES

824
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,943
Play the jingle!

825
00:37:59,026 --> 00:37:59,860
No!

826
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,445
We need to open the door for Hong-chul!

827
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,174
-Where?
-Come this way.

828
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,259
Hong-chul, this way.

829
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,970
Dex rescued him.

830
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,930
No, they're surrounded!

831
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,351
-Where?
-Come this way.

832
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
Hong-chul, this way.

833
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,915
Hey!

834
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,017
-Hong-chul got caught!
-He's caught!

835
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,976
He got caught?

836
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,603
What do we do?

837
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,534
He's not caught.

838
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,827
-He got away.
-Run.

839
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,079
Hong-chul got away.

840
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,963
HE THREW AWAY THE BAG
WHILE PUSHING AWAY THE ZOMBIES!

841
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,810
-The bags.
-Let's go.

842
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,270
-The bags.
-It's okay. Forget them.

843
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,358
-They're coming back. Open the door.
-Okay.

844
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,526
Wow. They're amazing.

845
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,489
Are you okay?

846
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,699
AS MANY BAGS AS POSSIBLE (1 SECURED),
WATER, OTHER (1 BOX)

847
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,368
You were amazing.

848
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,871
IT LOOKS LIKE HE PEED HIS PANTS

849
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,289
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

850
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,624
-You didn't get bitten?
-No.

851
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,917
-What about the bags?
-I'm tearing up.

852
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,293
-Bags?
-One.

853
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,461
-One?
-Yes.

854
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,547
-You brought an empty box.
-Why did you?

855
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,173
-Why did you bring this?
-The bags…

856
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,591
HE DIDN'T WANT TO RETURN EMPTY-HANDED

857
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,053
WOW! DEX SNATCHED A BAG
WHILE SAVING HONG-CHUL

858
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,931
There are at least ten zombies.

859
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,183
Ten? There are that many?

860
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,436
And I learned something new about them.

861
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,812
They respond to movement too.

862
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,481
ZOMBIES INSIDE THE BRIGHT SUPERMARKET
RECOGNIZE MOVEMENTS ACCURATELY

863
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,526
AGGRAVATED ZOMBIES ARE DIFFICULT
TO LURE AWAY BY NOISE

864
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,778
-What?
-Even if you don't make noise?

865
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,737
-Right.
-Really?

866
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,531
Actually, they're not very fast.

867
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,324
But they're everywhere,

868
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,826
so they block your exit routes.

869
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,203
What's surprising is

870
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,290
that even if you run into them,
you can push them away.

871
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,083
They rush over to attack.

872
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,169
-You pushed them.
-Right, I pushed them away.

873
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,462
I thought I was done for.

874
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,796
-Yes.
-But it worked.

875
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,798
And the people who went before us

876
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,510
knocked down detergent as they fell,
so the floor's very slippery.

877
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,513
-That's why you fell earlier.
-Yes.

878
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,557
-It's slippery.
-That's why you fell.

879
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,684
There are broken beer bottles too.

880
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,186
-Really?
-You need to watch out.

881
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,645
The floor is a mess.

882
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,357
Someone daring should go.

883
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,485
-Like a closing pitcher.
-Right.

884
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,944
I was a starting pitcher.

885
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,613
-Starters are daring too.
-That's hard.

886
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,530
Two men should go.

887
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,741
-My partner's a woman.
-But you have good control.

888
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,369
NO ONE MENTIONED THAT HE DID A GOOD JOB

889
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,413
-You're known for your slow pitch.
-Right.

890
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,373
-What's wrong?
-What?

891
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,708
-What's wrong?
-Hong-chul.

892
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,877
-What?
-Did you get bitten?

893
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,379
-No.
-He got scraped. Go over there.

894
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,256
NOTHING'S WRONG,
HE JUST WANTED SOME ATTENTION

895
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,549
I almost threw him out.

896
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,884
Seriously?

897
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,344
You need to be careful.

898
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,179
I went with Dex, but I still got hurt.

899
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,348
-Just keep your distance.
-Be more careful.

900
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,058
Make sure to keep your distance.

901
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,769
-Hey, Jonathan.
-I need more oxygen.

902
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,812
-I'm turning pale.
-What am I going to do?

903
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,356
NA-RAE AND JONATHAN WILL GO NEXT

904
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,899
-Even if you face them…
-Put this on.

905
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,443
Where are the cable ties?

906
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,278
Wait. Earlier,

907
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,030
I saw another cart out there.

908
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,990
I told you earlier. Put Na-rae in here.

909
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,661
And put another cart upside down.
Then it'll be like a fortress inside.

910
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,745
Like a shark tour?

911
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,580
Let's test it.

912
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,499
-You're going to abandon me.
-No.

913
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,626
It'll be fine
as long as they don't swarm you.

914
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,585
-Will that work?
-Try it.

915
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,503
It'll work.

916
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,255
I'll go like this.

917
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,215
-Block them like this.
-Press it.

918
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,967
-Open it up to put items.
-Open.

919
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,301
It's safe. You won't die.

920
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,720
You can be sure that you won't die.

921
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,808
-But I'm claustrophobic.
-You're claustrophobic?

922
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,519
Na-rae, you can see me, right?
You'll be fine.

923
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,354
Even if Jonathan leaves you out there,

924
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,772
-I'll bring you back.
-Really?

925
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,483
And don't cry or scream.
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?

926
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,818
You won't die for sure.

927
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,028
-You won't die for sure.
-You can count on me.

928
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,071
You can count on me.

929
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,823
It's really happening.

930
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,032
Na-rae.

931
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,702
If you see green grape candy, bring it.

932
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,328
-You bastard.
-Seriously?

933
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,872
I said I'm claustrophobic,
and you're asking for candy?

934
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,915
HE DESERVES MORE THAN A SLAP

935
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,959
Only if you can. I need sweets.

936
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,002
-Cut it out.
-Okay.

937
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,253
-Don't make noise.
-Sorry.

938
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,006
-He's a total jerk.
-He really is.

939
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,967
Na-rae, keep your mouth shut
and stay still. Don't make a sound.

940
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,803
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CHEER HER UP,
BUT SHE FEELS UPSET

941
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,141
Oh, no.

942
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,685
-Oh, no.
-Na-rae, listen.

943
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,229
-I'm here. Don't worry.
-Here.

944
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,189
-You wear this.
-What?

945
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,858
Don't worry.

946
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,651
I'm here.

947
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,028
I'm really strong, Na-rae.

948
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,529
Oh, gosh.

949
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,197
And if that works,

950
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,825
-we can all use the same strategy.
-Yes, we can.

951
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,827
-If it doesn't work…
-We're testing it out.

952
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,495
-What if it doesn't work?
-Well…

953
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,164
We have other teams.

954
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,458
How is your leg, Na-rae?

955
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,084
-It's uncomfortable.
-It must be.

956
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,628
-What should we do?
-It's okay.

957
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,754
-It's okay.
-Okay.

958
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,298
Na-rae, we'll go now.
We'll go towards the canned food.

959
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,383
SECURE SURVIVAL SUPPLIES:
RAMYEON AND INSTANT MEALS, CANNED FOOD

960
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,054
-Oh, gosh.
-There's one right in front of us.

961
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,349
How do I get past him?

962
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,267
What do I do with him?

963
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,271
Move his leg gently.

964
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,818
-They're right here.
-There is a problem.

965
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,779
The cart can't go past the dead body.

966
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,615
-Right, the students are lying in front.
-This is not good.

967
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,619
Sorry.

968
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,246
THE DEAD STUDENT IS WAKING UP

969
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,295
-Oh, no!
-The dead body… What is it?

970
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,797
Do they need to move the body?

971
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,509
Let's go.

972
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,302
Let's go.

973
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,388
He's not completely turned,
but be careful.

974
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,931
But be careful.

975
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,974
Be careful.

976
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,184
Hey, be careful.

977
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,727
Hurry. What do we do?

978
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,690
I should keep it closed.

979
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,567
Why are there so many obstacles?

980
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,655
Hey, they're coming.

981
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,458
Not this way.

982
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,877
Oh, no.

983
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,754
-You can't go that way, dummy!
-Zombies.

984
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:23,220
HE COMES TO HIS SENSES TO FIND
THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ZOMBIES

985
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,308
What do we do? Oh, no.

986
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,740
Don't worry. I'm here.

987
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,075
I'm really strong, Na-rae.

988
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,328
Na-rae, I'll come for you.

989
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,256
-Oh, no!
-No!

990
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,424
-Check Na-rae's cart.
-They got her!

991
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,800
He abandoned Na-rae.

992
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,764
No! They got her.

993
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,349
What do we do?

994
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,934
-There are four of them.
-Check her cart.

995
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,478
She'll be okay.

996
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,479
-Na-rae!
-Number one.

997
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,690
He abandoned Na-rae right away.

998
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,580
Na-rae!

999
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,165
THE ZOMBIE GETS HIT
EVERY TIME IT CHASES HIM…

1000
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,291
Na-rae!

1001
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,712
Na-rae!

1002
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,980
Jonathan is unstoppable.

1003
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,572
Let him in.

1004
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,115
Was he bitten?

1005
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,326
Na-rae got caught. Somebody come with me.

1006
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,911
-Hurry…
-Come inside for now.

1007
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,871
-Close the door.
-They caught Na-rae.

1008
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,164
-We know. Close the door.
-No.

1009
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,999
She won't die. Be quiet for a second.

1010
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,042
Na-rae is scared.

1011
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,835
Don't open the door.
There's one right there.

1012
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,420
Lock the door.

1013
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,548
Lock the door.

1014
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,175
You said, "They caught Na-rae"
so shamelessly.

1015
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,511
They're here. Lock the door.

1016
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,069
What do I do?

1017
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,251
Help me.

1018
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,338
-Have a seat.
-But Na-rae…

1019
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,881
-Sit.
-Two people will be enough.

1020
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,633
-Have a seat first.
-Let me go again.

1021
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,558
Na-rae, keep your mouth shut
and stay still. Don't make a sound.

1022
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,894
Let's go and bring her back.

1023
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,730
-What?
-Let's go and bring her back.

1024
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,191
-But right now…
-Don't go out like that. It's dangerous.

1025
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:25,986
Be careful.

1026
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,504
Where is she?

1027
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,806
Can I borrow that can?

1028
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
THEY DISCUSSED THIS PLAN PREVIOUSLY

1029
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,518
I told you that Hee-kwan is daring.

1030
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,652
What? They're all reacting.

1031
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,905
Oh, man.

1032
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,240
Oh, man.

1033
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,382
They did it. They got her.

1034
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,633
-What?
-They're coming.

1035
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,801
Na-rae's over here.

1036
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,226
Thank you.

1037
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,228
Let's go this way. Be careful.

1038
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,441
A little more. Good.

1039
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,819
Is there anything we can bring?
Any canned food?

1040
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,320
We can put them in the cart.

1041
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,322
-Oh, no.
-We can't bring them right now.

1042
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,700
Come on.

1043
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,259
Hong-chul, what about Hee-kwan?

1044
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,385
Hee-kwan…

1045
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,554
Where did Hee-kwan go?

1046
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,354
They caught him.

1047
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,482
Who? Is it Hee-kwan?

1048
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,566
He got bitten.

1049
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,306
-He got bitten!
-Hee-kwan!

1050
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,307
What do we do?

1051
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,227
-He got bitten?
-They got him already.

1052
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,687
-Oh, no.
-Who got bitten?

1053
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,397
They got him already.

1054
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,360
Shit. Hee-kwan is going to die.

1055
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:26,184
So many fresh foods available

1056
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:30,522
It's gushing with excitement

1057
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:34,651
Star Mart

1058
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,196
Yoo Hee-kwan has died.

1059
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:39,466
