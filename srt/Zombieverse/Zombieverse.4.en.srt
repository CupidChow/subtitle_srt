00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,395
Wait, Na-rae!

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,984
Na-rae!

8
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,153
What do we do?

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,912
-Oh, no!
-No!

10
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,456
Kkwachu Hyung!

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,623
Oh, no.

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,375
What do we do?

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,546
-Oh, no!
-Come over to this side.

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,505
Come on, come on.

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,346
Oh, gosh.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,306
Hold on.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,600
-We're in trouble now.
-Why?

18
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,976
They totally caught us.

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,020
I wonder if we're okay.

20
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,314
STAR MART CUSTOMER REST AREA

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,899
Oh! Hey, they're bleeding!

22
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,035
What? Wait, I-I think they got bitten.

23
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,538
-We were both bitten one time.
-Are you okay?

24
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,833
-We got bitten. Don't come near us.
-Oh, no.

25
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,001
We each got bitten once.

26
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,131
-Have a seat first.
-Kkwachu Hyung got bitten

27
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,092
-trying to save my life.
-Hey. Have a seat first. Let's sit.

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,761
-Sit. Wait. But…
-Oh, no.

29
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,638
Hey, wait.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,765
-Don't sit…
-Wait.

31
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,143
Wait, stay standing.

32
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,144
Yeah.

33
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,440
We got bitten only once.
Please believe us.

34
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,858
It doesn't look like a deep bite.

35
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,367

ESCAPED DEATH

39
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,919
BUT THE BITTEN AREA
WILL BECOME INFECTED

40
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,756
AND THE VIRUS WILL SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THEIR BODIES

41
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,723
Kkwachu Hyung's infection
has been confirmed.

42
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,861
Park Na-rae's infection
has been confirmed.

43
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,950
NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME
THEY HAVE LEFT TO LIVE

44
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,290
-I didn't even realize.
-Do you trust us?

45
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,377
-We got bitten once, really.
-Then go like this with your hands.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,462
Come on.
Please do it just for our sake.

47
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,631
-Put it on.
-Yeah, like this.

48
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,802
Na-rae.

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,637
But what happened?

50
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,306
-To tell you the truth…
-You did. I get it.

51
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,600
We ran and then… I'm sorry.

52
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,101
The carts collapsed,

53
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,311
so all the zombies
that we're trapped there

54
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,353
rushed to the forklift.

55
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,438
I was blocking the barricade

56
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,814
when it collapsed. We had to run.

57
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,150
-But he's the worst. Seriously.
-No, come on…

58
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,735
-You need to tie your hands too.
-You said…

59
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,361
Please, don't get me wrong.

60
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,863
I laugh when I get scared.

61
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,239
Do you know what he did?

62
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,451
When I was trying to make a run for it,
he pushed me like this

63
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,120
and shouted out my name,
so of course all the zombies rushed to me.

64
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,039
Hey, Na-rae, Na-rae…

65
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,166
Then you could have at least kept quiet!

66
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,293
Na-rae, I think you're getting
too worked up because you got bitten.

67
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,462
What are you talking about? You pushed me.

68
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,130
-Wow, what a jerk.
-No, I…

69
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,592
NOW EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED,
NOT JUST A FEW

70
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,761
It's not like that.
Just hear me out, okay?

71
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,512
Na-rae and I were operating the forklift

72
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,432
but she needed to lower the forks first
before putting them under the car,

73
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,351
but she left them raised
so they kept hitting the car.

74
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,519
Like, we couldn't get them under the car.

75
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,396
So I kept saying, "Na-rae, Na-rae, lower."

76
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,234
We lifted the forks,
but you know how it is?

77
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,694
It has to be centered for it to work,
but I guess she felt rushed.

78
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,905
The car was slanted like this.

79
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,365
-I saw that.
-So there was no way

80
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,368
of stopping it from flipping over.
So we had to pull it out and try again.

81
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,078
But this time,
it lifted like this instead.

82
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,705
So as I was getting
really flustered, the zombies came.

83
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,623
-So what?
-So what?

84
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,251
-What does that have to do with this?
-So… what happened?

85
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,377
-So, so…
-So that's why you abandoned me…

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,045
-I put down the car, and then…
-…to get bitten?

87
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,922
Then you should've gotten off together.

88
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,507
Honestly, I saw what happened.

89
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,802
It's true Hong-chul didn't push her
as he got off the forklift.

90
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,429
His hand slipped as he got off.
Just like this.

91
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,765
-Seriously?
-You did what?

92
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,725
No, it wasn't like that. She…

93
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,104
-You threw me at them.
-She went, "Ah!"

94
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,273
And I got confused if her leg just hurt
or if she got bitten.

95
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,357
SHE CAN'T HOLD BACK HER LAUGHTER

96
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,068
At the time,
I couldn't help but think she got bit.

97
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,070
She kept shouting in pain like this.

98
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,197
What are you talking about?
I hadn't been bitten then!

99
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,616
Wait, the tie came undone. Oh.

100
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,826
Okay.

101
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,077
Man, my head hurts so much.

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,621
We should decide what we will do first.
What are we gonna do?

103
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,872
I think the forklift will work now.

104
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,334
So the forklift works,
but they broke though the cart barricade.

105
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,503
Can we ask for the rice puff pop again?

106
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,589
-But Mr. Rice Puff…
-Did he… did he pass away?

107
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,634
POPS EVERY 15 MINUTES!

108
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,803
Wait, do you know
how to operate the rice puff machine?

109
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,972
Shush. Be quiet. Shut up.

110
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,057
Why don't I blow up
your head instead, huh?

111
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,978
Wait, wait, I have something to say.
Mr. Rice Puff got bitten already.

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,605
And the zombies
don't attack him, you know?

113
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:19,902
THE ZOMBIES WHO GATHERED AT THE SOUND
DIDN'T ATTACK HIM

114
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,696
-Maybe they think he's one of them.
-Oh.

115
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,906
Then maybe they wouldn't attack these two.

116
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,492
She's right.
It might work, so let's--

117
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,870
Okay, then let's be realistic.

118
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,497
Even if the zombies bite them…

119
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,166
…they've been bitten already.

120
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,959
Wow.

121
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,421
-She's… she's worse than me.
-If they don't bite them…

122
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,340
My goodness. Seriously.

123
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,550
She was asking
if they were okay earlier.

124
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,634
I yielded earlier.

125
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,137
Then okay, let's do this.
We don't wanna force them.

126
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,474
Raise your hand if you think
these two should go drive the forklift.

127
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,309
What are you talking about?

128
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,144
Because it might sound
like we're forcing you

129
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,353
since Si-young is the only one
who mentioned it.

130
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,396
Yeah, it's okay, raise your hand.

131
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,647
-Did you raise your hand?
-You two are…

132
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,232
No, I'm scratching.

133
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,233
-You did, didn't you?
-Just scratching.

134
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,651
Let's just say Hong-chul did…

135
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,070
The two who got bitten already,

136
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,072
so the zombies
might recognize them and not bite.

137
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,782
Or if they do bite,
they're already infected.

138
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,034
And Na-rae can drive the forklift well.

139
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,035
Raise your hand if you think…

140
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,536
-She is. She's good.
-…they should drive the forklift.

141
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,246
Let's decide by a majority vote.

142
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,543
EVERYONE EXCEPT THE TWO
WHO GOT BITTEN RAISED THEIR HANDS

143
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,836
-I can do it.
-Put your hands down.

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,004
-It's already decided.
-Put them down.

145
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,132
-You're awful.
-It's because my head hurts.

146
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,135
Then, if you move the car
with the forklift,

147
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,804
we'll take you with us at least.

148
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,430
THERE ARE CONDITIONS
FOR THEIR SURVIVAL NOW

149
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,433
Honestly, if the zombies don't go
after them when they drive the forklift,

150
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,351
it might be better for us.

151
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,186
-They can go in front of us.
-I see.

152
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,564
What are you saying?
You're going to use us as human shields?

153
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,483
SHE DOESN'T HESITATE TO DISCRIMINATE

154
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,068
Man, she really is the worst.

155
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,820
It's even worse
because she said it so nicely.

156
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,821
She's telling us to face…

157
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,738
-I think that's a good idea.
-…the zombies head-on.

158
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,990
-Come with us. Come on.
-I'll get the car.

159
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,701
-Let's escape this place together.
-You promise?

160
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,954
I don't trust you.
Dex, you tell us.

161
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,998
-Hyung, come with us.
-Okay, we'll go.

162
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,875
-That settles it.
-Hey, Dex. No going back on your word.

163
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
-But I'll be sure to keep a look out.
-We'll make sure to have

164
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,545
some safety measures though.

165
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,380
Okay.
We're okay with that. Okay.

166
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,674
Unni, I'm so sorry.

167
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,801
-Just drive the forklift for us.
-We should've tried harder.

168
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,177
-Please.
-Gosh, Hong-chul.

169
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,972
Seriously.

170
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,225
That car needs to be moved
for us to get out.

171
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,605
-Oppa, what if they bite us?
-Here we go. Let's go. Hurry.

172
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,065
Darn it. Wait.

173
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,110
To be honest, Kkwachu Hyung,
you know, talked too much.

174
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,486
He ordered us around like he's the leader.

175
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,946
Yeah, he had too much to say.

176
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,575
IF YOU LEAVE,
THEY TALK ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK!

177
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,993
A NEW LESSON LEARNED!

178
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,703
They went. Let's look. Come on.

179
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,204
They went? They did?

180
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,790
Stand behind me.

181
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,959
Damn it. What do we do?

182
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,919
Oppa, they're coming!

183
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,219
Oppa, they're coming!

184
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,556
No, goodbye. This way's the exit.

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,350
Oh, no. What do we do?

186
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,437
Darn it. What do we do? Oh, no.

187
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,105
They're coming. They're coming.

188
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,402
My goodness, what do we do?

189
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,197
Oppa, they're gonna bite us.
They're gonna bite! They're gonna bite!

190
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,324
What's going on?

191
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,160
-What?
-Did they bite?

192
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,328
What?

193
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,042
No! No! No!

194
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,344
No, wait. They're not attacking.

195
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,846
-Maybe they smell different.
-They aren't attacking.

196
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,265
Maybe you smell like them
after you get bitten.

197
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,226
THE INFECTED HUMANS' BLOOD
SMELLS LIKE ZOMBIES'

198
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,560
Hey, they're scattering.

199
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,771
-My goodness.
-Good. That's good.

200
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,773
-They must be so scared.
-I don't think they can see them.

201
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,941
-They must think they're one of them.
-They're not biting.

202
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,109
SI-YOUNG'S HYPOTHESIS
HAS BEEN VERIFIED!

203
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,153
Na-rae, try driving the forklift now.

204
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,281
Go slowly. Slowly.
Walk like a zombie. Let's go slowly.

205
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,867
Forget it.
Why do we have to act like zombies?

206
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,785
-Just go.
-It's just, I thought

207
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,412
-it'd make it more fun.
-This is great. There's hope.

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,581
Where'd the grape candy go?

209
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,170
Right,
I think we need to back it up.

210
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,842
Here. Yes. Yeah, like that.

211
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,763
THE ZOMBIES ARE DRAWN
TO THE NOISE OF THE FORKLIFT

212
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,974
-Move it. Let's go.
-Let's go.

213
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,103
Get in.

214
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,942
I hit my head.

215
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,906
Oh, crap.
They're coming to us again.

216
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,658
-No, we're fine.
-We're fine though.

217
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,743
They won't come to us. Lift it.

218
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,704
THEY LOST INTEREST
AFTER CONFIRMING THEY'RE INFECTED

219
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,749
Oppa, you're so good at driving this.

220
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
A HALF-ZOMBIE
DRIVES BETTER THAN A HUMAN

221
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,544
-This isn't easy.
-Hey,

222
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,045
-your friends are rooting for you.
-This way.

223
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,213
Take it easy. Take it easy.

224
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,382
Everyone is rooting for you.
All of your friends.

225
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,009
Is he kidding me?

226
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,392
They lifted it. Yes.

227
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,685
Oh, hey. They got it. They got it.

228
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,729
He's the best driver
out of all the zombies.

229
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,188
-Being a zombie suits him.
-Oh.

230
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,067
Wow. He's so great.

231
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,319
Wow. He's so great.

232
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:15,948
He's doing great.

233
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,617
-Oh, wow. Wow!
-More than good enough.

234
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,160
THE ESCAPE PATH IS SECURED

235
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,995
-We got it. Yes!
-Nice. Nice.

236
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,330
-Nice?
-Nice.

237
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,790
Do we really wanna go with them that much
to do all this?

238
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,083
Great work.

239
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,169
They did a good job.

240
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,380
But I mean,
there are some benefits to being infected.

241
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,882
Yeah. We don't know when they'll turn,

242
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,592
but if they can maintain
their current state…

243
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,719
I think it'll be okay for them
to stay with us.

244
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,472
We've secured the path now.

245
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,807
Okay. Go over there.
Let's keep separated for now.

246
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
It makes us feel like crap
when you applaud like that.

247
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,020
-Seriously. You're the worst.
-No, no.

248
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,357
Oppa, the balance was off
because you were driving it wrong.

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,193
But the two of you aren't scared
of zombies anymore, right?

250
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,570
They seemed to be debating
if they wanted to bite us or not.

251
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,113
I don't think we're fully zombies yet.

252
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,323
We must not be.

253
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,325
After smelling us,
I thought they would bite us,

254
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,160
-but then they just went away.
-Yeah.

255
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,244
I'm a bit nervous though.

256
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,955
"SAFETY MEASURES" COME TO MIND
AS THINGS ARE SOMEWHAT SETTLED

257
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,624
-It's not that I don't trust you…
-There's a surefire way.

258
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,541
…but I'm just worried
it might be hard on you.

259
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,295
-We can cut off their arms.
-What?

260
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,630
-What?
-Oh.

261
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,173
-That's crazy!
-You wanna cut…

262
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,676
If you don't want that,
let us tie your arms for now.

263
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,136
MY GOODNESS! HE SCARES THEM
TO GET THEM TO COOPERATE

264
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,888
I'll be gentle.

265
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,098
We have no idea when you'll turn.

266
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,432
You'll feel tormented.

267
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,642
Damn it. Seriously?

268
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,893
-It doesn't hurt?
-No.

269
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,269
HE'S STILL SWEET IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS

270
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,605
If I turn,
I know the one person I wanna bite.

271
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,564
Me too. Me too, me too.

272
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,983
-Let's do it together.
-Wait, let's settle who gets dibs.

273
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,193
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-I'll bite the left side,

274
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,277
-you take the right, okay?
-Okay, okay.

275
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,364
Oh! There's a rope.

276
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,244
We can tie Na-rae and Hyung with it.

277
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,203
Oh, right.

278
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,746
SO MANY PEOPLE
THE HALF-ZOMBIES COULD BITE

279
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,164
Okay.

280
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,625
Open your mouth.

281
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,460
You said you wouldn't gag us.

282
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,920
I just have to make sure
you can still breathe, right?

283
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:53,963
SCARY WORDS IN A SWEET TONE

284
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,131
I can't believe this.

285
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,757
-You never know.
-I feel terrible.

286
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,926
I can still talk.

287
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,761
We'll untie you in a bit, hyung.

288
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,014
They cleared up the path,
so let's carefully go that way.

289
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,824
-Get in now. Hurry.
-Get in.

290
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,075
You have to help us on.

291
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
Get in. Oh, no. I got it.

292
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,873
Oh, my goodness.

293
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,291
Be careful.

294
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,959
-I'm gonna fold this.
-We're all set.

295
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,005
Everyone is on board.

296
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,549
We're all good. Okay, okay.

297
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,469
We're screwed. Damn it.

298
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,971
-What's wrong?
-I need to drive in reverse

299
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,890
-looking at this.
-You're right.

300
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,475
But they covered the back.

301
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,311
-I think they can see us.
-I think they can see us, yeah.

302
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,271
They won't be able to see us
if we cover this up.

303
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,315
THEY COVERED THE WINDOWS
WITH NEWSPAPER

304
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,942
We can't see in front of us either.

305
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,695
What do we do? We can't see at all.

306
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,447
Maybe we need to open the back door.

307
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,324
Like, they need to open the back.

308
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,783
Let's start the car first.

309
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,912
Okay. Got it.

310
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,881
Let's go! We can do it.

311
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,716
There's a rear-view camera, yes!

312
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,968
HE SHIFTED INTO REVERSE
AND THE REARVIEW CAMERA TURNED ON!

313
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,303
Nice, nice, nice!

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,476
THEY CAN ONLY SEE VIA THE MONITOR
AND MUST DRIVE BACKWARD

315
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,102
-We can do it.
-He should be able to see.

316
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,604
We just have to get out of here.

317
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,523
We're escaping this place.

318
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,399
The quest begins.

319
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,151
ESCAPE THE PARKING LOT
DRIVING WITH COVERED WINDOWS

320
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,945
Hold on tight! Hold on tight!

321
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,238
Hold on tight, please!

322
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,786
-Gosh, hey, hey!
-Be careful.

323
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,037
That's too loud.
We're too loud, too loud!

324
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
-Oh.
-Darn it.

325
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
We're too loud, too loud!

326
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,041
Be careful.

327
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,629
Nice, nice, nice.

328
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,846
We can only go between these two.

329
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,360
Huh? What's that sound?

330
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,278
-Did we run over someone?
-It's the cars.

331
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,946
We're scraping against the cars.

332
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,831
-Oh, gosh. Be careful. Gosh.
-Be careful.

333
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,875
Darn it.

334
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,169
-Oh, damn. Oh, man.
-Huh?

335
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,213
-Hey, hey, the side mirrors. Close them.
-Watch your hand. Put it inside.

336
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,215
Your hand. Put it inside.

337
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,383
HIS HAND COULD'VE BEEN CUT OFF

338
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,718
I think it's best
we don't hold onto the side.

339
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,802
Right, hold on to the rope.

340
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
SUCH DRIVING SKILLS
WILL RAISE HIS INSURANCE PREMIUM

341
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,763
Damn it, we just need
to keep pushing through this way.

342
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,890
-One second.
-Hmm.

343
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,100
Hey, we're stuck.

344
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,519
No,
you have to force your way out.

345
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,521
THE OWNER OF THE TRUCK
WOULD BE DEVASTATED TO SEE THIS

346
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,441
Are we stuck?

347
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,068
-Shoot! It's totally stuck.
-We're almost out.

348
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,403
-We're almost there.
-We're nearly there.

349
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,654
Huh? Why is he going the other way?

350
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,157
He should have kept going.
Pull out, pull out!

351
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,993
Oppa, hold this, hold this.

352
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,245
Hey, hey, hey! Let's switch drivers.

353
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,371
Switch drivers?

354
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,206
This reminds me
of my traumatic experience.

355
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,417
Kkwachu Hyung is a good driver.
Actually… no.

356
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,919
Can Si-young drive instead?

357
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,087
This isn't working. We'll guide you.

358
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,923
The zombies will get off and spot you.

359
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,841
WELL, IF YOU'RE OFFERING

360
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,469
-We will.
-Be honest. That's what you wanted.

361
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,929
Would that be okay?

362
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,432
DinDin. DinDin, stop the car for a second
so people can get off.

363
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,893
The zombies are gonna get off!
Don't move the car!

364
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,939
Unni, don't call us zombies.
Don't say the zombies are getting off.

365
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,023
You have to tug
on the flaps you've opened.

366
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,400
No, not that. I said
the two zombies are getting off now.

367
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,945
I said don't call us "two zombies"!

368
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,696
-Call us "people"!
-The two are getting off,

369
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,740
-so just hold tight.
-Okay.

370
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,909
Go a bit forward
and you have to go to the right.

371
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,661
He says to pull to the right,
and then go.

372
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,371
Turn right as you go forward.

373
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,872
HE DOESN'T KNOW RIGHT FROM LEFT

374
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,334
This won't work.
Turn right as you go forward.

375
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,211
-Back up, back up.
-Opposite, opposite.

376
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,254
Okay, okay, okay.

377
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,715
DinDin's driving scares me
more than the zombies.

378
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,050
Release the wheel as you back up.

379
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,635
-Keep straight.
-Turn the wheel. Turn the wheel.

380
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,387
Okay, okay, okay. Back up.

381
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,471
He says okay.

382
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,808
Oppa, you're the best zombie valet
parking attendant I know.

383
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,896
Still, things are working out.
We haven't laughed like this in a while.

384
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,897
THEY MANAGE TO LAUGH AMIDST THE CHAOS

385
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,149
-Steer left.
-Steer left.

386
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,734
Kkwachu, Kkwachu, get in.

387
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,277
-He's back.
-Hey, get in.

388
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,947
Wait, don't go.
The zombie isn't inside yet.

389
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,741
You're the best at parking
among the zombies I know.

390
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,703
He's doing so well but
the windows are covered with newspaper.

391
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,579
He's only relying
on the rear-view camera, right?

392
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,165
Still, DinDin,
you should go slowly.

393
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,251
-The rice puffs smell so good.
-He still…

394
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,965
-Are we finally leaving?
-Yes, we're finally leaving.

395
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,175
-Hey, we're finally going.
-We're going?

396
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,474
HE SEES A GROUP OF ZOMBIES
RUSHING OVER TO THE CAR!

397
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,816
We're finally leaving.

398
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,859
-We're escaping.
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

399
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,360
-We're finally leaving.
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

400
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,278
We're escaping.

401
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,156
-No!
-We're going to escape!

402
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,908
No! Push them off!

403
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,160
No! Push them off!

404
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,579
What is it?
What is it? What is it? What is it?

405
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,080
No!

406
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,209
Rice puffs!

407
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,674
The quest is complete.

408
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,676
Everyone escapes.

409
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,561
HE'S LEFT ALONE IN THE PARKING LOT
AFTER MAKING THE FINAL RICE PUFFS

410
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,858
It's okay. Don't be scared.
We're all here together.

411
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,777
Okay, okay. Okay, dear.

412
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,945
-Flee now.
-You have to come with me.

413
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,782
-No, no, no, I can't.
-No, please come with me.

414
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:01,080
THE PROMISE TO ESCAPE TOGETHER
COULD NOT BE KEPT…

415
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,373
There are zombies everywhere.

416
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,918
Are you kidding? You're even riding a car
with two right now.

417
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,504
THEY SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM

418
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,631
We wouldn't have gotten out
if it weren't for me!

419
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,514
I don't wanna become like them.

420
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,374
THERE ARE 7 SURVIVORS AND 2 INFECTED

421
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,001
Central Disaster
and Safety Countermeasures announced

422
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,921
it will seal off Seoul
beginning at midnight.

423
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,090
It's rapidly spreading to nearby areas

424
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,217
such as Eunpyeong-gu and Yongsan-gu.

425
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,719
Many people
have already lost their lives.

426
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,682
Since Seoul has been sealed off,

427
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,018
transit to areas outside the city
is completely restricted.

428
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,938
Cargo and shipping have also been blocked.

429
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,236
-Do you know where we are?
-Wow.

430
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,322
No. I just kept driving
to the countryside for now.

431
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,365
Right.

432
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
It's similar to the countryside in Japan.

433
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,164
-Is it?
-Totally.

434
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,007
Professor, you're claiming
that they are not exactly zombies.

435
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,633
Zombies? That's nonsense.

436
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,429
What you're talking about here,
they're fiction, created in movies.

437
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,181
Professor, please, calm down.

438
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,808
What are
the countermeasures after infection?

439
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,978
There is no cure as of yet, is there?

440
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,689
Unfortunately,
vaccine development takes

441
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,483
an average of ten years worldwide.

442
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,913
THERE IS NOWHERE TO HIDE
IF THEY SUDDENLY TURN INTO ZOMBIES

443
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,291
It's morning now.

444
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,881
FORTUNATELY… THEY DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE TURNED YET

445
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,010
What are you doing, oppa?

446
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,179
Is your leg okay?

447
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,263
It looked like you were pushing

448
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,557
-her leg away.
-Why did you push my leg? Okay?

449
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,934
That's my leg…

450
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,312
You've started to change already.

451
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,483
No, I'm fine.

452
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,236
-I am. Hey, stop that. See? There?
-Show me your teeth.

453
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,905
-My teeth are the same.
-Hey, are you guys not tired?

454
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,449
It's nice to come to a place
with less people.

455
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,119
-We--
-Hey! Come on!

456
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,706
Hyung, are the zombies okay?

457
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,292
Well, no, I think they've changed a bit.
They've become more irritable.

458
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,294
They seem more aggressive too.

459
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,047
-No, we're not.
-Aggressive? It's all because of you!

460
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,549
-Okay?
-You shouldn't be the one talking.

461
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,930
Hey, but look at the doctor too.

462
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,307
It's a little…
It's a bit different from earlier.

463
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,017
They're turning. They're turning.
We should open this for now. Yeah.

464
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,686
-Oh, unbelievable.
-Jeez.

465
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,020
-Because of the sunlight.
-I mean…

466
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,064
You know,
they might not be okay with the sunlight.

467
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,774
-Right.
-We're not vampires.

468
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,150
But still, you never know.

469
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,445
There's nothing around here.
So I think you can open up the cover.

470
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,738
Shall we open it up?

471
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,824
It's daytime now.
Let's get some sunlight.

472
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,535
It's nice and bright.

473
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,829
Ah, it's so nice. Done on this side.

474
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,667
Everything okay?
Are the zombies okay?

475
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,210
-What now?
-The situation isn't good.

476
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,338
This is because I overexerted myself.
That's why the color's changed.

477
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,215
My veins popped up because I got angry.

478
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,801
But eventually, it's a fact
that you'll turn into zombies.

479
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,178
-No, but the thing is…
-It's already been six to seven hours.

480
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,055
So honestly, we did get scratched a bit.

481
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,473
Yes, it's only a scratch.

482
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,100
-I think it was a bite.
-It wasn't a scratch.

483
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,393
-I can see your flesh.
-Come on.

484
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,811
-This…
-There's a wound.

485
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,271
-We didn't get bitten.
-Their nails are long.

486
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,982
-They have long nails.
-You know, as two zombies,

487
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,650
I think you guys talk too much.

488
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,612
My energy's dropping,
so I'm talking to recharge myself.

489
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,489
-Oh, so you're feeling weak?
-You're feeling weak?

490
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,241
-No, because I'm hungry. I'm hungry.
-I'm fading because I'm so hungry.

491
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,243
If your energy's dropping,
you'll reach that state

492
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,037
-between a human and a zombie.
-He's a borderline zombie.

493
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,455
It's because I'm hungry. Aren't you?

494
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,457
And we're still human,
so don't call us zombies.

495
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,083
-Yeah. It's upsetting to hear.
-I'm sensitive.

496
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,376
Are the zombies okay?

497
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,170
Na-rae's face is so pale.

498
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,840
You punk, if you keep calling us zombies,
you'll be the first one I kill.

499
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,801
-I swear.
-Listen to me. We have to be cool-headed.

500
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,058
We can't accept zombies. No exception.

501
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,188
-Yes, he's right.
-In the end…

502
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,857
But what will we do when they do turn?

503
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,987
IF THEY BITE OTHERS,
THERE WILL BE MORE ZOMBIES

504
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,658
-What do we do?
-I mean, look, think about it--

505
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,994
-Na-rae, this is important.
-This is important.

506
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,834
-This is important.
-Don't try to just avoid it.

507
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,004
Then let's go separately.
There are two of us, so if you abandon us,

508
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,090
we'll go our own way
and make it ourselves together.

509
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,300
-No, don't abandon us!
-Once you turn into zombies,

510
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,551
you won't try to go your own way.

511
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,761
You'll try to bite us.

512
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,930
Right, you'll try to eat us.

513
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,723
-We're not gonna bite you.
-So I'm asking what will we do

514
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,684
-when they do turn like that?
-But we… I mean, we--

515
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,269
No, no, we should have them
fight the zombies off.

516
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,981
I mean, the zombies ignored us last time.
So you can use us then.

517
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,112
If you promise you won't abandon us,

518
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,029
-I'll do that.
-Yeah!

519
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,240
-Come on.
-That's why you can't abandon us.

520
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,242
-Right.
-Let's say there are lots of zombies.

521
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,451
-Who will go there?
-If that happens,

522
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,994
you can tell us to go first.

523
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,455
Honestly,
if the zombies don't go after them,

524
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,957
it might be better for us.

525
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,667
-They can go in front of us.
-I see.

526
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,087
What are you saying?
You're going to use us as human shields?

527
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,798
Yes, right.

528
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,973
In any case, let's work as a team.

529
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,641
Jonathan made a run for it.

530
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,226
Hong-chul pushed Na-rae.

531
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,019
I think it's because we don't have

532
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,688
-a leader.
-Yeah.

533
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,607
That's why Kkwachu Hyung
went out there alone and got bitten.

534
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,402
He has a point.
We have no system whatsoever.

535
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,528
-He's right.
-Right. Right.

536
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,322
I think it's best we select a leader now
and do as they say.

537
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,866
We don't know when that'll be though.

538
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,951
Let me say this as an outsider.

539
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:13,952
-I think Lee Si-young.
-Yeah. Si-young.

540
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,579
-Miss Lee here.
-Me too.

541
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,164
It doesn't matter she's a woman.

542
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,248
Yeah, she has what it takes

543
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,499
-to be a leader.
-She's the calmest of us all.

544
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,876
-Yeah, the most cool-headed.
-Yeah.

545
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,043
She's very cool-headed.

546
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,295
Si-young should do it.

547
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,005
She's been taking care
of Tsuki and everyone.

548
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,006
I agree.

549
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,591
Let's decide by a vote.

550
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,509
-Raise your hand if you want Si-young…
-Wait, wait.

551
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,553
-Hold on.
-I really don't feel confident enough

552
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,637
to be the leader.

553
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,682
But I'll do my best
to support the leader as the subleader.

554
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,810
Because I feel too much pressure
with something like that.

555
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,187
But I really want you to be the leader.

556
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,730
What are the qualifications
for the leader?

557
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,940
I get too flustered when I see zombies.

558
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,735
We need someone who can lead us
so we survive.

559
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,528
-Yeah.
-Then I think I can do it.

560
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,696
No, not you.

561
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,991
Yeah, like,
I think Jonathan lacks life experience.

562
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,701
HE HAS PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE IN FLEEING

563
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,328
-What are you gonna do, huh?
-You just made a run for it.

564
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,121
-He might have great judgment skills.
-Right.

565
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't think
Hong-chul should be the leader.

566
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,043
-What is it?
-Hong-chul…

567
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,503
This guy is definitely a future zombie.

568
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,047
No, no. Na-rae knows me well.

569
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,548
-Not him.
-I support gender equality.

570
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,425
-And cosmopolitanism.
-Yeah.

571
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,886
All right, you shouldn't pick who to help
based on the situation

572
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,262
but everyone
should take care of themselves.

573
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,431
-I told you. I told you.
-Anyone but Hong-chul.

574
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,390
-Huh?
-It's better

575
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,308
-to just keep your mouth shut…
-Not Hong-chul.

576
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,893
…and stay silent.

577
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,395
As for me, even though he's young,

578
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,065
I pick Dex since he has experience.

579
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,944
-And regardless, DinDin…
-Yeah, DinDin.

580
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,155
But DinDin too.
He has terrible judgment skills.

581
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,282
-Be quiet!
-Dex. Mr. Dex.

582
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,826
Mr. Dex, aren't you much younger than him?

583
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,411
-Hyung, how old are you?
-How old are you?

584
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,579
-How old are you?
-I'm 28.

585
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,207
-You're 32, aren't you?
-I see.

586
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,500
Then why are you acting like that?

587
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,501
-You call me hyung…
-You're only 28.

588
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,545
That punk kept acting tough and talking

589
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,880
-with a deep voice.
-That punk?

590
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,215
He's still immature, isn't he?

591
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,509
-Someone like him can't be the leader.
-What year were you born?

592
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,677
-Right. Not him.
-In any case,

593
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,594
-Dex has the most combat experience…
-Never, never…

594
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,429
-He's also the most cool-headed.
-…out of all of us.

595
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,889
-He should be the leader.
-Okay.

596
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,017
He comes up with tactics
and Si-young makes the final decision.

597
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,103
-Like, she'll have the most power.
-Yes.

598
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,897
So if Si-young
doesn't approve of something,

599
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,359
-then the leader can't force it, okay?
-Sure.

600
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,444
-Our leader.
-Dex, he's our leader.

601
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,779
-And subleader.
-The subleader.

602
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,406
-Then she's the subleader.
-Okay.

603
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,533
And how about DinDin be the commander?

604
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,410
-That works for me.
-Yeah. That's great.

605
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,287
Because he really did so much back there.

606
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,204
-Right.
-Yes, right.

607
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,539
Isn't a commander just basically

608
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,416
-a human shield?
-No.

609
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,667
-You're our protector.
-You're a genius.

610
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,960
No, no, not at all.

611
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,128
DINDIN IS THE COMMANDER

612
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,005
Okay.

613
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,594
Like, it was so hectic back there,
like a battlefield,

614
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,596
but it's so tranquil here.

615
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,974
-It's so nice.
-You suddenly feel relaxed, right?

616
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,643
-Yes.
-That's when it's most dangerous.

617
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,895
-I'm so tired.
-I wanna go somewhere warm

618
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,314
-and have a meal.
-I think I'd pass out immediately

619
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,898
-if we did.
-But I'm so, so hungry.

620
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,735
-The bag. We really should eat something.
-Right.

621
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,445
-Here! The food.
-Wait, this is all we have.

622
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,739
SI-YOUNG, THE SUBLEADER,
GUARDED THIS BAG WITH HER LIFE!

623
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,782
-We have to divide it up well.
-Seriously?

624
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,784
-These are all delicious.
-Oh, there are chocolate bars.

625
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,453
-Ah, yes.
-Grape candy too.

626
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,371
Oh, you got all the good stuff.

627
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,998
-Good, we have lots of water.
-That's great.

628
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,583
-How many?
-Five bottles.

629
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,502
We'll barely survive
a day or two with these.

630
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,759
Leader, can I eat one?

631
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,969
-One. You may eat just one.
-That was…

632
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,763
-Come on.
-I found it.

633
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,890
-It's fish sauce.
-Oh, fish sauce.

634
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,433
He was about to get angry.

635
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,643
-We've all become too sensitive.
-But…

636
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,104
I'm 40 and asked for a piece of chocolate.

637
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,148
We had such a tough night together.

638
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,107
It's understandable.

639
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,692
-It was such a tough night.
-I want one.

640
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,862
I just meant that, if you eat
a lot of these, you'll get thirsty.

641
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,405
-You're right.
-Yeah, yeah.

642
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,657
Let's just eat one. That's all.

643
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,535
-There's no one around.
-Let me have one too.

644
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,703
It's delicious.

645
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,290
When we get to a town,
will there be a place to rest?

646
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,334
-I wanna wash up.
-Yep.

647
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:53,546
It'll be nice to go into a house,
lock the door, and stay inside.

648
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,298
I want to wash up and eat.

649
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,884
Me too. We haven't eaten.

650
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,892
Gosh,
it really is so quiet here though.

651
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,435
As if nothing happened.

652
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,728
It's peaceful.

653
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,648
The road is blocked ahead.

654
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,816
-It's blocked?
-It's blocked?

655
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,193
-What? What? What? Why?
-Why is the road blocked?

656
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,028
Let's stop the car here, hyung.

657
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,198
Wait. Doesn't this mean
there could be zombies here?

658
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,075
That means someone's here, right?

659
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,077
It looks like
they abandoned the car and fled.

660
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,954
-Wait.
-Hyung, stop, stop, stop, stop.

661
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,833
There must be some here too then,

662
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,376
-judging by that car accident.
-Right.

663
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,628
If there's an accident,
that means someone was here.

664
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,088
Tsuki, what kind of car is it?

665
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,798
Mercedes-Benz.

666
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,300
-Mercedes-Benz? Great.
-And the one next to it?

667
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,386
-Looks like a delivery truck.
-It's a delivery truck.

668
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,513
FOR GROCERIES AND CLOTHES
ROCKET I DELIVERY

669
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,146
THE ROAD IS BLOCKED
A MYSTERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT

670
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,898
-No one is there? Do you see anyone?
-I think there is someone.

671
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,067
-I mean, there's been an accident.
-I can see someone.

672
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,485
-Can you see that, there?
-Someone's head.

673
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,403
You can see someone's head,

674
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,320
-right?
-It's a woman. It's a woman.

675
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,323
IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE IS INSIDE THE MERCEDES-BENZ

676
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,033
Yeah, I can see
someone's head. Their head.

677
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,662
Let's check out the person first
and then the delivery truck.

678
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,165
-Since we're infected, we'll stay here.
-Keep your distance.

679
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,208
Shouldn't the zombies
go check something like this?

680
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,419
You punk,
I told you not to call us zombies.

681
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,254
-Right.
-I'm telling you,

682
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,172
if I become a zombie,

683
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,132
-I'll kill you first. Okay. I'm sorry.
-Please calm down, noona.

684
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,301
He sure is the commander.

685
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,344
-Wait. Hold on. You lead.
-The tape.

686
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,471
Aren't you the commander?

687
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,805
-No, you lead.
-Okay.

688
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,557
HE IMMEDIATELY PASSED ON HIS DUTIES

689
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,101
-There's a woman in the car.
-No one is in the truck.

690
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,812
They could be in there.
Like when we open the door.

691
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,938
No way.

692
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,942
-I think she's dead.
-Seriously?

693
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,032
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS ATTACKED BY ZOMBIES.
ARE THEY HERE TOO?

694
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,991
She got bitten.

695
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,451
She's wearing a Rolex watch.

696
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
Really?

697
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,331
THE DEAD BODY IS COVERED
IN LUXURY GOODS

698
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,832
-It's really expensive.
-Hyung, that's a Rolex.

699
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,460
-Can we just take the watch?
-That's a Chanel bag.

700
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,718
-Hyung, you'll be okay by yourself, right?
-Yeah.

701
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,386
-Oppa.
-Hyung.

702
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,055
-Come here.
-Oppa, where are you going?

703
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,723
-Come here.
-Come here.

704
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,725
-Where are you going? Come here.
-Come here.

705
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,353
-Wait, I forgot for a second there.
-Come here. Come on over here.

706
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,814
-I mean, I thought I was one of you.
-Come here.

707
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,440
-What do you mean?
-I thought I was with you.

708
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,859
-Come on, come here. Where are you going?
-You are. Come here.

709
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,985
-Oppa?
-So, how is it?

710
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,362
Let's take the bag.

711
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,656
-The Chanel bag and the watch.
-Just the Chanel bag for now.

712
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,076
-This…
-Huh? She's moving. She's moving.

713
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,539
That scared me.

714
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,290
What? Hey. She's turning.

715
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,209
-Let's get out of here for now.
-Come on, hurry up.

716
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,585
-Come on, Patricia.
-She's wearing the seat belt.

717
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,921
She's wearing the seat belt,
so she can't get out.

718
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,007
-She can't get out.
-Open this up.

719
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,552
Wait, noona.
Let's take one side at a time.

720
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,929
-Hey, be careful, careful!
-Oh, no! Don't open it. Don't.

721
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,807
THE LEADERS ARE ACTING RECKLESSLY

722
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,437
Okay, hurry. Come on!

723
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,773
-No zombies.
-There's lots of stuff.

724
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,318
Wow. There are
so many things in here.

725
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,611
FULL OF SURVIVAL SUPPLIES

726
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,779
There's water!

727
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:10,785
ALAS… WHAT A MEANINGLESS SACRIFICE

728
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,620
-Oh! There are packages.
-What?

729
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,414
Wow. There are
so many things in here.

730
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,249
Is it okay to just take them?

731
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,751
Is it okay? Give it here. Come on.

732
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,795
For now, let's just get the…

733
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,088
Hey, leader!

734
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,591
Bring them over. Move them.
Move them, move them. Hurry.

735
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,426
THE SHOPPING SPREE STARTED
BEFORE THE LEADER'S ORDERS

736
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,803
-Wait. Hold up for a second.
-What is it?

737
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,805
Hey, hey. Hold on. Stop.

738
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,600
-Let's not take just anything.
-Great. Bring it. Okay.

739
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,726
Don't take them all.

740
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,519
-Hold up for a second.
-This is theft. Theft. That's what it is.

741
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,979
Hold on. No, no. Wait.

742
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,397
Ramyeon! Ramyeon!

743
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,607
LUCKY! THEY CAN SURVIVE
FOR A WHILE WITH THESE

744
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,400
Ah, if we had ramyeon without kimchi…

745
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,443
Here you go.

746
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,903
-Ramyeon!
-Ramyeon!

747
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,321
-Noona, we can't just take them.
-What is it?

748
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,906
-Why?
-They're not ours.

749
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,908
-But consider what has happened.
-In this situation…

750
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,784
In a world like this.

751
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,495
Let's take some clothing first.

752
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,080
THEY COULD BE IN DANGER
IF DISTRACTED BY THE GOODS

753
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,750
Take some clothes so we can change out
of these bloodstained ones.

754
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,627
-Yeah, definitely.
-I'll hop on and hand you

755
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,836
some items that could be useful.

756
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,212
-Okay.
-Great.

757
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,131
-Clothes, clothes, clothes.
-Put them on.

758
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,507
It's animal pajamas.

759
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,553
Hey, this.
Do you think these will be useful?

760
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,139
This could help prevent
getting bitten by zombies.

761
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,684
-They're too tight.
-You have to zip up your butt.

762
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,354
YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR A COLONOSCOPY

763
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,652
Like this. In any case,
we should be dressed properly.

764
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,569
It's cold.

765
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,737
Take the bag. Take the bag.

766
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,405
-Yes, yes, good job.
-Gosh, oppa.

767
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,199
-It's a Chanel bag.
-What's inside?

768
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,116
Only take what we need.

769
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,327
No one needs makeup, right?

770
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,703
-Makeup?
-We might need it.

771
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,829
-You never know.
-Let's take it.

772
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,040
We could remove bloodstains.

773
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,089
-I feel bad for taking the bag.
-Tissue?

774
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,132
-Let's just take the makeup. Yeah.
-The makeup. Just that.

775
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,760
-Yeah, right.
-You're taking… What's that? A Chanel bag?

776
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,638
THE LUXURIOUS HALF-ZOMBIE
IS REPRIMANDED

777
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,682
Taking the bag is a bit much, right?

778
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,599
Yeah, right.

779
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,767
-That would be so shameless.
-Ah, I agree.

780
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,485
We'll return your makeup
right after using it. It'll be fine.

781
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,736
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I feel terrible.

782
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,946
-Oh, gosh. Bye.
-Come on, let's go.

783
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,698
Wait, shoot!
We have no time for this.

784
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,658
Turn around. Look! It's zombies.
Zombies are coming!

785
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,326
-Oh, no!
-Hurry!

786
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,078
Turn around. Look! It's zombies.
Zombies are coming!

787
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,788
-Oh, no!
-Hurry!

788
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,748
-Wait.
-Hey, there! We have to move that first.

789
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,166
EMERGENCY! THEY MUST CLEAR THE ROAD

790
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,251
Should I close this then?

791
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,211
We're exposed.
We're exposed. We're exposed.

792
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,924
Let's push it to the side.

793
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,676
We should push it backward, right?

794
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,302
-Move aside. Move! Move!
-Move?

795
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,221
One, two, three.

796
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,056
Let's first…
Oh. It's moving. It's moving.

797
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,141
Keep going. It's moving. It's moving.

798
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,018
-We can get by it, right?
-Wait, wait, wait.

799
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,395
-This much?
-It's fine. Stop. Stop.

800
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,479
-Stop. Stop, stop.
-Oh? Oh…

801
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,690
-Na-rae, hurry, hurry! Get in!
-There. Get in, hurry!

802
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,400
-Get in?
-Yes, yes. Get in. That one.

803
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,317
Let's go. Come on.

804
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,361
-Get in this one here. Na-rae!
-Hurry!

805
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,072
Oppa, what if they abandon us?

806
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,117
-I know, right? Seriously.
-Damn it. This doesn't feel right.

807
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,410
-Hey!
-Sit down. Sit.

808
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,203
-Let's go! Let's go!
-They're coming!

809
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,333
-What's going on?
-What is this?

810
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,334
They came all the way here?

811
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,336
-It's a manual car.
-It's manual?

812
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,756
Sorry.
We should be riding in that one.

813
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,799
-Can you drive it?
-Follow us. Follow us.

814
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,385
DinDin, step on the gas.
Go! Go!

815
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,221
-Just in case.
-Why, oppa?

816
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,473
You wanna ditch them?

817
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,183
Take us with you!

818
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,977
Oh, come on. Hey!

819
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,196
Hey, I feel much more at ease.

820
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,617
Look at them. Don't drive too far ahead!

821
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,660
See?
He's can't even use the blinkers right.

822
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,953
He's not fine.

823
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,101
It's getting so cold, hyung.

824
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,146
It's so chilly now that the sun has set.

825
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,192
I'm so hungry. I'm starving.

826
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
Huh? We're here?

827
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,363
I see people.

828
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,281
There are people? What?

829
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,705
Oh.

830
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,790
It's a town.

831
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,426
There are people here.

832
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,137
We'll follow you until the very end.

833
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,471
-Yes.
-Jerks.

834
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,598
Huh? What? What? What's going on?

835
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,601
-Someone's guarding the place.
-Who are you? Stop. Stop. Stop.

836
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,482
What if we can't go in?

837
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,526
-No, no, wait. He's coming this way.
-Let's stop. Stop here.

838
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,195
-They're coming this way.
-Oh, no.

839
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,948
Okay, what do we do?
What if we get caught?

840
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,784
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Wait.

841
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,453
-Hello.
-Hey. Hi.

842
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,454
What's going on?

843
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,707
-It's safe here, right?
-Hello. Hi.

844
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,500
-Get out first. Everyone, out.
-Okay, okay.

845
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,710
Where did you come from?

846
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,253
-We came from Seoul.
-Seoul.

847
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,212
-From Seoul?
-We're safe.

848
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,964
Thank you so much!

849
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,967
-No, wait! This way!
-No! Don't come closer.

850
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,434
ON A BRIDGE OUTSIDE OF A TOWN
THE RESIDENTS STOP THEM

851
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,659
Oppa, act a bit…

852
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,786
Act a little dumb, okay?

853
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,205
-Okay, I'll act dumb…
-Don't act like a doctor.

854
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,623
-…like I'm a bit stupid. Yeah.
-I mean,

855
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,749
we look suspicious, right?

856
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,584
-This way.
-Hello,

857
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,670
-we came from Seoul.
-Is that so? Nice to meet you.

858
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,172
-Yes, yes, yes. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

859
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,798
-Were you playing baseball?
-Hey, sir.

860
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,133
-Are you the town chief?
-Yes, I am.

861
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,676
-Hello. Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

862
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,386
But what brings you here?

863
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,181
Well, we… Something horrible happened,

864
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,308
so we came to take shelter
in this safe town.

865
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,644
SOMETHING HORRIBLE?
THIS IS NEWS TO THEM

866
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,646
-Nothing happened here, right?
-No.

867
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,858
But the thing is,
our town doesn't accept outsiders.

868
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,610
This town is uncontaminated!

869
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,737
-It's uncontaminated?
-Wow! That's great.

870
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,489
You know these celebrities, right?

871
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,741
-Hey. Hi.
-Celebrities. They're all celebrities.

872
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,702
NO ID ON THEM…
SO THEY USE THEIR FACES

873
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,871
-Celebrities. She's an actress.
-Yeah.

874
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,665
Huh? I've never seen her.

875
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,041
Celebrities. They're on TV.

876
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,627
I don't know celebrities at all.

877
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,339
-Pa… Park… Park Na-rae.
-Yes, I am.

878
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,548
I'm on I Live Alone.

879
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,717
And he's on Two Days and One Night.

880
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,678
-No, no.
-Yeah, right. That's me, sir.

881
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,930
Oh, right, yes, yes.
It's nice to meet you.

882
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,432
Here's… That one is on
Two Days and One Night.

883
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,394
-He was on Infinite challenge! Challenge!
-Infinite challenge!

884
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,436
-No, but…
-I see.

885
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,231
You're like brothers.

886
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,149
I'm in a group called Billlie.

887
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,526
She's very cute.

888
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,695
-Show us!
-Okay.

889
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,696
From the top.

890
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,114
One, two.

891
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,574
She's so cute, isn't she? She's cute.

892
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,202
INFO: TSUKI, THE MAIN DANCER OF BILLLIE,

893
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,203
She can perform for the people too!

894
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,913
IS BEST KNOWN
FOR HER "GINGAMINGAYO" VIDEO

895
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,998
WHICH HAS
OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS… MORE

896
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,332
The town chief knows it. He does.

897
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
-She's, uh… Beyoncé.
-Can we go in?

898
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,712
Beyoncé! Beyoncé!

899
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,380
-Okay.
-Beyoncé!

900
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,591
She's good.
Patricia, you're so good!

901
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,635
Oh, my goodness.
She's so good. Look at her.

902
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,304
-Good job.
-Good job. Good job.

903
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,346
EVEN JAY-Z WOULD BE IMPRESSED

904
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,681
-All right.
-Good job.

905
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,933
-Let's go in now. Okay, let's go.
-Let's go!

906
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,892
No, wait, wait, wait!

907
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,893
Let's go!

908
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,730
No, wait, wait, wait! Stop, stop, stop!

909
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,441
But no matter how much I think about it,
I don't think we can let you in.

910
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,985
-Why not?
-We can't. You guys are too loud.

911
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,570
Can't you see it's a quiet town?

912
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,406
THEY TRIED, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH
TO OPEN UP THEIR HEARTS

913
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,491
He's our town chief over here.

914
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,160
THEY FORGOT TO PAY RESPECTS
TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE TOWN

915
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,745
-Hello, sir.
-Nice to meet you.

916
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,955
Don't make a fuss.
Why did you have to bring that up?

917
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,498
-No, no, no, don't do that.
-You look so kind.

918
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,791
-Let's all go inside and…
-Yeah.

919
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,959
Let's talk things out.

920
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,170
-We've been through so much.
-No, wait, hold on.

921
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,588
Zombies just showed up now too.

922
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,922
He's right.
They came running after us.

923
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,550
What are you talking about?
Zombies? We didn't see them.

924
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,302
No, no, no. We didn't run into

925
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,595
-any zombies.
-We didn't see any zombies.

926
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,556
…SAYS THE HALF-ZOMBIE

927
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:19,440
Sir, something terrible happened to us,
so we ran all the way over here.

928
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,486
To tell you the truth, we haven't slept
or eaten for the past few days.

929
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,656
We only have a few bottles of water left
and barely enough supplies to survive.

930
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,494
We would appreciate if you could be
generous and help us just a little.

931
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,871
-Please.
-We can't, we're an uncontaminated town.

932
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,166
They're young enough to be your kids.
Tsuki, how old are you? Not even…

933
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,168
-I'm 21.
-That's right.

934
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,128
Couldn't you just let us stay one night?

935
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,054
Okay. Wait a moment.

936
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,430
Then…

937
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,723
Well, then…

938
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,267
Don't move. Stay right here, okay?

939
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,311
-Don't move and stay right here, okay?
-Okay.

940
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,188
-Okay.
-Okay? Let's go.

941
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,398
-Here…
-We won't move an inch.

942
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,565
Don't cross over, okay?

943
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,900
-Okay.
-All right.

944
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,527
Wait here. Yeah.

945
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,362
THEY SUDDENLY LEAVE FOR SOME REASON

946
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,908
Here, cover this part a little.

947
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,785
-I need the makeup pouch.
-Cover them with this.

948
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,702
-But…
-No, here…

949
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,746
ANYBODY WOULD CONSIDER
THEM SUSPICIOUS, SO THEY TIDY UP

950
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,706
-You look awful right now.
-We look awful?

951
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,459
-Your dark circles are terrible.
-It looks like we're scheming.

952
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,585
Don't move an inch. Don't move.

953
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,711
-Okay!
-Blush, blush.

954
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,046
-Take your time.
-This is all there is.

955
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,923
You look so pale. How's it going?

956
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,509
-Her dark circles are bad.
-It's so bad right now.

957
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,594
You can't see it, right?

958
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,679
You can't see it.

959
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,514
-Bloodstains?
-Yeah, the bloodstains.

960
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,600
THAT'S A BIT TOO MUCH LIPSTICK

961
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,727
-I'll make it look natural.
-Yeah, please.

962
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,812
Cover that up there.

963
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,771
That'll make it less noticeable.

964
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,106
How are you doing?

965
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,607
-You know what this is, right?
-What's that?

966
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,484
-Like Heo Sung-tae in Squid Game.
-Right.

967
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,319
If you cover it up,
you won't be able to tell at all.

968
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,237
A tattoo.

969
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,114
SHE PAINTS OVER THE BULGING VEINS TOO

970
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,075
-Look.
-He looks like a beggar.

971
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,452
Don't say that.

972
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,828
-Okay, that's all right.
-He looks human.

973
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,121
-Did we really have to do this?
-Isn't that for a dog?

974
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,498
-Okay?
-That's a dog outfit.

975
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,208
-Does it look okay?
-You look totally fine.

976
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,126
-Yes.
-I look fine?

977
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,419
NOTE: HE'S A UROLOGIST

978
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,753
-Okay.
-Don't touch that. Here.

979
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,297
-Like this.
-He looks okay.

980
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,381
Do his veins look okay?

981
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,967
But it's so cold.
Gosh, it's freezing. I want to go in soon.

982
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,260
Where's the town chief?

983
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,929
We need to go in first.
So let's cooperate as much as we can.

984
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:27,151
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE,
BUT THE TOWN CHIEF HASN'T RETURNED

985
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,446
-I need to eat.
-Where did he go?

986
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,406
-I'm hungry.
-Seeing the ramyeon makes me hungry.

987
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,741
-Gosh, let's just eat it raw.
-Couldn't he have given us

988
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,992
-some hot water?
-Yeah, eat it raw.

989
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,203
-You can eat it like that?
-This sucks.

990
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,038
-Yes, yes.
-In Korea,

991
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,789
-we sprinkle this on.
-Yeah?

992
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,333
-You have to sprinkle the seasoning.
-That's how we do it here.

993
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,292
-Are you serious?
-It's good.

994
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,839
BUT A BAG OF RAMYEON
WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR THEM

995
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,925
TO OVERCOME HUNGER AND THE COLD

996
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,468
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

997
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,844
I need to eat real food.

998
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,474
We're so hungry, sir!

999
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,812
Hey, they're coming.
They're coming back now.

1000
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,692
Here they come.

1001
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,906
No problem. No problem.

1002
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,491
Okay, hyung. Let them in.

1003
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,910
A VERY ANTICLIMACTIC ANSWER
CONSIDERING HOW LONG THEY'VE WAITED

1004
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,704
THEY GOT EXHAUSTED WHILE WAITING

1005
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,373
Let's leave the cars here for now.

1006
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,584
-Let's go, let's go.
-Can we leave our cars parked here?

1007
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,294
Leave them there.
They can't come in.

1008
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,337
Okay.

1009
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,756
Come this way. Follow me.

1010
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,093
Wait…

1011
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,470
They wouldn't, like,
lure us into a trap, would they?

1012
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,059
Here. This is our town hall.

1013
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,769
-Hwangchon-ri?
-Hwangcheon?

1014
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,937
I've never heard of it.

1015
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,980
I thought it was Hwangcheon.

1016
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,439
Hwangchon-ri.

1017
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,900
-Hwangchon-ri.
-We have meetings here too.

1018
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,819
I've traveled a lot
for Two Days and One Night,

1019
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,820
but I've never heard of it.

1020
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,363
Really?
You should travel more.

1021
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,658
-You must be hungry.
-Yeah!

1022
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,410
-I'm so hungry.
-Do we have something to eat?

1023
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,245
Someone had passed away, so…

1024
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,830
That's good.
I mean, that's terrible.

1025
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,498
-Is there food?
-Gosh, we have a lot.

1026
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,624
We have a lot of food.

1027
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,312
-It's kimchi, kimchi.
-Ah, that scared me.

1028
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,646
-I got so startled.
-They're making kimchi.

1029
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,732
Why are you making kimchi at night?

1030
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,859
-Don't go. Don't bother. Don't.
-Wait, hey, wait.

1031
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,819
We're making kimchi.

1032
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,778
Gosh, hey. Hi.

1033
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,405
-No. Sorry to bother you.
-Sorry.

1034
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,615
-Sorry.
-Hi.

1035
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,617
Do you have some warm soup?

1036
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,076
We have spicy beef soup.

1037
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,871
-Spicy beef soup!
-I love spicy beef soup.

1038
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,914
-Very hot soup!
-Did they die of old age?

1039
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,833
The deceased didn't have any family.

1040
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,918
So the town is holding a funeral for them.

1041
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,463
It's a funeral.
Let's not act so happy.

1042
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,089
He's right. Yeah.

1043
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,883
Hurry and tell them to bring out

1044
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,677
some spicy beef soup and food.
We have guests!

1045
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,638
-Okay.
-Come on in.

1046
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,805
-Can we come in?
-Come on in, come on in.

1047
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,806
Is it okay?

1048
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,392
Can we dress like this to a funeral?

1049
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:10,814
AN OLD MAN'S FUNERAL IN HWANGCHON-RI

1050
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,462

1058
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,311
Boiled pork. Goodness.

1059
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,355
-It's been so long.
-Thank you for the food.

1060
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,649
It's been so long since we last ate.

1061
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,068
But I'm so, so hungry.

1062
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,194
-Me, me, me.
-There's so much

1063
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,612
-I wanna eat.
-Beef tripe hot pot.

1064
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,657
-Kimchi stew with lots of pork fat.
-Kimchi stew with pork fat!

1065
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,033
I just want some white rice.

1066
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:03,951
-Me too.
-White rice.

1067
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,873
THE WARM FOOD
THEY'VE BEEN DESPERATELY HOPING FOR

1068
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,169
-Gracious. It looks so delicious.
-Thank you.

1069
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,880
-No, it's okay.
-Someone is mourning over there.

1070
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
-Huh?
-She's crying over there.

1071
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,134
Let's be respectful.

1072
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,929
THEY SHOULD BE RESPECTFUL
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE STARVING

1073
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,558
-Please start eating. Go on.
-Looks so tasty.

1074

1078
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,817

1080
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,071
It's nice and warm. So warm.

1081
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,615
-How is it? Isn't it chewy?
-Oh, yeah.

1082
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,701
What is it? What is it?

1083
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,036
Hey, it's so delicious. It's so good.

1084

It's a hidden gem.

00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,837
It's a hidden gem.

1089
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,256
-It's a hidden gem.
-Here, over here.

1090
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,341
Wow. It's delicious.

1091
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,260
It tastes so good since it's hot.

1092

Mmm.

-They have great funeral food here.
-Is this beef pancake?

1102
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,241
There are many elderly people here.

-I see.
-Yes, we have

1107
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,998

-If they're to stay this good,

1108
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:36,502
then the funerals need to keep coming.
That's not great.

1109
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,629
-That won't do.
-What are you saying, oppa?

1110
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,548
YOU'RE NOT ON A RESTAURANT TOUR!

1111
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,258
It's so tasty.

1112
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,719
It really is. So, so good.

1113
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,139

So sad.

1120
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,078
THEY HEAR THE SOUNDS OF MOURNING
FOR THE DECEASED

1121
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,373
A STRANGE, REMOTE TOWN

1122

-Oh, gosh.
-Oh, gosh.

1125
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,105
My goodness.

1126
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,194
Ah, at this rate,
no one will be left in this town.

1127
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,737
It's okay. Please eat.

1128
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,823
-Is it okay for us to eat?
-Eat.

1129
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,784

Hey, wait.

1131
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,830
THE MOURNER'S TEARS
DRIED UP LIKE MAGIC!

1132
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,540
She stopped… she stopped crying.

1133
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,457
SHE MIGHT START CRYING AGAIN

1134
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,376
She stopped.
Let's eat quickly.

1135
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,461
-Let's eat quickly. Hurry.
-Get them more boiled pork.

1136
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,796
IT'S SAD,
BUT THEY CAN'T BE POLITE RIGHT NOW

1137
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,214
We don't know when we'll eat again.
Eat fast.

1138
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,592
Eat fast.

1139
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,094
You must've been starving.

1140
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,971
You never know when we'll die too.

1141
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,972
Eat up.

1142
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,642

Ma'am,
more boiled pork for them, please.

Aren't the pancakes tasty?

1148
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,651
-Yeah, they are.
-The beef pancakes are delicious.

1149
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,861
No need for the soup.

1150
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,280
Eat up.

1151
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,741
Wow! Wow, it's so delicious.

1154
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,205
My goodness gracious, sir.

1155
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,249
It's the traditional wine of our town.

1156
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,751
-Traditional wine?
-Just half a cup, please.

1157
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,794
-So nice.
-Sure thing.

1158
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,005
What about Kkwachu Hyung?
Did you get any?

1159

00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,976
It's delicious.

1165
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,647
Drink up.

1166
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,193
There you go.

1167
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,903
Hey. It's a killer.

1168
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,446
Have one more. Come on, here you go.

1169
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,739
-Jonathan, you too.
-Okay, okay.

1170
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,492
It's okay. You can't say no
to a drink from someone older.

1171
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,077
It's only proper to drink at funerals.

1172
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,745
-Yeah, Jonathan.
-One more time. Drink up.

1173
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,372
-Come on.
-Drink up. Go on.

1174
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,373
We can't clink though.

1175
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,333
We can't toast,
so let's do it contactless.

1176
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,627
-Like Wi-Fi.
-You have Wi-Fi here?

1177
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,878
-Oh, I see.
-Jonathan,

1178
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,755
stop talking nonsense and drink up.

1179
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,840
THAT JOKE GOT HER GOOD

1180
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,677
At funerals, enjoying the food
is the way to be respectful.

1181
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,054
I mean, the food here is so--

1182
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,556
Oh, no.

1183
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,892
Oh, no.

1184
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,060
Oh, gosh.

1185
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,354
TEARS RECHARGED!
HER WAILING STOPS THEM FROM EATING

1186
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,323
IT'S HARD TO EAT LIKE THIS

1187
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,617
Uh, don't mind her
and just eat up.

1188
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,956
Is it okay for us to eat?

1189
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,833
-I thought he died of old age.
-I know.

1190
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,752
Oh, jeez…

1191
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,045
Oh, gosh.

1192
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,672
THEY TRY TO MOURN WITH HER

1193
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,466
No, don't worry and just eat.

1194
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,476
Uh, given the situation,

1195
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,273
I was thinking maybe one of you
could offer up your condolences.

1196
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,357
I'll do it.

1197
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,526
Our leader and subleader.
She's our subleader.

1198
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,112
-Go too.
-Go together. Go, go.

1199
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,033
-I'll do it.
-Yeah, you go ahead.

1200
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,577
It's best you offer your condolences.

1201
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,537
-I'll go with you.
-Okay. Let's go together.

1202
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,710
-She'd like to offer her condolences.
-Oh, yes. Hello.

1203
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,795
-Yes. Please take off your shoes.
-Okay.

1204
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,590
Offer a flower.
You may burn incense if you wish.

1205
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,091
Bow twice.

1206
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,385
Oh, gosh.

1207
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,309
Oh, gosh.

1208
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,644
Oh, gosh.

1209
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,105
-What was that?
-What's that sound?

1210
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,109
Wait. What's wrong?

1211
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,194
I heard something.

1212
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,653
What? Hear what?

1213
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,365
-I didn't hear anything.
-The sound, the sound…

1214
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,700
What sound?

1215
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,035
What is it?

1216
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,203
My shoe wouldn't come off.

1217
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,537
-Man, that scared me.
-He surprised me.

1218
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,164
He said he heard a sound.

1219
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,833
-The sound came from in there.
-In there?

1220
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,418
-No, it's from here, here. It's here.
-No, no.

1221
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,669
You're mistaken. Yeah.

1222
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,921
Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1223
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,714
I'm so scared, I can't eat any more rice.

1224
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,549
Didn't that sound come from the coffin?

1225
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,675
APPARENTLY SHE CAN STILL EAT SIDE DISHES

1226
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,635
-No, no.
-You're mistaken.

1227
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,559
-You're mistaken, yeah.
-You're mistaken. Go on up.

1228
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,727
Why are you smiling?

1229
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,103
I'm not crying. I mean…

1230
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,146
Sorry?

1231
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,314
It's nothing.

1232
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,736
I'm sorry, but what was
the cause of his death?

1233
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,364
-The town's small, so…
-He died of old age.

1234
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,282
Don't worry about it. Gosh.

1235
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,867
-Go ahead and eat.
-Uh-huh.

1236
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,952
Eat up.

1237
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,962
-Is something odd? Over there?
-Yeah, it's weird.

1238
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,547
-From the coffin?
-Was it from the coffin?

1239
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,131
-It's odd, it's all odd.
-The sound came from the coffin?

1240
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,424
Hurry up.
Let's finish up and go.

1241
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,844
Miss Lee, don't be like that.
Have a drink.

1242
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,429
No, come on. Here. Here, have a drink.

1243
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,889
-It's so good.
-Let's just pour our own drinks.

1244
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,351
If we've all eaten enough,
shall we go now?

1245
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,311
-Aren't we sleeping here tonight?
-Huh?

1246
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,397
We have nowhere to sleep.
Where would we go?

1247
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,773
-Let's stay the night here.
-We have our cars.

1248
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,525
We have the cars out there.

1249
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,069
-What would you do that for?
-Goodness. Don't worry.

1250
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,739
We heated up the floor at the town hall.

1251
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,368
I can't believe this!

1252
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,203
-Heated floors!
-It's boiling hot.

1253
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,663
Sir, is there hot water?

1254
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,957
-Don't burn yourself.
-Yes, they have hot water.

1255
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,000
Can we shower?

1256
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,001
Let's take a shower.

1257
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,544
-I have to shower.
-Let's shower.

1258
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:56,548
THEY NEED TO REST THEIR BODIES
AFTER AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY

1259
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,259
We can't stop now.
There's no choice. We should eat.

1260
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,886
-We should eat.
-Yeah, we should.

1261
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,679
It's delicious. A bit more.

1262
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,806
We have nowhere to go anyway.

1263
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,267
Since it's the first meal in a while,
I do feel full.

1264
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,312
We'll be able to sleep warmly.
I'm so looking forward to it.

1265
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,147
-You're making ramyeon?
-Ramyeon? Ramyeon?

1266
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,189
Drink up.

1267
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,484
-I can't eat anymore all of a sudden.
-Bottoms up.

1268
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,278
What if they put something in the food?

1269
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,905
Heated floors. Really.

1270
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,823
You ate too much
to start being suspicious now.

1271
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,825
…THEY DID EAT A LOT ALREADY

1272
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,244
Everyone, we shouldn't toast
at a funeral home.

1273
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,330
So we'll do a wave and drink one by one.

1274
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,457
SHE HAS GOOD MANNERS
FOR A HALF-ZOMBIE

1275
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,801
This is stronger than it looks.
I'm feeling buzzed.

1276
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,178
Yeah. Doctor, you too.

1277
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,596
Yes, thank you.
It's so good.

1278
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,555
It's okay.

1279
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,516
-Like this.
-Bottoms up. What?

1280
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,185
Not with a half-zombie?

1281
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,227
Have a drink.

1282
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,520
Don't ruin the mood.
Have a drink.

1283
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,689
-Dex, have a drink.
-Man, we've got a problem.

1284
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,901
Drink, drink, drink.
Bottoms up. Don't toast.

1285
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,322
You drank? You had a sip.

1286
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,531
I need to sleep.

1287
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,327
-They didn't drink much.
-Green light.

1288
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,412
DRINKING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH,
THEY'RE GETTING DRUNK FAST

1289
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,872
It looks pretty!

1290
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,165
We're getting hammered tonight, all right?

1291
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,083
-Let's do it.
-Eat some hot food.

1292
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,294
-We're getting hammered tonight.
-I ate four servings of pancakes.

1293
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,130
You really ate a lot.

1294
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,050
-Oppa, are you all right? Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1295
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,095
-You're acting weird.
-The boiled pork is so tasty.

1296
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,805
I've never seen
people eat so much at a funeral.

1297
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,473
This meat is addictive. It's like a drug.

1298
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,599
-I'm addicted.
-Yeah.

1299
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,101
Let's eat until we die!

1300
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,145
You wouldn't notice if one of us dies.
Because we're dead already.

1301
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,777
Oh, jeez. Here we go again.

1302
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,446
THEY RESPOND CALMLY
TO THE MOURNING SOUNDS NOW

1303
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,787
I don't know anymore.
What am I gonna do with my life?

1304
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,998
You don't have long anyway.

1305
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,835
-I'm sorry.
-I want to cry too.

1306
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,545
Here.

1307
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,465
Call me again next time.

1308
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,175
-Go.
-Call me.

1309
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,344
Oppa, stop drinking.

1310
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,430
This one's for me.

1311
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,890
Have you gone crazy?
What's wrong with you?

1312
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,063
Did you drink?

1313
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,649
We're drunk, a little.

1314
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,276
We're all drunk.

1315
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,477
♪ Made a little cookie ♪

1316
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,356
♪ Gave it to my mother, this treat ♪

1317
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,654
♪ Made a little cookie ♪

1318
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,949

♪ Gave it to my mother, this treat ♪

1320
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,247
All right. Let's go.

1321
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,083
HWANGCHON-RI RICE MILL

1322
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,716
All right. Let's go.
Slowly, slowly.

1323
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,926
Here we are.

1324
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,392
Mother, what do you think? Hmm?

1325
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,145
Eat slowly, okay?

1326
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,412
-What the heck is that?
-Mother.

1327
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,123
I'll be right back,
so just sit tight for a bit, okay?

1328
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,959
Sir, what's going on?

1329
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,752
-What's all this? Hey!
-What's going on?

1330
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,172
