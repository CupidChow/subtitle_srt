1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,968
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,976
Hang in there for three hours,
and we'll be safe. We can do it!

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,352
We can do it!

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,937
Time's really crawling by.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,982
Unni, back there…

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,650
Get away from me! Get back!

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,278
Get away from me!

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,738
Wait, isn't that the ride operator?

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,281
It sounds like the guy working down there.

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,075
Once you get on the Ferris wheel,
you can't open the door from the inside.

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,994
Hang tight here for three hours,
then open the door for us.

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,454
THE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS GOING
TO OPEN THE DOORS GOT ATTACKED

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,372
The operator got bitten.

16
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,207
Someone just left.
There! He got bitten!

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,375
Hey! There's a whole bunch
of zombies here.

18
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,752
Oh, no. What do we do?

19
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,420
Who's gonna open the door for us?

20
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,423
If something happens to him,
none of us can get off.

21
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,799
We can't open the door.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,051
Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh!

23
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,262
Oh, no!

24
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,513
Are we stuck in here?

25
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,807
Shouldn't the ones
who got bitten open our doors?

26
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,017
Na-rae and Kkwachu got off.

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,185
Na-rae and Kkwachu just got off the ride.

28
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,186
Na-rae and Kkwachu?

29
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,271
-Huh? What is it?
-Get out of there.

30
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,231
-What is it?
-We're scared too.

31
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,524
NA-RAE AND KKWACHU HYUNG GOT RESCUED

32
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,026
Oh, jeez.

33
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,528
This is so scary!

34
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,405
Oh, no.

35
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,574
Get in. Get in.
Let's close the door.

36
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,666
The operator opened
Na-rae and Kkwachu's door…

37
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,251
-Yeah.
-…and then died!

38
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,377
I know. He's dead.

39
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,922
THE EMPLOYEE KEPT HIS PROMISE…
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED

40
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,801
Thank goodness. There's still hope.

41
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,678
Good. Good. That's good.

42
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,055
Hey, if we were a little late,

43
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,723
-they could have gotten us too.
-Wait.

44
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,351
But he should have
kept his door locked better.

45
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,394
SUCH A SHAME
ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE'S SACRIFICE

46
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,022
4:36 A.M.
THE FERRIS WHEEL EMPLOYEE DIES

47
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,483
2 HOURS AND 24 MINUTES
UNTIL THE RESCUE BOAT DEPARTS

48
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,198
Oppa, oh, gosh.
Oppa, what do we do?

49
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,825
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

50
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,076
What do we do, oppa?

51
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,329
That zombie down there
is looking at the Ferris wheel.

52
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,957
We had no idea
this place was teeming with zombies.

53
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,584
What about us? What should we do?

54
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,170
Those two are safe, thought. Oh dear, wow.

55
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,757
We're scared in here too.

56
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,552
-We're safe for now.
-Thank goodness.

57
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,262
-Oh, god.
-Thank goodness.

58
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,847
Hey, you can see the ocean.

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,391
Tomorrow we'll escape to the ocean.
Tomorrow!

60
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,101
No, not even tomorrow.
In just three hours.

61
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,645
-Just a little longer.
-Just a little later.

62
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,940
Hey, we always made it out alive
when we were together.

63
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,234
-We've never been in danger.
-You're right.

64
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,652
Wait, Na-rae…

65
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,447
BUT HE PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN DANGER

66
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,242
Oppa, what if they abandon us?

67
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,161
Look. Don't drive too far ahead.

68
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,373
Yeah! We're alive!

69
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,083
-We made it.
-We made it.

70
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,710
This is amazing.

71
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,128
They can go in front of us.

72
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,172
You're going to use us as human shields?

73
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,798
She really is the worst.

74
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,301
I think… I think we'll make it, at least.

75
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,720
You shouldn't have been bitten then.

76
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,723
-When I get out…
-Yeah?

77
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,057
…I'll kill both of you immediately.

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,854
I've worked hard my entire life.

79
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,940
I worked myself to the bone…

80
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,943
…not even taking care of myself.

81
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,322
Just accept your fate.

82
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,365
Hey. We're almost there.

83
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,618
We just need to hang in
a little longer.

84
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,789
You can't open the doors
if we don't open them for you.

85
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,046
-What did she say?
-Hey, Park Na-rae, snap out of it.

86
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,840
You all wanna live, right?

87
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,383
What's with Na-rae?

88
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,760
What's wrong with her?

89
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,096
So why did you survive for so long?

90
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,725
-What the heck? Jeez.
-She's scaring me.

91
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,979
Come on, stop kidding around. Not again.

92
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,314
Snap out of it.

93
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,359
Okay? Snap out of it,
you hear me? Come on.

94
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,444
Open your eyes. Oppa!

95
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,863
If I open the doors now,

96
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,907
that's the end of everything, right?

97
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,500
This feels so unfair.

98
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,378
I can't watch while they
get on the boat alive.

99
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,299
NA-RAE SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A DECISION

100
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,595
THE FATE OF THE SURVIVORS
DEPENDS ON THE HALF-ZOMBIES

101
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,141
Doctor, Na-rae, are you okay?

102
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,018
-Tsuki, it's Tsuki.
-Would you be okay

103
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,728
if you were in my situation?

104
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,022
Okay, then, I just want to ask…

105
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,151
Na-rae and Kkwachu, is there anyone here
that you resent right now?

106
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,487
No, I don't think we need to ask that.

107
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,446
Please don't ask them that.

108
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,073
-Please don't ask something like that.
-Get a hold of yourself and stay strong.

109
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,076
Kkwachu Hyung, Na-rae.
Get a hold of yourselves.

110
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,954
-You don't hate anyone.
-We're family. Family.

111
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,707
It's been really nice
being together, right?

112
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,083
SUDDENLY GETTING NOSTALGIC??

113
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,710
Hey, hyung, hyung.

114
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,462
Hey, I didn't know where you were,
but now that you're gone,

115
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,922
-it feels so empty.
-Yeah, I miss you.

116
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:58,923
You left behind such a big hole.

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,841
Please, just hang in there.

118
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,801
They're trying to appeal
to their emotions.

119
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,846
Na-rae, I wish we could
just be drinking in our neighborhood

120
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,097
like we used to.

121
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,475
Just hang in there, okay?
We were close.

122
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,394
Those sneaky rats.

123
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,940
Kkwachu Hyung, Na-rae,
I just want you to survive, okay?

124
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,400
Let's just keep communicating.

125
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,818
We don't have to live.

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,695
What matters is that you two
keep hanging in there.

127
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,988
What's with him?

128
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,281
THEY START TO CURRY FAVOR TO SURVIVE!

129
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,365
What's with him?

130
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,243
Na-rae, who's the person you'd call
and say, "Hey, where are you?

131
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,287
"Come join me,"
when you wanted a drink? It was me.

132
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,830
Who called you when you were
going through a tough time?

133
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,041
You know I always pressed like
on social media posts, right?

134
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,002
Always. I didn't see the others do that.

135
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,795
But I always pressed like.

136
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,882
DinDin and oppa,
you guys are trying so hard.

137
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,259
Jeez.

138
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,678
It hasn't been that long
since I came to Korea, unni.

139
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
Patricia's a foreigner.

140
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,348
She lost her brother too.
Her brother. She has to live.

141
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,602
-It doesn't matter what happens to me.
-I don't even have any family left now.

142
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,896
Hey, I'm a foreigner too.

143
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,522
I'm Japanese. I came from Japan.

144
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,901
My mom and dad are in Japan.
I'm an only child.

145
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,570
My mom and dad both got bitten in Korea.

146
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,613
SELLING OUT HER HEALTHY PARENTS

147
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,656
Na-rae,
Patricia's from farther away.

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,117
She says she can't even remember
her hometown.

149
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,745
Both of Patricia's parents are in Gwangju.
What are you talking about?

150
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,330
-What? Who…
-Not the hometown in her heart.

151
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,748
Her actual hometown.

152
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,376
AS HE MAKES AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL,
THEIR CAR APPROACHES THE BOOTH

153
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,670
Unni, are you okay?

154
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,840
So Hong-chul is in
number 23 with Patricia.

155
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,509
Hong-chul in number 23?

156
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,095
Who's in 17?

157
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,430
Okay, so Tsuki and DinDin in 17.

158
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,598
Come on.

159
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,559
-Number 23?
-Kkwachu Hyung.

160
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,647
I've memorized your name perfectly now.

161
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,067
Kkwachu Hyung. Sung-woo.

162
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,988
THE SUBLEADER BRAGS
ABOUT MEMORIZING HIS NAME AFTER 4 DAYS

163
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,325
You're all so funny
now that you're about to die.

164
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,578
Hyung, I was going to get
surgery at your clinic.

165
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,544
Na-rae, can you still see?

166
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,339
Number 23, Ro Hong-chul.

167
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,424
Oh, unni!

168
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,218
Good! You can see.

169
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,053
-Unni.
-Yeah, Na-rae, you can see.

170
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,096
Good.

171
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,224
Number 17, DinDin.

172
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,767
SHE CLEARLY REMEMBERS
HONG-CHUL AND DINDIN'S CAR NUMBERS

173
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,726
Oppa.

174
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,812
Or should we all get off together?

175
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,730
I'm worried about
Kkwachu Hyung and Na-rae.

176
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,484
Just stay put.
We're the ones who'll make the decision.

177
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,612
Should we all get off
and check on them?

178
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,408
Oppa, shut up.Stop talking.

179
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,742
IT'S BEEN 47 HOURS
SINCE THEY GOT INFECTED

180
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,286
I'm so sleepy.

181
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,370
THE HALF-ZOMBIES
ARE FEELING EXTREMELY TIRED

182
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,288
Oppa.

183
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm so sleepy. Can I sleep?

184
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,711
Na-rae, you're cold, aren't you?

185
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,880
Hyung, if you're cold,
I can give you my hat. My hat.

186
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,472
Why aren't they saying anything?

187
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,390
Na-rae, Na-rae, can you hear me?

188
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,186
Na-rae. Na-rae.

189
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,188
Kkwachu Hyung, Na-rae.

190
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,152
Hey, Park Na-rae,
you haven't changed, right?

191
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,613
Park Na-rae, oppa.

192
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,115
Oppa, how's Na-rae?

193
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,209
I'm nearly at the bottom now
and Na-rae and Kkwachu aren't moving.

194
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,878
THE HALF-ZOMBIES SUDDENLY FELL ASLEEP

195
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,380
-They're-- But before…
-Na-rae and Kkwachu aren't moving at all.

196
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,008
They're unconscious.
They're not moving at all.

197
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
Hey, maybe they've turned.

198
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,224
This means we can't get off.

199
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,980
Don't these things open
with something like a credit card?

200
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,483
Careful. Be careful.

201
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,777
Okay. We won't move an inch.

202
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,741
THE EMPLOYEE FORGOT TO LOCK THIS CAR!

203
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,743
DINDIN ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE

204
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,702
It's open.

205
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,496
-Okay, we got it.
-Yes!

206
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,915
-There. Okay.
-Okay.

207
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,208
Be careful.

208
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,961
It's DinDin and Tsuki.

209
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,878
Huh?

210
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,672
How did they get out?

211
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,551
Did Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung change?
Have they completely turned?

212
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,221
No, they're quietly asleep,
like Jonathan was.

213
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,848
If they look like they've turned,
lock the door.

214
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,101
I think they're just dead,

215
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,894
but Na-rae keeps blinking.

216
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,027
For now, I'll just let you all out.

217
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,112
Okay.

218
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,239
Is it okay to get out?

219
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,409
-Hold on, there are zombies there.
-DinDin, did Tsuki get off too?

220
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,369
Come on out.

221
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,538
Na-rae and Kkwachu aren't moving.

222
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,622
They aren't moving?

223
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,124
Why are they so still?

224
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,792
What? What's with them?

225
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,128
It has already been
four days though.

226
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,338
-True. Yeah.
-I see.

227
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,967
The zombie virus
turns people who are completely dead

228
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,468
into zombies.

229
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,847
Even if the infection isn't severe,

230
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,808
48 hours is enough
to spread throughout the body

231
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,476
and kill the person.

232
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,109
THEY'VE HELD UP WELL SO FAR,
BUT THEY ONLY HAVE ABOUT 1 HOUR LEFT

233
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,528
The problem is we can't leave this place.

234
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,405
-We can't?
-There are zombies.

235
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,745
THERE ARE SO MANY ZOMBIES
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!

236
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,622
Shouldn't we
get back on the Ferris wheel?

237
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,707
The problem is,

238
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,376
Na-rae and Kkwachu know
what cars Hong-chul and I were in.

239
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,758
SINCE MANY CARS HAVE DEAD BODIES
OR ARE UNDER MAINTENANCE

240
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,344
ONLY FIVE CARS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM

241
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,054
I'm going in another car.
Let's switch people too.

242
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,597
-Let's just…
-So you wanna split up?

243
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,723
Yeah.

244
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,142
-You should think this through.
-Can I just get in this one?

245
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,977
You're going to get on
by yourself?

246
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,354
I can't take this. I'm too anxious.

247
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,105
-Or do you wanna get in first?
-You're getting in that one?

248
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,191
You will?
Then we should all… Oppa!

249
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,735
-Let me go first.
-What? Oppa. You're just…

250
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,736
Seriously?

251
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,112
-Seriously, oppa.
-Wow.

252
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,156
THE SCARED HONG-CHUL
QUICKLY GETS IN THE CAR

253
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,908
-Let's get in.
-Oh, no.

254
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,286
Tsuki, if we die, we'll die together.

255
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,496
Yeah, you're right.

256
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,539
DINDIN AND TSUKI ARE A TEAM AGAIN

257
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,208
-Who… Yeah.
-Then I'll get in first.

258
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,086
-Okay.
-Dex, are you gonna ride alone?

259
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,253
Without anyone else?

260
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,214
Can you go back a car
and hang my hat up?

261
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,507
-Go then.
-No.

262
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,508
My hat, please.

263
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,884
-I don't want to resent anyone.
-Guys.

264
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,968
Separately then.

265
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,097
THE LEADER AND THE SUBLEADER
ALSO GO SEPARATE WAYS

266
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,191
ALL SURVIVORS ARE NOW ON BOARD

267
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,531
Now that I'm riding by myself,
I'm so scared.

268
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,699
Noona, I'm sorry.

269
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,954
Oh, this is so scary. I'm so scared.

270
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,872
Hey, you don't think Na-rae

271
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,500
remembers that I pushed her
in the beginning, do you?

272
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,503
Na-rae wanted to kill you
from day one, hyung.

273
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,213
Man.

274
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,425
You don't have long anyway.

275
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,553
Hey, come on!

276
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,476
We can't accept zombies. No exception.

277
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,813
You punk, if you keep calling us zombies,
you'll be the first one I kill.

278
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,233
-Which one should I bite?
-You're not wrong.

279
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,818
Eeny meeny…

280
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,319
-Seriously.
-Noona.

281
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,863
-You know I'm right.
-Hold on.

282
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,614
THESE TWO MUST BE
THE MOST ANXIOUS OF THEM ALL

283
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,205
We won't expose
each other's car numbers, right?

284
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,083
Let's be civil.
No telling each other's numbers, okay?

285
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,752
Hyung, you're in number nine, right?

286
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,714
DinDin, you and I
are very close to each other.

287
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:41,302
THE TWO STRONGEST CANDIDATES' CARS
ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER

288
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,141
Two.

289
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,392
Three. Two.

290
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,810
THE TWO MADE A SECRET CHANNEL

291
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,646
What if Si-young tells them
which cars you and I are in?

292
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,649
But we know which cars
they're all riding in too.

293
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,319
Right now, Dex is in number 17.

294
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,528
Si-young…

295
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,113
-She's in three.
-Three.

296
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,865
Patricia is in number 23.

297
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,991
I see.

298
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,118
They might get suspicious
if we're silent for too long,

299
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,620
so let's switch to channel one.

300
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,122
-This light…
-If something happens to us,

301
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,290
if our radio cuts out,

302
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,751
write on the window like this, okay?

303
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,835
Okay. Okay.

304
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,378
Okay.

305
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,088
I think I'll be safe here.

306
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,798
As long as no one says anything.

307
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,635
-Hey, isn't that Hee-kwan?
-Huh?

308
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,803
-He's still on the Viking.
-I know.

309
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,722
I'm worried about him.

310
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,519
Hee-kwan?

311
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,438
ZOMBIE HEE-KWAN IS STILL
SUFFERING FROM MOTION SICKNESS…

312
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,817
He looks so innocent.

313
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,031
I wanna go back in time.
Like ten years or so.

314
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,787
I just want to work out again.

315
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,456
The muscleman.

316
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,502
THE MUSCLEMAN IS WORRIED ABOUT MUSCLE LOSS

317
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,255
I wanna go to my mom and dad's house,
have a hot bath,

318
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,173
and then eat my mom's cooking.

319
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,176
But, noona, shouldn't you
go see your kid first?

320
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,972
Right.

321
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,100
Let's go our separate ways if we survive.

322
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,811
Seriously, this guy.

323
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,147
EVERYONE MIGHT FEEL THE SAME WAY

324
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,817
It looks like the sun will rise soon.

325
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,237
Yeah.
Hey, we're almost there, okay?

326
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,530
Hang in a little longer.

327
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,867
Yeah, hang in a little longer.
The boat will be here in an hour.

328
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,243
Hold on for another hour.

329
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,799
Oppa.

330
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,427
Did someone turn the lights off?

331
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
Na-rae.

332
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,431
Na-rae. Hey.

333
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,099
Na-rae.

334
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,601
-Oppa.
-Na-rae.

335
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,227
Oppa, it's dark.

336
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,147
Na-rae, where are you? Na-rae.

337
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,064
Na-rae.

338
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,941
-Oppa.
-Na-rae.

339
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,485
Oh, I can't see.

340
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,032
Na-rae.

341
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,118
Hey, Na-rae.
Na-rae, there you are. Na-rae.

342
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,203
Oh, you startled me.

343
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,289
-Oh, I'm sorry. Gosh.
-Jeez.

344
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:23,213
I can't see. What do we do, oppa?

345
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,924
We can't see anymore.
We can't.

346
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,258
THEIR EYES CLOUDED UP WHILE SLEEPING

347
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,345
Oppa, can you see over there?

348
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,305
No, what… what is that?

349
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,599
My vision is all blurry.

350
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,309
THIS IS WHAT THEY SEE

351
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,562
Oh, gosh. I can't see.

352
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,563
What's wrong with your face?

353
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,481
-What's wrong?
-What happened?

354
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,484
-Yeah, they're red.
-Their eyes are all red.

355
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,110
-Na-rae, open your eyes.
-What?

356
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,528
Open your eyes, come on.

357
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,573
I can't see.
I can't see either.

358
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,992
AND THEY CAN BARELY SEE NOW

359
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,452
I can't see.

360
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,663
Shouldn't we go out there?

361
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
Oppa.

362
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,585
I don't think
I have much time left.

363
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,172
Okay, let's go outside.
You can still walk, right?

364
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,470
Where are you?

365
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,847
Where are you?

366
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,601
Oh, no. They're coming.
They're coming, oppa.

367
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,895
Unni, are you okay?

368
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,647
You're okay, right?

369
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,066
-I think I'm…
-Na-rae. Kkwachu Hyung.

370
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,734
Of course I'm okay.

371
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,904
What car number are you in?

372
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,740
Everyone's where
they were before, noona.

373
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,909
Are you okay?
Why didn't you answer until now?

374
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,038
Who cares about the car numbers?
We're gonna see each other soon.

375
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,290
Number 17, DinDin.

376
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,584
WHILE THE HALF-ZOMBIES WERE SLEEPING

377
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,087
THEY ALL SWITCHED CARS

378
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,215
BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THEIR VISION

379
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,761
IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM
TO FIGURE IT OUT

380
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,265
Oh, my heart's racing. Wow, this is crazy.

381
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,267
Isn't this so scary?

382
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,644
-I'm so scared.
-It's so frightening, isn't it?

383
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,354
It's like Russian roulette.

384
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,522
Isn't it fun?

385
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,818
We're going to die!

386
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,281
The half-zombie siblings
only have 30 minutes left.

387
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,077
Once that time is up,
their humanness will completely disappear.

388
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,831
The Ferris wheel takes 12 minutes
to go around once.

389
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,751
They need to find the people
they want to take with them

390
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,336
to the afterlife
while they are still lucid.

391
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,924
However, their eyesight
has deteriorated significantly.

392
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,761
If they make a wrong choice,

393
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,013
they might hurt an innocent friend.

394
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,015
THEY MAY FAIL AT THEIR REVENGE

395
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,228
The final game begins now.

396
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,897
BLIND ROULETTE
A CLOUDED CHOICE

397
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,066
So it's come to this.

398
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,652
If I die, so be it.

399
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,363
Two.

400
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
DinDin.

401
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,701
Hey, shouldn't we come up with a plan B?

402
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,164
Is our only option right now
to stay in here?

403
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,709
Na-rae and Kkwachu
still have the walkie talkie.

404
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,003
So if there's still some humanness
left in them,

405
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,547
we could yell out, "17! 17!"

406
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,882
And they might go to Patricia.

407
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,509
Right.

408
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,344
TERRIBLE FRIENDS!
THEY'RE PLOTTING AN ASSASSINATION

409
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,388
Then which number should we yell out?

410
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,224
Hyung,
the biggest problem right now

411
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,017
-is that you're the closest to them.
-I know.

412
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,143
Oh, really?

413
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,354
-Our car is next up after his passes.
-I know.

414
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,314
HONG-CHUL, DINDIN, AND TSUKI
ARE HEADED TOWARD THE DANGER ZONE

415
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
Can they see us?

416
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,327
Let's hide. Hide.

417
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,208
My eyes hurt.

418
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,461
Does anyone have eyes
on Na-rae and Kkwachu?

419
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,338
I'm too high up,
so I can't see.

420
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,341
Oh, are they in here?

421
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,009
No, I can't see too clearly.

422
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,678
I think they're in there.

423
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,597
I think there's someone in there. No?

424
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,684
We've made it this far together.

425
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,103
We agreed we're a family, right?

426
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,774
We have to get to a safe place together.

427
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,777
I think
it's just Tsuki in there.

428
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,280
That one. Isn't it that one?

429
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,115
Tsuki, are you in number ten?

430
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,325
Number 17? Number 17?

431
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,036
Tsuki, are you in number 17?

432
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,249
I can't hear you.
The connection's bad.

433
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,752
TSUKI'S GOTTEN MUCH BETTER AT LYING

434
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,715
-Jeez. Then who's in number ten?
-They're hiding.

435
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,050
They covered the window with a towel.

436
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,140
HONG-CHUL, DINDIN, AND TSUKI
SAFELY OVERCOME THE CRISIS

437
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,106
Na-rae, Kkwachu Hyung,
if you're having a tough time,

438
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,065
do you want us to come and talk?

439
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,525
HE EMPLOYS A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC

440
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,526
Hong-chul.

441
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,612
Why don't you come out and talk?

442
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,322
I'll open the door.
What number are you in?

443
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,657
Can't you see me?
Open the door now.

444
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,992
HIS TARGETS ARE
DEX, PATRICIA, AND SI-YOUNG

445
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,202
Is someone in there?

446
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,496
It's almost time anyway,
so open the door. We'll come out.

447
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,748
Open all the doors.

448
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,959
He's terrible, really.

449
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,378
I don't think it's this one.

450
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,299
Na-rae, we can see the boat now.

451
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,093
So we need to hurry up and go.
Open all the doors now.

452
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,887
So where are you?

453
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,349
The boat's here. It's here. We need to go.

454
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,184
Let's escape now. Hurry up, open the door.

455
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,268
DINDIN JOINS IN

456
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,813
I don't think
it's this one.

457
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,273
THEY'LL BE PUT IN DANGER AT THIS RATE!

458
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,901
Open the doors, come on.
I want to get out of here now.

459
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,819
Where are you?

460
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,822
Where are you?

461
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,410
Na-rae, can you see me?

462
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,792
Kkwachu Hyung, why are you outside?

463
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,963
Dex, which number are you in?

464
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,882
I'm in front of you right now.

465
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,719
DEX SHOWED HIMSELF WITHOUT HIDING

466
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,097
-I'm in front of you right now.
-No way.

467
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,556
He's facing her straight on.

468
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,601
Let's go.
Let's all go now. Let's get out of here.

469
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,562
Is this the right one? Talk to me.

470
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,482
Yes, it's this one.
I'm in here, Noona. Are you okay?

471
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,073
I'm here. Right in front of you.

472
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,420
-Open it!
-No! Over there.

473
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,507
DEX SAVED HIS TEAMMATES
EVERY TIME THEY FACED DANGER

474
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,552
THE LEADER CONFIDENTLY REVEALED HIMSELF
AS HE HAS NOTHING TO FEAR

475
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,555
Oppa, I don't think it's this one.

476
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,270
-We're doomed.
-Hyung, Dex knew they wouldn't kill him

477
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,315
and showed his face.
So they let him pass by.

478
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,649
Wait, really?

479
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,942
That's why he was acting all nice.

480
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,111
"Noona, are you okay?
You don't look so great."

481
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,404
The punk said that.

482
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,200
Hey, shoot. We're gonna die.
I think they're going to kill us all.

483
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,288
Not the one that just passed by, then.

484
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,333
IT SEEMS LIKE
NA-RAE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS DEX

485
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,834
Is everyone okay?

486
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,462
Which numbers are you all in?

487
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,379
PATRICIA IS NEXT

488
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,257
Na-rae.

489
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,884
Oh, they got us.

490
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,053
Oppa, is someone in there?

491
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,805
Jeez, are they in there?

492
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,515
Unni, I love you.

493
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,311
No, no, no, no, no, no!

494
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,605
No. No!

495
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,983
We have to make them
open the doors.

496
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,615
Wow. That was so scary.
I almost just peed myself.

497
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,783
Where are you?

498
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,744
SI-YOUNG'S CAR IS HEADING DOWN NOW

499
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,329
Na-rae, you're okay, right?

500
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,122
Are you okay?

501
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,881
Na-rae, you're okay, right?

502
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,132
I can't see.

503
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,926
I can't see.

504
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,219
-I can't see.
-Here.

505
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,387
I don't think there's anyone in there.

506
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,267
Oh, gosh.

507
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,232
If they let Patricia pass
and Dex pass by too,

508
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,234
that means they're waiting for you and me.

509
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,820
No! No!

510
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,614
Not after all I've done to come this far.

511
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,951
Oh, what do we do?

512
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,077
Oppa.

513
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,245
THEY COULDN'T FIND THEIR TARGETS

514
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,372
It means two people are in one
and one in another.

515
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,498
-What?
-If each of those two

516
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,125
-were riding by themselves.
-Na-rae. Na-rae.

517
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,130
There's 18 minutes left
until they turn into zombies.

518
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,342
IT'S HONG-CHUL, DINDIN,
AND TSUKI'S TURN AGAIN

519
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,177
It's coming.

520
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,721
It's coming.

521
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,851
-They're together.
-They are? They are?

522
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,269
Yeah. Na-rae is there too.

523
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,980
Let me just check one last time.

524
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,690
Tsuki, are we next?

525
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,108
It's Hong-chul.

526
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,579
Can you see them?

527
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,747
No. They must be hiding, of course.

528
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,333
It's because I really can't see.

529
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,806
Do you see them?

530
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,268
THEY CAN'T SEE THE PERSON
HIDING ON THE FLOOR

531
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:43,565
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH!

532
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,195
IF HONG-CHUL PASSES THROUGH SAFELY,
THEY'LL BE IN DANGER

533
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,534
Who's in number nine?

534
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,042
Who's in number nine?

535
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,794
Hong-chul is in there.

536
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,969
TSUKI SELLS HONG-CHUL OUT!

537
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,224
We won't expose
each other's car numbers, right?

538
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,351
Let's be civil.
No telling each other's numbers, okay?

539
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,518
THE PROMISE WAS BROKEN…

540
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,979
I think I'll be safe in here.
As long as no one says anything.

541
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,690
I don't think they'll kill you, Tsuki.

542
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,567
-Why?
-Because those two

543
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,069
have no reason to kill you.

544
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,322
BUT SINCE THEY'RE IN THE SAME CAR,
THEY SHARE THE SAME FATE

545
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,407
They hate either me or Hong-chul.

546
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
What should we do?

547
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,871
I think it'll be better to show them once.

548
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,832
Yeah, since they don't know
that I'm with you.

549
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,044
So if they let you pass by,
Tsuki, then I'll be safe too.

550
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,256
Will you be okay though?
What if they open the door?

551
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,174
If they open the door
then we'll die.

552
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,011
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
THEY'LL BE DEAD INSTANTLY!

553
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,597
SO THEY MAKE A FINAL BET

554
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,599
Hong-chul is in there.

555
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,978
Tsuki, is it this one?

556
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,105
Yeah, the red one
you're looking at right now.

557
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,985
That's Hong-chul.

558
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,778
Hong-chul is in number nine?

559
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,160
Wait, I think someone's
in number ten. Wait.

560
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,040
Are you okay?

561
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,417
Are you okay?

562
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,584
Are you okay?

563
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,585
SHE COPIES THE LEADER!

564
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,672
-Did you see?
-I'm in here.

565
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,881
-Let's go in.
-Did you see Tsuki?

566
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,008
Are you okay?

567
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,843
Number ten, Tsuki and DinDin.

568
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,387
HE BELATEDLY THROWS A SMOKE GRENADE

569
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,805
Tsuki and DinDin.

570
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,224
Number ten. DinDin! DinDin!

571
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,977
Oh, gosh.

572
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,478
Oh, gosh.

573
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,230
Oh, my legs are shaking.

574
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,566
Wow, I'm so scared. Seriously.

575
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,738
-Let's not cry.
-Really, my legs are shaking.

576
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,114
How were you sitting?

577
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,574
Like this. I was sitting like this.

578
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,076
-I mean, what happened just now?
-I don't know.

579
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,245
Hey, why are you all hiding?

580
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,789
There's no reason for us to hide
from Na-rae and Kkwachu.

581
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,707
What is with you all?

582
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,750
Let's…

583
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,420
not meet again if we survive.

584
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,589
…if we survive.

585
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,759
I told you before
we should go our separate ways.

586
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,761
Let's go our separate ways
as soon as we get off the boat.

587
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,012
IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR JOURNEY TOGETHER
WILL END HERE

588
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,599
There's 13 minutes remaining
until they turn into zombies.

589
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,601
Is he really in number nine?

590
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,228
If Tsuki said he was in number nine,

591
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,189
-everyone can listen to that channel.
-We need to get out of here.

592
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,941
-We have to get on the boat.
-So if Hong-chul were really in there,

593
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,902
do you think
he wouldn't have said anything?

594
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,653
Hong-chul is in there.

595
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,323
I know.
He would've said something.

596
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,742
IT DOES SEEM ODD
THAT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

597
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,579
Numbers 3, 9, 10, 17, and 23
were empty before.

598
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,207
But in number ten,
I definitely saw Tsuki in there.

599
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,750
Dex was between 10 and 20.

600
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,212
-Dex, Patricia…
-I want to get out of here.

601
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,589
-Tsuki was riding alone.
-Yeah.

602
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,758
I didn't see DinDin.
Where could he be?

603
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,136
Open sesame!

604
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,430
What do we do? Hold on.

605
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,015
The only ones
we don't know right now

606
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,892
are Hong-chul, Si-young, and DinDin.

607
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,394
-I know.
-We might open the wrong one

608
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,645
and get Si-young.

609
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,483
SI-YOUNG BECAME ONE OF THE TARGETS
BECAUSE SHE HID HERSELF

610
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,111
Seriously, Oppa, what do we do?

611
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,779
It's okay. We're not gonna die.

612
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,030
We'll survive this. We will.

613
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,491
I'm gonna pee myself. For real.

614
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,745
-It's definitely not number nine.
-It isn't?

615
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,288
-It's not number ten.
-It isn't?

616
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,665
We went over three.

617
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,500
-For number three, I--
-Oh, no!

618
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,837
EVERYTHING IS CONFUSING!

619
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,756
Hong-chul is in there.

620
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,425
Just how much can I trust Tsuki?

621
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,176
They should sleep outside, right?

622
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,347
IT'S ACTUALLY QUESTIONABLE
WHETHER TSUKI IS TRUSTWORTHY

623
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,599
-Tsuki, what if this were your family?
-Yeah?

624
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,519
If this happened to your family
in Japan, would you leave them behind?

625
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,354
It's up to you.
You can decide.

626
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,981
What do we do?

627
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,400
Na-rae, Kkwachu Hyung,
we have to go now.

628
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,527
If the boat leaves, that's it for us!

629
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,116
There's five minutes left
until they turn into zombies.

630
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,828
Everyone.

631
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,789
Thank you and I'm sorry.

632
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,376
But I can't go alone.

633
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,044
I'm sorry.

634
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,047
We're all going together,
so what are you sorry about?

635
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,966
Noona, what are you talking about?
You're not going anywhere.

636
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,260
We're all getting out of here together.
The boat's coming!

637
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,887
You stand there.
I'll press it.

638
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,680
You can blame me as much as you want.

639
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,934
It's now time
to stop the roulette.

640
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,229
This is the last choice…

641
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,814
I can make.

642
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,329
Oppa…

643
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,499
Stop it now.

644
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
What?

645
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,510
What?
Why is it suddenly stopping? Why?

646
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,636
It stopped.

647
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,179
It stopped?

648
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,056
Which one is it?

649
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,369
I'm holding it.
I've got a hold of it.

650
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,414
Who is in that red one?

651
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,550
Did we find him?

652
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,596
Who is it?

653
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,809
She opened it!

654
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,894
Whose door did they open?

655
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,688
She opened it.
She opened it. She opened it.

656
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,731
Huh?

657
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,735
No way. Oh, no.

658
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,119
Stop it at number nine.

659
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,705
I have a feeling it's nine.

660
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,228
-Who is it?
-This is insane.

661
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,025
I found you, Ro Hong-chul.

662
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,739
Hi.

663
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,328
I found you, Ro Hong-chul.

664
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:12,221
5:58 A.M.
HONG-CHUL IS LOCKED UP WITH NA-RAE

665
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,506
How did you know?

666
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,513
How did you know?

667
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,849
Ro Hong-chul.

668
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,019
Oppa.

669
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,902
Oh, he's always
looked after me.

670
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,825
Why? What?

671
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,952
It's moving.

672
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,788
But Doctor Kkwachu is outside

673
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,498
and Na-rae is in the car.

674
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,876
We made it.

675
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,253
We made it?

676
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,754
We made it.

677
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,673
-I can come back up?
-Oppa.

678
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,092
Up there. Na-rae is in there.

679
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,808
How? How did we make it?

680
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,268
It was so scary!

681
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,352
Absolutely.

682
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,443
Hong-chul! Hong-chul!

683
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,861
How did you know?

684
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,492
HE MIGHT DIE FROM LAUGHING
BEFORE GETTING BITTEN TO DEATH

685
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,369
-I got you.
-Damn it.

686
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,538
How did you know?

687
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,458
Tsuki told me.

688
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,424
-Oh, gosh.
-See? That's why you should've been nicer.

689
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,552
Tsuki said,
"Ro Hong-chul is in number nine."

690
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,804
Man, Tsuki's a jerk too.

691
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,681
DinDin manipulated her. He did.

692
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,059
On what channel? Number one?

693
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,520
-Huh?
-Did you use a different channel?

694
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,897
Oppa, you didn't hear it?

695
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,940
I didn't. Shoot.

696
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,275
Why couldn't you hear it?

697
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,778
I must have switched it to
another channel when I was startled.

698
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,404
Darn.

699
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,907
Tsuki, is this the one?

700
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,658
Yeah, the red one
you're looking at right now.

701
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,453
HE MISSED THE ASSASSINATION PLOT
BECAUSE HE WAS ON A DIFFERENT CHANNEL

702
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,121
Number ten, Tsuki and DinDin.

703
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,832
HE WAS SCHEMING
WITHOUT KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO DIE

704
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,501
Damn it.

705
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,009
The final destination
that Hong-chul was running so hard toward

706
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,928
was to be by Na-rae's side.

707
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,432
The lucky guy who always
fled by himself is scared.

708
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,644
-Now…
-You coward.

709
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,729
If anyone else
were in the car with him…

710
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,898
I don't think they'll kill you, Tsuki.

711
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,026
Yeah, since they don't know
that I'm with you.

712
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,322
…he wouldn't have died in vain.

713
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,244
DINDIN SURVIVED TO THE END
USING TSUKI AS HIS SHIELD

714
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,079
The teammates survive.

715
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,748
We always made it out alive
when we were together.

716
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,000
-We've never been in danger.
-You're right.

717
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,087
Heartfelt condolences
to the unlucky Hong-chul

718
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,797
who briefly forgot its value.

719
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,924
Bye!

720
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,634
This isn't fair.

721
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,344
I'm so mad.

722
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,815
Kkwachu Hyung is still there.

723
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,068
I think Kkwachu Hyung is gonna
take someone out too.

724
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,782
Oh, gosh. I'm so scared.

725
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,120
Patricia, are you okay?

726
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
Tsuki is…

727
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,418
See you later.

728
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,045
-Who is it?
-No!

729
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,257
Dex!

730
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,218
What? Dex? What?

731
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,679
What happened? What's going on?

732
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,347
Does anyone know?

733
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,557
He has Jex.

734
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,058
Jex. He got him.

735
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,560
IT'S DEX, NOT JEX

736
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,771
Dex!

737
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,648
Just come out already.

738
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,277
-Hyung.
-It's okay. No. I'm okay.

739
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,279
-Be careful.
-I thought I was going to die, hyung.

740
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,531
No, it's okay. Good luck.
Make sure you get on the boat.

741
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,824
Hyung, I'm sorry.

742
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
It's okay.

743
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,078
-I'm sorry.
-Hurry. Go.

744
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,788
Go and survive.

745
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,127
Huh?

746
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,839
Hey! No! Don't kill me!

747
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,425
No! Don't come any closer. No, no, no!

748
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,676
Come on out. I'll let you live.

749
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,637
-What?
-Come on out now. Hurry.

750
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,138
Go. Go get on the boat.

751
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,556
-Really?
-Really.

752
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,976
You're my savior. I love you!

753
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,645
I really love you so much!

754
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,606
SHE SURE RUNS FAST
FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES HIM

755
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,944
Should I get out?

756
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,863
-I'll let you live. Come out.
-Okay.

757
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,365
Make it onto the boat alive.

758
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,242
What happened?

759
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,245
EVERYONE QUICKLY RUNS AWAY

760
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,789
No! No! No! No! No!

761
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,625
No! Don't!
Don't, don't, don't! No, no, no!

762
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,835
No! Come on. Why?

763
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,421
-Come on out. I'll let you live.
-You will?

764
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,216
-You two were in here together? Jeez.
-You'll let us live?

765
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,884
Tsuki, come on out!

766
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,636
-Come on out. I'll let you live.
-Thank you.

767
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,304
Make it out alive and go home.

768
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,098
-Hyung, thank you!
-Hurry.

769
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,867
I feel sleepy.

770
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,002
Did you think you'd live, oppa?

771
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,086
But…

772
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,589
You know,
evil people should be punished.

773
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,585
Hey! Don't!

774
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,337
Don't! No!

775
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,048
I'm sorry about the forklift.

776
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,508
I'm sorry about the forklift!

777
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,554
Mr. Kkwachu Hyung has died.

778
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,223
Ms. Park Na-rae has died.

779
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,518
Mr. Ro Hong-chul has died.

780
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,028
6:55 A.M.
MINUS 13 DEGREES CELSIUS

781
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,946
It's so cold.

782
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,573
We have to hurry up. Come on.

783
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,034
-Is the boat here?
-It's there, right?

784
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,370
-There! There!
-Where? Where?

785
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,913
Is that
where we were yesterday?

786
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,373
-The boat is there!
-It's there?

787
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,874
SURVIVED

788
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,667
-We have to hurry.
-The boat's there!

789
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,461
We're not late.

790
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,672
Let's go!

791
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,673
THEY ARRIVED RIGHT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK!

792
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,967
-Hurry.
-Does the gate open?

793
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,554
-Sir!
-We're here!

794
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,681
-Here!
-Sir!

795
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,141
Hello!

796
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,645
-Over here!
-Hello!

797
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,938
-Captain!
-Over here!

798
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,856
-We're over here!
-Hey!

799
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,191
-What's with them?
-We made it!

800
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,901
-No!
-Here!

801
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,778
-Here, we're here!
-It's the boat.

802
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,488
-Captain!
-Please let us board.

803
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,406
"Harmony"?

804
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,323
Jonathan?

805
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,659
THE NAME OF THE BOAT IS HARMONY…
IS IT HARMONICA BY ANY CHANCE?

806
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,828
-Let us on!
-No, come on.

807
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,746
-What is he saying?
-The Harmony. That's the boat.

808
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,914
-So what's up with him?
-Hurry!

809
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,332
-We're over here!
-Sir!

810
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,168
Jeez.
Why are they being so noisy?

811
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,878
-Sir!
-Where are you going?

812
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,880
THE CAPTAIN IGNORES
THE SURVIVORS AND GOES IN?

813
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,923
Please!

814
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,551
-Hey!
-Oh, you're breaking my heart.

815
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,970
THE BOAT IS RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES,
BUT THEY HAVE NO WAY OF GETTING THERE

816
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:31,887
Let's hurry!

817
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,014
Should we just go in?

818
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,391
It's right there.

819
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,102
The water has to be
at least three meters deep.

820
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,441
-What is that?
-A rope?

821
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,942
Maybe we need to
tie them together.

822
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,027
Tie them together and throw it.
Then pull it closer.

823
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,237
-Let's try it.
-Let's go.

824
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,448
We can do it!

825
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,408
-Wow!
-That's it.

826
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,912
-Yeah! You got it!
-Okay. You got it!

827
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,832
-Pull!
-Pull! Pull harder!

828
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,333
Oh, no.

829
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,419
It won't come any closer.

830
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,754
Noona. There.

831
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,256
Yeah! That's great.

832
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,176
Let's put these in the water
and step on them to get to the boat.

833
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,553
-Let's put them in the water.
-Like a boat?

834
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,221
-Yeah.
-After one person gets on,

835
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,264
we can pull it back.

836
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,223
-That will work. Yeah.
-Oh! The rope.

837
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,349
I see. Okay, okay.

838
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,103
EVERYONE MUST GET ON THE BOAT
WITHOUT THE CAPTAIN NOTICING

839
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,105
-I'll test it out.
-No.

840
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,024
-You're going?
-There's no time. We have to hurry.

841
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,525
I'll test it out.

842
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,028
-You'll go first?
-A guy should go.

843
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,905
Okay, then you should go first.

844
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,115
Be careful. Be careful.

845
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,159
Okay.

846
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,456
-Hey!
-Oppa.

847
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,419
YOU COULD HAVE A HEART ATTACK
FALLING INTO THE FREEZING COLD WATER

848
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,754
Shoot.

849
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,882
We have to pull the rope from the back,
make it taut.

850
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,718
Pull it and make it taut.
Patricia, hold this.

851
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,304
Good. Good.

852
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,889
You're doing great. Okay?

853
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,810
-Okay.
-Okay. Good.

854
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,854
-Who wants to go next?
-Next?

855
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,023
Dex, I think you should go
and hold it steady…

856
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,192
-I think he could help.
-…for Patricia with DinDin.

857
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,568
-Okay, I'll go first then.
-Okay.

858
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,614
You have to let it go.

859
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,288
You can come up, right?

860
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:22,957
DEX ALSO GOT ON

861
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,291
Okay. We're good.

862
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,043
Patricia,
do you want to go this time?

863
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,546
-Can I?
-You go and hold it steady.

864
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,423
Oh! Scary!

865
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,014
-Hey, what?
-Oh, no!

866
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,808
What?

867
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,227
SHE ALMOST MET WITH LEVIATHAN
BEFORE EVEN GETTING ON

868
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,521
-You okay?
-Help her up. Help her up first!

869
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,606
-You okay?
-I was trying to get on,

870
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,441
but my legs wouldn't move.

871
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,277
Are you okay?

872
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,279
Oh, I should've come last.

873
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,114
-I'm so scared.
-You're scared?

874
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,532
-Tsuki, go first.
-Tsuki.

875
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,825
-Can you go?
-I'll go first. Okay.

876
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,077
TSUKI GOES IN PATRICIA'S STEAD

877
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,245
Be careful.

878
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,330
Tsuki, be careful. Be careful!

879
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,499
Wait. Wait. Be careful, be careful!

880
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,167
You can do it. You can do it.

881
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,460
SHE FOUND A STABLE POSITION!

882
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,503
Tsuki, pull.

883
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,547
Hurry!

884
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,300
Tsuki, here's the ladder.

885
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,509
Oh, there's a ladder?

886
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,928
Hold her steady.

887
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,016
Wait!

888
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,851
Huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

889
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,521
Wow, hold on. This is so scary.

890
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,690
Put your foot down.

891
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,691
Oh, gosh.

892
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,192
Oh, this is so scary.

893
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,820
Here.

894
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,947
-Dex, can you make it up here?
-Yeah.

895
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,325
-Pull!
-Go, go!

896
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,334
Hold on, my crotch, wait.

897
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,627
OH, NO! THAT'S NOT GOOD!

898
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,045
My legs. Wait. I--

899
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,755
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

900
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,548
Okay, let's take it out to the side.

901
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,843
Hey.

902
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,638
That hurt.

903
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,308
Unni, we need to decide
who should go next.

904
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,310
I'll stay, unni. You go.

905
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,187
You go. I'm fine.

906
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,230
-No, I--
-I can go on my own.

907
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,067
Unni, can you really do it by yourself?

908
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
Better me than you.

909
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,444
-Really?
-I need to hold this for you.

910
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,820
THERE'S NO NEED FOR HER TO WORRY

911
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,821
Okay, unni.

912
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,365
Hurry!

913
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,408
Okay, sit.

914
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,951
-Oh, no!
-Sit.

915
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,580
IT'S VERY UNSTABLE FROM THE START!

916
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,374
Sit. Sit. Sit.

917
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,209
All set?

918
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,877
Balance yourself. Find your balance.

919
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,254
-I'll keep a hold on the rope.
-Unni!

920
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,506
Oh, gosh!

921
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,635
-Oh, gosh.
-We have to hurry! Come on!

922
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,221
What the heck!
This is so annoying.

923
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,598
The water is so salty!

924
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,517
This is so dangerous.

925
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,893
How do I get up there?

926
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,605
Stop there for now.
Stop there and try standing up.

927
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,274
Stand up? Hold on.

928
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,776
Patricia, try to stand up.

929
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,194
This is so…

930
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,905
You have to hurry.

931
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:00,864
Zombies!

932
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,163
THE ZOMBIES RUSHED OVER ALREADY!

933
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,131
-You have to hurry.
-Hold on.

934
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,757
-Wait.
-Oppa.

935
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,385
-No. You have to stand up!
-Hurry. Stand up!

936
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,054
Si-young's on the other side,
you have to hurry up on here.

937
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,516
Patricia, we don't have time.
The zombies are coming. Quickly!

938
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,601
Okay, I'll just die!

939
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,727
No!

940
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,937
HER FRIENDS ALREADY FEEL LIKE DYING!

941
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,442
-Put your feet up here together.
-You can do it.

942
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,526
-You can do it.
-Here. Up here!

943
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,028
Raise your foot really high,
really high.

944
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,407
Oh, gosh!

945
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,078
Dex!

946
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,206
No!

947
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,207
Patricia!

948
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,044
Oh, no!

949
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,382
Oh, no!

950
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,898
Oppa, I'm sorry.

951
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,691
-Oh, I'm all wet.
-Hold on.

952
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,818
Wait, wait, wait. Patricia.

953
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,613
-No, no.
-No, no.

954
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,072
Patricia, let's go back for now.

955
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,866
Si-young. She's in danger!

956
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,410
-Patricia.
-Oh, I hate that!

957
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,662
Zombies…

958
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,123
Jeez.

959
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,669
Hurry! There's no time!

960
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,922
-Let's go. Hurry. Get on it.
-No!

961
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,882
-Let's go.
-The zombies are coming.

962
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,717
-Let's go.
-No wait. Okay.

963
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,677
-You can do it. You can.
-Let's hurry.

964
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,429
-But you have to hold on.
-Oh, I really…

965
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,265
I feel like I'm gonna develop a phobia!

966
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,643
Patricia, we have to hurry!

967
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,810
Yeah! We're coming!

968
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,145
-We're coming!
-We're going together!

969
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,563
-All at once.
-All at once?

970
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,857
Noona, hurry, there's no time.
The boat needs to leave.

971
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,068
Patricia, it's okay!
You can do it!

972
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,903
Why is it so noisy?

973
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,405
OH, NO! THE CAPTAIN WOKE UP
AT THE COMMOTION

974
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,615
It's so noisy.

975
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,742
Jeez.

976
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,202
-Let's go.
-Wait!

977
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,287
Oppa!

978
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,206
-The three of them?
-At once?

979
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,125
-Can they get here all at once?
-Hey!

980
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,628
What? Hey! This isn't a fishing boat.

981
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,797
-Find another one.
-But we…

982
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,840
-What?
-What is with you people?

983
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,259
-Why did you tie this here?
-What is it?

984
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,885
You can't untie this!

985
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,053
-No.
-There are zombies.

986
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,137
Sir!

987
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,764
-We're coming!
-Sir!

988
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,599
-What are zombies?
-You can't untie this! No!

989
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,393
-You people!
-Tsuki, pull!

990
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,228
-What is all this?
-No!

991
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,522
-We're coming!
-Tsuki!

992
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,940
They're coming. They have to come!

993
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,066
-Sir!
-Sir!

994
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,694
What's wrong with you people?
I told you this isn't a fishing boat.

995
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,654
What now? The rope's cut.

996
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,114
The rope is cut?

997
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,626
What are you doing? Hey, lady.
What are you doing? You'll fall.

998
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,753
-No!
-Come here. Come here. Come here.

999
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,840
What?

1000
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,675
I can't believe it.

1001
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,055
You threw it!

1002
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,353
Oh, no!

1003
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,150
Tsuki!

1004
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,237
-Hey, hey! Tsuki!
-Sir!

1005
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,199
-Don't go!
-Sir! I can't swim!

1006
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,618
Sir!

1007
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,829
We were almost there, you jerk!

1008
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,831
You jerk!

1009
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,542
You could have taken us with you!

1010
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,961
Sir, I can't even swim!

1011
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,009
I'm gonna remember you!

1012
00:48:56,808 --> 00:49:00,187
You two! You have to come back for us!

1013
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,482
-We'll come back!
-We will! We promise!

1014
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,067
DinDin!

1015
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,655
You know the coordinates, right?
Come rescue us. We'll be waiting!

1016
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,407
-Oh, no!
-Shoot!

1017
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,619
There are zombies over there.

1018
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,412
-Zombies.
-What are zombies?

1019
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,206
Why do you keep talking about
these zombies?

1020
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,249
There are zombies everywhere right now!

1021
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,877
That's why we escaped
and came here.

1022
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,590
I can't believe it.

1023
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,635
What are we gonna do?
We can't even go back.

1024
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,928
Oh, gosh.

1025
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,313
Huh? What, what, what, what?

1026
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,024
It's okay. It's okay, Patricia.
I'll take care it.

1027
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,945
-What, what?
-I'll go in.

1028
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,364
-What are you doing?
-Oppa, what are you doing?

1029
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,907
-Hey, Oppa!
-Let's go.

1030
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,535
How is he
not scared of anything?

1031
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,370
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1032
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,163
Let's go.

1033
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,170
-Are you really okay? Oh, gosh.
-I'm okay.

1034
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,463
We're almost there.

1035
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,633
THE OCEAN IS MINUS 13 DEGREES CELSIUS,
BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY

1036
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,802
Let's go up. Come on.

1037
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,803
Up. Up.

1038
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,142
You okay?

1039
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:24,104
IN THE END, THEY LEFT

1040
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,483
THE THREE

1041
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,819
WHO WERE ABANDONED

1042
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,822
REMAIN

1043
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,662
THE SURVIVORS ENDED UP
WITH DIFFERENT FATES ONCE AGAIN

1044
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,414
-Come on, please. We have to go back.
-Sir.

1045
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,957
-Hey! Let go!
-Come on!

1046
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,542
-Go back! Please!
-Hold on!

1047
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,044
Did you not see just now?
There were zombies over there.

1048
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,213
So what are these zombie, huh?

1049
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,506
You haven't seen them yet?

1050
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,051
I don't know. I've just come back
from a week-long fishing trip.

1051
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,511
-Then he wouldn't know.
-He doesn't know.

1052
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,554
I don't know what zombies are,

1053
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,014
so why do you keep telling me
to let them on?

1054
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,307
Let zombies on board?

1055
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,937
-Behind you! Sir! Behind you!
-What?

1056
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,651
-Behind you!
-Oh, jeez. Come on!

1057
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,739
Why do you keep climbing onboard?

1058
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,574
I told you, this isn't your boat!

1059
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,992
Get off! Come on!

1060
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,454
THE CAPTAIN IS VERY STRONG!

1061
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:26,291
See. You people got on so, look, look,
they're all trying to get up here.

1062
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,584
No, that's not it.

1063
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,586
Jeez.

1064
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,175
It was a zombie, right?

1065
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,762
It was a zombie, right?

1066
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,431
I don't know. He's so strong.

1067
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,516
I know.

1068
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,268
He's really strong.

1069
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,186
I know.

1070
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,522
I think we'll be okay if we stay with him.

1071
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,775
-Let's stay quiet for now.
-Should we?

1072
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,443
After all, we did survive.

1073
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,614
We can go and then
come back and rescue them.

1074
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,615
THEY DECIDE TO STAY QUIET…

1075
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,210
What?

1076
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,254
They're opening the gate.

1077
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,472
Wait.

1078
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,434
Oh, no! Shoot!

1079
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,020
After everything we did to escape them.

1080
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,230
Hey!

1081
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,945
Huh? What's that? Oh!

1082
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,909
-What's that?
-What is that?

1083
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,299
It's a bus!

1084
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,466
-Here, here! This way!
-What?

1085
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,635
-Here, here! We're over here!
-Sir!

1086
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,512
-Over here!
-He's coming!

1087
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,060
-Over here!
-Please open the door!

1088
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,812
-Please open the door!
-Let's go, let's go!

1089
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,107
-Unni, you go first.
-Come on. Hurry.

1090
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,866
Oh, gosh.

1091
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,284
Oh, gosh.

1092
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,662
There are passengers here.

1093
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,873
There are still few survivors.

1094
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,044
-Thank you.
-Sorry I'm a little late.

1095
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,420
Kim Sal-man, right?

1096
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,923
-What?
-Huh? Hello.

1097
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,592
Aren't you Sal-man's people?

1098
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,594
-Sal-man?
-What? Sal-man's people?

1099
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,472
This is what the reporter
must have been talking about.

1100
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,640
-What?
-The reporter.

1101
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,058
He was talking about this bus.

1102
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,100
Not the boat?

1103
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,310
Then…

1104
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,228
-What did they get on?
-Where did they go?

1105
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,813
This is what we were supposed to take?

1106
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:02,155
I have the coordinates for the boat
that will let you move around…

1107
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,203
THEY WERE COORDINATES FOR A BUS?!

1108
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,163
Hey, hey, you young folks!

1109
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,331
Come here. Come here.

1110
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,626
-Why?
-Well…

1111
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,003
I've been thinking…

1112
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,588
Here. Put these on first.

1113
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,715
Yeah, go on.

1114
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,258
-This too. Put them on.
-Me too?

1115
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,344
Yes. Put them on. Put them on.

1116
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,720
Yes, go on.

1117
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,263
Yes, that's it.

1118
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,348
THIS WASN'T A RESCUE BOAT!

1119
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,308
It fits you perfectly. Good.

1120
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,936
Let's go catch fish!

1121
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,145
Wait. Wait.

1122
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,398
-What?
-Reporter Kim Sal-man…

1123
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,649
Kim Sal-man?

1124
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,984
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1125
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,027
Who the heck is Kim Sal-man?

1126
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,238
How am I supposed to know him?

1127
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,572
You don't know him?

1128
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,866
No, I don't. I don't know him.

1129
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,326
Okay. Let's go!

1130
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,953
Man, I like these kids.

1131
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,329
No way.

1132
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,084
Are… are we on the wrong boat?

1133
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,879
Please…

1134
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,927
We really almost died.

1135
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,679
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

1136
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,596
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

1137
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,432
-Wherever it is, we're there.
-Let's go.

1138
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,933
-As quickly as we can.
-Thank you.

1139
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,939
Huh? Huh?

1140
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,108
-Anywhere but here… What's going on?
-Sir?

1141
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,611
-Where are we going?
-You're heading into the ocean?

1142
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,530
-Sir!
-Sir! Where are you going?

1143
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,698
-The seat belt.
-Wait!

1144
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,658
-What?
-Sir!

1145
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,410
Wait! Sir!

1146
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,139
-What the heck? Wow.
-We're going back into the water?

1147
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,311
-What? This wasn't just a bus?
-Wow.

1148
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,606
THIS IS

1149
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,399
THE REAL

1150
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,484
RESCUE BOAT

1151
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,652
I've never been on
something like this.

1152
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,613
I've never seen
something like this.

1153
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,990
-Wow! This is amazing!
-Are we floating?

1154
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,075
Wow.

1155
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,623
-We are in the ocean.
-We really made it.

1156
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,834
-What? We aren't sinking?
-We really made it!

1157
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,753
-We made it!
-We made it!

1158
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,005
-We made it.
-Bye!

1159
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,341
-It's been so tough, really.
-Hey! We're going.

1160
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,635
Man, I'm getting emotional.

1161
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,011
We really almost died.

1162
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,475
What about Hong-chul
and Na-rae and Kkwachu?

1163
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,685
-I know.
-It would have been nice

1164
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,354
-if they'd come with us.
-Did anyone see them?

1165
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,772
Wait, but…

1166
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,398
Are you really that clumsy?

1167
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,234
SHE LET OUT THE WORDS
SHE'S BEEN DYING TO SAY!

1168
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,236
-Listen…
-I mean, why couldn't you climb up?

1169
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,905
My body felt so heavy back there.
Like so--

1170
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,324
To be honest,
I really resented you at the time.

1171
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,868
-But now…
-But you're the reason we're on this boat.

1172
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,205
-Can you believe it?
-I really… I really felt so sorry.

1173
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,332
You have no idea,
but we're on the right boat.

1174
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,416
How lucky are we?

1175
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,295
Wait. So, what boat
did DinDin and Tsuki get on then?

1176
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,547
I know.

1177
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,048
KIM SAL-MAN

1178
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:08,967
Man.

1179
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,804
We're doomed.

1180
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,392
"The Atlantic… Atlantic Tuna"?

1181
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,103
Is that the guy's name? "Atlantic"?

1182
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,771
"Tuna"?

1183
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,024
We have to go catch maguro.

1184
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,026
-"Maguro."
-What? Maguro?

1185
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,153
Maguro?

1186
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,737
We are?

1187
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,574
We're screwed.

1188
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,868
"Atlantic…"

1189
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,124
It has been 61 hours
since the zombie outbreak began.

1190
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,210
Lee Si-young,

1191
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,421
Patricia,

1192
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,882
Dex,

1193
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,426
Tsuki,

1194
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,054
DinDin survived.

1195
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,605
1 YEAR LATER

1196
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,654
Eat this.

1197
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:56,866
Don't be picky.

1198
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,440
Even better.

1199
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:53,590
ZOMBIEVERSE
