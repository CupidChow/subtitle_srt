1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,010
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,363
Look over there.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,906
My goodness.

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,241
Hee-kwan died.

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,367
-Where?
-The top right.

8
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,123
Yoo Hee-kwan's death has been confirmed.

9
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,713
Throw these to lure them with the sound.

10
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,006
Bring some with you.

11
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,391
-Let's go and bring her back.
-What?

12
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,768
Let's go and bring her back.

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,321
-They caught him.
-Who?

14
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,530
He got bitten!

15
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,373
Na-rae, I need to go.

16
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,627
Na-rae got caught. Somebody come with me.

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,888
The zombies are unconcerned.

18
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,014
Let's get out of here.

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,601
We have water and food already.

20
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,686
There's no point
in sacrificing more people here.

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,315
MANY WERE KILLED
WHILE SECURING SURVIVAL SUPPLIES

22
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,610
THEY MUST ESCAPE THIS PLACE
TO PREVENT FURTHER LOSSES

23
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,113
-Sir, where is the exit?
-How can we get out?

24
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,032
You can take that middle route.

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,202
There's also another exit
near the camping section.

26
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,413
THERE ARE 2 WAYS OUT
OTHER THAN THE MAIN ENTRANCE

27
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,665
And I noticed

28
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,876
zombies can't come closer
if we use the carts.

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,004
So we should stand back-to-back
using the carts.

30
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,465
The stronger people
should pair up and push.

31
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,218
It'd be better for Na-rae
to go with some strong men.

32
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,137
-I agree.
-She can walk between them.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,431
TO INCREASE THEIR CHANCE OF SURVIVAL,
THEY WILL DIVIDE THE FOOD

34
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,183
AND MOVE AS TWO TEAMS

35
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,060
Hey…

36
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,353
-They're coming.
-Let's go.

37
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,981
They're coming.

38
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,023
We should go.

39
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,279
-The door…
-Help him.

40
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,613
-Lock it.
-Help him.

41
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,784
-How will we get out?
-It's insane.

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,077
Let's keep it down.

43
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,038
They may go somewhere else then.

44
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,500
-If you're leaving, wrap your arms.
-Let's do that.

45
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,043
-Everyone should.
-Let's do that.

46
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,633
I saw them biting Hee-kwan's back earlier.

47
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,302
Goodness.

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,345
We used it all up.

49
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,724
They're quieting down.

50
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,601
We should get out now.

51
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,394
Let's go. Let's survive this.

52
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,688
Let's briefly pay
a silent tribute to Hee-kwan.

53
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,189
-Shall we?
-He was one of us.

54
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,816
Will you start us off?

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,568
A moment of silence.

56
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,660
If I get bitten,
I'll come get you as a zombie.

57
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,205
They're doing great.

58
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,712
RIP HEE-KWAN
WE'LL REMEMBER YOUR SMILE FOR A LONG TIME…

59
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,590
At ease.

60
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,092
Let's survive and meet again.

61
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,137
Let's survive until the end
and meet again.

62
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,026
Should I bring that bottle?

63
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,778
I'm going to.

64
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,029
Yes, bring it.

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,369
Anyone want to go first?

66
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,828
I guess no one would.

67
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,456
Let's go toward the camping section.

68
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,434
We need to go up there.

69
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:47,203
OH, NO! HE STEPPED ON A TOY
THAT MAKES NOISE

70
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,540
HE EXITS IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENTERING

71
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,626
PLEASE KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,169
Darn it.

73
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,064
DinDin, watch your arms.

74
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,400
-Block and push.
-Push.

75
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,526
-Come on.
-We can do it!

76
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,694
We can do it!

77
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,488
Push!

78
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,782
-Come on.
-Push.

79
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,577
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,870
Go away!

81
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,829
-Go away!
-No!

82
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,130
Oh, my.

83
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,803
We did it!

84
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,972
-I'll go now.
-Be careful.

85
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,475
Goodness!

86
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,065
They're touching me.

87
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,738
Shit, let go.

88
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,822
-We can't get out.
-No?

89
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,616
-Go. Go first.
-Go.

90
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,493
This way! Hurry!

91
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,119
It's Hee-kwan!

92
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,662
-Oh, no!
-Hurry.

93
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,456
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

94
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,124
-Which way?
-Hurry.

95
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,794
-Oh, no! Hurry!
-Hurry.

96
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,670
Na-rae, hurry.

97
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,175
Come on, Na-rae.

98
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,802
Come on!

99
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,888
THE AUTOMATIC DOOR ISN'T OPENING

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,056
Push them away.

101
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,767
Push them away.

102
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,647
A PHYSICAL FIGHT IS UNAVOIDABLE!

103
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,732
No!

104
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,781
-Hong-chul!
-Let's go.

105
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,203
-We have to go.
-Let's go, Tsuki.

106
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,664
Let's go. Hurry.

107
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,258
Dex.

108
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,009
Dex.

109
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,013
THE LONG-HAIRED ZOMBIE
THAT KEPT GETTING HIT BY JONATHAN ALL DAY…

110
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,933
FINALLY HAS A CHANCE TO GET REVENGE

111
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,562
-No!
-I'm sorry!

112
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,730
They're going out of control.

113
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,566
Come this way.

114
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,110
Open the door!

115
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,864
EX-SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER DEX
BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN

116
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,282
Get out!

117
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,784
It's open!

118
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,998
It wasn't an automatic door.

119
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,875
No, it wasn't. We needed to open it.

120
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,544
-Is your leg okay?
-Yes.

121
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,753
My gosh.

122
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,465
STAR MART
CUSTOMER PARKING ONLY

123
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,259
DELIVERY AVAILABLE

124
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,519
There's a zombie over there.

125
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,653
A new location has been discovered.

126
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,080
STAR MART CUSTOMER REST AREA

127
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,874
We need to find the other team.

128
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,917
Lower your body.

129
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,757
Keep it down.

130
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,758
Are you okay?

131
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,260
-Did anyone get bitten?
-Hey.

132
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,553
There are so many of them.

133
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,057
What's going on?

134
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,767
What's going on?

135
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,525
What's happening?

136
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,656
What's going on?

137
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,533
Are they okay?

138
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,785
-They're limping.
-Someone's here.

139
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,039
My goodness.

140
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,753
My goodness.

141
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,145
PARKING LOT BEHIND THE SUPERMARKET

142
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,148
A GRAVEYARD FOR THOSE
WHO COULDN'T GET AWAY

143
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,159
NOSTALGIC RICE PUFFS

144
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,829
-Let's go hide.
-Go inside.

145
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,872
-Go in.
-Come on.

146
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,749
Put this down.

147
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,042
Let's sit down.

148
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,211
We all survived, right?

149
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,671
Let me take this off.

150
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,881
-Wait. Where's our food?
-Right. One second.

151
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,091
-Where's the cart?
-What?

152
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,802
The cart was gone
by the time I came to my senses.

153
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,971
-I'm sorry.
-We were rushing over.

154
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,348
We abandoned the carts.
We would've died otherwise.

155
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,017
But we went inside to get those.

156
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,893
-We…
-That's why we left.

157
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,811
We almost died.

158
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,771
We almost died. We had no choice.

159
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,691
-We at least have some water and stuff.
-Great.

160
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,068
-These are great.
-Great.

161
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,403
I brought these.

162
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,946
-What is it?
-I brought these.

163
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,781
I put them in here.

164
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,617
Darn it.

165
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,285
You brought toilet bowl cleaners.

166
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,996
SHE MUST'VE SLIGHTLY
WET HER PANTS FROM FEAR

167
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,414
She got toilet bowl cleaners.

168
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,583
Good job.

169
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,086
At least we got something.

170
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,422
Hey, look. There are car keys.

171
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,257
4 CAR KEYS WERE LEFT
AT THE CUSTOMER REST AREA

172
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,092
This is the customer rest area.

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,218
There are cars.

174
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:42,600
THERE MAY BE AN OPERABLE CAR HERE

175
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,147
THEY REMEMBER
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPORTATION

176
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,982
-What's this?
-What's that?

177
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,359
-Daewoo.
-It's an old model.

178
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,069
There are different car models.

179
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,278
We have to try the keys.

180
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,696
-This one's Hyundai.
-We can guess by the model.

181
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,614
This one's also Hyundai.

182
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,282
I didn't see a Daewoo out there.
Where are they?

183
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,623
THE DOCTOR EXAMINES THE CAR SITUATION

184
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,554
A TOTAL OF 19 CARS CONFIRMED

185
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,765
There are so many cars, right?

186
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,226
We can hide behind the cars to avoid them.

187
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,394
If it gets dangerous,

188
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
-Someone should lure them.
-someone can make noise.

189
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,147
I checked them out.

190
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,149
They're mostly Hyundai cars.

191
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,735
Except the fourth one
is an old Daewoo Tosca.

192
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,112
There's just one.

193
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,155
-Is someone going out there now?
-I am.

194
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,866
Jonathan, Dex, and me. The three of us.

195
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,992
All four of you go?

196
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,202
-No, you can't.
-No.

197
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,412
All four of us go?

198
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,746
-No, you can't.
-No.

199
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,957
-We shouldn't.
-Hong-chul and I'll find a car.

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,500
HONG-CHUL HAS BEEN PICKED TO GO FIRST

201
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,751
-What?
-You'll go first?

202
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,253
He took off his jacket. Let's go.

203
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,463
-Yes. Go, Hong-chul.
-You should go.

204
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,798
Let's go.

205
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,550
Hong-chul would be the best.

206
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,343
-Go for it.
-Hong-chul, go for it.

207
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,594
You're 12 years older than me.

208
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,929
-I'm in the back.
-You ride motorcycles.

209
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,390
-Hong-chul, you go get backpacks.
-We go first?

210
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,184
COME TO THINK OF IT,
HE WAS ALWAYS FORCED TO VOLUNTEER

211
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,854
FIDGETING

212
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,439
Hong-chul, let's go.

213
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,274
-It doesn't work.
-It's not a smart key.

214
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,193
IT NEEDS TO BE OPENED MANUALLY

215
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,784
STAR MART
CUSTOMER PARKING ONLY

216
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,412
The quest begins.

217
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,457
ESCAPE THE PARKING LOT
SECURE AN ESCAPE VEHICLE

218
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:36,839
THEY NEED TO FIND A CAR THAT WORKS
WITH THE 4 REMAINING KEYS

219
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:43,053
ESCAPE THE PARKING LOT:
FIND THE RIGHT CAR, START THE ENGINE

220
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,683
This way.

221
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,935
Over there.

222
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,439
No, go straight.

223
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,523
Go around that way.

224
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,610
Go straight.

225
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,868
-Stay safe, Hong-chul.
-Okay. Be careful.

226
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,869
That way.

227
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,211
Let's go.

228
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,761
Hong-chul, go now.

229
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,821
Hong-chul.

230
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,032
Over there. Go quickly.

231
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,784
Get going.

232
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,044
HE BEGINS CRAWLING
THROUGH THE WIDE-OPEN PARKING LOT!

233
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,420
What are you doing?

234
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,597
Hong-chul's crawling.

235
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,110
Strange behavior has been detected.

236
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,488
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY HE'S DOING THIS?

237
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,618
Just go. There's no one there.

238
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,833
It's dangerous.

239
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,670
He's running.

240
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,225
HE EXITS WITHIN 50 SECONDS

241
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,977
It won't work.

242
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,604
-It won't work.
-We're in trouble.

243
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,771
Which way should I go?

244
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,690
DinDin went over there by himself.

245
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,697
My goodness.

246
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,953
Hong-chul abandoned Dex, didn't he?

247
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,247
He did. I'm sure of it.

248
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,208
-It's going as we expected.
-What?

249
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,629
AT THIS RATE,
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO AVOID CRITICISM

250
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,555
Oh, no. Will he be all right?

251
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,817
THE SCAREDY-CAT GOES TO SAVE DINDIN!

252
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,455
Oh, no, Hong-chul.

253
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,248
-Goodness.
-He's in trouble!

254
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,604
HE DREW THEIR ATTENTION
BUT IS NOW SURROUNDED BY ZOMBIES

255
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,620
Hurry while Hong-chul is there.

256
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,920
THEY ALL HEAD OUT
WHILE THE ZOMBIES' EYES ARE ON HONG-CHUL

257
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,008
Darn it.

258
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,562
One, two…

259
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,318
BLACK, WHITE

260
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,070
HONG-CHUL

261
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,121
NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR A HANDSHAKE

262
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,042
Jeez.

263
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,752
Darn it.

264
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,763
HE FINDS AN UNLOCKED CAR

265
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,434
A ZOMBIE PASSENGER WELCOMES HIM!

266
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,191
BINGO! HE FINALLY FINDS A CAR
THAT WORKS WITH THE KEY

267
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,942
Which one? The silver one.

268
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,454
THIS TIME, A ZOMBIE WELCOMES HIM
FROM THE BACK SEAT

269
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,830
Fuck.

270
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,376
AS PLAYFUL AS A DING-DONG DITCH!

271
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,355
DEX FINDS A CAR THAT OPENS WITH HIS KEY

272
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,210
THE CAR WON'T START

273
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,589
THE BATTERY SEEMS TO BE DEAD

274
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,174
Shit.

275
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,638
Black car. White car.

276
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,142
Are they all right?

277
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,021
HIS MIND AND BODY ARE SUFFERING
FROM TOO MANY HANDSHAKE REQUESTS

278
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,314
Damn it.

279
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,242
DOING YOGA TO CALM HIS MIND

280
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,581
Draw their attention. He's in danger.

281
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,501
HE DIDN'T MEAN HERD THEM LIKE COWS

282
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,211
No, come out.
Hong-chul is about to get killed.

283
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,424
…PROBABLY BEST IF HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

284
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
OH, NO… HE'S LACKING IN CORE STRENGTH

285
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,142
No, quickly…

286
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,352
Hey! What the hell?

287
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,731
Hey!

288
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,816
Help him! Jonathan, help him now.

289
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,777
Throw it over there.

290
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,447
It didn't make noise.

291
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,781
THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL

292
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,226
Wait. Everyone, come back.

293
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,185
Come back.

294
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,269
Come back.

295
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,146
KKWACHU HYUNG ORDERS THEM TO RETREAT

296
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,483
We need an interim check.

297
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,068
Which ones opened?

298
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,195
A strategy meeting. Everyone, come inside.

299
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,822
My goodness. Good work.

300
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,033
-Wait.
-Why didn't you come down?

301
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,744
-That was so terrifying.
-Why didn't you come down?

302
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,955
Where is Si-young?

303
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,165
-I know.
-She went to the back.

304
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,333
-What?
-Is she alone?

305
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,918
-Let's bring her back.
-Oh, no.

306
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,545
-Have we checked all of these?
-I'll watch from the top.

307
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,813
Let's bring back Si-young.

308
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,815
Where is Si-young?

309
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,234
What the hell?

310
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,863
THE FIRST ONE TO RUN AWAY
3 TIMES IN A ROW!

311
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,375
SHE IS CORNERED

312
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,626
There she is. Hurry.

313
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,935
Divert their attention.

314
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,688
Draw their attention to the right.

315
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,608
DEX FOLLOWS ORDERS AND ENTERS THE AREA

316
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,038
WITNESSING THE LAST REAL MAN OF THIS ERA

317
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,548
Divert their attention.

318
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,299
Jonathan, draw it to the left.

319
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,218
This way. Distract them.

320
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,479
Everyone, come in.

321
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,735
You did well.

322
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,655
It's good to keep watch from up there.
Take out the keys.

323
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,366
LOOKING LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER
WHEN HE DIDN'T DO MUCH

324
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,659
Which ones did you open?

325
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,495
There are zombies in the remaining two.

326
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,330
Where? Which ones?

327
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,874
On the far right.

328
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,834
-Here?
-On the far right.

329
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,752
-You mean this one.
-Yes, that one.

330
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,177
None of these work.

331
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,386
I checked all of them.

332
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,598
THEY RISKED THEIR LIVES
BUT ONLY MANAGED TO CHECK THREE CARS

333
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,974
If you look out there,

334
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,686
there's a car that has
a dead body leaning against it.

335
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,397
THEY COULDN'T CHECK ONE CAR
BECAUSE A DEAD BODY IS LEANING ON IT

336
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,652
But I think there are too many zombies
for us to get to that car.

337
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,029
This just came to me.

338
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,406
-Those boards that we stood on?
-The pallets?

339
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,241
PALLET: BOARD FOR MOVING GOODS
WITH A FORKLIFT

340
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,826
KKWACHU HYUNG USED IT AS A WATCHTOWER

341
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,245
Two people should hold it up.

342
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,916
-You hold it up in front?
-If you and I hold it like this and block,

343
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,417
we'll be invincible.

344
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,586
But can we even carry that?

345
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,338
Let's try. If it works, four people…

346
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,007
-It must be very heavy.
-Which car are we targeting?

347
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,675
-The one at the very end.
-This one here.

348
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,636
Next to the Santa Fe…

349
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,271
IT'S PRETTY HEAVY,
EVEN FOR AN ADULT MAN (ABOUT 20 KG)

350
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,524
We can't carry that.

351
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,776
We really can't.

352
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,944
It's about 20 kg.

353
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,988
You can't move while carrying it.

354
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,448
-You can't?
-It's very heavy.

355
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,492
-It's about 25 to 40 kg.
-It's dangerous.

356
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,535
Wouldn't we be able to carry 25 kg?

357
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,746
But we have to keep moving
while carrying it.

358
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,957
-Why can't we?
-The cart… It's too heavy.

359
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,541
THE FRUSTRATED BOXER GOES HERSELF

360
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,002
-Take a look here. Which one?
-I…

361
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,922
This one is a Santa Fe,
and that's a SsangYong, so it won't work.

362
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm saying we can go like this.

363
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,136
THAT'S POSSIBLE?

364
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,263
So it's possible.

365
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,681
You can hold it up like this.

366
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,599
WE'RE NOT ALL WARRIORS…

367
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,185
Then four people can go like this.

368
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,020
Then it should be Si-young, Dex…

369
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,939
-I can go.
-Jonathan…

370
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,107
Hong-chul…

371
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,859
HE'S TOO EXHAUSTED TO EVEN RESPOND

372
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,362
Then first, this is our target.

373
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,197
-The middle part.
-The black car.

374
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,282
The black car.

375
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,033
We have to go there.

376
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,827
But there will be a small blind spot

377
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,537
-going in with a pallet.
-Okay.

378
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,081
The men should climb up somewhere high,

379
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,542
like Si-young did earlier,
and draw their attention.

380
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,004
And you pass through. I'll keep watch.
Then we can divert their attention.

381
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,756
But he's all talk.

382
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,050
-Seriously. What are you doing?
-Where I was standing.

383
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,094
-You go up.
-He's all talk.

384
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,887
-It's so safe there.
-I can't believe him.

385
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,306
-But…
-He talks and talks, and…

386
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,933
What you said is true, but still.

387
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,435
Do you want to do it?

388
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,520
-Okay, fine.
-It's not like we're nutcrackers.

389
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,772
SHE MEANT PUPPETS, NOT NUTCRACKERS

390
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,401
The quest begins again.

391
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,695
THE QUEST RESUMES
SECURE AN ESCAPE VEHICLE

392
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,618
HE CLAIMS THE EASIEST POST AGAIN

393
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,704
Tsuki is going.

394
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,705
THESE TWO ARE IN CHARGE OF
AGGRAVATING THEM

395
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,664
The two are going?

396
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,082
No. You're going too.

397
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,417
I have to go too?

398
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,546
They're all scattered.
We shouldn't move now.

399
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,964
Be quiet!

400
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,966
There's no one there.

401
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,025
HE'S MORE SKILLFUL
NOW THAT HE'S DONE IT ONCE BEFORE

402
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,748
-Join them, Jonathan.
-Someone draw their attention over there.

403
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,837
No, not on that car.

404
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,305
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE WENT ON THE CAR
NEXT TO THE TARGET CAR

405
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,599
I hate this!

406
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,768
Come on, Tsuki.
Why did you go on that one?

407
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,939
I hate this!

408
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,360
What do we do? Help her.

409
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,071
Why did she go there? What do we do?

410
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,913
What do I do?

411
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,379
Damn it.

412
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,481
Hey, don't come near me!

413
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,859
Hey, get away from me!

414
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,235
THE THREE-POLE SYSTEM IS COMPLETE

415
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,112
Mom!

416
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,448
They're all scattered. Now's our chance.

417
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,866
Hurry and check the door!

418
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,534
Mom!

419
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,453
Hey, don't come near me! Go away!

420
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,246
THEY USE THE CONFUSION
TO CHECK THE LAST CAR

421
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,045
Darn it.

422
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,562
Patricia needs help.

423
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,775
Draw their attention.

424
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,068
IT'S CHAOS BOTH ON AND IN THE CAR

425
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,989
Stop that!

426
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,661
Don't come near me!

427
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,622
THE THREE POLES ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE

428
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:59,047
They're climbing up!

429
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,298
-No!
-Hey!

430
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,800
Hey, they're climbing up!

431
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,306
Please. No!

432
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,099
Hey, they're climbing up!

433
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,727
Hey, they're climbing up!

434
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,771
Hey, don't bite me!

435
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,314
I have to press them down.

436
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,275
They're climbing up!

437
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,446
My goodness! Please!

438
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,697
Please!

439
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,784
Mom!

440
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,328
Mom!

441
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,291
Rice puffs!

442
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,464
Oh, my God! What was that?

443
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,307
Hey, you bastards!

444
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,435
Rice puffs are a legitimate business.

445
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,398
THEY THOUGHT MR. RICE PUFF FLED
AFTER GETTING ANNOYED

446
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,527
THEY THOUGHT HE HAD DIED,
BUT HE WAS JUST HIDING QUIETLY

447
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,820
Oh, my God! What was that?

448
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,533
What? Is it Mr. Rice Puff?

449
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,911
Hey, you bastards!

450
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,913
They're attracted to the sound of the pop.

451
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,373
Get away now!

452
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,419
THEY ESCAPE THANKS TO MR. RICE PUFF

453
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,503
Hey, please.

454
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,923
-Help me!
-Rice puffs!

455
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,009
Rice puffs!

456
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,650
Why is Mr. Jung…

457
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,956
Be careful.

458
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,419
Why are you here? Let's go together.

459
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,004
-No.
-You must come with me.

460
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,422
Why did you come here?

461
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,343
It's okay. We're all here together.

462
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,761
So don't be scared.

463
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:14,057
AMONG THE SURVIVORS,
ONLY TSUKI SAID KIND WORDS TO HIM

464
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,184
Get in the car and go!

465
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,895
-Please come with me.
-No.

466
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,314
-You have to come with me.
-It's too late for me.

467
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,859
Okay?

468
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,196
Go now. Hurry.

469
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,114
Go now.

470
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,251
THEY STILL HAVE A JOB TO DO
EVEN DURING THE EMOTIONAL MOMENT

471
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,507
Did you try it?

472
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,439
I didn't get bitten, did I?

473
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

474
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,236
NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH

475
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,029
They can climb up.

476
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,948
-Wow.
-I was so shocked.

477
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,116
They evolve.

478
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,743
I went to Mr. Jung's truck.

479
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,246
And I asked him to come with me.

480
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,749
But he said he'd been bitten already.
There was a wound on his leg.

481
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,459
He told me to leave.

482
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,585
-I found it.
-You startled me.

483
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,962
-I found the car.
-Good job.

484
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,088
-Which car?
-I found it.

485
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,172
-Where?
-Which one?

486
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,841
On the far right. 5209.

487
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,217
-Where?
-5209?

488
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,261
-Number 5209?
-All the way on the right.

489
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,138
-Right next to the entrance.
-The truck?

490
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,327
Okay.

491
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,413
Quest complete.

492
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,458
An escape vehicle has been secured.

493
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,501
-Did you find the car?
-Yes, we did.

494
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,295
-Which one?
-Where is DinDin?

495
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,255
DinDin needs to come. Where is he now?

496
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,803
What if they come hearing the sound?

497
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,264
-The engine is too loud.
-I know.

498
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,432
THE ENGINE IS LOUDER THAN EXPECTED

499
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,036
The car is moving.

500
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,287
-Really?
-Yes.

501
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,289
What?

502
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,959
-Tsuki is inside.
-It's that car.

503
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,462
-The one at the end with a cover.
-The blue truck.

504
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,173
The car is blocked.

505
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,134
-We can't get out.
-What do we do?

506
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,053
Do we need to push them?

507
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,640
The car is moving.
The two of them are inside.

508
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,974
DinDin is driving it.

509
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,939
THEY'RE ATTRACTING
ALL THE ZOMBIES IN THE PARKING LOT

510
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,445
Are they coming?

511
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,240
-They're coming. What do we do?
-Is it because of the sound?

512
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,908
They're all coming. What do we do?

513
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,535
Wait a second. Stay still.

514
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,289
I'll turn the engine off.

515
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,261
-I think they can see us.
-I think they can see us.

516
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,680
They can see us.

517
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,057
Let's tape this.

518
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,392
The window might break.

519
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,521
Hey, they're in trouble.
All the zombies are shaking the car.

520
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,192
-They can see us.
-Let's cover the windows.

521
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,321
-Hurry.
-I'll tape it like this.

522
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,913
-They can't see us if we tape this up.
-Right.

523
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,582
Okay, I got it.

524
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,127
-This might break.
-Oh, no. The windows might break.

525
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,587
No!

526
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,968
-They might break.
-What do we do?

527
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:29,854
-If we tape it up like this,
-Exactly.

528
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,063
they calm down.

529
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,523
THEY ESCAPE DANGER BY HIDING

530
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,858
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

531
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,444
-Did they leave?
-Do you have another?

532
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,112
-Yes.
-Give me the tape.

533
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,947
-The problem is…
-Yes?

534
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,534
-We can't back out.
-I know.

535
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,953
We can't see in front of us either.

536
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,251
-For now…
-Yes.

537
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,795
-Let's go explain the situation.
-Okay.

538
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,758
Come on.

539
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,594
Run.

540
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,970
They came out of the car.

541
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,349
Does the engine work?

542
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,184
The car was moving.

543
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,019
The engine is fine and the car works.

544
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,605
But we can't get out. The back…

545
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,650
The truck is blocked in.
So we can't get out.

546
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,278
No other cars work.

547
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,405
All sides are blocked.

548
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,951
-Right. We can't even push them.
-They wouldn't move.

549
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,369
We can't get it out, can we?

550
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,995
No, we can't.

551
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,038
There is no path.

552
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,831
-Darn it.
-Jeez.

553
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,042
-DinDin worked the hardest.
-I agree. He did.

554
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,460
DinDin was so fast.

555
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,129
We just need to get out.

556
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,382
It's blocked, but we just need to get out.

557
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,677
-Let me go look at it one more time
-You go.

558
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,845
and find a route.

559
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,347
-We should take a look.
-Yes.

560
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,015
-Go now.
-The shortest route.

561
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,809
Or the hardest route for zombies.

562
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,935
I'll go with you.

563
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,191
The back of the truck is open,
so we can all get on.

564
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,026
-How many can it carry?
-We can get out.

565
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,444
Ten or even twenty people.

566
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,154
-Yes, it's possible.
-Is it a truck?

567
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,032
-It's a truck.
-The back of the truck is fully uncovered.

568
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,785
-The zombies can't get in?
-We need to keep them out.

569
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,997
We need to block them somehow.

570
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,458
But there's no way
to get the truck out of there now.

571
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,377
They went out to find a way.

572
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,546
-This one that we talked about earlier.
-Yes.

573
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,757
Move that. And lift that one
and get it out of the way.

574
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,218
-I think that will work.
-Hyung. Wait, then…

575
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,555
That. Right there.

576
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,472
That's perfect.

577
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,765
Would that work?

578
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,685
I wonder if it works. We should check.

579
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,271
-I saw that people…
-Everyone.

580
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,524
Kkwachu Hyung and I found this. Look.

581
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,694
Everyone, look carefully.
Hyung, please explain.

582
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,155
We just need to move these two to get out.

583
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,700
Look here.
We can drive in reverse all the way.

584
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,953
THEY FOUND A PATH TO DRIVE IN REVERSE
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NARROW

585
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,542
This car is parked perpendicularly.
We need to move that one.

586
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,545
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUSH IT
SINCE IT'S PARKED PARALLEL TO THE PATH

587
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,630
Move it and go down all the way.

588
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,632
And there's a car parked at an angle.

589
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,551
If we move it aside…

590
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,180
THEY'LL SECURE AN ESCAPE PATH
IF THEY CAN MOVE THIS CAR!

591
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,099
We can drive in reverse,
go around, and get out over here.

592
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,897
-We have to move it first.
-Will it move?

593
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,691
Some cars might move if we push them.

594
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,401
But some might not move.

595
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,362
-How should we move it?
-I saw something.

596
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,032
-There is a forklift there.
-Here.

597
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,575
Where did you get the key?

598
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,002
THEY KEPT PASSING BY THE FORKLIFT

599
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,715
Here's the key.

600
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,427
It's working.

601
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,556
FORKLIFT: FOR LIFTING GOODS,
LOOKS STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT A CAR

602
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,809
But who will operate the forklift?

603
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,185
Anyone know how to drive it?

604
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,770
Also, all the sides are open.

605
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,147
That's not the point.
Has anyone driven a forklift?

606
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,692
Well, no one here
has ever met zombies before, right?

607
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,486
We must try everything we can.

608
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,239
I have operating licenses
for boats and motorcycles.

609
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,866
-Really?
-Not sure if it's similar.

610
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,786
-Isn't it like this?
-There are only two pedals. No clutch.

611
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,789
-Just the brake and accelerator.
-I'm not sure if this will help.

612
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,252
I was once on a show
where Sung Hoon got his forklift license.

613
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,003
I saw him starting the forklift

614
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,297
-and operating the levers.
-How does it work?

615
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,715
Can your leg handle that?

616
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,801
No, but I can help whoever's doing it.

617
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,554
Who will drive the forklift with me?

618
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,472
I'll do it since it's parked far.

619
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,474
-The forklift?
-Then the two of us will go.

620
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,686
But Hyung, the noise from the forklift
will attract the zombies.

621
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,688
-Right.
-Is there a way to stop them?

622
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,606
They're not very bright.

623
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,109
-Right. Tell them.
-They only go forward.

624
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,569
This place over here.

625
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,945
-Here and here.
-Look.

626
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,573
It looks like a triangle here.

627
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,784
Let's say we block this area.
They'll rush over here.

628
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,828
But they wouldn't go around.

629
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,038
-They'll just do this.
-They don't go around.

630
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,623
Let's block this part with carts.

631
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,792
Yes, there are a lot of carts here.

632
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,670
Let's build a barricade in a single line.

633
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,510
THEY CAN BUILD A BARRICADE
WITH THE STACKED SHOPPING CARTS

634
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,471
They'll only go straight and get trapped.

635
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,057
I think we should ask Mr. Rice Puff
to draw their attention.

636
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,350
We should ask him.

637
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,645
THEY CAN GATHER THE ZOMBIES
TO ONE PLACE USING THE LOUD POP!

638
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,108
I'll go to Mr. Rice Puff first
and ask him to make the noise.

639
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,778
If he can start popping
when we give him the signal…

640
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,573
Then when Tsuki goes to him,
they'll rush over that way.

641
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,075
-That's when we go push the car.
-We push.

642
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,245
When they all rush over,
we bring the carts and block the path.

643
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,581
SET UP BARRICADE USING CARTS

644
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,791
Simultaneously,
one person starts the forklift.

645
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,918
MOVE CAR USING FORKLIFT

646
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,337
-We'll be pressed for time.
-Tsuki needs to go first.

647
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,381
THE PLAN LOOKS PERFECT

648
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,884
Please have a few carts ready.

649
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,846
A new quest begins.

650
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,765
A NEW QUEST BEGINS
SECURE THE ESCAPE PATH

651
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,019
SECURE THE ESCAPE PATH:
REQUEST POPPING, PUSH THE CAR

652
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,439
SET UP BARRICADE USING CARTS,
MOVE CAR USING FORKLIFT

653
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,732
Here's the forklift.

654
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,070
Hong-chul, we shouldn't go now.

655
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,989
Because they'll go
after hearing the popping sound.

656
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,033
There's no cover. We'll die if they come.

657
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,494
-Right, it's completely open.
-Yes. We can't go now.

658
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,621
THEY'RE DOOMED IF THEY MOVE
BEFORE THE POPPING STARTS

659
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,339
TSUKI TRIES TO CONTACT MR. RICE PUFF

660
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,716
PLEASE, SIR

661
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,884
JUST ONE POP

662
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,177
LOUDLY, PLEASE!

663
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,564
Rice puffs!

664
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,108
THE SENSIBLE MR. RICE PUFF
UNDERSTOOD THE HAND SIGNAL!

665
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:54,196
REQUEST POPPING

666
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,241
Cross now!

667
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,951
-What do we do?
-They're going.

668
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,078
Let's go. I'll follow you.

669
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,163
-Hey, you bastards!
-There they are.

670
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,666
THEY GET TO THE MISSION LOCATION
AS MR. RICE PUFF TAKES ORDERS

671
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,961
How does it work?

672
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,963
Like this?

673
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,298
Come now.

674
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,549
Let's go.

675
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,134
-Cross now.
-What do we do?

676
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,933
Fuck. What the hell?

677
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,728
-We can push it.
-It's moving.

678
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,397
LUCKILY, THE GEAR IS IN NEUTRAL

679
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,317
PUSH THE CAR

680
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,359
Si-young, the carts.

681
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,986
Are we moving the carts?

682
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,197
THE MATADOR IS BUSY TRAINING THE ZOMBIES

683
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,574
Let's go.

684
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,409
The black car.

685
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,122
Let's put them here.

686
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,457
One more?

687
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,631
-This?
-Yes, that.

688
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,924
This is the accelerator?

689
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,262
IT'S NOT WORKING

690
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,680
-Turn it on.
-I did.

691
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,309
-This…
-This…

692
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,020
STARTLED! THE BLINKER TURNED ON!

693
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,606
What's going on with this?

694
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,235
What do we do? We need to do it quickly.

695
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,864
You move that with this one.

696
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,658
-Okay.
-We need to go forward.

697
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,618
-So this lifts it?
-Wait.

698
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,162
-How come it won't go forward?
-This goes like this.

699
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,206
THEY'RE READY TO LIFT THE CAR

700
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,374
Just go forward.

701
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,917
-Let's go.
-We can do it.

702
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,672
THEY'RE SECURING THE CARTS
SO THAT THEY DON'T SLIDE

703
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,341
-We can do it.
-How do you use this?

704
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,468
-Hey, what's wrong with this?
-Come on, hurry.

705
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,803
I'm over here!

706
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,887
They're coming.

707
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,682
I'm over here!

708
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,393
Hey!

709
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,107
They're not very bright.

710
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,192
They wouldn't go around.

711
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,569
AS EXPECTED,
THE ZOMBIES COME STRAIGHT TO THEM

712
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,490
SET UP BARRICADE USING CARTS

713
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,409
Why is it doing that?

714
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,702
-Why doesn't it work?
-That's not the one.

715
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,247
We just need to get it moving.
It's driving me crazy.

716
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,248
-What's this?
-What?

717
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,625
-It's moving.
-My goodness.

718
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,461
THEY HADN'T RELEASED THE SIDE BRAKE

719
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,547
-We got it.
-Go that way.

720
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,175
I'll work these. Just keep going.

721
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,261
Hurry.

722
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,271
They're gathering. We have to block them.

723
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,355
Come on.

724
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,025
Jonathan, over here.

725
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,616
Here we go.

726
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,244
Let's lower it a bit.

727
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,955
Lower it a little.

728
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,334
A little more. Back it up.

729
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,879
-Can it back up?
-Back it up. Be careful.

730
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,756
-Turn it that way.
-I can't back it up.

731
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,717
-I can't. Is this the reverse?
-Go to the side.

732
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,385
Turn left.

733
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,137
Turn left.

734
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,346
-It's working.
-Is it?

735
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,599
-More.
-This way.

736
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,392
We need to lower it a little.

737
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,144
Okay, that's fine.

738
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,689
Hurry up!

739
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,566
-Hurry!
-Okay.

740
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,526
Come on.

741
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,322
You got it.

742
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:26,241
-Go straight.
-Let's go.

743
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,618
It's moving.

744
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,162
-Wait.
-Hey.

745
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,791
-Hey, no.
-You can't do that.

746
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,877
OH, NO! THE CAR MIGHT FLIP OVER!

747
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,337
-Hey, no.
-You can't do that.

748
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,796
-Lower it.
-Lower it a little.

749
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,299
THE BACKUP ALARM COULD PUT THEM IN DANGER

750
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,802
-To the ground.
-Push it in more.

751
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,804
All the way to the ground. It's stuck.

752
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,767
We can't hold much longer!

753
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,310
-Push it in further.
-More.

754
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,479
-Push it in further.
-No, it's stuck. We need to lower it.

755
00:46:55,562 --> 00:47:00,067
-No, lower it to the ground first.
-Hurry!

756
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,529
Lower it. We have to lower it.

757
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,574
A ZOMBIE HEADS TOWARD KKWACHU HYUNG

758
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,701
We have to lower it. We didn't lower this.

759
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,453
-Lower it.
-How does this work?

760
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,622
-It's hitting it.
-Over there.

761
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,040
-Something to throw.
-Hurry.

762
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,962
-Hurry!
-You have to block them.

763
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:23,674
-Block them!
-Get out of here!

764
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:28,136
Hey, this isn't the right way.

765
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,222
Let me take it out. This is insane.

766
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,642
Gosh, seriously. Hey.

767
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,102
We're screwed.

768
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,815
You have to block them.

769
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,400
Get out of here!

770
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,442
Not yet.

771
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,611
-Hey, this isn't the right way.
-Run!

772
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,321
Let me take it out.

00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,698
-Hey, this isn't the right way.
-Run!

774
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,074
Let me take it out.

775
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,033
Shit!

776
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,743
Gosh, seriously. Hey.

-Hey, seriously.
-Hey!

779
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,082
-Hey!
-Hold on.

780
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,458
What do we do?

781
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,881
Hey!

782
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,925
Hey, run!

783
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,010
What do we do?

784
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,553
