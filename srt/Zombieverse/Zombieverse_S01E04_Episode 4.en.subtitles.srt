00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,352
-Get off. No!
-No!

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,895
Na-rae, I gotta go.

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,817
Na-rae!

8
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,361
What do we do?

9
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,119
Oh, no. Kkwachu Hyung!

10
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,579
What do we do?

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,456
-Kkwachu Hyung.
-Na-rae!

12
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,623
What do we do?

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,375
What do we do?

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,505
Come over to this side.

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,306
Hold on.

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,558
-This is bad.
-Why?

17
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,976
They totally caught us.

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,020
I wonder if we're okay.

19
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,730
STAR MART CUSTOMER REST AREA

20
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,899
What do we do? Hey, they're bleeding!

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,035
What? Wait, I think they got bitten.

22
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,538
We were both bitten.

23
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,833
-We got bitten. Don't come near us.
-Oh, no.

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,001
We each got bitten.

25
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,799
-Kkwachu Hyung got bitten
-Sit down.

26
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,344
-trying to save my life.
-Have a seat first.

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,638
Hey, wait.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,765
Don't sit…

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,143
Wait, stay standing.

30
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,144
Yes.

31
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,440
We only got bitten once.
Please believe us.

32
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,858
It doesn't look deep.

33
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,367

00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,041
ESCAPED DEATH

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,919
BUT THE BITTEN AREA WILL BECOME INFECTED

38
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,756
AND THE VIRUS WILL SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THEIR BODIES

39
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,723
Kkwachu Hyung's infection
has been confirmed.

40
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,861
Park Na-rae's infection
has been confirmed.

41
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,950
NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME
THEY HAVE LEFT TO LIVE

42
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,873
Do you trust us?

43
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,668
-We only got bitten once.
-Put your hands together.

44
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,462
Please put this on for us for now.

45
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,047
I'll put it on.

46
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,802
Na-rae.

47
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,637
But what happened?

48
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,306
-We fled.
-Yes.

49
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,600
As we fled… I'm sorry.

50
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,101
The carts collapsed,

51
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,353
so they all rushed over to the forklift.

52
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,814
When it collapsed, we had to flee, but…

53
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,150
-But he's the worst. Seriously.
-Wait…

54
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,068
-You said…
-Let's tie our hands together.

55
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,361
Please don't get me wrong.

56
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,863
I laugh when I get scared.

57
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,072
Do you know what he did?

58
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,867
I tried to flee.
But he pushed me like this

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,951
and shouted, "Na-rae!"

60
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,120
So the zombies all rushed toward me.

61
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,039
HE PUSHED AND PULLED TO SACRIFICE HER

62
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,206
Why did you shout?

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,293
Na-rae, I think you're talking nonsense
because you got bitten.

64
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,462
What are you talking about? You pushed me.

65
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,130
Wow, what a jerk.

66
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,592
NOW EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED,
NOT JUST A FEW

67
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,761
No, that's not what happened. Listen.

68
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,512
Na-rae and I were driving the forklift.

69
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,599
She needed to lower the forks first,

70
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,684
but she left them raised.

71
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,396
So they kept hitting the car.
So I kept saying, "Na-rae."

72
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,400
We lifted up the car,
but it wasn't centered.

73
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,194
I guess she felt rushed.

74
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,905
The car was slanted like this.

75
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,032
-I saw that.
-We couldn't block the path like that.

76
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,034
So I pulled the forks out and tried again.

77
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,078
But it lifted it up like this instead.

78
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,288
So I was so flustered,
and the zombies came.

79
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,957
-So what?
-Right, so what?

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,291
-So…
-So what?

81
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,085
-What next?
-So you abandoned me?

82
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,045
-I lowered them.
-So you abandoned me?

83
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,922
-You should've gotten off together.
-We did.

84
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,049
Honestly, I saw exactly what happened.

85
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,843
Hong-chul didn't push her
as he got off the forklift.

86
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,846
-He pushed off of her in order to get off.
-Why, you…

87
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,139
Like a springboard.

88
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,725
-Seriously?
-No, it wasn't like that. She…

89
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,104
You threw me at them.

90
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,399
SHE CAN'T HOLD BACK HER LAUGHTER

91
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,068
I couldn't help but think she got bitten.

92
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,070
She kept shouting in pain like this.

93
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,197
But I hadn't been bitten then!

94
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,074
Wait, the cable tie came undone.

95
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,826
Okay.

96
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,577
-My head hurts so much.
-More importantly,

97
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,621
we should decide what to do about that.

98
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,124
-The forklift will work now.
-The forklift works.

99
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,334
But the carts collapsed.

100
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,503
Wait, can we ask
for the rice puff pop again?

101
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,505
-But Mr. Rice Puff…
-Did he…

102
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,589
Did he pass away?

103
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,634
POPS EVERY 15 MINUTES!

104
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,803
Wait, do you know how to make rice puffs?

105
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,972
Don't talk. Be quiet.

106
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,974
Why don't I blow up your head?

107
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,978
I have something to say.
Mr. Rice Puff got bitten already.

108
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,605
And the zombies don't attack him, right?

109
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:19,902
THE ZOMBIES WHO GATHERED AT THE SOUND
DIDN'T ATTACK HIM

110
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,696
-They think he's one of them.
-Right.

111
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,906
Then maybe they wouldn't attack these two.

112
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,492
She's right. It might work, so let's…

113
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,870
Then let's be realistic.

114
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,997
Even if the zombies bite them,

115
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,166
they've already been bitten.

116
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,959
She's…

117
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,421
-If they don't bite them…
-She's worse than me.

118
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,340
SI-YOUNG IS BASICALLY ANOTHER HONG-CHUL

119
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,550
She was asking if they were okay earlier.

120
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,135
Then let's do this.

121
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,636
We don't want to force them.

122
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,474
Raise your hand if you want
the two of them to go drive the forklift.

123
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,309
What the heck is that?

124
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,353
You might think that
Si-young alone is forcing you to do it.

125
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,354
Raise your hand.

126
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,647
Did you raise your hand?

127
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,399
-You did, didn't you?
-Scratching.

128
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,151
-You did.
-I was scratching my head.

129
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,736
The two of them got bitten already.

130
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,863
Even if they go out,
they might not bite them.

131
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,740
If they do, they're already infected.

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,034
And Na-rae can drive the forklift well.

133
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,536
-Raise your hand if you want them to go.
-Can she?

134
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,288
Let's decide by a majority vote.

135
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,543
EVERYONE EXCEPT THE TWO WHO GOT BITTEN
RAISED THEIR HANDS

136
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,004
-Put your hand down. It's decided.
-Put it down.

137
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,132
-You're awful.
-It's because my head hurts.

138
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,135
If you move the car with the forklift,

139
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,804
we'll take you with us at least.

140
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,430
THERE ARE CONDITIONS
FOR THEIR SURVIVAL NOW

141
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,351
If they don't touch them when they drive
the forklift, it might be better for us.

142
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,186
If we stand them up in front of us…

143
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,064
That's nonsense. Are we human shields?

144
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,483
SHE DOESN'T HESITATE TO DISCRIMINATE

145
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,567
She's the worst.

146
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,445
-Her voice is gentle, but she's the worst.
-You want us to…

147
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,738
That's a good idea.

148
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,990
Come with us.

149
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,201
Let's escape this place together.

150
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,954
-You promise?
-I don't trust you. Dex, tell us.

151
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,748
-Hyung, come with us.
-Okay.

152
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,875
UDT soldier,
you can't go back on your word.

153
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,169
-I'll keep an eye on you.
-We'll have safety measures.

154
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,380
Okay, we're okay with that.

155
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,674
I'm so sorry.

156
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,801
-Please drive the forklift for us.
-We should've tried harder.

157
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,303
-Jeez, Ro Hong-chul.
-Seriously.

158
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,225
That car needs to be moved
for us to get out.

159
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,438
Hyung, what do we do?

160
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,605
Let's go.

161
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,065
Darn it. Wait.

162
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,110
To be honest,
Kkwachu Hyung talked too much.

163
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,486
He ordered us around.

164
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,529
Yes, he talked a lot.

165
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,575
IF YOU LEAVE,
THEY TALK ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK!

166
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,993
A NEW LESSON LEARNED!

167
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,703
They're out there. Let's look.

168
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,787
They went?

169
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,790
Stand behind me.

170
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,959
Shoot. What do we do?

171
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,919
Hyung, they're coming!

172
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,219
Hyung, they're coming!

173
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,556
No, goodbye.

174
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,143
What do we do? They're coming.

175
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,437
HE SHOWS THEM THAT THEY'RE ONE OF THEM

176
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,855
They're coming.

177
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,819
My goodness, what do we do?

178
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,696
They're going to bite us.

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,365
-What's going on?
-Hold on.

180
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,160
-What?
-Did they bite?

181
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,328
What?

182
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,042
No!

183
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,344
No, wait. They're not attacking.

184
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,846
Maybe they smell different.

185
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,265
Maybe you smell like them
after you get bitten.

186
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,226
THE INFECTED HUMANS' BLOOD
SMELLS LIKE ZOMBIES'

187
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,560
Hey, they're scattering.

188
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,187
-My goodness.
-That's good.

189
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,939
-It must be terrifying.
-They can't see them.

190
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,941
They must think they're one of them.

191
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,109
SI-YOUNG'S HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN VERIFIED!

192
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,153
Na-rae, try driving the forklift now.

193
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,281
Go slowly. Walk like a zombie.

194
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,950
Forget it. Why do we have to?

195
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,285
-I thought it'd make it more fun.
-Hyung.

196
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,412
This is great. There's hope.

197
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,581
Where'd the grape candy go?

198
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,170
Right, we need to back it up.

199
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,716
Keep going. Okay, let's lower it.

200
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,763
THE ZOMBIES ARE DRAWN
TO THE NOISE OF THE FORKLIFT

201
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,974
Move it. Let's go.

202
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,358
I hit my head.

203
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,490
Darn it. They're coming again.

204
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,658
We're fine, though.

205
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,743
They're not coming to us. So…

206
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,704
THEY LOST INTEREST
AFTER CONFIRMING THEY'RE INFECTED

207
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,749
You're so good at driving this.

208
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
A HALF-ZOMBIE DRIVES BETTER THAN A HUMAN

209
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,335
This isn't easy.

210
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,213
Take it easy.

211
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,382
We're all rooting for you.
Including your fellow zombies.

212
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,009
Is he kidding me?

213
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,392
They lifted it.

214
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,685
They did it.

215
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,729
He's the best driver among zombies.

216
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,188
Being a zombie suits him.

217
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,067
He's so cool.

218
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,319
He's so cool.

219
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,157
He's doing great.

220
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,617
-Goodness.
-That's good enough.

221
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,160
THE ESCAPE PATH IS SECURED

222
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,661
-We got it.
-Nice.

223
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,330
-Nice.
-Nice.

224
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,790
Do we really have to do this?

225
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,083
Great work.

226
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,169
They did a good job.

227
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,380
By the way,
there are some benefits of being infected.

228
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,592
Yes. We don't know when they'll turn,
but if they can maintain that…

229
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,719
I think it's okay for them
to stay with us.

230
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,348
-We secured the path now.
-Come on in.

231
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,391
First…

232
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,809
Don't applaud. It upsets me.

233
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,020
-Seriously. You're the worst, Hong-chul.
-No.

234
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,357
The balance was off
because you were driving it wrong.

235
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,276
But the two of you
no longer fear zombies, right?

236
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,570
They wondered if they should
bite us or not.

237
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,656
-I don't think we're fully zombies yet.
-We must not be.

238
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,618
-They came to us.
-I'm not lying. They came and smelled us.

239
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,912
I'm a bit nervous. Can you put this on?

240
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,955
"SAFETY MEASURES" COME TO MIND
AS THINGS ARE SOMEWHAT SETTLED

241
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,541
-I just don't want you to feel bad.
-There's a good solution.

242
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,295
-We can cut off their arms.
-What?

243
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,630
What?

244
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,881
You're all our enemies.

245
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,676
If you don't want that,
let us tie your arms for now.

246
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,136
MY GOODNESS!
HE SCARES THEM TO GET THEM TO COOPERATE

247
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,888
I'll be gentle.

248
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,098
You might turn.

249
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,432
You'd feel tormented.

250
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,642
Jeez.

251
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,018
-It doesn't hurt?
-No.

252
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,269
HE'S STILL SWEET IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS

253
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,605
If I turn, I'll bite one specific person.

254
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,564
Me too.

255
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,358
-Do it together.
-Let's set the order.

256
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,609
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-DinDin.

257
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,277
-I go left, you go right.
-Okay.

258
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
-There's a rope.
-A rope.

259
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,202
We can tie Na-rae
and Kkwachu Hyung with it.

260
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,663
SO MANY PEOPLE THE HALF-ZOMBIES COULD BITE

261
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,664
Great.

262
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,460
You said you wouldn't gag us.

263
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,920
You can still breathe.

264
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:53,963
SCARY WORDS IN A SWEET TONE

265
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,131
This is so awful.

266
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,757
-You never know.
-I feel terrible.

267
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,761
We'll untie you after monitoring you.

268
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,014
The path is clear now,
so let's carefully go that way.

269
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,824
-Get in now.
-Get in.

270
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,075
Help us get on.

271
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
-Get in.
-I got it.

272
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,414
Oh, my goodness.

273
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,291
Be careful.

274
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,959
-Put this in.
-We're all set.

275
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,422
Everyone is on board.

276
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,549
We're all good.

277
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,469
We're screwed.

278
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,971
-What's wrong?
-The thing is…

279
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,182
-I need to look at the back with this.
-Right.

280
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,475
But it's covered.

281
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,311
-I think they can see us.
-I think they can see us.

282
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,271
They can't see us if we tape this up.

283
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,315
THEY COVERED THE WINDOWS WITH NEWSPAPER

284
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,942
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE

285
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,361
-What do we do? We can't see.
-I can't see the back.

286
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,071
Should we open the back?

287
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,324
But if we open it, they'll gather.

288
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,783
Let's start the car first.

289
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,910
Okay. Got it.

290
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,881
Let's go! You got this!

291
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,716
There's a rearview camera!

292
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,638
HE SHIFTED INTO REVERSE
AND THE REARVIEW CAMERA TURNED ON!

293
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,476
THEY CAN ONLY SEE VIA THE MONITOR
AND MUST DRIVE BACKWARD

294
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,895
We can do it. We're going now.

295
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,688
We can escape.

296
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,399
The quest begins.

297
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,151
ESCAPE THE PARKING LOT
DRIVING WITH COVERED WINDOWS

298
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,028
Hold on tight!

299
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,321
Hold on tight, please!

300
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,453
-Gosh, it's too loud.
-Be careful.

301
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,706
It's too loud.

302
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,041
Be careful.

303
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,546
Nice.

304
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,846
We can only go between these two.

305
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,360
What's that sound?

306
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,529
-Did we run over someone?
-We hit other cars.

307
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,955
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

308
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,875
Darn it.

309
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,169
-My goodness.
-The side mirrors.

310
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,213
Watch your hand. Put it inside.

311
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,215
Your hand. Put it inside.

312
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,383
HIS HAND COULD'VE BEEN CUT OFF

313
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,802
-Don't hold the bars.
-Right, hold on to the rope.

314
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,890
SUCH DRIVING SKILLS
WILL RAISE HIS INSURANCE PREMIUM

315
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,100
Hey, we're stuck.

316
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,519
You have to force your way out.

317
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,521
THE OWNER OF THE TRUCK
WOULD BE DEVASTATED TO SEE THIS

318
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,441
Is it blocked?

319
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,026
It's totally stuck.

320
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,486
-We're almost out.
-We're almost there.

321
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,780
Why's he going forward? Back up.

322
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,698
Pull out!

323
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,785
-Hong-chul, hold this.
-Hey, he…

324
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,245
Let's switch drivers.

325
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,206
Switch drivers.
I had a traumatizing experience.

326
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,417
Kkwachu Hyung is a good driver.
Actually, he's not.

327
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,919
Can Si-young drive instead?

328
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,923
We, the zombies, will get off
and guide you. This isn't working.

329
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,841
WELL, IF YOU'RE OFFERING

330
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,469
-We will.
-Be honest. That's what you want, right?

331
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,929
Would that be okay?

332
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,432
DinDin, stop the car for a second.
Someone's getting off.

333
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,893
The zombies are getting off!
Don't move the car!

334
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,978
Si-young, don't call us zombies.

335
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,104
DON'T CALL THE HALF-ZOMBIES "ZOMBIES"

336
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,023
You have to pull it closed.

337
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,400
No, not that.
The two zombies are getting off now.

338
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,945
I said don't call us "the two zombies!"

339
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,572
-Call us "people."
-They're getting off. Hold on!

340
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,740
FIRST-EVER HALF-ZOMBIE VALETS!

341
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,408
Go a bit forward and to the right.

342
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,327
Pull to the right and then go.

343
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,828
Turn right as you go forward.

344
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,872
HE DOESN'T KNOW RIGHT FROM LEFT

345
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,334
That won't work.
Turn right as you go forward.

346
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,211
-Back up.
-The opposite direction.

347
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,380
Okay.

348
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,132
DinDin's driving scares me
more than the zombies.

349
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,635
-Turn the wheel as you back up.
-Turn the wheel.

350
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,387
Okay. Back up.

351
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,471
He says okay.

352
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,808
You're the best zombie valet that I know.

353
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,896
This is quite eventful.
We haven't laughed like this in a while.

354
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,149
THEY MANAGE TO LAUGH AMIDST THE CHAOS

355
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,734
Kkwachu Hyung, get in.

356
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,277
-He's back.
-Okay.

357
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,947
Wait, don't go yet.
The zombie isn't inside yet.

358
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,741
You're the best at parking
among the zombies I know.

359
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,370
The windows are covered.
He's doing a great job.

360
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,122
DinDin, you still have to go slowly.

361
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,165
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

362
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,251
The rice puffs smell so good.

363
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,131
-Are we finally leaving?
-Yes, we are.

364
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,008
Yes, we're finally leaving.

365
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,474
HE SEES A GROUP OF ZOMBIES
RUSHING OVER TO THE CAR!

366
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,569
-Hey, it's the college kids.
-No!

367
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,778
It's the college kids.

368
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,114
-No!
-It's the college kids.

369
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,491
-No!
-Push them off!

370
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,577
No!

371
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,579
What's wrong with them?

372
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,664
Hurry!

373
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,417
Rice puffs!

374
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,883
Quest complete.

375
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,676
Everyone has escaped.

376
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,561
HE'S LEFT ALONE IN THE PARKING LOT
AFTER MAKING THE FINAL RICE PUFFS

377
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,066
It's okay. We're all here together.

378
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,192
So don't be scared.

379
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,777
Okay, dear.

380
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,945
-Go!
-Please come with me.

381
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,572
No.

382
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:01,080
THE PROMISE TO ESCAPE TOGETHER
COULD NOT BE KEPT…

383
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,373
But there are zombies everywhere.

384
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,876
Are you kidding?
We're even riding here with you.

385
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,504
THEY SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM

386
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,631
You couldn't have gotten out without me!

387
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,514
I don't want to become like them.

388
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,374
THERE ARE 7 SURVIVORS AND 2 INFECTED

389
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,751
The Central Disaster Relief Headquarters

390
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,337
announced that Seoul
will be blockaded at midnight.

391
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,092
It's rapidly spreading to nearby areas
such as Eunpyeong-gu and Yongsan-gu.

392
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,719
It seems many people
have already lost their lives.

393
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,682
Since Seoul has been sealed off,

394
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,018
transit to areas outside the city
is completely restricted.

395
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,938
Cargo and shipping have also been blocked.

396
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,236
Do you know where we are?

397
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,322
No. I just kept driving
to the countryside for now.

398
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,365
Right.

399
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,245
It's similar to the countryside in Japan.

400
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,621
-Is it?
-Totally.

401
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,840
Professor, you are claiming
that they are not zombies.

402
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,633
Zombies? That's nonsense.

403
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,760
That's fiction created in movies--

404
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,388
Please, calm down for a moment.

405
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,474
What are the countermeasures
after infection?

406
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,935
There is no cure as of yet, is there?

407
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,147
Unfortunately,

408
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,193
vaccine development takes
more than ten years on average globally.

409
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,913
THERE IS NOWHERE TO HIDE
IF THEY SUDDENLY TURN INTO ZOMBIES

410
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,291
It's morning now.

411
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,881
FORTUNATELY…
THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE TURNED YET

412
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,593
Hong-chul, what are you doing?

413
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,762
Is your leg okay?

414
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,557
-You pushed her leg.
-Why did you push my leg?

415
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,934
That's my leg…

416
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,312
You've started to turn already.

417
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,483
No, I'm fine.

418
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,236
-Show me your teeth.
-I'm cold.

419
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,905
-My teeth are the same.
-DinDin, aren't you tired?

420
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,449
It's nice to come to a quiet place.

421
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,119
-We--
-Oh, come on!

422
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,748
Hong-chul, are the zombies okay?

423
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,292
They've changed.
They've become more sensitive.

424
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,294
They seem more aggressive.

425
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,504
-We're not.
-Aggressive?

426
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,130
It's all your fault!

427
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,967
You shouldn't be the one talking.

428
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,389
-A bit…
-The doctor too.

429
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,807
A bit different from earlier…

430
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,017
They're turning. We should open this now.

431
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,352
-Let me open it.
-Seriously?

432
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,020
-Because of the sunlight.
-I mean…

433
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,564
-They might not be okay with the sunlight.
-Right.

434
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,692
-We're not vampires.
-But you never know.

435
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,445
But there's nothing around here.
I think you can open up the cover.

436
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,572
-Shall we open it up?
-It's daytime now.

437
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,824
Let's get some sunlight.

438
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,535
It's nice and bright.

439
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,452
It's so nice.

440
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,829
Done on this side.

441
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,667
Is everything okay with the zombies?

442
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,210
-What now?
-The situation isn't good.

443
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,338
-This is because I overexerted myself.
-That's right.

444
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,215
My veins popped up because I got angry.

445
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,217
But eventually, you'll turn into zombies.

446
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,594
-The thing is…
-It's been six to seven hours now.

447
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,055
We did get scratched a bit.

448
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,473
Yes, it's only a scratch.

449
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,393
-No, it's not. I can see your flesh.
-It's a deep bite.

450
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,561
-It's all torn up.
-No.

451
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,022
-Their nails are long.
-They have long nails.

452
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,192
By the way, you zombies talk too much.

453
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,902
My energy level is dropping.

454
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,612
So I'm talking to recharge.

455
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,489
-What?
-You're feeling weak?

456
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,532
-Because I'm hungry.
-He's hungry.

457
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,825
-When his energy drops,
-I'm hungry.

458
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,827
-he'll be borderline.
-Because I'm hungry.

459
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,037
-A borderline zombie.
-Borderline.

460
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,455
I'm hungry. Aren't you?

461
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,789
And we're still human,

462
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,083
-so don't call us zombies. I'm sensitive.
-It's upsetting.

463
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,376
Are the zombies okay?

464
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,170
Na-rae's face is so pale.

465
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,840
You punk, if you keep calling us zombies,
you'll be the first one I kill.

466
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,592
No, listen to me.

467
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,093
We have to be rational here.

468
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,058
We can't accept zombies. No exceptions.

469
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:39,066
-Yes, he's right.
-What will we do if they turn?

470
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,987
IF THEY BITE OTHERS,
THERE WILL BE MORE ZOMBIES

471
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,658
Think about it.

472
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,535
Na-rae, this is important.

473
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,334
-This is important.
-Don't avoid it.

474
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,670
Then let's go separately.
There are two of us here.

475
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,757
-If you abandon us, we'll go our own way.
-No, don't abandon us.

476
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,551
But once you turn into zombies,
you won't go your own way.

477
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,761
You'll try to bite us.

478
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,888
-Right, you'll try to eat us.
-No.

479
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,349
-We should part before that happens.
-When they turn,

480
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,517
what will we do?

481
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,852
-But, we…
-I think we should just part.

482
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,605
But the zombies ignored us last time.

483
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,981
-You can use us then.
-Right.

484
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,029
-If you don't abandon us, I'll do that.
-Yes.

485
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,240
-Don't abandon us.
-That's why you can't abandon us.

486
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,991
-Right.
-Let's say there are lots of zombies.

487
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,869
-Who will go there?
-When that happens, tell us to go.

488
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,456
If they don't touch them,
it might be better for us.

489
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,166
If we stand them up in front of us…

490
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,628
IT MIGHT BE A BETTER DECISION
TO BRING THEM DESPITE THE RISK

491
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,798
Right.

492
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,347
In any case, let's work as a team.

493
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,557
Jonathan fled.

494
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,226
Hong-chul pushed Na-rae.

495
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,688
I think it's because
we don't have a leader.

496
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,649
That's why Kkwachu Hyung
went out there alone and got bitten.

497
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,402
He has a point.
We have no system whatsoever.

498
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,528
-He's right.
-Right.

499
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,906
Let's pick a leader now
and do as they say.

500
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,951
Let me say this honestly as an outsider.

501
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,369
-Lee Si-young.
-Me too.

502
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,579
-I agree.
-Si-young.

503
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,664
It doesn't matter if she's a woman.

504
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,083
-She's the most levelheaded.
-She's calm.

505
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,918
She's right for it. Very cool-headed.

506
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,044
Si-young has to do it.

507
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,005
She took care of Tsuki and everyone.

508
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,006
I agree.

509
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,757
-Let's decide by a majority vote.
-Okay.

510
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,509
-Raise your hand for Si-young.
-I…

511
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,637
Wait. I really don't feel confident
in being the leader.

512
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,682
I'll do my best
to support the leader as the subleader.

513
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,185
I feel a bit burdened.

514
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,187
But I really want you to be the leader.

515
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,940
-Wait. What are the qualifications?
-I get flustered when I see the zombies.

516
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,735
Someone who can lead us
so that we can survive. That's all.

517
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,528
Then I think I can do it.

518
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,696
No, not you.

519
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,991
I think Jonathan lacks experience.

520
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,701
HE HAS PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE IN FLEEING

521
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,328
-But…
-You didn't even look after your sister.

522
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,121
-He might have great judgment skills.
-Right.

523
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:02,000
But I don't think
Hong-chul should be the leader.

524
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,586
Hong-chul is definitely a future zombie.

525
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,503
I'm not.

526
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,047
Na-rae knows me well.

527
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,132
-Totally.
-I support gender equality.

528
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,425
And cosmopolitanism.

529
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,011
I don't favor any specific person to help.

530
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,804
-Everyone is on their own.
-I told you.

531
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,765
-Anyone but Hong-chul.
-What?

532
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,350
Anyone but Hong-chul.

533
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,395
As for me, even though he's young,

534
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,065
I pick Dex given his experience.

535
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,360
-And regardless, DinDin…
-Yes, DinDin.

536
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,653
But DinDin too.

537
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,155
He can't tell apart pee from poop.

538
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,282
-Be quiet!
-Dex.

539
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,826
Dex, aren't you much younger than him?

540
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,411
Dex, how old are you?

541
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,579
I'm 28.

542
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,373
You're 32, aren't you?

543
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,501
Then why do you act so tough?
You're only 28.

544
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,880
That punk kept acting tough
and talking in a deep voice. Hey!

545
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,509
-Someone like him can't be our leader.
-How old are you?

546
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,636
-Dex has the most combat experience.
-Should we vote?

547
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,804
He's objective.

548
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,889
-Right.
-He should be the leader.

549
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:02,227
He comes up with tactics
and Si-young makes the final decision.

550
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,939
So if Si-young doesn't approve something,

551
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,359
-then the leader can't force it.
-Right.

552
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,278
-Dex is the leader.
-We've decided.

553
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,612
-The subleader.
-The subleader.

554
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,406
-Then she's the subleader.
-Okay.

555
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,533
And how about DinDin be the commander?

556
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,159
-DinDin? Okay.
-Great.

557
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,204
-Because he really took action.
-Right.

558
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,039
Isn't that basically a human shield?

559
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,667
-Shield?
-You're a genius.

560
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,627
-You're our protector.
-Not at all.

561
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,005
Okay.

562
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,594
It was like a warzone back there,

563
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,596
but it's so tranquil here.

564
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,182
You suddenly feel relaxed, right?

565
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,643
That's when it can get dangerous.

566
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,396
I want to go somewhere warm
and have a meal.

567
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,898
-I'm going to faint.
-Seriously, I'm so hungry.

568
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,735
-The bag. We should eat.
-Right.

569
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,445
-That's all we have.
-Check it.

570
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,739
SI-YOUNG, THE SUBLEADER,
GUARDED THIS BAG WITH HER LIFE!

571
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,324
-We have to divide it up well.
-Seriously?

572
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,075
-Look.
-These are all delicious.

573
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,286
-There are chocolate bars.
-Grape candy too.

574
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,371
-These are all delicious.
-Green grape candy.

575
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,165
It's good that we have lots of water.

576
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,583
-How many?
-Five bottles.

577
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,502
We can barely survive
a day or two with these.

578
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,675
Leader, can I eat one?

579
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,927
You may eat just one.

580
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,763
You said you were full.

581
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,890
CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE 1ST
TO BE SCOLDED BY THE LEADER

582
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,433
He was about to get angry.

583
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,643
-We've all become too sensitive.
-But…

584
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,271
I'm 40 and asked for a piece of chocolate.

585
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,148
We had such a tough night.

586
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,692
-That's understandable.
-It was such a tough night.

587
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,362
If you eat things like these,
you'll get thirsty.

588
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,405
-That's why.
-I see. That's right.

589
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,283
Let's just eat one. That's all.

590
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,535
-There's no one around.
-Let me have one too.

591
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,703
-It's delicious.
-Okay.

592
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,290
When we get to a town,
will there be a place to rest?

593
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,334
I want to wash up.

594
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:53,546
It'll be nice to go into a house,
lock the door, and stay inside.

595
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,298
I want to wash up and eat.

596
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,884
Me too. We haven't eaten.

597
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,183
Gosh, it's so quiet here.

598
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,435
As if nothing happened.

599
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,728
It's peaceful.

600
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,648
The road is blocked ahead.

601
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,816
-It's blocked?
-It's blocked?

602
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,193
-What's going on now?
-Why is the road blocked?

603
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,028
Please stop the car here, DinDin.

604
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,446
-Wait.
-What do we do?

605
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,198
There could be zombies here then.

606
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,075
Right? That means someone's here.

607
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,077
-They abandoned the car and fled.
-Wait.

608
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,954
DinDin, stop.

609
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,249
They probably came here too,

610
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,792
-judging by that car.
-Right.

611
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,628
Right. If there was an accident,
someone was here.

612
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,088
Tsuki, what kind of car is it?

613
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,714
A Mercedes-Benz.

614
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,299
A Mercedes-Benz? Great.

615
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,135
-The one next to it?
-Looks like a delivery truck.

616
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,386
It's a delivery truck.

617
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,513
FOR GROCERIES AND CLOTHES
ROCKET I DELIVERY

618
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,146
THE ROAD IS BLOCKED
A MYSTERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT

619
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,898
-Do you see anyone?
-I think someone's there.

620
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,067
-Looks like an accident.
-I can see something.

621
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,569
-I can see.
-Someone's head.

622
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,320
-It's a woman.
-Someone's head?

623
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,323
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
IS INSIDE THE MERCEDES-BENZ

624
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,033
Yes, I can see someone's head.

625
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,662
Let's check the person first
and then the delivery truck.

626
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,165
Since we're infected, we'll stay here.

627
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,208
But shouldn't the zombies go check it?

628
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,711
-You punk, I said don't call us zombies.
-Right.

629
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,838
If I become a zombie, I'll kill you first.

630
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,132
-Please calm down, Na-rae.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

631
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,301
He's the commander indeed.

632
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,344
-Wait. You lead.
-I'm scared.

633
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,180
-Aren't you the commander?
-You lead.

634
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,222
Okay.

635
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,474
HE IMMEDIATELY PASSED ON HIS DUTIES

636
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,101
-Isn't there a woman in the car?
-No one is in the truck.

637
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,812
They might come out of there
if we open the door.

638
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,938
I doubt it.

639
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,942
-I think she's dead.
-Seriously?

640
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,032
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS ATTACKED BY ZOMBIES.
ARE THEY HERE TOO?

641
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,991
She got bitten.

642
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,451
She's wearing a Rolex watch.

643
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
Really?

644
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,997
THE DEAD BODY IS COVERED IN LUXURY GOODS

645
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,998
It's very expensive.

646
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,666
-She got bitten.
-Can we just take the watch?

647
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,460
And that's a Chanel bag.

648
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,218
Hong-chul, you're okay by yourself, right?

649
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,386
-Hong-chul.
-Hong-chul.

650
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,805
-Come here.
-Where are you going?

651
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,139
-Come here.
-Come here.

652
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,517
-Come here. Where are you going?
-Come here.

653
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,227
-Come here.
-I forgot.

654
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,603
-Come here.
-I…

655
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,313
-Come here.
-I can't be alone here.

656
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,232
-What do you mean?
-I can't.

657
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,317
-Stay here with me.
-Come here.

658
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,985
-Where are you going?
-How is it?

659
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,446
-I'll take the bag.
-Take the Chanel bag.

660
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,656
And the watch.

661
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,698
What?

662
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,076
-She's moving.
-This…

663
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,622
That scared me.

664
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,290
-She's turning.
-What?

665
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,167
-Let's get out of here for now.
-Hurry.

666
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,585
-She's wearing the seat belt.
-Hurry!

667
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,295
-She can't get out.
-She's wearing the seat belt.

668
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,924
Open this up.

669
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,094
-Wait, Si-young.
-Why? Be careful.

670
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,929
Don't open it.

671
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,807
THE LEADERS ARE ACTING RECKLESSLY

672
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,022
-No zombies.
-Lots of stuff.

673
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,982
Great.

674
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,318
There's so much stuff.

675
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,611
FULL OF SURVIVAL SUPPLIES

676
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,779
There's water!

677
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:10,785
ALAS… WHAT A MEANINGLESS SACRIFICE

678
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,329
-There are packages.
-What?

679
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,290
-Water.
-Is it okay to take them?

680
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,751
Is it okay to take them? Give it here.

681
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,795
For now…

682
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,088
Hey, leader!

683
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,591
Bring them over. Hurry.

684
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,426
THE SHOPPING SPREE STARTED
BEFORE THE LEADER'S ORDERS

685
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,803
Wait. Hold up for a second.

686
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,305
Hey.

687
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,973
-Don't take them.
-More.

688
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,600
Bring it. Okay!

689
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,519
-Is it okay to take everything?
-This is theft.

690
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,479
Wait. Hold up for a second.

691
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,397
Ramyeon!

692
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,232
LUCKY! THEY CAN SURVIVE
FOR A WHILE WITH THESE

693
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,484
Ramyeon!

694
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,903
Ramyeon!

695
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,321
We can't just take them.

696
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,906
They're not ours.

697
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,242
-But consider what has happened.
-In this situation…

698
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,495
Let's just take the clothing first.

699
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,080
THEY COULD BE IN DANGER
IF DISTRACTED BY THE GOODS

700
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,167
Take some clothes
to change out of our bloodstained clothes.

701
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,836
I'll go up and hand you
some items that look useful.

702
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,212
-Okay.
-Great.

703
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,131
-Clothes.
-Wait.

704
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,507
It's animal pajamas.

705
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,511
Would these be useful?

706
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,139
These could help prevent zombie bites.

707
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,891
It's too tight.

708
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,684
You have to zip up your butt.

709
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,354
YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR A COLONOSCOPY

710
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,652
Like this. In any case,
we should dress properly.

711
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,569
It's cold.

712
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,737
Take the bag.

713
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,280
-Yes, good job.
-Come on.

714
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,490
-It's Chanel.
-What's inside?

715
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,116
Only take what we need.

716
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,327
No one needs makeup, right?

717
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,829
-Makeup? Let's take it.
-We might need it.

718
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,040
We might be able to remove bloodstains.

719
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,089
I feel bad for taking the bag.

720
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,132
-Let's just take the makeup.
-Okay.

721
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,760
-Great.
-What's that? A Chanel bag?

722
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,638
THE LUXURIOUS HALF-ZOMBIE IS REPRIMANDED

723
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,767
-Taking the bag is a bit much.
-That would be so shameless.

724
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,485
We'll return your makeup
right after using it. It'll be fine.

725
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,153
-I'm sorry.
-I feel so terrible.

726
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,613
-Come on, let's go.
-Wait.

727
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,074
We have no time for this. Turn around.

728
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,326
-Zombies are coming!
-Oh, no!

729
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,078
Turn around. Zombies are coming!

730
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,955
-Oh, no!
-Hurry!

731
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,748
-Wait.
-We have to move that first.

732
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,166
EMERGENCY! THEY MUST CLEAR THE ROAD

733
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,251
Should I close this?

734
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,211
We're exposed.

735
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,924
Let's push it to the side.

736
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,302
-Should we push it backward?
-Move aside.

737
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,221
One, two, three.

738
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,056
Straight. It's moving.

739
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,975
-Don't push too hard.
-It could fall off.

740
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,018
-Wait.
-This much?

741
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,395
THEY JUST NEED TO MOVE
THE DELIVERY TRUCK TO ESCAPE

742
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,479
Stop.

743
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,397
-Na-rae.
-All set?

744
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,190
-Get in, Na-rae.
-Get in?

745
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,483
-Get in, Na-rae.
-Get in that one.

746
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,693
-Let's go.
-Get in this one.

747
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,361
-Hurry!
-Na-rae!

748
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,072
Hyung, what if they abandon us?

749
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,117
-I know. Damn it.
-This doesn't seem right.

750
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,410
-Hey!
-Sit down.

751
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,203
-They're coming.
-They're coming.

752
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,168
-Wow.
-They came all the way here?

753
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,878
-It's a manual car.
-It is?

754
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,504
Sorry. We have to take this one.

755
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,799
-Can you drive it?
-Follow us.

756
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,385
DinDin, step on the gas.

757
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,221
-Why, Hong-chul?
-Just in case.

758
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,473
You want to ditch them?

759
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,183
Take us with you!

760
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,977
What the heck? Hey!

761
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,696
Hey, I feel much more at ease.

762
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,617
Hey, look at them. Don't abandon us!

763
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,660
See? He's using the blinker improperly.

764
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,953
He's not fine.

765
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,101
It's getting so cold.

766
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,146
It's so chilly now that the sun has set.

767
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,608
I'm so hungry.

768
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,363
I see people.

769
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,281
What? You see people?

770
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,790
It's a town.

771
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,885
There are people here.

772
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,721
-We'll follow you until the very end.
-Yes.

773
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,598
Darn it. What's going on?

774
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,517
-Someone's guarding the place.
-Stop.

775
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,601
Stop!

776
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,482
What if we can't go in?

777
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,526
-Wait.
-They want us to stop.

778
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,195
-There are some people there.
-Oh, no.

779
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,948
Hyung, what do we do?
What if they find out?

780
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,784
Stop. Wait.

781
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,453
Hello.

782
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,454
What's going on?

783
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,707
It's safe here, right?

784
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,500
-Get out first.
-Okay.

785
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,710
Where did you come from?

786
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,003
-From Seoul.
-From Seoul.

787
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,045
-Seoul?
-Yes, Seoul.

788
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,964
Thank you so much!

789
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,967
-No, come here.
-Wait. Come here for a second.

790
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,434
ON A BRIDGE OUTSIDE OF A TOWN
THE RESIDENTS STOP THEM

791
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,659
Hyung, act a bit…

792
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,620
-What now?
-Act a little dumb.

793
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,997
-Okay, I'll act dumb.
-Don't act like a doctor.

794
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,749
We probably look suspicious.

795
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,086
-Hello, we came from Seoul.
-Is that right?

796
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,172
-Okay, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

797
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,798
-Were you playing baseball?
-Oh, yes.

798
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,133
-The town chief.
-Hello.

799
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,676
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

800
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,386
But what brings you here?

801
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,308
Something horrible happened,
so we came to take shelter in a safe town.

802
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,644
SOMETHING HORRIBLE? THIS IS NEWS TO THEM

803
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,646
-Nothing happened here, right?
-No.

804
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,858
But the thing is,
our town doesn't accept outsiders.

805
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,610
NO OUTSIDERS HERE? THAT'S GOOD NEWS!

806
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,737
-This town is uncontaminated.
-That's great.

807
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,489
You know these celebrities, right?

808
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,157
-Nice to meet you.
-Celebrities.

809
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,367
They're all celebrities.

810
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,702
NO ID ON THEM… SO THEY USE THEIR FACES

811
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,871
Celebrities. She's an actress.

812
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,665
-An actress?
-I've never seen her.

813
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,041
Celebrities. They're on TV.

814
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,627
I don't recognize them at all.

815
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,670
Wait, you…

816
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,339
-Park Na-rae.
-Yes, it's me.

817
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,548
I'm on I Live Alone.

818
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,717
-Yes.
-He's on Two Days and One Night.

819
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,470
-That's me, sir.
-That one is on Two Days and One Night.

820
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,930
-I'm DinDin.
-I see.

821
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,100
THIS MIGHT GET EMBARRASSING

822
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,394
-Infinite challenge!
-Challenge!

823
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,436
By the way…

824
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,231
HE EMBARRASSED HIMSELF BUT SUCCEEDED!

825
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,149
I'm in a group called Billlie.

826
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,526
She's very cute.

827
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,695
-Show us!
-Okay.

828
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,613
One, two.

829
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,203
INFO: TSUKI, THE MAIN DANCER OF BILLLIE,

830
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,913
IS BEST KNOWN FOR HER "GINGAMINGAYO" VIDEO

831
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,332
WHICH HAS OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS… MORE

832
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
-Pass?
-Beyoncé.

833
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,211
-Oh, me?
-One more.

834
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,380
-Oh, me?
-One more.

835
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,968
My goodness. So great!

836
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,847
EVEN JAY-Z WOULD BE IMPRESSED

837
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,181
Great job.

838
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,933
-They'll let us in.
-Let's go!

839
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,851
-No!
-No!

840
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:32,893
Let's go!

841
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,730
-No!
-No! Stop!

842
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,024
I thought hard about it,
but we can't let you in.

843
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,483
-Why not?
-We can't.

844
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,985
You guys are too loud.

845
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,570
Don't you see it's a quiet town?

846
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,406
THEY TRIED, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH
TO OPEN UP THEIR HEARTS

847
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,491
He's our town chief.

848
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,745
THEY FORGOT TO PAY RESPECTS
TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE TOWN

849
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,955
Why did you have to bring that up?
My goodness.

850
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,498
-Goodness.
-You look so kind.

851
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,791
Let's go inside.

852
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,876
Let's talk a bit.

853
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,961
-No, wait.
-We've been through so much.

854
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,588
Zombies showed up just now too.

855
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,922
-What?
-They ran after us.

856
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,966
-What zombies? We didn't see anything.
-No.

857
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,343
No.

858
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,054
-We didn't see anything.
-We didn't see any zombies.

859
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,556
…SAYS THE HALF-ZOMBIE

860
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:19,440
Sir, something terrible happened to us,
so we ran away all the way over here.

861
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,486
To tell you the truth, we haven't slept
or eaten for the past few days.

862
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:28,699
We only have a few bottles of water left,
barely enough to survive.

863
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,494
We would appreciate your generosity.

864
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,371
No, we're an uncontaminated town.

865
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,166
They're young enough to be your kids.
Tsuki, how old are you?

866
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,168
-I'm 21.
-That's right.

867
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,128
Will you let us stay just one night?

868
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,054
Wait a moment.

869
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,430
Then…

870
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,598
Well, then…

871
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,476
Don't move. Stay right here, okay?

872
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,311
-Don't move and stay here, okay?
-Okay.

873
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,521
-Stay here.
-Okay.

874
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,231
-Let's go.
-Here…

875
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,565
Don't cross over, okay?

876
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,900
-Okay.
-All right.

877
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,527
Wait.

878
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,362
THEY SUDDENLY LEAVE FOR SOME REASON

879
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,242
Cover this part a little.

880
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,785
Cover it. Cover them with this.

881
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,954
-But…
-Cover up your dark circles.

882
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,706
ANYBODY WOULD CONSIDER THEM SUSPICIOUS,
SO THEY TIDY UP

883
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,459
-It's bad. You're pale.
-It looks like we're scheming.

884
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,585
-Face forward.
-Don't move!

885
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,711
-Okay.
-Blush.

886
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,046
See you when you're back!

887
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,923
You look so pale.

888
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,509
-Her dark circles are so bad.
-So terrible.

889
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,594
I'll cover this. You can't see it, right?

890
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,595
Keep it covered.

891
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,763
-Bloodstains?
-Yes.

892
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,642
THAT'S A BIT TOO MUCH LIPSTICK

893
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,727
-I'll make it look natural.
-Yes, please.

894
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,771
-Cover that up a bit.
-It's more suspicious.

895
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,106
-You should cover it.
-Then…

896
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,607
-You know what this is, right?
-What's that?

897
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,484
Like Heo Sung-tae in Squid Game.

898
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,154
-You won't be able to tell. Like a tattoo.
-A tattoo.

899
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,114
SHE PAINTS OVER THE BULGING VEINS TOO

900
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,075
He looks like a beggar.

901
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,911
-He looks human.
-That's good.

902
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,121
Isn't that a dog outfit?

903
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,498
-It is a dog outfit.
-Do I look okay?

904
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,041
You look totally fine.

905
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,126
-I look fine?
-Yes.

906
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,419
NOTE: HE'S A UROLOGIST

907
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,753
Don't touch that.

908
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,714
-He looks okay.
-Do the veins look okay?

909
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,967
But it's so cold. I want to go in soon.

910
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,343
Where's the town chief?

911
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,929
We need to go in.
Let's cooperate as much as we can.

912
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:27,151
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE,
BUT THE TOWN CHIEF HASN'T RETURNED

913
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,446
-Where did he go?
-I'm hungry.

914
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,406
-I'm hungry.
-Ramyeon is making me hungry.

915
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,532
Let's eat it raw.

916
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,203
Can you eat it like that?

917
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,079
-In Korea,
-Yes?

918
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,789
-we sprinkle the seasoning.
-You sprinkle it.

919
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,292
-You have a lot more to learn.
-Are you serious?

920
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:50,925
BUT A BAG OF RAMYEON WON'T BE ENOUGH
FOR THEM TO OVERCOME HUNGER AND THE COLD

921
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,676
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

922
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,844
I'm so hungry.

923
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,015
We're so hungry, sir!

924
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,480
-They're coming back now. Hey.
-All right…

925
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,692
Goodness, what do we do…

926
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,989
No problem.

927
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,324
You can come in.

928
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,910
A VERY ANTICLIMACTIC ANSWER
CONSIDERING HOW LONG THEY'VE WAITED

929
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,704
THEY GOT EXHAUSTED WHILE WAITING

930
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,373
Let's leave the cars here for now.

931
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,584
-Let's go.
-Can we leave our cars parked here?

932
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,920
-Leave them there. They can't come in.
-Okay.

933
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,756
Come this way.

934
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,093
Wait a second.

935
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,470
They wouldn't lure us into a trap,
would they?

936
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,059
This is our town hall.

937
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,769
-Chongchon-ri?
-Hwangchon-ri.

938
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,980
-I've never heard of it.
-I read it as Hwangcheon, the afterlife.

939
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,439
-Hwangchon-ri.
-It's Hwangchon-ri.

940
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,400
-Hwangchon-ri.
-We have meetings here too.

941
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,443
I've traveled a lot
for Two Days and One Night,

942
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,820
but I've never heard of it.

943
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,321
Really? You should travel more.

944
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,241
You must be hungry.

945
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,285
-Yes!
-I'm so hungry.

946
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,245
Someone has passed away, so…

947
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,789
-That's good. I mean, that's terrible.
-Is there food?

948
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,833
-We have a lot.
-We have a lot of food.

949
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,519
-It's kimchi.
-That scared me.

950
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,478
-It's kimchi.
-Kimchi.

951
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,646
-They're making kimchi.
-I got so startled.

952
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,566
Why make kimchi at night?

953
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,859
-Wait.
-My goodness.

954
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,819
-Are they really?
-We're making kimchi.

955
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,903
-Hello.
-Hello.

956
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,405
-Sorry to bother you.
-Sorry.

957
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,617
Sir, do you have some warm soup?

958
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,076
We have spicy beef soup.

959
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,537
-Spicy beef soup!
-I love spicy beef soup.

960
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,914
-Very hot soup!
-Was it a natural death?

961
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,833
The person didn't have any family.

962
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,918
So our town is holding a funeral.

963
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,463
Let's not act so happy. It's a funeral.

964
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,089
He's right.

965
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,301
Hurry and tell them to bring out
some spicy beef soup and food.

966
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,677
We have guests!

967
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,638
-Okay.
-Come on in.

968
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,805
-Can we come in?
-Yes.

969
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,806
Is it okay?

970
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,392
Can we come to a funeral home
dressed like this?

971
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:10,814
AN OLD MAN'S FUNERAL IN HWANGCHON-RI

972
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,462
-We're here.
-Hello.

973
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,546
-There's food.
-Hello.

974
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,423
-Hello.
-We're sorry to intrude.

975
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,300
Sit down over here.

976
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,635
-Hello.
-It looks delicious.

977
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,761
Wow.

978
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,971
Hello.

979
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,224
-I'm so hungry.
-There are rice cakes too.

980
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,518
-It looks delicious.
-There's stingray.

981
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,561
Boiled pork. Thank you for the food.

982
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,646
Thank you so much.

983
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,649
It's been so long…

984
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,068
Seriously, I'm so hungry.

985
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,903
-Boiled pork.
-Beef tripe hot pot.

986
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,822
Kimchi stew with lots of pork fat.

987
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,657
Kimchi stew sounds good.

988
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,951
-I just want some white rice.
-White rice.

989
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,873
THE WARM FOOD
THEY'VE BEEN DESPERATELY HOPING FOR

990
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,502
It looks so delicious.

991
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,880
Someone is mourning over there.

992
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
She's crying.

993
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,134
Let's not be disrespectful.

994
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,929
THEY SHOULD BE RESPECTFUL
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE STARVING

995
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,558
-Please start eating.
-Okay.

996
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,226
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

997
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,061
Let's dig in, guys.

998
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,438
Enjoy the food.

999
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,314
-Is this boiled pork?
-Yes.

1000
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,150
I really love boiled pork.

1001
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,194
-And spicy beef soup.
-Let's eat.

1002
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,654
It's nice and warm.

1003
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,531
How is it? Isn't it chewy?

1004
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,036
It's so delicious. Seriously.

1005
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,329
It's so good.

1006
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,874
THE FIRST MEAL IN TWO DAYS!
THEY'RE LOSING THEIR MINDS

1007
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,208
The food is delicious here.

1008
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,837
We serve great food here.

1009
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,256
Over here.

1010
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,341
It's delicious.

1011
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,051
It tastes so good since it's hot.

1012
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,636
-Beef pancakes, please.
-Sure.

1013
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,763
Warm beef pancakes
and meat patties, please.

1014
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,056
Please serve them hot.

1015
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,558
-Okay.
-Will do.

1016
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,477
My goodness.

1017
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,272
Try it when it's hot. It's so delicious.

1018
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,735
DELICIOUS FOOD MAKES THEM HAPPY!

1019
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,279
-It's so delicious.
-The food is good here.

1020
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,241
-There are many elderly people here.
-Thank you.

1021
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,367
We have many funerals.

1022
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,660
It's delicious.

1023
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,705
That's why the food is good here.
They hold many funerals.

1024
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,290
To maintain their skills,

1025
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,502
they need to keep holding funerals.
That's troubling.

1026
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,629
That's nonsense, Kkwachu Hyung.

1027
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,548
YOU'RE NOT ON A RESTAURANT TOUR!

1028
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,258
It's so delicious.

1029
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,719
It's really amazing.

1030
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,139
The head of the women's association here
is an amazing cook.

1031
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,891
-Over here.
-Here you go.

1032
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,685
DELIGHTED AT THE UNLIMITED FUNERAL FOOD

1033
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,062
Eat as much as you'd like.

1034
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,078
THEY HEAR THE SOUNDS
OF MOURNING FOR THE DECEASED

1035
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,373
A STRANGE, REMOTE TOWN

1036
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:18,377
THEY MUST REMEMBER
THEY'RE AT SOMEONE'S FUNERAL

1037
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:25,092
My goodness, what do I do?

1038
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,514
My goodness, what do I do?

1039
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,486
At this rate,
no one will be left in this town.

1040
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,737
It's okay. Please eat.

1041
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,823
-Please eat.
-Let's eat.

1042
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,992
Goodness.

1043
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,830
THE MOURNER'S TEARS DRIED UP LIKE MAGIC!

1044
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,540
She stopped crying. Hurry.

1045
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,457
SHE MIGHT START CRYING AGAIN

1046
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,376
-She's not crying. Eat quickly.
-Eat more.

1047
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,461
-Let's eat quickly.
-More boiled pork.

1048
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,796
IT'S SAD, BUT THEY CAN'T BE
POLITE RIGHT NOW

1049
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,089
We don't know when we'll eat next,

1050
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,048
-so eat fast.
-Eat fast.

1051
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,094
You must've been starving.

1052
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,971
You never know when we'll die too.

1053
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,972
Eat up.

1054
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,642
Tell us if you want more.

1055
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,852
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

1056
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,645
-Boiled pork and meat patties.
-Meat patties.

1057
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,897
-Rice and soup, please.
-Give them more boiled pork.

1058
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,524
-Okay.
-Aren't the pancakes tasty?

1059
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,651
-Yes, they are.
-Eat up.

1060
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,278
That one. Great.

1061
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,741
It's so delicious.

1062
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,117
-Thank you.
-Eat slowly.

1063
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,619
-Here.
-Don't eat the cold ones.

1064
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,454
Here's some makgeolli.

1065
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,205
My goodness, sir.

1066
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,249
It's the traditional wine of our town.

1067
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,751
-Traditional wine?
-Is it good?

1068
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,794
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1069
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,005
Did Kkwachu Hyung get any?

1070
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,590
YOU CAN'T SAY NO
TO WARM FOOD AND MAKGEOLLI

1071
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,093
The food is so delicious here.

1072
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,306
-Drink up.
-Drink up.

1073
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,017
ONE BY ONE, THEY HAVE A DRINK
OFFERED BY THE TOWN CHIEF

1074
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,976
It's delicious.

1075
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,894
Drink up.

1076
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,856
Drink up. All of it.

1077
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,193
THAT ROUGHLY MEANS THAT IT TASTES AMAZING

1078
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,903
It's killer.

1079
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,446
Have one more.

1080
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,822
-Jonathan, you too.
-Okay.

1081
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,492
-It's okay.
-Your elder is giving it to you.

1082
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,035
You have to drink at a funeral.

1083
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,745
Last one. Drink up.

1084
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,372
-Come on.
-Drink up.

1085
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,956
-We can't toast.
-We can't toast.

1086
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,376
So just say, "Wi-Fi."

1087
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,627
You have Wi-Fi here?

1088
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,755
Jonathan, stop talking nonsense
and drink up.

1089
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,840
THAT JOKE GOT HER GOOD

1090
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,677
It's respectful to
enjoy the food they've given us.

1091
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,054
The food is really…

1092
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,556
My goodness!

1093
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,557
The food is really…

1094
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,892
-My goodness!
-Oh, no.

1095
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:42,896
TEARS RECHARGED!
HER WAILING STOPS THEM FROM EATING

1096
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:51,947
Goodness.

1097
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,156
IT'S HARD TO EAT LIKE THIS

1098
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,617
Don't mind her and just eat up.

1099
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,827
What's going on?

1100
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,956
Is it okay for us to eat?

1101
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,791
-I thought he died of old age.
-I know.

1102
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,752
My goodness…

1103
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,672
THEY TRY TO MOURN WITH HER

1104
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,466
Don't worry, and just eat.

1105
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:19,474
Goodness.

1106
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,476
The mood is quite sad.

1107
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,273
Can one of you offer condolences?
What do you think?

1108
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,774
I'll do it.

1109
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,526
Our leader and subleader.

1110
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,112
Go together.

1111
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,906
Goodness.

1112
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,241
-I'll do it.
-Yes, please.

1113
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,452
-I'll do it.
-I think it's best if you do.

1114
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,537
Yes, sir. Let's go together.

1115
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,959
-She'd like to offer her condolences.
-Okay.

1116
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,795
Please take off your shoes.

1117
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,088
-Offer a flower.
-Okay.

1118
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,590
You may burn incense.

1119
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,091
Bow twice.

1120
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,105
-What was that?
-What's that sound?

1121
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,109
-Wait.
-What's wrong?

1122
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,194
I heard something.

1123
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,653
What? Heard what?

1124
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,699
-I didn't hear anything.
-A sound?

1125
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,035
What's wrong?

1126
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,537
-My shoe wouldn't come off.
-I got so startled.

1127
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,164
He said he heard a sound.

1128
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,833
The sound came from inside.

1129
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,418
-No, it's from here.
-From here.

1130
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,669
You're mistaken.

1131
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,921
Sit down.

1132
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,380
I'm too scared to eat.

1133
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,757
Wasn't it from the coffin?

1134
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,635
APPARENTLY SHE CAN STILL EAT SIDE DISHES

1135
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,559
-You're mistaken.
-You're mistaken. Go on up.

1136
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,727
Why are you smiling?

1137
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,145
I'm not crying. I mean…

1138
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,063
Sorry?

1139
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,862
What was the cause of his death?

1140
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,364
He died of old age.

1141
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,282
Don't worry about it.

1142
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,867
Go ahead and eat.

1143
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,952
Go on.

1144
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,919
-Is something odd?
-Over there?

1145
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:11,962
-Yes, it is.
-Is it?

1146
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,630
-Why?
-Was it from the coffin?

1147
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,924
-From the coffin?
-It's odd. Let's finish up and go.

1148
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,092
-Si-young.
-Yes?

1149
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,844
Don't be like that. Have a drink.

1150
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:19,970
We…

1151
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,346
Here, have a drink.

1152
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,351
If we've all eaten enough,
shall we go now?

1153
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,311
-Aren't we sleeping here tonight?
-What?

1154
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,438
-We have nowhere to sleep.
-Aren't we sleeping here?

1155
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,773
Let's stay the night.

1156
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,525
-We have our cars.
-Wait!

1157
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,069
-In our cars.
-Don't worry.

1158
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,739
We heated up the floor at the town hall.

1159
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,368
A HEATED FLOOR! THEY CAN'T SAY NO TO THAT

1160
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,161
-Heated floor!
-It's boiling hot.

1161
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,162
Is there hot water?

1162
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,373
-Don't burn yourself.
-They have hot water.

1163
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,000
Can we shower?

1164
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,001
Let's take a shower.

1165
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,544
-I have to shower.
-Let's shower.

1166
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:56,548
THEY NEED TO REST THEIR BODIES
AFTER AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY

1167
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,259
We have no choice. We should eat.

1168
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,552
Yes, we should.

1169
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,679
It's delicious. We should eat.

1170
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,806
We have nowhere to go now.

1171
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,267
Since it's the first meal in a while,
I do feel full.

1172
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,062
THEY LET DOWN THEIR GUARD DUE TO
FOOD, DRINKS, AND A WARM PLACE TO SLEEP

1173
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,147
Ramyeon?

1174
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,189
-Drink up.
-It's good.

1175
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,859
I can't eat anymore all of a sudden.

1176
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,278
What if they put something in the food?

1177
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,823
It's too late. We ate so much already.

1178
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,325
…THEY DID EAT A LOT ALREADY

1179
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,661
Everyone, we shouldn't toast
at a funeral home.

1180
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,579
So we'll take turns drinking.

1181
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,457
SHE HAS GOOD MANNERS FOR A HALF-ZOMBIE

1182
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,801
This is quite strong.
I'm starting to feel buzzed.

1183
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,678
-Doctor.
-Yes.

1184
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,555
-You gave me too much again.
-It's okay.

1185
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,516
Bottoms up. What?

1186
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,185
Not with a half-zombie?

1187
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,520
-Have a drink.
-Don't ruin the mood. Have a drink.

1188
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,689
-Dex, have a drink.
-What a disaster.

1189
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,901
Bottoms up. Don't toast.

1190
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,322
You drank. You had a sip.

1191
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,531
I need to sleep.

1192
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,327
-They didn't drink much.
-Green light.

1193
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,872
DRINKING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH,
THEY'RE GETTING DRUNK FAST

1194
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,123
Let's get drunk today.

1195
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,083
Let's do it.

1196
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,417
Let's get drunk today.

1197
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,294
I ate four servings of pancakes.

1198
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,462
You really ate a lot.

1199
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,050
-Hong-chul, are you all right?
-Yes.

1200
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,594
-You're acting weird.
-I ate too much boiled pork.

1201
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,846
I've never seen people
eat so much at a funeral.

1202
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,473
This meat is addictive.

1203
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,599
-It's addictive.
-Yes.

1204
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,101
Let's eat until we die!

1205
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,145
You wouldn't notice if one of us dies.
Because we're dead already.

1206
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,609
Goodness!

1207
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,777
Goodness!

1208
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,446
THEY RESPOND CALMLY
TO THE MOURNING SOUNDS NOW

1209
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,366
Goodness!

1210
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,787
I don't know anymore.
What am I going to do with my life?

1211
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,956
You can't live long anyway.

1212
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,835
-I'm sorry.
-I want to cry too.

1213
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,545
Here.

1214
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,465
Call me again next time.

1215
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,050
-Go.
-Call me.

1216
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,344
Hong-chul, stop drinking.

1217
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,804
I downed it.

1218
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,890
Have you gone crazy?
What's wrong with you?

1219
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,063
Did you drink?

1220
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,649
We're drunk, all of us.

1221
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,276
We're all drunk.

1222
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,686
A rolled-up gimbap

1223
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,856
A thick gimbap

1224
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,655
Cut it into small pieces

1225
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,491
And place them in Mother's mouth

1226
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,247
All right. Let's go.

1227
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,083
HWANGCHON-RI RICE MILL

1228
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,008
Let's go. Slowly.

1229
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:09,926
Here we are.

1230
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,808
Mother, what do you think?

1231
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,145
Eat slowly, okay?

1232
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,411
What the heck is that?

1233
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,662
-Mother.
-Sir!

1234
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,123
I'll be right back, so just wait a little.

1235
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,959
Sir, what the heck is going on?

1236
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,752
Sir!

1237
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,753
He's our town chief.

1238
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,338
-I see.
-Hello, sir.

1239
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,842
THE 10TH TOWN CHIEF, LEE JUN-HYEOK

1240
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,886
FILIAL SON AWARD
LEE JUN-HYEOK

1241
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,472
…SERVED HIS MOTHER WITH UTMOST CARE
AND RESPECTS ELDERS…

1242
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,391
Did she eat some?

1243
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,394
No, not at all.

1244
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,647
Perhaps, your mother only eats live…

1245
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,325
Sir, what the heck is going on? Sir!

1246
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,203
Sir!

1247
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,913
Sir! What is that?

1248
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,582
What the heck is that?

1249
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,213
What's this? Ma'am, please!

1250
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,312
I don't want to die.

1251
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,782
