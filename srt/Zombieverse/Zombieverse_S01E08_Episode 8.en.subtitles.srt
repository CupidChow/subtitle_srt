1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,173
THIS SURVIVAL GAME TAKES PLACE
IN A ZOMBIE UNIVERSE

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
THE CAST ACT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND TURN INTO ZOMBIES ONCE BITTEN

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,968
PLEASE BE ADVISED
OF THEIR IMMERSION IN THE GAME

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,101
Let's hold out for three more hours.
Then we'll survive. Let's go!

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,019
Let's go!

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,104
Time is going by so damn slowly.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,732
Well, earlier…

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,777
Get away from me!

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,738
Was that the employee from earlier?

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,780
Isn't it the employee's voice?

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,867
Once you get on the Ferris wheel,
you can't open the door from the inside.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,994
Please open the doors in three hours.

13
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,872
THE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS GOING TO
OPEN THE DOORS GOT ATTACKED

14
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,207
The employee went outside and got bitten.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,375
There are so many zombies.

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,752
What do we do?

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,420
Who's going to open the door for us?

18
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,423
If anything happens to him,
none of us will be able to get off.

19
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,799
The door won't open.

20
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,885
What do we do?

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,262
Oh, no!

22
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,513
Are we locked in now?

23
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,807
Shouldn't we open the doors
for those up there too?

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,185
-Na-rae and Kkwachu got off.
-What?

25
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,186
Na-rae and Kkwachu?

26
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,271
-What is it?
-Go.

27
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,231
-What's wrong?
-It's scary for us too.

28
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,524
NA-RAE AND KKWACHU HYUNG GOT RESCUED

29
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,321
Oh, my goodness.

30
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,657
Hurry and go inside.
Let's close the door and stay inside.

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,084
The employee opened the door
for Na-rae and Kkwachu

32
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,251
and died.

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,377
Yes, he's dead.

34
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,922
THE EMPLOYEE KEPT HIS PROMISE…
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED

35
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,801
Thank goodness. There's still hope.

36
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,678
I'm relieved. It might be better this way.

37
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,723
That would've been our fate
if we got here a little later.

38
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,351
Why didn't the employee
lock his door tightly?

39
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,394
SUCH A SHAME
ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE'S SACRIFICE

40
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,022
4:36 A.M.
THE FERRIS WHEEL EMPLOYEE DIES

41
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,483
2 HOURS AND 24 MINUTES
UNTIL THE RESCUE BOAT DEPARTS

42
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,614
DinDin, what do we do?

43
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,241
DinDin, what do we do?

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,701
What do we do?

45
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,329
A zombie down there
is looking inside the Ferris wheel.

46
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,957
We had no idea
there were so many zombies down there.

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,584
By the way, what about us? What do we do?

48
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,170
Those two will be safe. Good lord.

49
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,757
We're scared in here too.

50
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,552
-We would've died if we stayed out there.
-I'm so relieved.

51
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,262
THEY IGNORE THE HALF-ZOMBIES

52
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,429
I can see the ocean.

53
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,014
Tomorrow we'll be at the ocean.

54
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,391
We'll escape to the ocean tomorrow.

55
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,268
Not even tomorrow. In three hours.

56
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,645
-Let's hold out just a little longer.
-Very soon.

57
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,940
We always made it when we were together.

58
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,984
-We never came close to danger.
-Right.

59
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,652
Na-rae…

60
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,447
BUT HE PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN DANGER

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,242
Hyung, what if they abandon us?

62
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,161
Hey, look at them. Don't abandon us!

63
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,373
We're safe.

64
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,083
-We're safe!
-We're almost there.

65
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,168
This is awesome.

66
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,128
If we stand them up in front of us…

67
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,172
That's nonsense. Are we human shields?

68
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,798
She's the worst.

69
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,550
I think we'll survive.

70
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,720
So you shouldn't have got bitten.

71
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,057
When I get out,
I'll kill both of you immediately.

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,437
I just did my best…

73
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,940
working my fingers to the bone…

74
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,943
and sacrificing myself.

75
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,322
Let's accept our fate now.

76
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,365
We're almost there. Hey.

77
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,618
Hang in there just a little longer.

78
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,121
If we don't open the doors for you,

79
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,789
you won't be able to open them.

80
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,046
-What is she saying?
-Hey, Park Na-rae. Come to your senses.

81
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,840
You all want to live, don't you?

82
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,383
What's wrong with her?

83
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,635
Why is she scaring us?

84
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,096
But you've lived long enough,
don't you think?

85
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,141
-What the heck?
-She's scaring me.

86
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,979
Come on, don't joke around.
What's wrong with you?

87
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,314
Come to your senses.

88
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,359
Come to your senses, okay?

89
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,444
Open your eyes. Kkwachu Hyung!

90
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,489
If I don't open the doors,

91
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,907
it'll be the end for you.

92
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,500
I would be too upset

93
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,378
to see them make it to the boat alive.

94
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,299
NA-RAE SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A DECISION

95
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,595
THE FATE OF THE SURVIVORS
DEPENDS ON THE HALF-ZOMBIES

96
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,141
Doctor, Na-rae, are you okay?

97
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,728
-That's Tsuki.
-If you were us, would you be okay?

98
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,022
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

99
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,151
Na-rae and Kkwachu, out of everyone here,
do you resent anyone?

100
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,487
No, it's not necessary to ask that.

101
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,447
-Please don't ask that.
-Just stay alert.

102
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,076
HIS GUILT MAKES HIM LONG-WINDED

103
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,954
-We don't hate anyone. We accept everyone.
-We're all family.

104
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,707
It was great when we were together, right?

105
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,083
SUDDENLY GETTING NOSTALGIC??

106
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,710
Hyung.

107
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,462
I didn't realize it when you were here,
but now that we're separated,

108
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,423
-I feel your absence keenly.
-I miss you.

109
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,841
Please just hang in there.

110
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,801
Is he trying to appeal to their emotions?

111
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,969
Na-rae.

112
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,681
I just want to have a drink with you
in our neighborhood like we used to.

113
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,475
Hang in there, okay?
We had some good times together.

114
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,477
Those rats.

115
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,940
Kkwachu Hyung and Na-rae,
I hope you guys survive.

116
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,400
Let's keep communicating.

117
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,695
We don't have to live.
You two hang in there as long as possible.

118
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,821
Seriously…

119
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,281
THEY START TO CURRY FAVOR TO SURVIVE!

120
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,365
What's wrong with him?

121
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,327
Na-rae, whenever you hit people up
when you felt like having a drink,

122
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,287
who always showed up? Me.

123
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,830
Who was always there for you?

124
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,041
You know I always
liked your posts on social media.

125
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,002
RESORTING TO TRIVIAL MATTERS

126
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,795
I always liked them.

127
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,007
DinDin and Hong-chul,
you're trying so hard.

128
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,259
My goodness.

129
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,678
I haven't been in Korea
for that long, Na-rae.

130
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
INFO: SHE CAME TO KOREA IN 2008
WHEN SHE WAS 6

131
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,681
She even lost her brother.

132
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,683
She needs to survive.
Don't worry about me.

133
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,226
I don't have any family left.

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,145
But I'm a foreigner too.

135
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm Japanese. I'm from Japan.

136
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,901
My parents are in Japan
and I'm an only child.

137
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,570
Both of my parents got bitten in Korea.

138
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,613
SELLING OUT HER HEALTHY PARENTS

139
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,656
Na-rae, Patricia's hometown is far away.

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,617
She can't even remember it.

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,578
Patricia's parents live in Gwangju.
That's nonsense.

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,664
Not the hometown in her heart.
Her actual hometown.

143
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,376
AS HE MAKES AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL,
THEIR CAR APPROACHES THE BOOTH

144
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,670
Na-rae, are you all right?

145
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,840
Ro Hong-chul
is in car number 23 with Patricia.

146
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,509
Hong-chul's in number 23?

147
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,095
Who's in number 17?

148
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,430
Tsuki and DinDin are in number 17.

149
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,848
What's wrong with her?

150
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,559
-Number 23?
-Kkwachu Hyung.

151
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,272
I memorized your name perfectly now.

152
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,275
Kkwachu Hyung. Sung-woo.

153
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,988
THE SUBLEADER BRAGS
ABOUT MEMORIZING HIS NAME AFTER 4 DAYS

154
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,741
Everyone has become so funny before death.

155
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,745
Sung-woo, I was going to get
surgery at your clinic.

156
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,961
Na-rae, can you still see?

157
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,297
Number 23, Ro Hong-chul.

158
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,424
Na-rae!

159
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,218
I'm relieved. You can still see.

160
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,053
-That's great, Na-rae.
-Na-rae.

161
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,221
Great.

162
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,224
Number 17, DinDin.

163
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,767
SHE CLEARLY REMEMBERS
HONG-CHUL AND DINDIN'S CAR NUMBERS

164
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,726
DinDin.

165
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,812
Should we just all get off?

166
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,730
I'm worried about
Kkwachu Hyung and Na-rae.

167
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,568
No, just stay where you are.
We'll call the shots.

168
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,571
Should I go down there?

169
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,325
IT'S BEEN 47 HOURS SINCE THEY GOT INFECTED

170
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,036
THE HALF-ZOMBIES
ARE FEELING EXTREMELY TIRED

171
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,788
-Hyung.
-Yes?

172
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,207
I feel so sleepy. Can I sleep?

173
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,210
Na-rae, you must be cold.

174
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,088
If you're cold, I'll give you my hat.

175
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,472
No one's responding.

176
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,557
Na-rae, can you hear me?

177
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,186
Kkwachu Hyung, Na-rae.

178
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,354
Kkwachu Hyung, Na-rae.

179
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,152
Park Na-rae, you're still there, right?

180
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,613
Park Na-rae, Kkwachu Hyung.

181
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,115
Kkwachu Hyung, how's Na-rae doing?

182
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,828
Hold on.

183
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,209
I'm near the ground now,
but Na-rae and Kkwachu aren't moving.

184
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,878
THE HALF-ZOMBIES SUDDENLY FELL ASLEEP

185
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,380
-They aren't moving at all.
-Earlier…

186
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,008
They're totally unconscious.
They're not moving at all.

187
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
Hey, what if they're dead?

188
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,265
We can't get off then.

189
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,980
It might open if we use
something thin like a credit card.

190
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,399
Hold on a second.

191
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,777
Are you using a card?

192
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,741
THE EMPLOYEE FORGOT TO LOCK THIS CAR!

193
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,743
DINDIN ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE

194
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,702
Did you open it?

195
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,371
Okay, it worked.

196
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,915
We got it. Okay.

197
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,208
Be careful, DinDin.

198
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,961
DinDin and Tsuki got out.

199
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,878
What?

200
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,588
How did they get out?

201
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,551
What happened to Na-rae and Kkwachu?
Did they turn?

202
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,221
No, they're quietly asleep
like Jonathan was.

203
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,015
If they've turned, lock the door.

204
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,101
I think they're dead,

205
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,228
but Na-rae keeps blinking.

206
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,027
I'll open all your doors first.

207
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,112
Okay.

208
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,364
Is it safe for us to get off?

209
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,741
But there are zombies.

210
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,786
Come on out.

211
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,538
Na-rae and Kkwachu aren't moving at all.

212
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,622
Really?

213
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,124
Why aren't they moving?

214
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,792
What's wrong with them?

215
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,670
The thing is that it's been four days now.

216
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,629
Right.

217
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,967
The zombie virus turns people into zombies

218
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,468
when they're completely dead.

219
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,263
Even if the infection isn't severe,

220
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,141
48 hours is enough for the virus
to spread through the body

221
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,476
and kill the person.

222
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,109
THEY'VE HELD UP WELL SO FAR,
BUT THEY ONLY HAVE ABOUT 1 HOUR LEFT

223
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,528
The problem is we can't get out of here.

224
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,405
-We can't?
-There are zombies.

225
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,745
THERE ARE SO MANY ZOMBIES
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!

226
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,622
Shouldn't we get back on then?

227
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,831
But the issue

228
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,585
is that Na-rae and Kkwachu know
which cars Hong-chul and I were in.

229
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,758
SINCE MANY CARS HAVE DEAD BODIES
OR ARE UNDER MAINTENANCE

230
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,344
ONLY FIVE CARS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM

231
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,054
I want a different car and partner.

232
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,597
-A totally different…
-You'll split up?

233
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,723
-Yes.
-Yes.

234
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,892
-Think carefully.
-Can I get in that one?

235
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,393
By yourself?

236
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
Yes, it's too nerve-racking to handle.

237
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,105
-You're going in?
-You want to get in?

238
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,191
But all of us… Hong-chul.

239
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,151
-Let me go first.
-What? Hong-chul, wait.

240
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,736
-Really?
-No way.

241
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,112
Hong-chul, seriously?

242
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,156
THE SCARED HONG-CHUL
QUICKLY GETS IN THE CAR

243
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,908
-Let's go.
-What do we do?

244
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,286
Tsuki, if we die, we'll die together.

245
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,496
I know.

246
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,539
DINDIN AND TSUKI ARE A TEAM AGAIN

247
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,124
-Who…
-I'll get in first.

248
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,251
Dex, you're going alone?

249
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,544
Without me?

250
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,214
Sorry, but can you hang my hat?

251
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,049
-Go then.
-It's just…

252
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,968
-I don't want to blame anyone.
-Go our separate ways.

253
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,097
THE LEADER AND THE SUBLEADER
ALSO GO SEPARATE WAYS

254
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,191
ALL SURVIVORS ARE NOW ON BOARD

255
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,239
It's so scary being in here alone.

256
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,950
Si-young, I'm sorry.

257
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,537
I'm so scared.

258
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,872
You don't think Na-rae would remember

259
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,083
how I pushed her
at the very beginning, right?

260
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,503
Na-rae's been wanting to kill you
from day one, Hong-chul.

261
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,008
You can't live long anyway.

262
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,593
Na-rae.

263
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,886
Oh, come on!

264
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,976
We can't accept zombies. No exception.

265
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,563
You punk, if you keep calling us zombies,
you'll be the first one I kill.

266
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,732
Which one should I bite?

267
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,319
Eeny meeny miney mo…

268
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,531
THESE TWO MUST BE
THE MOST ANXIOUS OF THEM ALL

269
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,123
Let's not expose each other's car numbers.
Don't be cruel.

270
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,250
You can't disclose my number, okay?

271
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,502
You're in number nine, right?

272
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,714
DinDin, we're very close to each other.

273
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:41,302
THE TWO STRONGEST CANDIDATES' CARS
ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER

274
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,810
THE TWO MADE A SECRET CHANNEL

275
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,521
What if they expose our numbers?

276
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,649
But now we know theirs too.

277
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,319
Dex is in number 17 now.

278
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,445
-Si-young…
-Si-young…

279
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,113
-Si-young is in number three.
-Three.

280
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,865
Hong-chul, Patricia is in number 23.

281
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,991
DINDIN KNOWS EVERYONE'S CAR NUMBERS

282
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,410
Hey, if we're silent for too long,
they'll get suspicious.

283
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,620
Let's get back to channel one.

284
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,290
-The light…
-If our communication gets cut off,

285
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,751
write on the window like this.

286
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,127
-Like this.
-Like this?

287
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,378
That's right.

288
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,130
As long as no one exposes me,

289
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,798
I think I'll be safe in here.

290
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,635
Wait, isn't that Hee-kwan?

291
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,803
-He's still riding the Viking.
-I know.

292
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,722
They're all on there.

293
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,519
You're right.

294
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,438
ZOMBIE HEE-KWAN IS STILL
SUFFERING FROM MOTION SICKNESS…

295
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,943
How innocent.

296
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,906
I want to return to the past.
About ten years back.

297
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,787
I just want to work out.

298
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,456
The muscleman.

299
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,502
THE MUSCLEMAN IS WORRIED ABOUT MUSCLE LOSS

300
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,255
I want to take a warm bath
at my parents' house

301
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,173
and have a meal made by my mom.

302
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,385
Si-young, shouldn't you
go see your kid first?

303
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:07,972
You're right.

304
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,267
Let's go our separate ways if we survive.

305
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,811
Jeez.

306
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,147
EVERYONE MIGHT FEEL THE SAME WAY

307
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,025
I think the sun will rise soon.

308
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,444
Yes, we're almost there.

309
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,530
Hey, hang on just a little longer.

310
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,909
Let's hang on just a little longer.
Just an hour more.

311
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,799
Kkwachu Hyung.

312
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,427
Did someone turn off the lights?

313
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
Na-rae.

314
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,638
Na-rae.

315
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,099
Na-rae.

316
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,601
-Kkwachu Hyung.
-Na-rae.

317
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,227
Hyung, it's dark in here.

318
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,605
Na-rae, where are you?

319
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,064
Na-rae.

320
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,941
-Hyung.
-Na-rae.

321
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,360
I can't see.

322
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,823
Na-rae.

323
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,868
Here you are, Na-rae.

324
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,203
Gosh, you startled me.

325
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,289
-I'm sorry. Oh, gosh.
-My goodness.

326
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:23,213
I can't see anything.
What do we do, Hyung?

327
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,924
I guess there's no hope for us now.

328
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,258
THEIR EYES CLOUDED UP WHILE SLEEPING

329
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,761
Hyung, can you see over there?

330
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,221
No, what's that?

331
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,599
My vision is so blurry.

332
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,309
THIS IS WHAT THEY SEE

333
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,562
What do I do? I can't see anything.

334
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,481
-What's wrong with your face?
-What?

335
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,484
-Right, their eyes look bright red.
-Their eyes are red.

336
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,861
AFTER INFECTION,
THEIR EYESIGHT CONTINUED TO WORSEN

337
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,573
You can't see?
I can't see very clearly either.

338
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,992
AND THEY CAN BARELY SEE NOW

339
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,035
I can't see.

340
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,746
Shouldn't we go out there?

341
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
Listen.

342
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,460
I don't think I have much time left.

343
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,172
Okay, let's go outside.
You can still walk, right?

344
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,553
Where are you guys?

345
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,847
Where are you guys?

346
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,601
Oh, gosh. DinDin, what do we do?

347
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,895
Na-rae, are you all right?

348
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,772
You're okay, right?

349
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,482
Na-rae. Kkwachu Hyung.

350
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,818
Of course, I'm fine.

351
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,362
What are your car numbers?

352
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,740
We're still in the same ones, Na-rae.

353
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,909
Are you okay?
Why didn't you respond earlier?

354
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,038
The car numbers don't matter.
We're going to see each other soon.

355
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,290
Number 17, DinDin.

356
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,584
WHILE THE HALF-ZOMBIES WERE SLEEPING

357
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,087
THEY ALL SWITCHED CARS

358
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,215
BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THEIR VISION

359
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,761
IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM
TO FIGURE IT OUT

360
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,265
Gosh, my heart is pounding.
I'm going crazy.

361
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,267
Isn't it terrifying?

362
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,060
-It is.
-Right?

363
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,354
It's like Russian roulette.

364
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,522
Isn't it fun?

365
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,818
We're going to die!

366
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,364
The half-zombie siblings
only have 30 minutes left.

367
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,702
Once that time is up,
their humanity will completely disappear.

368
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,831
It takes 12 minutes for the Ferris wheel
to make one full rotation.

369
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,125
While they're still conscious,

370
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,503
they must find their travel companion
to the afterlife.

371
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,507
But their vision
has deteriorated significantly.

372
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,761
An innocent friend could be sacrificed

373
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,013
if they make a wrong choice.

374
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,015
THEY MAY FAIL AT THEIR REVENGE

375
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,228
The final game begins now.

376
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,897
BLIND ROULETTE
A CLOUDED CHOICE

377
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,066
I guess this is how I'll die.

378
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,736
If I die, then so be it.

379
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
DinDin.

380
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,868
Shouldn't we come up with a plan B?

381
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,164
Is staying in here our only option?

382
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,043
The walkie-talkies
are still near Na-rae and Kkwachu.

383
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,003
If they're still a bit human,

384
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,589
we can yell out, "Number 17!"

385
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,508
Then they might go to Patricia.

386
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,509
Right.

387
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,344
TERRIBLE FRIENDS!
THEY'RE PLOTTING AN ASSASSINATION

388
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,638
Then which number should we yell out?

389
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,140
Hong-chul, the biggest problem

390
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,017
-is that you're nearest to them.
-Right.

391
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,268
Is that right?

392
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,354
-If he passes, we'll be next.
-I know.

393
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,314
HONG-CHUL, DINDIN, AND TSUKI
ARE HEADED TOWARD THE DANGER ZONE

394
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
Can they see us?

395
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,575
Are you all covered?

396
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,536
I'm covered.

397
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,208
My eyes hurt.

398
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,044
Does anyone spot Na-rae and Kkwachu?

399
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,338
No, I'm too high up to see.

400
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,341
Are they there?

401
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,510
-I think they are.
-I can't see very well.

402
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,595
I think something's in there.

403
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,513
No?

404
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,597
IT'S HARD FOR HER TO SEE

405
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,976
We made it this far together.

406
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,103
You said we were family.

407
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,816
We have to get to somewhere safe together.

408
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,735
I think there's someone in number ten.

409
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,280
I think they're inside.

410
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,115
Tsuki, are you in number ten?

411
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,325
Number 17?

412
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,036
Tsuki, you're in number 17?

413
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,249
I can't hear you clearly.
The walkie-talkie isn't working well.

414
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,752
TSUKI'S GOTTEN MUCH BETTER AT LYING

415
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,715
-Who's in number ten?
-Hold on.

416
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,341
They're hiding under towels.

417
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,140
HONG-CHUL, DINDIN, AND TSUKI
SAFELY OVERCOME THE CRISIS

418
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,065
Na-rae, Kkwachu,
do you want us to come out and talk?

419
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,525
HE EMPLOYS A DIVERSIONARY TACTIC

420
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,526
Hong-chul.

421
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,322
Will you do that?
I'll open the door for you. What number?

422
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,657
You can't see me? Just open it now.

423
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,992
HIS TARGETS ARE
DEX, PATRICIA, AND SI-YOUNG

424
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,202
Someone's inside?

425
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,496
It's almost time, so open the doors.
We'll come out.

426
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,748
Open them all.

427
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,876
He's really terrible.

428
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,170
I don't think he's in there.

429
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,509
Na-rae, I can see the boat now.
We'd better go now. Open the doors.

430
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,970
So where are you?

431
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,349
The boat is here. We have to go now.

432
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,184
Let's escape. Hurry and open the door.

433
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,268
DINDIN JOINS IN

434
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,813
I don't think he's in there.

435
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,273
THEY'LL BE PUT IN DANGER AT THIS RATE!

436
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,525
Please open it for me.
I want to get out now.

437
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,819
Where are you?

438
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,948
Where the hell are you?

439
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,577
Na-rae, can you see me?

440
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,667
Kkwachu Hyung, why are you outside?

441
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,921
Dex, what number is your car?

442
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,299
I'm right in front of you.

443
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,719
DEX SHOWED HIMSELF WITHOUT HIDING

444
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,097
-I'm right in front of you.
-My gosh.

445
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,723
He's going for the classic tactic.

446
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,601
Let's all get out now.

447
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,562
Are you in this one? Talk to me.

448
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,482
Yes, I'm here, Na-rae. Are you okay?

449
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,156
I'm right in front of you.

450
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,420
Oh, my goodness!

451
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,507
DEX SAVED HIS TEAMMATES
EVERY TIME THEY FACED DANGER

452
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,552
THE LEADER CONFIDENTLY REVEALED HIMSELF
AS HE HAS NOTHING TO FEAR

453
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,555
Hyung, I don't think it's this one.

454
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,270
-We're doomed.
-Hong-chul, Dex revealed himself

455
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,315
knowing they won't kill him
so he just passed through.

456
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,649
Are you serious?

457
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,942
He was acting all kind.

458
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,404
That punk was like,
"Na-rae, are you okay? You look so pale."

459
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,783
We're going to die. We'll all be killed.

460
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,830
The one that just passed by
isn't our target.

461
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,333
IT SEEMS LIKE
NA-RAE CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS DEX

462
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,834
Are you okay?

463
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,462
What are your car numbers?

464
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,379
PATRICIA IS NEXT

465
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,257
Na-rae.

466
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,925
It's me. Open it now.

467
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,053
Hyung, is someone there?

468
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,805
It seems like someone's in there,

469
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,849
-but I'm not sure.
-I love you, Na-rae.

470
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,311
No, not this one.

471
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,440
No, not this one.

472
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,783
I was so scared just now
that I almost wet my pants.

473
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,744
SI-YOUNG'S CAR IS HEADING DOWN NOW

474
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,329
Na-rae, you're okay, right?

475
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,122
Are you okay?

476
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,926
I can't see anything.

477
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,219
-I can't see.
-Watch out.

478
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,720
I don't think anyone's inside.

479
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,851
It's hard to stay alive.

480
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:20,232
Both Patricia and Dex
passed through safely.

481
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,234
They're waiting for you and me.

482
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,319
No!

483
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,614
We went through so much to come this far.

484
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,951
Gosh, what do we do?

485
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,077
Hyung.

486
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,245
THEY COULDN'T FIND THEIR TARGETS

487
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,372
There are two in one car
and one in another.

488
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,125
-What?
-If each of them was riding alone.

489
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,130
They have 18 minutes left
until they turn into zombies.

490
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,342
IT'S HONG-CHUL, DINDIN,
AND TSUKI'S TURN AGAIN

491
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,177
It's coming.

492
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,721
It's coming.

493
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,851
-Are they there?
-I see Kkwachu Hyung.

494
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,269
Yes. Na-rae's there too.

495
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,980
Let me just check one last time.

496
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,690
Tsuki, are we next?

497
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,108
No, it's Hong-chul.

498
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,579
Do you see him?

499
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,747
Of course, he's hiding. Think about it.

500
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,333
It's because I really can't see.

501
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,806
Do you see him?

502
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,268
THEY CAN'T SEE THE PERSON
HIDING ON THE FLOOR

503
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:43,565
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH!

504
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,195
IF HONG-CHUL PASSES THROUGH SAFELY,
THEY'LL BE IN DANGER

505
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,534
Who's in number nine?

506
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,042
Who's in number nine?

507
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,794
Hong-chul is there.

508
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,094
TSUKI SELLS HONG-CHUL OUT!

509
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,180
(HA)

510
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,933
Let's not expose each other's car numbers.
Don't be cruel.

511
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,351
You can't disclose my number, okay?

512
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,518
THE PROMISE WAS BROKEN…

513
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,063
As long as no one exposes me,
I think I'll be safe in here.

514
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,358
I don't think they'll kill you, Tsuki.

515
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,069
-Why not?
-They have no reason to kill you.

516
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,322
BUT SINCE THEY'RE IN THE SAME CAR,
THEY SHARE THE SAME FATE

517
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,824
They hate me or Hong-chul.

518
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
What should we do?

519
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,288
I think it'll be better
to reveal ourselves once.

520
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,832
Right, they don't know that I'm with you.

521
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,336
If they let you pass through,
then I'll be safe too.

522
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,756
Will you be okay with that?
What if they open the door?

523
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,174
If they do, then we'll die.

524
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,011
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
THEY'LL BE DEAD INSTANTLY!

525
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,597
SO THEY MAKE A FINAL BET

526
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,599
Hong-chul is there.

527
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,811
Tsuki, is this the one?

528
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,479
Yes, the red one that you're looking…

529
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,985
Hong-chul is there.

530
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,361
Hong-chul is in number nine?

531
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,160
Wait, I think someone's in number ten.

532
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,040
Are you okay?

533
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,417
Are you okay?

534
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,584
Are you okay?

535
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,585
SHE COPIES THE LEADER!

536
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,672
-Did you see her?
-I'm over here.

537
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,881
-Let's go inside.
-Did you see Tsuki?

538
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,008
Are you okay?

539
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,843
Number ten, Tsuki and DinDin.

540
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,387
HE BELATEDLY THROWS A SMOKE GRENADE

541
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,805
Tsuki and DinDin.

542
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,224
Number ten. Hey, DinDin.

543
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,230
My legs are shaky.

544
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,649
Gosh, I'm so scared.

545
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,738
-Let's open the doors.
-Even my legs are shaky.

546
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,156
How were you able to stand?

547
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,574
I was doing this.

548
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,825
So what happened?

549
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,076
I don't know.

550
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,245
Why are you all hiding?

551
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,707
We have no reason to hide from them.
What's with you all?

552
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,750
Everyone,

553
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,921
if we survive,
let's not see each other again.

554
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,759
I already said that earlier.

555
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,761
Let's part ways
as soon as we get off the boat.

556
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,012
IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR JOURNEY TOGETHER
WILL END HERE

557
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,599
They have 13 minutes left
until they turn into zombies.

558
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,100
Is he really in number nine?

559
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,729
Tsuki said he was in number nine.

560
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,647
-We have to go.
-Do you think Hong-chul was really there?

561
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,941
-We have to get on the boat.
-Everyone can listen to that channel.

562
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,318
He would've said something.

563
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,653
Hong-chul is there.

564
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,323
Right. He would've said something.

565
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,742
IT DOES SEEM ODD
THAT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

566
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,994
Numbers 3, 9, 10, 17, and 23

567
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,579
were empty.

568
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,123
But Tsuki was definitely in number ten.

569
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,750
Dex was in number ten something.

570
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:54,005
-Dex, Patricia, and Tsuki were alone.
-Right.

571
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,966
But I didn't see DinDin. Where did he go?

572
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,136
Open the door!

573
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,888
What do we do then?

574
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,518
The ones we have yet to confirm
are Hong-chul, Si-young, and DinDin.

575
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,645
Si-young might get unlucky.

576
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,483
SI-YOUNG BECAME ONE OF THE TARGETS
BECAUSE SHE HID HERSELF

577
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,528
My gosh. What do we do, DinDin?

578
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,779
We're not going to die.

579
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,614
We'll survive.

580
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,491
I'm going to wet my pants.

581
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,745
-It's definitely not number nine.
-No?

582
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,288
-It's not number ten.
-It's not?

583
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,665
Maybe number three.

584
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,500
-Number three…
-What do I do?

585
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,837
EVERYTHING IS CONFUSING!

586
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,756
Hong-chul is there.

587
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,425
Can I trust Tsuki?

588
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,010
Tsuki, they should sleep outside, right?

589
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,347
IT'S ACTUALLY QUESTIONABLE
WHETHER TSUKI IS TRUSTWORTHY

590
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,599
Tsuki, what if he was your family?

591
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,519
Would you leave them
if this happened to your family in Japan?

592
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,979
I'll let you choose.

593
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,981
Gosh, what do I do?

594
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,400
Na-rae and Kkwachu, we need to go now.

595
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,527
If the boat leaves, we'll all be dead!

596
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,116
They have four minutes left
until they turn into zombies.

597
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,828
Everyone.

598
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,789
Thank you and I'm sorry.

599
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,002
But I can't go alone.

600
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,044
I'm sorry.

601
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,047
We'll go together.
You don't need to say sorry.

602
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,759
You aren't going anywhere.
You're coming with us!

603
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,260
The boat is coming!

604
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,887
Just stand there. I'll press it.

605
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,597
You can blame me all you want.

606
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,934
It's time to stop the roulette.

607
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,812
This is the last choice…

608
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,814
I can make.

609
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,329
Kkwachu Hyung…

610
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,499
Please stop it now.

611
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
What's going on?

612
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,510
What? Why did it suddenly stop?

613
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,094
Oh, my gosh!

614
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,179
Did it stop?

615
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,056
Tsuki, which one is it?

616
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,952
They're holding it shut.

617
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,414
Who's in that red one?

618
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,550
They're holding it shut.

619
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,596
Who is it?

620
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,934
She opened it!

621
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,894
Did she open the door?

622
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,688
She opened it.

623
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,731
My goodness.

624
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,735
This is insane. Oh, no.

625
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,494
Stop it at number nine.

626
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,412
Okay.

627
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,038
I have a feeling it's number nine.

628
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,603
-Who is it?
-Gosh, this is crazy.

629
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,025
I found you, Ro Hong-chul.

630
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,822
Take him with us.

631
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,369
I found you, Ro Hong-chul.

632
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:12,221
5:58 A.M.
HONG-CHUL IS LOCKED UP WITH NA-RAE

633
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,464
How did you know?

634
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,388
How did you figure it out?

635
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,849
Ro Hong-chul.

636
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,019
Hong-chul.

637
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,444
Hong-chul was so nice to me.

638
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,950
What?

639
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,035
It's moving.

640
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,788
Doctor Kkwachu is outside

641
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,623
and Na-rae is inside the car.

642
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,876
We're safe.

643
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,253
We are?

644
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,754
We're safe!

645
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,673
-Can I get up now?
-DinDin!

646
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,092
Na-rae is in the car in front of us.

647
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,808
How did we survive?

648
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,268
I was so scared.

649
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,352
Good work.

650
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,443
Hong-chul!

651
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,902
How did you figure it out?

652
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,492
HE MIGHT DIE FROM LAUGHING
BEFORE GETTING BITTEN TO DEATH

653
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,369
-I got you.
-Darn it.

654
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,538
How did you figure it out?

655
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,458
Tsuki told me.

656
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,424
-Oh, no.
-You should've been nicer.

657
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,385
Tsuki told me right away,
"Ro Hong-chul is in number nine."

658
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,804
Those bastards.

659
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,681
I'm sure DinDin talked her into it.

660
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,059
Which channel? Channel one?

661
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,520
-What?
-Did you use a different channel?

662
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,813
You couldn't hear it?

663
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,940
No, I couldn't.

664
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,275
I wonder why.

665
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,778
I was startled,
so I accidentally changed the channel.

666
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,529
Darn it.

667
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,907
Tsuki, is this the one?

668
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,658
Yes, the red one that you're looking…

669
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,453
HE MISSED THE ASSASSINATION PLOT
BECAUSE HE WAS ON A DIFFERENT CHANNEL

670
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,121
Number ten, Tsuki and DinDin.

671
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,832
HE WAS SCHEMING
WITHOUT KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO DIE

672
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,501
Darn it.

673
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,802
The final destination that Hong-chul
had been sprinting toward was Na-rae.

674
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,096
Na-rae, I gotta go.

675
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,432
The coward who always fled by himself.
What a lucky guy.

676
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,644
-Bye.
-You coward.

677
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,313
If only he had gotten in the car
with someone else…

678
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,607
I don't think they'll kill you, Tsuki.

679
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,318
Right, they don't know that I'm with you.

680
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,405
…then he wouldn't
have gotten caught so easily.

681
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,244
DINDIN SURVIVED TO THE END
USING TSUKI AS HIS SHIELD

682
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,079
The value of teamwork.

683
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,165
We always made it when we were together.

684
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,000
-We never came close to danger.
-Right.

685
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:32,964
Heartfelt condolences to unlucky Hong-chul
who briefly forgot about this.

686
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,924
Goodbye!

687
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,592
This is so upsetting.

688
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,344
I'm so upset.

689
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,399
Kkwachu Hyung is still there.

690
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,068
I think Kkwachu will kill someone too.

691
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,703
Are you okay?

692
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,081
Tsuki and I passed.

693
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,418
I'll see you all later.

694
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,045
-Who is it?
-No!

695
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,257
Dex!

696
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,218
Dex? What about him?

697
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,679
What happened? What's going on?

698
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,347
Does anyone know?

699
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,557
Jex got caught.

700
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,058
It's Jex.

701
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,560
IT'S DEX, NOT JEX

702
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,354
No!

703
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,648
Come out.

704
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,277
-Hyung.
-No, I'm fine.

705
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,446
-Be careful.
-I thought I was going to die, Hyung.

706
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,531
No, it's okay.
Take care. Go get on the boat.

707
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,824
I'm sorry, Hyung.

708
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
It's okay.

709
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,204
-I'm sorry.
-Go now.

710
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,788
You have to survive.

711
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,839
Save me!

712
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,382
He's coming!

713
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,260
Come out. I'll let you live.

714
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,637
-What?
-Get out. I'll let you live.

715
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,138
Go get on the boat.

716
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,556
-For real?
-Yes.

717
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,976
You saved my life. I love you!

718
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,645
I really love you so much!

719
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,606
SHE SURE RUNS FAST
FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES HIM

720
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,944
Do I get off?

721
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,863
-I'll let you live. Come out.
-Okay.

722
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,365
Survive and get on the boat.

723
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,242
What's going on?

724
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,245
EVERYONE QUICKLY RUNS AWAY

725
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,789
-Come out.
-No!

726
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,625
Save me! No, please don't!

727
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,835
No!

728
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,421
-Come out. I'll let you live.
-You're letting us live?

729
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,216
-You two were together? Darn it.
-You're letting us live?

730
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,884
-Tsuki, hurry.
-Come out now.

731
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,594
-I'll let you live.
-Thank you.

732
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,304
Make sure to survive.

733
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,098
-Thank you!
-Go now.

734
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,075
I'm getting sleepy.

735
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,584
Did you think you'd survive, Hong-chul?

736
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,214
An evil person like you must be punished.

737
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,585
Stop.

738
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,211
Stop!

739
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,089
I'm sorry about the forklift.

740
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,342
I'm sorry about the forklift.

741
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,554
Kkwachu Hyung has died.

742
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,223
Park Na-rae has died.

743
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,352
Ro Hong-chul has died.

744
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,028
6:55 A.M.
MINUS 13 DEGREES CELSIUS

745
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,488
It's so cold.

746
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,573
We have to hurry.

747
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,158
Is the boat here?

748
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,284
It's over there, right?

749
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,911
-It's over there!
-Over there!

750
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,913
-Is it over there?
-Is it where we went yesterday?

751
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,373
-The boat is there!
-It is?

752
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,874
SURVIVED

753
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,667
-We have to hurry.
-There's the boat!

754
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,461
It's not too late.

755
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,673
THEY ARRIVED RIGHT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK!

756
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,716
Hurry.

757
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,967
Does the gate open?

758
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,554
Sir!

759
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,681
-Please help us!
-Over here!

760
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,141
-Over here!
-Over here!

761
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,645
-Over here!
-Sir!

762
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,938
-Captain!
-Over here!

763
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,856
-We're over here!
-Hey!

764
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,108
-What's wrong with them?
-Over here!

765
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,901
-No!
-Over here!

766
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,529
-We're over here!
-Please let us get on!

767
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,406
-Sir!
-Captain, we're over here!

768
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,659
THE NAME OF THE BOAT IS HARMONI…
IS IT HARMONICA BY ANY CHANCE?

769
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,411
This isn't it!

770
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,704
-What is he saying?
-That's the boat. What's the issue?

771
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,705
-This way!
-Sir!

772
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,332
-We're over here!
-Come this way!

773
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,168
-It's the right boat!
-They're so loud.

774
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,878
-Sir!
-Where are you going?

775
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,880
THE CAPTAIN IGNORES
THE SURVIVORS AND GOES IN?!

776
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,923
Please!

777
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,551
-Hey!
-It's so cold! Please let us on!

778
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,430
THE BOAT IS RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES,
BUT THEY HAVE NO WAY OF GETTING THERE

779
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,014
Should we just jump in the water?

780
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,058
-It's just right there.
-I think the water

781
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,102
is at least three meters deep.

782
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,441
-What's that?
-A rope?

783
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,984
Should we weave it and throw it?

784
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,027
Let's weave it, throw it,
and then pull it.

785
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,237
-Let's try it.
-Let's go.

786
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,738
You can do it!

787
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,866
-Wow!
-Okay!

788
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,996
-It worked!
-Pull!

789
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,832
-Pull!
-Pull harder!

790
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,333
It's not working!

791
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,419
It won't budge!

792
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,754
Si-young, look at that.

793
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,840
-That's a good idea.
-Right.

794
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,092
Let's put that down and stand on top.

795
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,344
-Let's put it in the water.
-I see. Use it like a boat?

796
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,014
-Yes.
-One person crosses and we pull from here.

797
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,349
FINAL QUEST
GET ON THE RESCUE BOAT

798
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,103
EVERYONE MUST GET ON THE BOAT
WITHOUT THE CAPTAIN NOTICING

799
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,105
-I'll test it.
-No.

800
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,024
-You're going to go?
-We don't have time. We have to hurry.

801
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,525
I'll test it.

802
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,028
THE COMMANDER GATHERS UP COURAGE
ONE LAST TIME!

803
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,905
Okay, then DinDin should go first.

804
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,115
Be careful.

805
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,159
I'll go now.

806
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,456
-Hey!
-DinDin.

807
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,419
YOU COULD HAVE A HEART ATTACK
FALLING INTO THE FREEZING COLD WATER

808
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,004
Wow. Shit.

809
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,882
We have to pull it tight from behind him.

810
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,594
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE REMAINING
PULL THE ROPE

811
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,304
It's working.

812
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,889
He's crossing smoothly.

813
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,810
-I made it!
-You made it! Okay!

814
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,854
-Who wants to go next?
-Next?

815
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,439
Dex, you need to go first.

816
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,192
-He can help me.
-You can help Patricia with DinDin.

817
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,568
-Okay, I'll go first then.
-Okay.

818
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,614
You have to release it.

819
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,288
You can get up, right?

820
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:22,957
DEX ALSO GOT ON

821
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,291
Okay. It's working.

822
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,001
Patricia, do you want to go next?

823
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,837
-Is it okay if I go?
-Yes, go and hold the rope for us.

824
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,423
I'm scared!

825
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,889
-Hey, what's wrong?
-No!

826
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,227
SHE ALMOST MET WITH LEVIATHAN
BEFORE EVEN GETTING ON

827
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,521
-Are you okay?
-Pull her up first!

828
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,189
-Are you okay?
-I was trying to go forward,

829
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,399
but I couldn't.

830
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,277
Are you okay?

831
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,862
I should've been the last one.

832
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,947
-I'm so scared.
-It's scary.

833
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,532
-Tsuki, go first.
-Tsuki, go ahead.

834
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,825
I'll go first. Okay.

835
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,077
TSUKI GOES IN PATRICIA'S STEAD

836
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,245
Hold this.

837
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,663
Tsuki, be careful.

838
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,873
-No!
-Tsuki, be careful.

839
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,167
You can do it.

840
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,460
SHE FOUND A STABLE POSITION!

841
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,920
Tsuki, pull the rope.

842
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,630
Hurry!

843
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,341
Tsuki, there's a ladder.

844
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,509
A ladder?

845
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,928
Hold her hand.

846
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,098
Oh, no.

847
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,016
Wait!

848
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,851
Oh, no. Hey!

849
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,938
Wow, it's so scary.

850
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,690
Lower your leg.

851
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,691
Oh, no.

852
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,109
It's so scary.

853
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,820
Hold my hand.

854
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,947
-Can you come up, Dex?
-Okay.

855
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,325
THANKS TO THE LEADER, TSUKI MADE IT UP TOO

856
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,334
Wait, my groin.

857
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,502
OH, NO! THAT'S NOT GOOD!

858
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,795
-Why, you…
-Wait.

859
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,632
Wait. Here, I'll take it out.

860
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,259
Excuse me.

861
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,638
-I didn't mean to.
-It hurt.

862
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,308
Si-young, we need to decide
who will go next.

863
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,310
I'll stay behind. You go, Si-young.

864
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,187
No, you go. It's okay.

865
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,230
THE SUBLEADER CHOOSES TO STAY BEHIND

866
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,067
Will you really be able to do it alone?

867
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
Better me than you.

868
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,444
-Are you sure?
-I need to hold it for you.

869
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,820
THERE'S NO NEED FOR HER TO WORRY

870
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,821
Okay, understood.

871
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,365
You need to hurry!

872
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,408
Okay, sit down.

873
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,951
-Oh, gosh!
-Sit down.

874
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,580
IT'S VERY UNSTABLE FROM THE START!

875
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,956
Sit down.

876
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,209
You got it?

877
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,877
-Try to balance!
-Okay.

878
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,629
-I'll hold on to it.
-Si-young.

879
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,506
Oh, my gosh!

880
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,093
-Mom!
-Hurry!

881
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,930
I really hate this!

882
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,390
The water is so salty!

883
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,517
It's dangerous.

884
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,893
How will I get up?

885
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,605
Stop there for now and try to stand up.

886
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,274
I have to stand up? I don't think I can.

887
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,776
Patricia, try to stand up.

888
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,735
This?

889
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,864
Hurry up, zombies are here!

890
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,163
THE ZOMBIES RUSHED OVER ALREADY!

891
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:13,585
Oh no.

892
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,131
Wait.

893
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,799
Wait. Not yet.

894
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,385
-Stand up now!
-Stand up.

895
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,554
Si-young needs to cross too.

896
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,516
Patricia, we don't have time.
Zombies are coming. Hurry!

897
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,601
I'll just die!

898
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,727
No!

899
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,937
HER FRIENDS ALREADY FEEL LIKE DYING!

900
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,442
Put your leg up on here at once.

901
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,526
Put it up here!

902
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,028
-Lift your leg up high.
-Oh, gosh!

903
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,240
Oh, my gosh!

904
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,494
Dex!

905
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,206
No!

906
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,207
Patricia!

907
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,169
Mom!

908
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,382
What do I do?

909
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,397
Dex, I'm sorry.

910
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,192
-I got wet.
-Hold on.

911
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,818
Hold on, Patricia.

912
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,613
-This won't work.
-It won't work.

913
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,822
Patricia, let's go back.

914
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,866
Si-young's in danger!

915
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,827
I really hate that!

916
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,329
The zombies…

917
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,123
Seriously.

918
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,669
Hurry! We're running out of time!

919
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,922
-Let's try it! Get on now.
-No!

920
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,591
-Let's try it.
-The zombies are coming.

921
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,717
-Let's go.
-Wait.

922
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,135
-You can do it.
-Let's try it.

923
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,429
-You need to keep your balance.
-Oh, gosh!

924
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,265
I'm going to develop a phobia!

925
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,643
Patricia, we need to hurry!

926
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,187
-We'll come in one go!
-We're coming!

927
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,104
In one go?

928
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,857
Si-young, hurry! We don't have time.
The boat will sail!

929
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,275
Patricia, you'll be fine!

930
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,903
What? What's all the commotion?

931
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,405
OH, NO! THE CAPTAIN WOKE UP
AT THE COMMOTION

932
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,615
It's so loud.

933
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,742
My goodness.

934
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,202
-Let's go.
-But…

935
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,578
Dex!

936
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,748
-Three of them?
-In one go?

937
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,125
-They'll come in one go?
-Hey!

938
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,628
What? This isn't a fishing boat.

939
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,713
Go find another fishing boat!

940
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,840
-What's all this?
-What are you doing?

941
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,259
-Why did you tie this?
-Hold on!

942
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,885
You can't untie that!

943
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,137
-There are zombies.
-Sir!

944
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,764
We're coming!

945
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,723
-You can't untie it.
-Sir!

946
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,100
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't untie it.

947
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,393
Tsuki, pull it!

948
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,228
-Sir!
-No!

949
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,522
-We're coming!
-Tsuki!

950
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,940
-They have to come!
-No.

951
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,066
Sir!

952
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,526
-What's wrong with you people?
-Sir!

953
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,694
This isn't a fishing boat.

954
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,279
What? The rope came undone.

955
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,115
The rope is undone.

956
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,210
This is my boat…
Miss, you'll fall into the water.

957
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,753
-Come here.
-No.

958
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,840
What the heck?

959
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,758
Sir!

960
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,180
Sir, what's your name?

961
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,353
No!

962
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,482
Tsuki!

963
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,237
-Guys! Tsuki!
-Sir!

964
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,157
-Don't go!
-Sir!

965
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,618
Sir!

966
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,996
We were almost there, man!

967
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,873
You bastard!

968
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,542
You can take us with you!

969
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,961
Sir, I don't even know how to swim!

970
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,092
I'm going to remember this!

971
00:48:56,808 --> 00:49:00,187
Guys, you have to come back and rescue us!

972
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,565
-We'll come back!
-We promise to come back!

973
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,067
DinDin!

974
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,654
You know the coordinates, right?
Come rescue us. We'll be waiting!

975
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,947
Fuck!

976
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,619
There are zombies.

977
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,412
-Zombies…
-What's with you people?

978
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,206
You keep saying zombies.

979
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,249
There are zombies everywhere right now!

980
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,002
That's why we fled and got on here!

981
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,590
My gosh.

982
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,635
What do we do? We can't go back.

983
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,928
What do we do?

984
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,105
What are you doing?

985
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,691
It's okay, Patricia. I'll handle it.

986
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,942
-What?
-Hold on.

987
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,945
-What?
-Hold on. I'm going in.

988
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,364
-What are you doing, Dex?
-Oh, no. Hey!

989
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,907
-Hey, Dex!
-Let's go.

990
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,535
How is he so fearless?

991
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,453
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

992
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,163
Let's go.

993
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,170
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm okay.

994
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,463
I'm okay.

995
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,633
THE OCEAN IS MINUS 13 DEGREES CELSIUS,
BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY

996
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,802
Let's get up there first. Hurry.

997
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,220
Go up.

998
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,142
Are you okay?

999
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:24,104
IN THE END, THEY LEFT

1000
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,483
THE THREE

1001
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,819
WHO WERE ABANDONED

1002
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,822
REMAIN

1003
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,662
THE SURVIVORS ENDED UP
WITH DIFFERENT FATES ONCE AGAIN

1004
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,414
-We have to get them on the boat!
-Please, sir.

1005
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,832
-Get off me!
-Please, sir.

1006
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,542
-Please turn the boat around!
-Wait!

1007
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,544
Didn't you see? There were zombies.

1008
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,213
So what are zombies anyway?

1009
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,506
You haven't seen them yet?

1010
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,051
I have no idea.
I went fishing and came back after a week.

1011
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,386
-He doesn't know.
-Right.

1012
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,014
What is a zombie?
Why do you ask me to let them on?

1013
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,307
What? Let zombies get on?

1014
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,353
-Sir, behind you!
-What?

1015
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,521
-Sir!
-Behind you!

1016
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,651
-Behind you!
-Gosh, seriously!

1017
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,071
Are you with them?

1018
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,200
Why do you keep getting on?
This isn't your boat!

1019
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,454
THE CAPTAIN IS VERY STRONG!

1020
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,373
Darn it. Because you guys got on,
look what happened.

1021
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,584
-They all try to get on.
-It's not that…

1022
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,586
Damn it.

1023
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,175
That was a zombie, right?

1024
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:37,761
That was a zombie?

1025
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,431
What's his deal? He's so strong.

1026
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,516
I know.

1027
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,268
That man is very strong.

1028
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,186
I know.

1029
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,772
If we stay with him, we'll be safe.

1030
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,775
-Let's just stay quiet for now.
-Should we?

1031
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,610
We survived in the end.

1032
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,614
We can come back later to rescue them.

1033
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,615
THEY DECIDE TO STAY QUIET…

1034
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,210
What the heck?

1035
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,670
They're opening the gate.

1036
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,472
Wait.

1037
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,517
What do we do?

1038
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,020
We worked so hard to escape from them!

1039
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,945
-What?
-What's that?

1040
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,909
-What's that?
-What's that?

1041
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:56,882
It's a bus!

1042
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,717
Over here. This way!

1043
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,926
-Over here!
-Sir!

1044
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,512
-Over here!
-Over here!

1045
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,601
Hey!

1046
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,561
-Please open the door!
-Open the door!

1047
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,812
Let's go!

1048
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,189
Get on.

1049
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,107
Hurry.

1050
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,359
Get on.

1051
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,866
Gosh, that was too…

1052
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,284
Oh, gosh.

1053
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,662
There are passengers.

1054
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,414
These are the only survivors?

1055
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,294
Sorry I'm a little late.

1056
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,754
It was Kim Sal-man, right?

1057
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,048
-Sorry?
-Hello.

1058
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,425
Aren't you Sal-man's people?

1059
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,594
-Sal-man?
-Sal-man?

1060
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,472
This must be what
the journalist told us about.

1061
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,640
-What?
-The journalist…

1062
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,058
It was this bus.

1063
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,100
It wasn't the boat?

1064
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,310
Then they…

1065
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,228
-What was that boat then?
-Where did they go?

1066
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,813
Are you saying this is it?

1067
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:02,155
THE COORDINATES
THAT JOURNALIST KIM SAL-MAN GAVE THEM

1068
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,203
THEY WERE COORDINATES FOR A BUS?!

1069
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,496
Hey, young fellows!

1070
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,331
Come over here.

1071
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,626
-What is it?
-Well…

1072
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,003
I gave it some thought.

1073
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,588
Here. Put these on first.

1074
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,715
Yes, put them on.

1075
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,258
-Here you go.
-Me too?

1076
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,344
Put it on.

1077
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,720
Good.

1078
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,263
Just like that.

1079
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,306
THIS WASN'T A RESCUE BOAT!

1080
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,308
They fit you perfectly.

1081
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,560
Let's go fishing

1082
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,145
Wait.

1083
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,398
-What?
-Journalist Kim Sal-man…

1084
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,649
Kim Sal-man?

1085
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,984
-Yes.
-Yes.

1086
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,027
Who the heck is Kim Sal-man?

1087
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,238
How am I supposed to know him?

1088
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,572
You don't know him?

1089
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,866
No, I don't.

1090
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,326
Great. Let's go!

1091
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,953
I like them.

1092
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,496
No way.

1093
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,042
Did we get on the wrong boat?

1094
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,879
Please…

1095
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,924
I need to catch my breath.

1096
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,260
We almost died.

1097
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,679
We'll depart now.

1098
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,931
-Please go anywhere for now.
-Please depart.

1099
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,933
-As soon as possible.
-Thank you.

1100
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,229
We survived.

1101
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,108
-Anywhere but here… What?
-Sir.

1102
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,776
Where are we going?

1103
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,611
Sir, we're heading to the ocean.

1104
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,280
-Sir!
-Where are you going? Wait.

1105
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,906
Let me put on my seat belt.

1106
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:27,824
Sir!

1107
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,826
Wait!

1108
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,888
What is this?

1109
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,477
This wasn't an ordinary bus?

1110
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,606
THIS IS

1111
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,399
THE REAL

1112
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,484
RESCUE BOAT

1113
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,360
I've never been on something like this.

1114
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,529
-I've never seen something like this.
-Sir.

1115
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,573
This is so cool.

1116
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,075
My goodness.

1117
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,539
-We're safe!
-We're in the ocean.

1118
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,042
-What? We're not sinking?
-We're safe!

1119
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,337
-We're safe!
-We're safe!

1120
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,005
-We're safe!
-Bye!

1121
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,341
-Good work, guys.
-We're off!

1122
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,926
I feel so emotional.

1123
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,011
We almost died.

1124
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,517
But what about Hong-chul,
Na-rae, and Kkwachu?

1125
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,853
-I feel bad.
-I wish they were here with us.

1126
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,021
By the way,

1127
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,398
are you really that uncoordinated?

1128
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,234
SHE LET OUT THE WORDS
SHE'S BEEN DYING TO SAY!

1129
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,236
-How could you not do that?
-I mean…

1130
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,946
I couldn't handle my weight.

1131
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:51,324
To be honest, I really resented you then.

1132
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,868
-But we got on this thanks to you.
-Now…

1133
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,205
-We got on this one.
-I felt so bad.

1134
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,332
SUCH IS LIFE

1135
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,416
We got so lucky.

1136
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,462
But what did DinDin and Tsuki get on then?

1137
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,547
Tell me about it.

1138
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,048
KIM SAL-MAN

1139
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,804
We're doomed.

1140
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,600
"The Atlantic Ocean Tuna"?

1141
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,103
Is that his name? "Atlantic Ocean"?

1142
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,604
-No.
-"Tuna"?

1143
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,024
We're going to go catch maguro.

1144
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,944
-"Maguro," as in tuna fish.
-Maguro?

1145
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,737
Us?

1146
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,907
We're screwed.

1147
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,909
"The Atlantic Ocean…"

1148
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:41,624
It's been 61 hours
since the outbreak of the zombie crisis.

1149
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,335
Lee Si-young,

1150
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,504
Patricia,

1151
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,923
Dex,

1152
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,509
Tsuki,

1153
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,972
and DinDin survived.

1154
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,605
1 YEAR LATER

1155
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,487
Eat this.

1156
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:56,866
All of it.

1157
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,440
Great vibes.

1158
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:53,590
