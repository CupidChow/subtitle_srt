4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,891
Hello, this is Ro Hong-chul. I'm alive.

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,981
I believe Park Na-rae and DinDin
have been contaminated.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,901
I'm sure they got bitten,
but they're denying it.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,611
-What are you talking about?
-Now…

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,739
Jung-yoon, it's Mommy. I'm okay.

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,198
What's going on?

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,658
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,786
I promise I'll come to you.
You'll be good, right, Jung-yoon?

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,704
Momma.

13
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,705
What do we do?

14
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,748
-No!
-Oh, no!

15
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,710
The pin for my bank account
is your birthday, okay, Mom?

16
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,670
Mom, Dad!

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,465
I hope you're doing well.

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,386
-I don't know how things in the world…
-Give it to me!

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,554
-…will change.
-Give me that!

20
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,556
DinDin and Na-rae
seem to have been bitten.

21
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,267
We didn't! I told you we didn't!

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,836
Na-rae, Na-rae.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,338
-I…
-Oppa.

24
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,382
-Oppa!
-Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh. What is it?

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,467
Wait.

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,593
Oh, my gosh!

27
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,513
-I see smoke.
-What do we do?

28
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,348
-What if it explodes?
-We crashed.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,766
-Unni.
-Oh, no.

30
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,227
Director?

31
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,229
Director.

32
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,274
Oh, no. What do we do?

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,944
-Director!
-What happened to him?

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,029
No, he isn't dead.

35
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,239
Yeah, he's dead.
He's gone. He's dead.

36
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,698
-No, he isn't.
-Oh, we lost him.

37
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,033
He isn't breathing.

38
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,493
-He isn't breathing?
-Hey, DinDin.

39
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,036
What do we do? I'm scared.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,705
Hey, guys. There are more in front of us.
There are more of them.

41
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,005
Let's go inside first and then talk.
Let's hide.

42
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,841
-Come on.
-Wait, we can't leave the director.

43
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,217
If this explodes, we'll all die.

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,678
-May he rest in peace.
-Huh?

45
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,346
HE'S MOVED ON QUICKLY!

46
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,973
Gosh, seriously.
What's wrong with you, oppa?

47
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,599
-You're terrible.
-Let's live.

48
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,143
-Guys, come on. Look at the smoke.
-There are so many zombies.

49
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,562
Come on, let's just let him
rest in peace and go already!

50
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,147
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,523
Oh, heavens. I'm sorry.

52
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,650
Let's go over there
where the light is on.

53
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,651
11:58 PM
THEY LAY HIM AND HIS HEADPHONES TO REST

54
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,112
-We have to go now.
-Wait, I see people lying dead over there.

55
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,446
The supermarket.

56
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,198
But there are zombies over there.

57
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,284
-Then Na-rae, get on my back.
-Hey, do you see this?

58
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,369
-No, unni, you can't carry me.
-I'm gonna open the door, all right?

59
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,413
I can do this, really. Are you over 60 kg?

60
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,748
Uh, over 60 kg? Well, not
according to my official profile.

61
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,875
…IT SEEMS THAT SHE IS!

62
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,546
Bend your legs
just a little more, Na-rae. Hurry!

63
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,885
Oh, no.

64
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,928
They're eating them.

65
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,347
Oh, my gosh. All those people. Oh, no!

66
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,557
Help! Please help me up!

67
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,268
Please help me up.

68
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,896
-I'm sorry.
-Hurry. Come on, hurry up!

69
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,316
-Hyung, hurry up!
-We have to go!

70
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,701
Let's go! Get in here, now!

71
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,244
Come on! Quickly!

72
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,997
Hurry! Let's close the doors.
Come on, oppa, close them now.

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,290
Close it. Come on!

74
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,374
The button, it's here.

75
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,376
What do I do? The doors are opening!

76
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,253
We got it.

77
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,672
Hey.

78
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,924
There may be some in here too.

79
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,052
-Oh, what do we do?
-Wait. Hold on. No. Help me down.

80
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,345
My chest hurts.

81
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,555
-It really hurts.
-Be quiet.

82
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,686
They've arrived at a new place.

83
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,399
A SUPERMARKET IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SEOUL

84
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,946
IT'S EVIDENT THAT
SOMETHING HAS SWEPT THROUGH IT

85
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,783
Is anyone here? Do you see anyone?

86
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,869
There might be some in here too.

87
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,798
What? What?

88
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,842
What? What's wrong? What is it?

89
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,136
What? What? What's wrong?

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,097
What is it? What?

91
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,765
What? What's wrong?

92
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,933
What are you doing? Come on! What is it?

93
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,394
I'm a person!
I am! I'm a person! I'm a person!

94
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,311
Be quiet.

95
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,646
I'm human, really.

96
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,859
GOODNESS! IT WAS JUST
AN EMPLOYEE IN HIDING

97
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,569
Are you sure she wasn't bitten?

98
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,989
There are so many zombies outside.

99
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,615
Are you sure you aren't bitten?

100
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
-Was she bitten?
-I haven't been bitten.

101
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,410
-My crutches.
-Hurry.

102
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,912
-I think we need to go now.
-There's a group of people gathered there.

103
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,414
There.
I think someone's coming.

104
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,748
No, no, no.

105
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,333
OFFICE

106
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,668
-What if she's been bitten?
-Calm down.

107
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,628
-No, she's fine.
-When did they get here?

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,008
The doors will hold.

109
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,092
Dang it.

110
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
-Sir! Wait!
-Over here.

111
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,554
-Sir! Please help us.
-Is it locked?

112
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,014
-Is it?
-It won't open? It's locked?

113
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm… Oh!

114
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,100
-There are a lot of people in there.
-Wait!

115
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,727
I'm TV personality Ro Hong-chul!

116
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,395
-No.
-Don't open it. No, don't.

117
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,896
No, no, no, no.

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,606
-Tell them you're Ro Hong-chul. Come on.
-Please open the door.

119
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
-We're survivors.
-Hello, sir.

120
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,484
I'm TV personality Ro Hong-chul.

121
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,653
I'm Park Na-rae, the comedian.

122
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,530
I'm Tsuki of Billie. Do you know me?

123
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,408
Lee Si-young is here too.
You know her, right?

124
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,828
Oh, gosh. No! Please!
Please hurry!

125
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,621
Please!
Could you open the door?

126
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,165
-I mean…
-Please hurry!

127
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,335
-Please wait. Hold on! Step back!
-Open the door! Please!

128
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,669
The door isn't gonna hold!

129
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,212
Please let us in!

130
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,839
-Check if they've been bitten.
-Yes.

131
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,049
We haven't been bitten.

132
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,093
Hello, sir. I'm Park Na-rae.
Hey, Jonathan, it's you!

133
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,636
-Oh!
-Huh? Jonathan!

134
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,804
-Open the door, Jonathan!
-No, wait.

135
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,805
They'll break through the door any minute.

136
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,890
-No. It's not like that.
-Oh. Hold on.

137
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,767
Okay. Okay. We have a doctor here.

138
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,393
-Doctor?
-When you're a zombie,

139
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,644
your eyes change.

140
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,146
Wait, but he's a urologist.

141
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,731
-But, uh…
-Right, he's a urologist.

142
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,024
You don't wanna come inside?
You're fine out there?

143
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,901
-Fine. Hurry up.
-Your eyes.

144
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,029
-Park Na-rae is okay.
-Come in when you're checked.

145
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,655
That's a relief.

146
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,574
She's okay. Yup, yup, yup. She's fine.

147
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,951
-I'm okay too, right? Aren't I?
-Yes. Okay.

148
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,495
Quickly! She's okay. Yep, all fine.

149
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,622
Hey, DinDin, DinDin,
just show them your eyes.

150
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,207
Show them your eyes.

151
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,172
He's fine. Okay.

152
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,132
Open the door, please.

153
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,050
Open it.

154
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,719
-What's taking them so long?
-Hurry.

155
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,262
-Quickly!
-Quickly! Hurry up!

156
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,305
Hurry! Come on! Let's go!

157
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,432
Man, what took you guys so long
to open the door?

158
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,767
-Close the door.
-Close it. Come on!

159
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,560
-Close it! Close the door!
-Darn it.

160
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,729
-Jeez, I mean…
-Why didn't you open up?

161
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,730
How were you gonna face us later?

162
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
So many people died out there.
What were we supposed to do?

163
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,858
They're right there.
So let's keep it down.

164
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,151
-Shh! Be quiet.
-Let's quiet down. Come on.

165
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,861
Have a seat first.
Take a seat. Sit down.

166
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,863
But what's a group
of celebrities doing together?

167
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,448
We had just finished a shoot.

168
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,958
New survivors have been found.

169
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,126
KKWACHU HYUNG
UROLOGIST

00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,795

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,646
STRANDED WHILE BUYING SNACKS
DURING A DRIVING LESSON

YOO HEE-KWAN, JUNE 1ST, 1986
FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER

178
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,570
STRANDED WHILE BUYING FRUIT
FOR A FRIEND'S HOUSEWARMING PARTY

179
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,032
THERE ARE ALSO SURVIVORS
WHO SEEM TO BE CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES

180
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,868
What happened here?
What's the situation like?

181
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,077
They went through here once.

182
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,620
It's been about an hour
since they invaded.

183
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,122
No one got bitten here?

184
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,540
-No one here got bitten.
-No one.

185
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,542
I told you,
we've been here for more than an hour.

186
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,294
Na-rae, just in case.
Please don't get me wrong.

187
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,087
We should be honest with you too.

188
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,883
We were at the gas station
trying to pump gas,

189
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,594
and she and he slightly came
into contact with them.

190
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,262
-No.
-What's wrong with him?

191
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,055
-No, we didn't.
-Don't talk nonsense. That's not true.

192
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,141
-We have a doctor here.
-Are you kidding me?

193
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,100
There's a doctor here.

194
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,269
Did you see it yourself?
I just got some blood splatter on me.

195
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,440
-I saw it.
-But Na-rae was scratched.

196
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,900
-So stuff like this--
-All right.

197
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,526
I'll tell you
exactly what happened.

198
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,569
OH NO! HONG-CHUL'S WORDS CAUSE A STIR

199
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,696
The blood splattered
and entered through his cornea.

200
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,949
-But they just grazed my leg a little.
-No, she got scratched. Look. There.

201
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,914
I didn't get scratched.
It just slightly grazed me.

202
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,123
If the blood splattered in his eyes,
it's risky.

203
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,667
-Yes, that's risky.
-It didn't get into my eye. It didn't.

204
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,587
So I think we'll need to keep an eye
on DinDin and Na-rae for now.

205
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,546
Yes, you're right. We should.

206
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,632
If it got into his eye,
he might be infected.

207
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,300
Okay. Then we'll keep a bit of a distance.

208
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,010
I mean, if we feel uneasy,
we can just throw them out.

209
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,136
Just let them go, you know?

210
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
Dr. Kkwachu,
how could you put it like that?

211
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,640
-Come on, I mean, we need to survive too.
-He's right.

212
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,517
When I'm such a big fan
of your YouTube videos?

213
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,268
But YouTube has nothing to do
with that right now.

214
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,728
-I can't help but smile though.
-Wait, but…

215
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,023
Okay then.
Why don't we introduce ourselves?

216
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,609
What about you?
Are you a customer or an employee?

217
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,487
I run a business inside the supermarket.

218
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,614
-You can call me Mr. Jung.
-I see.

219
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,698
A business owner, I see.

220
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,909
And they're just
supermarket employees.

221
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,286
If you work here,
then you must know this place well.

222
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,871
Jeez, a business owner?

223
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,872
-You sell rice puffs.
-You "puffed" up the truth.

224
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,915
-Well, well.
-Rice puffs.

225
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,750
Rice puffs are a legitimate business.

226
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,293
We were going on a retreat.

227
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,004
They said they were majoring
in Physical Education.

228
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,714
What about this person in the back?

229
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,550
I'm just an ordinary citizen.

230
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,094
I met him here.
He is a former Navy Seal.

231
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,179
-I see.
-Yeah, he was a soldier.

232
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,306
He's the leader of our group, yeah.

233
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,809
I mean, if you see on The Iron Squad,

234
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,770
all these special forces guys
are very handsome nowadays.

235
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,188
Yeah, I see that.

236
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:35,116
THE WOMEN FORGET ABOUT THE ZOMBIES
AND ARE FEELING MUCH BETTER

237
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,786
You're right. He is handsome indeed.

238
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,038
We're about to die.
It's not the time for romance.

239
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,915
Better than dying lonely, you punk.

240
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,251
-I've gotta at least try before I die.
-You wanna die in the middle of this?

241
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,460
You'll die in the middle of it.

242
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,088
-Shut it, you lunatic.
-Those two might have been exposed.

243
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,840
I saw today--

244
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,175
Oh! What's this? An alert.

245
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,510
The alerts are working.

246
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,555
I got it. "From Central Disaster
and Safety Countermeasures."

247
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,349
"Those infected with
an unknown virus is increasing."

248
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,644
"Uninfected persons should secure
emergency food supplies."

249
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,896
"Going outside is prohibited."

250
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,857
"Be prepared
for additional security measures."

251
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,859
-See? We can't go outside.
-It's more dangerous.

252
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,653
But we're lucky. We're inside
and there's food and stuff here too.

253
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,947
There are security cameras here too.

254
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,366
Oh! Over there.
There are a bunch of them.

255
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,702
CAN USE CCTV CAMERAS WHILE FINDING FOOD

256
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,454
We can get food here too.

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,040
We need water
and other things too.

258
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,209
But even so, we're basically dead here.

259
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,462
Don't you understand
what this emergency alert means?

260
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,963
WE'VE SEEN THIS ANGER IN DISASTER MOVIES!

261
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,715
But at least we're all together, okay?

262
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,217
My point exactly.
Let's all calm down and talk this out.

263
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,053
-But we were calmly talking it out.
-Why would they send the alert just now?

264
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,764
-We were doing introductions.
-We're all here together.

265
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,432
-So don't be scared.
-I'm Lee Si-young.

266
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,311
-Okay, okay, okay, dear.
-It's going to be okay.

267
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,687
HIS ANGER COOLS AT HER WORDS

268
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,730
Okay.

269
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,398
-Hey, Hee-kwan.
-Yeah, I already went.

270
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,442
-My goodness.
-Here, have a rice puff.

271
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,360
Rice puffs?

272
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,277
Wait, that's the food supply.

273
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,528
You didn't give me any
when I was hungry earlier.

274
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,364
-I made these. I made them myself.
-Thank you.

275
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,323
-Let me have some.
-Thank you.

276
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,825
-There's more out there.
-I was so hungry. Thank you.

277
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,743
-The emergency alert, though…
-First,

278
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,994
-I have a question.
-Yes.

279
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,497
The monster-like things
that we encountered,

280
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,916
-they reacted to sounds.
-Yes.

281
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,876
They moved when we made sounds.

282
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,170
It didn't seem like that they could see.
What was it like here?

283
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,631
To be honest, we just talked about
how the phones weren't working,

284
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,716
how nervous we were,
so we really don't have a clue.

285
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,801
We don't know.

286
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,474
So the only thing that we know for now
is that they respond to sounds.

287
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,684
Bro, what's the best course of action
in this situation?

288
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,520
I feel like we should explore a bit,
you know?

289
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,898
First off, the most important thing
is to secure food right now.

290
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,566
-Yeah, I'm hungry.
-Water.

291
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,651
-We need it.
-And we should get weapons,

292
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,194
-like tools to defend ourselves.
-Right.

293
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,780
-First, water.
-We need water.

294
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,990
Foods that have a long shelf life
and no cooking.

295
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,659
-Canned food. Cans.
-Yes, food like that.

296
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,077
Canned tuna. Canned tuna.

297
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,287
-Ramen and canned food.
-I think canned tuna is a good choice.

298
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,997
Candy. Green grape-flavored candy.

299
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,999
Don't just say
what you wanna eat.

300
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,085
But don't we need candy?
Some candy? Sweets?

301
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,628
We might need a little bit.

302
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,004
I think we definitely
might need some,

303
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,047
-but we don't need that much.
-Green grape-flavored candy.

304
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,091
You said earlier that
staying hydrated is important, right?

305
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,717
-Yes.
-So what if we get cereal?

306
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,136
That's delicious and can hydrate you too.

307
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,638
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh yeah, that one cereal, you know?

308
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,224
-The one with the tiger.
-Yes, the tiger. We need his energy.

309
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,142
-What?
-I mean…

310
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,602
-Everyone is different.
-Then let's get the low-cal cereal.

311
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,020
-Hey, but I mean…
-Come on.

312
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,648
Really? We could die any second
and you're arguing about low-cal cereal?

313
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,941
Just eat whatever.

314
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,401
-Something sweet.
-Keep it down, you guys!

315
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,861
Or something sparkling.

316
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,156
-If there's any strawberry yogurt too…
-Strawberry yogurt?

317
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,368
Strawberry yogurt with cereal.

318
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,870
-Butane fuel.
-That would be so tasty.

319
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,247
Then let's get sirloin
from the meat section. We can grill it.

320
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,957
-Then meat, too.
-But we can't grill it.

321
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,043
But what we get isn't important right now.
We need to get back alive, right?

322
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,087
Then who wants to go out there first?

323
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,425
IMMEDIATE SILENCE

324
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,969
Better the Navy Seal than us, right?

325
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,515
In the military,
we used to have a buddy system.

326
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,767
-A team of two or three.
-We should pair up.

327
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,562
-No way I'm going alone.
-As I said, a team of two or three.

328
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,605
-Yes.
-We can't all go at once.

329
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,982
-Water and--
-We'll go.

330
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,234
No.
You shouldn't go. Why would you?

331
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,153
-It's dangerous. Too risky.
-We've been here for a while

332
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,529
and the zombies seem slow.

333
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,780
We saw them on our way in.

334
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,407
The zombies are slow to react.

335
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,950
Don't do it just because
you're a PE major.

336
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,036
They're getting all cocky
because they're young.

337
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,579
Not at all, this might work out.

338
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,122
-I'm getting a headache.
-PE majors, so dependable.

339
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,916
Don't worry about us. We'll be brave.

340
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,293
Let's just leave them
to do what they wanna do.

341
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,295
-Like what?
-It'd be nice to have a signal

342
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,421
when we're in danger.

343
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,174
I think we need to let them know somehow
if they're in danger.

344
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,509
There's a PA system here, right?

345
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,302
-Yes, we have the supermarket jingle.
-Right. She's a long-time employee.

346
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,512
-A jingle?
-Yes. Right.

347
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,514
No need for words.
Let's just play the jingle.

348
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,266
Looks like it's set up here.
You just need to press this, right?

349
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,684
Press it.

350
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,812
-It's playing.
-I can hear something.

351
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,105
It's coming from over there.
Not in here, right?

352
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,023
I think it's playing in there.

353
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,150
♪ So many fresh foods available ♪

354
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,236
♪ It's gushing with excitement ♪

355
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,779
♪ Star Mart ♪

356
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,282
If you're out there and hear the jingle,
come back right away.

357
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,576
Because you can always go back out
after you return.

358
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,911
-We'll be back.
-Watch the security cameras.

359
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,204
-We'll be watching you.
-We'll keep an eye on you.

360
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,622
-Get back safely.
-So brave, really.

361
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,585
-Be careful.
-This could get like 30 million views.

362
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,629
He's a YouTuber.

363
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,882
THE TECH-SAVVY YOUTH DON'T WASTE
A CHANCE TO MAKE A GOOD VIDEO

364
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,842
We'll be back.

365
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,177
Take it easy.

366
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,303
Be careful.

367
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,764
Lower your body. Stay low.

368
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,017
By the way, shouldn't we lock the door?

369
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,310
-Lock it.
-We have to lock it.

370
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,563
-We have to lock it.
-Carefully.

371
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,233
-Lock it.
-Hey, they're going this way.

372
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,401
-Look.
-Yes, we can see them.

373
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,403
I think you should come here
and watch them.

374
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,612
Uh, there.

375
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,658
Zoom in to wherever they go.
Let's zoom in and watch.

376
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,034
-Okay.
-Zoom in, please.

377
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,329
-I see the two.
-There they are.

378
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,331
Are they here?

379
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,750
-That one. Zoom in on that one.
-Yes, that one.

380
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,169
-That's it. Yes.
-Oh.

381
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,255
Let's take everything we want.

382
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,424
-Let's just do what we want.
-Okay.

383
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,804
No zombies, right?

384
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,101
-Let's go.
-Help me with this.

385
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,314
-They passed the first isle.
-Okay.

386
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,399
That section is blocked.
The middle section.

387
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,775
Right. They shouldn't go there.

388
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,069
They're doing a good job.

389
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,656
-Have an energy drink first?
-Yes, give me one.

390
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,076
-They're drinking something.
-Yeah, they are. Right?

391
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,453
-They're drinking something?
-No, that's fine.

392
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,370
It's okay. It's fine.

393
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,205
-Try this cap.
-He's putting on a cap.

394
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,290
Let's go.

395
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,710
Hey.

396
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,547
Clear?

397
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,341
Come this way.

398
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,218
-It's fine. Let's say hello.
-It's all good.

399
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,970
-Okay, okay.
-To the security cameras?

400
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,392
They're doing great.

401
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,311
It's like
watching the World Cup.

402
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,479
Keep it down. Be quiet. Come on.

403
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,980
-Young people are so brave.
-There aren't any zombies.

404
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
-It's okay.
-No zombies.

405
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,900
-There. Good job.
-They're doing great.

406
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,193
Good job. Good job.

407
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,407
-Any zombies?
-No.

408
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,871
Things like this. Tuna.

409
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,708
Tuna.

410
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,337
-Hey. They're packing them.
-Yes.

411
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,546
Nicely done. Good work.

412
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,840
-They're doing great.
-Good job. Good job.

413
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,178
-Let's take four bottles for now.
-Snacks.

414
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,262
Okay.

415
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,723
Oh, granola.

416
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,600
They're getting cereal.

417
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,978
-Yes!
-Yes, the cereal. That's it! Great work!

418
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,479
The low-cal cereal!

419
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,438
The low-cal cereal?

420
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,273
-Yeah, the low-cal cereal.
-They got the low-cal cereal!

421
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,441
Yes, yes, yes!

422
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,734
Hey, adjust the angle.

423
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,486
But are they okay making that much noise?

424
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,656
I mean, if they've gotten that much,
shouldn't they bring it back here first?

425
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,533
-They can go back out.
-They're bringing everything they can.

426
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,492
There aren't any zombies there right now.

427
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,576
Maybe they should have
taken a walkie-talkie.

428
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,537
But all of that will be pointless
if something goes wrong

429
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,746
before they make it back.

430
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,206
Yes. That's why
they should come back first.

431
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,874
-Oppa. Spam.
-They're being too careless.

432
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,875
But I don't think
there are any zombies right now.

433
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,502
They've completely
let their guard down right now.

434
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,004
-Camera seven.
-Seven.

435
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,880
-Okay, seven.
-Seven.

436
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,048
-They should get that first.
-They're drawing.

437
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,591
-No, writing something.
-What if they don't make it back?

438
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,468
They're a little buzzed right now.

439
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,720
-They're drunk.
-Yeah.

440
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,637
What are they writing?

441
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,930
-Just come back now.
-What does it say?

442
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,267
-What are they doing?
-"Everyone. Don't worry."

443
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,144
Don't worry!

444
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,603
-Don't worry!
-There are no zombies.

445
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,522
-Sweets!
-Shush, quiet.

446
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,607
-But this isn't the time to be doing that.
-Why aren't they

447
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,525
getting back here?

448
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,861
But I feel anxious,
because it's going too well.

449
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,903
-They're eating something.
-We locked the doors

450
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,821
-when we came in.
-No.

451
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,739
-It's okay. It's fine.
-They're still just kids.

452
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,365
-Come back now.
-Just let them be.

453
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,950
But I think they should
come back now.

454
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,118
-I'm nervous.
-Let them be. They're kids.

455
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,996
-Right, water.
-I think they said water was over there.

456
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,666
We're making noise
by dragging this thing.

457
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,501
-Should we carry it together?
-Okay. All right.

458
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,836
-You got it?
-Yes.

459
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,047
One, two, three.

460
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,216
Three.

461
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,260
A LOUD NOISE WAS MADE

462
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,344
We're screwed.

463
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,638
Hey! turn on number three.

464
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,223
-Which one?
-Camera three. Now.

465
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,308
-There was a noise. I heard.
-Hey! Here!

466
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,769
-What is it?
-Number one! Camera one. That one!

467
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,312
The box broke.
It all fell out when they lifted it.

468
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,897
Hey, hold on. Quiet down. Keep it down.

469
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,440
Keep it down.

470
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,113
We're screwed.

471
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,866
Damn it.

472
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,661
Really?

473
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,925
There's a zombie.

474
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,939
-It's a zombie!
-It's a zombie!

475
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,108
Shush! Be quiet!
The zombies will come to us.

476
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,698
Let go!

477
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,620
-Oh, no!
-It bit him!

478
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,538
What? What is it?

479
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,747
-The song.
-Here, this way.

480
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,958
-I turned it on.
-We're already too late with the song.

There, we got it.

487

There are a lot.

489
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,286

Look at the bottom one.

Over there. The other one.

491
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,705

-There's a bunch.

492
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,831
A bunch of them. A lot…

493
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,416
-What is that?
-There's a bunch. A bunch of them.

Oh, no. Look! Look!

498
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,549
Be quiet. Keep it down.

499
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,884
You should've played
the song earlier, hyung.

500
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,885
I did.

501
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,808

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,895
-Oh, no, no!
-He's still alive.

504
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,813
-Oh, gosh. What do we do?
-Don't look!

505
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,649
Gosh, this is awful.

506
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,325
Oh, this is terrible.

507
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,954
You can't be so loud. Be quiet.

508
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,372
Don't look. Don't.

509
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,207
-Did he get bitten?
-Yeah, he got bitten.

510
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,345
Did he get bitten?

511
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,098
It's too dangerous here.

512
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,100
Let's get out of here.

513
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,644
-Hey, mister. Sir. Sir.
-No, no, I can't.

514
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,812
It's even more dangerous
out there.

515
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,313
-I need to go to the restroom.
-I want to get out of here.

516
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,190
No, you can't.

517
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,441
-No.
-No, Mr. Jung.

518
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,985
Let me go. I wanna go.

519
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,444
-Stop them.
-Mr. Jung. Wait.

520
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,529
-No, you can't.
-Please!

521
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,322
-You'll kill us all too.
-Come on. Hurry.

522
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,699
We have to stop them.
We can't let them open it.

523
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,450
He's trying to open it.

524
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,077
-I wanna go.
-They want to go. They said so.

525
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,413
-We'll all get killed too.
-No, no, stop.

526
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,581
If they want to, let them.
Close the door.

527
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,667
-Let them go if they want.
-Why? Why would you?

528
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,168
-They want to go.
-Hey.

529
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,045
-But still, we're in this together.
-It's not like--

530
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,463
-We can't.
-They wanted to leave.

531
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,132
-This is wrong.
-They're crawling. There they are.

532
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,967
I can see them. There.
They're crawling over there.

533
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,638
Are they crazy?

534
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,432
-Let me see.
-Here. We have it here.

535
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,017
-Is there a walkie-talkie?
-No. No!

536
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,184
-I'll bring them back. I will.
-No.

537
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,728
-No. Don't go.
-They're right out front.

538
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,731
No, no, don't. Let's think objectively.
They already went outside.

539
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,940
The people here, we need to survive.

540
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,443
I think Kkwachu Hyung and DinDin
are being so heartless.

541
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,652
Come on.
I mean, how are we supposed to

542
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,612
stop someone from leaving
when they want to?

543
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,989
How can you say that right now?

544
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,115
How are we to stop them?

545
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,783
Na-rae, you go
and try bringing them back then.

546
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,910
We should have
talked them down from the start.

547
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,330
-What is that?
-What's going on? Where?

548
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,165
-What? What's going on?
-What?

549
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,129
They're lying on the ground.
I can see them on the ground.

550
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,047
-There. There they are.
-Yes.

551
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,633
-Did they get bitten?
-They got bitten.

552
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,385
That's why I told them
not to go.

553
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,763
-Oh, no.
-This is all because you told them to go.

554
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,056
What are you gonna do now?

555
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,933
Did that lady get bitten?

556
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,269
-Seriously?
-What do we do?

557
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,157
5 VICTIMS IN JUST 30 MINUTES

558
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,829
I wanna get something straight here.

559
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,042
I don't think Kkwachu Hyung and DinDin
should encourage other people to leave,

560
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,169
-even if they say they want to leave.
-But I mean, look.

561
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,088
But I didn't encourage them.
DinDin was the one doing that.

562
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,465
I didn't encourage them.
Because, hear me out, all right?

563
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,884
-They said they wanted to go.
-You encouraged them.

564
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,178
I'm just saying,
if they want to leave, they should.

565
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,847
Do you think we can save those people?

566
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,182
Come on, don't fight.

567
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,391
-Don't fight.
-Yeah, okay. So…

568
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,144
These two can be a team.

569
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,395
-Oh.
-Sounds good.

570
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,356
-The two of us?
-They can team up since they think alike.

571
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,273
-He's right.
-Wait.

572
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,566
I think you two will get along just great.

573
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,734
-You two are great together.
-Yes, please.

574
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,194
We'll be fair in the order we go, okay?

575
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,738
-I'm laughing because I'm so dumbfounded.
-Hyung.

576
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,532
I'm sorry to do this
when we've only just met.

577
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,699
-But I, I…
-Team up with him.

578
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,784
-You two will be great.
- I-I want Dex.

579
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,744
-I-I want to team up with him.
-No, you guys have a great vibe. No.

580
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,454
-This is it. No.
-I wanna go with Dex.

581
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,164
You two can go together. A perfect pair.

582
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,666
Dex is with me. I wanna go out there too.

583
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,626
You and hyung
go out there first and come back.

584
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,128
-Yeah.
-Bring anything, even if it's small.

585
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,880
-Something light, like bread.
-Hey, wait a minute.

586
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,341
I get why we're a team.
But why do we have to go first?

587
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,677
Oh, we're all gonna go.
We'll all take turns. We will.

588
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,388
But we don't need to rush.
We have nothing to do anyways, right?

589
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,181
Let's take it slowly, one by one.

590
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,769
-But let me say this. I'm gonna be honest.
-Okay.

591
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,730
We have to survive. I tore my ACL.

592
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,858
And it's only been two months
since my surgery.

593
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,318
As you know,
you can't run with a torn ACL.

594
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,028
Then let's do this.

595
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,157
Na-rae and Hee-kwan. He's strong
since he was a baseball player.

596
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,159
No, Dex here is stronger.

597
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,035
No, you and Na-rae go out there together.

598
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,413
-You can carry her, hyung.
-Wait.

599
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,373
-Then as for Na-rae--
-From what I can see,

600
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,584
-I don't think they're on the same side.
-How about Hong-chul? He's strong.

601
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,294
No, no, no. I don't think so.

602
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,378
PLAYING HOT POTATO WITH NA-RAE

603
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,756
Right. The injured person should be
with someone strong. Let's see.

604
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,259
-Jonathan is strong.
-Jonathan looks strong. But he's far away.

605
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,886
So he might not understand her.

606
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,846
-It's either Dex or…
-What are you talking about?

607
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,890
Jonathan.

608
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,474
Hey.

609
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,312
JONATHAN IS LOOKING FOR JONATHAN

610
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,023
I think you should be with Hee-kwan.

611
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,274
Yes. Or Dex.

612
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,943
Dex, who do you want to go with?

613
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,029
-Let's hear what he thinks.
-I'll be honest.

614
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,239
We're not going out there to die.

615
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,283
I want to go with someone
who is going to succeed.

616
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,576
-Right.
-Just based on physique.

617
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,370
-I want either Hee-kwan or Hong-chul.
-That works for me, yeah.

618
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,414
-Great.
-But you should know, he plays dirty.

619
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,583
He is. He'll run off first.

620
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,126
I believe Dex has picked me.

621
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,336
I pick Dex too.

622
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,297
We can do it. The 55th Infantry Division.

623
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,757
-What are you talking about?
-The 55th, yes.

624
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,467
-Really?
-I was in the 55th Division.

625
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,469
-We'll go now. We'll go now.
-Wait! Wait a second.

626
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,304
Dex is a former Navy Seal.

627
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,680
I was
in the 55th Infantry Division.

628
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,890
Dex should go with Tsuki.

629
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,808
No, it's better that
the strong people go together.

630
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,645
If they see eye to eye,
they can go together.

631
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,563
-Let them go together.
-You two go. Just let them pair up.

632
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,691
They picked each other.
They're both happy with their choices.

633
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,859
-You two are both annoying. Go.
-We can do it.

634
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,860
-I'll go with DinDin.
-They're both--

635
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,779
-You won't abandon me, will you, hyung?
-No, never.

636
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,072
He plays dirty.

637
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,657
I'll stay with you
all the way. To the end.

638
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,533
-All right, Dex. Lower your body.
-Yes.

639
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,410
-They're really slow.
-From here…

640
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,665
But, Na-rae, let me tell you something.

641
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,083
All the men wanna stick together.

642
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,710
The probability of success
is higher that way, like Dex said.

643
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,963
We have to think objectively here.

644
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,426
Wait. Six… six people
are left then, right?

645
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,844
Does anybody wanna go with me?

646
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,513
Jonathan?

647
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,560
I was planning to go with Patricia.

648
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,655
But since Na-rae
has experience with zombies…

649
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,573
You know a lot about zombies,
right, noona?

650
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,826
-I know them perfectly.
-You know them very well.

651
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,077
Then I'll go with Na-rae.

652
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,830
-Okay then.
-Unni, write it down for me.

653
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,374
-Tsuki and Patricia will go together.
-Okay, I'll go with her.

654
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,418
-DinDin and Kkwachu Hyung.
-Okay.

655
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,961
-Dex and Ro Hong-chul.
-Okay.

656
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,671
-Who is with Tsuki?
-Patricia.

657
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,006
-Patricia.
-Two of them?

658
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,092
I'm sorry to say this,
but I'm a bit worried.

659
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,010
-Right.
-I'm worried

660
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,429
about women going alone.
Let's have Patricia go with Hee-kwan then.

661
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,555
Let's change that bit.

662
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,472
Patricia and who?

663
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,932
-Why don't you go with her, hyung?
-Patricia and Hee-kwan.

664
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,475
Why don't you go, hyung?

665
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,602
Hey, come on.
My team has already been decided.

666
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,687
-Wait, then…
-It's just that

667
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,106
-I'm so worried.
-Then Tsuki and Kkwachu should go.

668
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,817
-No. Kkwachu Hyung is--
-Kkwachu… I mean, Kkwachu Hyung.

669
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,193
PLEASE CALL KKWACHU HYUNG BY HIS FULL NAME

670
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,653
If you say "Kkwachu,"
it could be any man here.

671
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,405
"Kkwachu" could be anyone. Anyone.

672
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,990
Kkwachu could be anyone.

673
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,367
-Give me a second.
-Patricia and Hee-kwan.

674
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,953
She's only ever acted,
so she's not used to all this.

675
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,498
I think Kkwachu Hyung
and DinDin should go together.

676
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,541
Patricia and Hee-kwan.

677
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,043
-Patricia and Hee-kwan?
-Really?

678
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,961
-Who am I going with?
-I'll take care of Na-rae.

679
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:10,962
I think you should take Tsuki
and Si-young.

680
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,589
Because Si-young kept looking after Tsuki.

681
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,008
Yes. Si-young kept
looking after Tsuki. Like a mom.

682
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,092
And Tsuki listens to her.

683
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,262
-I'll take care of Na-rae.
-Okay then. All right. I'll go with Tsuki.

684
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,180
Okay.

685
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,556
-Hee-kwan and Patricia.
-Okay.

686
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,183
Na-rae and Jonathan.

687
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,851
Si-young and Tsuki.

688
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,480
-That reminds me, Tsuki, not Chaki.
-Tsuki.

689
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,816
-Hey, get it together.
-Totally understandable, it's so hectic.

690
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,152
-No, not Chucky.
-"Chaki" sounds like "car key."

691
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,029
Hightail it
out of here right now.

692
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,989
-"Tsuki."
-"Tsu" not "Cha."

693
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,115
"Tsu" not "Chu"

694
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,700
-"Tsuki."
-I'm sorry.

695
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,119
See? This is what you should do
when there's a misunderstanding.

696
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,913
-Tsuki?
-Yes, Tsuki.

697
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,374
-We're all set then, right? All done.
-Yes, all set.

698
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,291
Okay? Okay.

699
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,585
But I think you should tell us
what's farthest back

700
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,462
and which area will be the hardest.

701
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,839
-The farthest.
-The hardest? Here. Here.

702
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,341
-Water. And then…
-Then…

703
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,967
Water, ramen and canned food.

704
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,969
-Well, then…
-Let's get the heavier items first,

705
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,970
so water.

706
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,972
-Oh, yeah. Water.
-First, water.

707
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,809
-Then DinDin, DinDin and Kkwachu Hyung.
-Yes.

708
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,519
-The two of us are totally worthless.
-I agree.

709
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,436
We're damn worthless.

710
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,604
You two are strong.

711
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,439
-No, we--
-Yeah, like she did all that boxing,

712
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,565
-and he's a baseball player.
-Yeah, come on.

713
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,275
-No, DinDin and--
-From what I can tell,

714
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,652
Patricia and Hee-kwan are strong.

715
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,986
No, DinDin and…

716
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,988
-Seriously?
-Since you're men…

717
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,574
Don't do that. DinDin and Kkwachu
should bring water.

718
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,534
-I'll go!
-Kkwachu Hyung.

719
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,785
I meant…

720
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,954
Stop saying just "Kkwachu."
Kkwachu could be anyone.

721
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,872
"Kkwachu" is this right here.

722
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,624
-Jeez! Stop that.
-Well…

723
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,668
It's Kkwachu Hyung.
You have to say "Hyung" too.

724
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,504
I just found out that was his name.
I'm sorry.

725
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,797
-He has a real name.
-He has a real name?

726
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,257
KKWACHU HYUNG
IS A PROPER NOUN

727
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,302
I think what we need to decide now
is what our next step is after this.

728
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,304
Depending on whether
we'll wait it out or escape…

729
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,056
-We need to escape.
-…we'll need different things.

730
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,016
But first, we have
to bring things back here…

731
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,352
-Right.
-…and then we need to escape.

732
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,520
Then we need bags.

733
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,938
Like, think about it.

734
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,314
How are you gonna carry
these four things here?

735
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,357
-You're right.
-So smart.

736
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,775
-We need to bring back bags.
-Yeah. Let's bring back bags.

737
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,444
Are there bags here
in the supermarket?

738
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:07,287
THEY COULD FACE THIS DISASTROUS FATE
IF THEY GO OUT THERE WITHOUT BAGS

739
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,205
-Let's bring bags.
-We need bags.

740
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,374
-They should be in the camping section.
-Yeah, there are.

741
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,542
Camping.

742
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,960
They're at the far left side
of the store.

743
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,253
Toward the alcoholic beverages.

744
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,796
Just follow the wall
straight out of here.

745
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,381
Yes. Right, yes.

746
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,632
The camping section is here then.

747
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,594
Then Dex and Hong-chul,
you go get backpacks. Right now.

748
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,762
Okay, you go first. Come on.

749
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,929
-Go first?
-Yes, right.

750
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,973
-Oh, wait.
-You said we need backpacks most, right?

751
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,224
You picked the strongest person here.

752
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,768
Don't laugh and go, now.

753
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,561
-Go first?
-Yeah. Get the backpacks.

754
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,438
He said the bags are
the most important.

755
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,023
You two are the tallest too. Go. Now.

756
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,776
They're going with
the former Navy Seal. Hurry up and go.

757
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,027
I think it's this way.

758
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,695
Let's insist that
water's the least important.

759
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,030
Let's put it off for as long as possible.

760
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,865
-They'll hate us.
-Let's go last.

761
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,201
Dex, how should we do this?
Should I follow you?

762
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,036
You should lead.

763
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,871
-Me?
-Should I lead?

764
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,164
And why is that?

765
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,417
-I'll lead.
-Okay.

766
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,003
-We'll keep watching from here.
-Yeah, Jonathan, watch closely for us.

767
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:57,921
We'll play the jingle.

768
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,465
Please do.
He was looking at something else before.

769
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,841
Please focus on the monitors.

770
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,802
-Don't nag at my partner.
-I'll watch them.

771
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,928
-I will.
-Focus. Concentrate.

772
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,180
You played the jingle late before too.

773
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,765
-Way too late.
-That's true. I was late.

774
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,900
MOUSE PAD: FOUND NEXT TO THE COMPUTER
USAGE UNDETERMINED

775
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,488
And we should wrap this around our arms.

776
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,281
Give me your arm.

777
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,701
Oh, so the teeth won't break the skin
even if they bite us.

778
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,036
-We should too.
-Yeah.

779
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,080
-I knew it.
-Let's do that, too.

780
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,039
THIS SOLDIER IS CERTAINLY RELIABLE!

781
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,707
Yes. He's so reliable.

782
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,420
THEY CAN ATTACK WITH THEIR ELBOWS NOW

783
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,755
First we get the bags.

784
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,549
-The bags.
-Once we get the bags,

785
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,968
-we'll come back here via the same route.
-Got it.

786
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,345
-Okay, okay, okay. All right.
-Oppa.

787
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,847
-Yeah?
-Come back alive.

788
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,432
-Okay.
-Hyung, if you can put anything

789
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,018
in the bags, like if it's safe,
bring back some stuff in the bags.

790
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,312
-Okay. Let's go.
-If you don't bring good stuff,

791
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,106
-we won't open the door.
-Come back safely.

792
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,233
-Okay.
-Don't overdo it, okay?

793
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,818
Let's watch the monitors.

794
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,663
The quest begins.

795
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,458
SECURE SURVIVAL SUPPLIES
SEARCH THE MARKET WHILE AVOIDING ZOMBIES

796
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,378
Lower your body. Lower.

797
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,171
SECURE SURVIVAL SUPPLIES:
AS MANY BAGS AS POSSIBLE

798
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,381
We have to close this.

799
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,592
Close it. Come on.

800
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,178
-Lock it quickly.
-Lock it?

801
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,597
All good. Okay.

802
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,599
Be safe, please.

803
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,406
THE STUDENTS GOT BITTEN
ON THE WAY TO THE CAMPING SECTION

804
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,034
The college students are in the way.

805
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,245
-There they are.
-I think they'll turn into zombies.

806
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,122
That side is all blocked.

807
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,878
If they attack,
I'll block their mouths with this.

808
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,129
Understood.

809
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,102
This way.

810
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,321
-It's a zombie.
-Over there.

811
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,282
It's coming this way.

812
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,917
It's coming this way.

813
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,543
Okay.

814
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:06,275
HE'S NOW USED TO SILENTLY
TIPTOEING AROUND LIKE A THIEF

815
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,494
It's over here.

816
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,374
Tell me if you see bags. We need bags.

817
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,879
It's coming here,
so let's go around this way.

818
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
Go back! Back!

819
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,206
What? What? What happened?

820
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,416
Come on! Come on!

821
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,333
Over here. Over here.

822
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,127
Go back! Back!

823
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,804
HE MAKES A BREAK FOR IT
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING BACK

824
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,514
-They got separated.
-Where are they?

825
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,099
Hong-chul abandoned Dex, didn't he, noona?

826
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,018
-He went to the bag.
-He did. No doubt about it.

827
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,728
-It's going as we expected.
-What's going on?

828
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,618
A new zombie has appeared.

829
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,831
HE CARRIES OUT THE MISSION ALONE
BEFORE MORE ZOMBIES APPEAR

830
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,474
He went to get a shopping cart.

831
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,551
-Oh!
-What?

832
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,094
Look! He's right behind him.

833
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,281
-What do we do?
-He's here.

834
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,533
Shouldn't we open the door?
He's here! He's here!

835
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,285
-What about Hong-chul?
-We have to open the door. Do it now!

836
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,162
Open the door. Open it!

837
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,207
Close the door.

838
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,208
WATER

839
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,376
What? Where's Hong-chul?

840
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
-What about Hong-chul?
-I'll be back.

841
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,629
-Where's Hong-chul?
-What do we do?

842
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,630
Where is he?

843
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,258
Hee-kwan, lock the door.
Lock it. Come on.

844
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,926
-What are you doing?
-Wait, Dex.

845
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,512
He's going back?

846
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,689
DEX CREATED AN OPENING
BY LURING ALL THE ZOMBIES

847
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,196
We need bags the most.

848
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,573
-First we get the bags.
-Bags.

849
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,714
At least Hong-chul's
getting the bags.

850
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,091
-He got them.
-Wow, look. Man, Hong-chul is awesome.

851
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,385
-I'm sorry, but I'm so scared.
-Come on. Get out.

852
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,095
How unexpected.

853
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,264
NO ONE EXPECTED HIM TO BE SO BRAVE

854
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,512
THE ESCAPE ROUTE IS FULL OF ZOMBIES

855
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,943
-Oh, there he is!
-No! No, over there!

856
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,778
-Open it.
-We should open the door for Hong-chul!

857
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,029
Now!

858
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,174
Come this way.

859
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,259
Hyung, this way.

860
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,970
-Did you get bit?
-Dex rescued him.

861
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,930
No, no. They're getting bitten!
No, no, no!

862
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,892
Come this way. Come on, come on.

863
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,477
Hyung, this way.

864
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,017
-I think Hong-chul got caught! Oh, no!
-He's caught!

865
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,976
-They got him!
-They got him?

866
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,561
What do we do? Oh, no!

867
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,535
No, he's not caught. He got away.

868
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,079
He got away. Hong-chul got away.

869
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,332
Let's go!

870
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,963
HE THREW AWAY THE BAG
WHILE PUSHING AWAY THE ZOMBIES!

871
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,810
-But the bags.
-Let's go. Come on.

872
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,270
-The bags.
-It's okay. Forget about it. This way.

873
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,857
They're coming. They're coming.
Open the door. Here they come.

874
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,276
-Hurry, hurry!
-Wow. No way.

875
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,489
Are you okay?

876
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,699
AS MANY BAGS AS POSSIBLE,
WATER, OTHER

877
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,368
You were amazing.

878
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,328
IT LOOKS LIKE HE PEED HIS PANTS

879
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,871
-Oppa, are you okay?
-Yes.

880
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,456
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

881
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,624
-You didn't get bitten?
-No, I didn't get bitten.

882
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,418
-What about the bags?
-I'm tearing up.

883
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,461
The bags. The bags. One.

884
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,547
-Why did you bring an empty box?
-An empty box?

885
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,965
-Why?
-No, the bags…

886
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,591
HE DIDN'T WANT TO RETURN EMPTY-HANDED

887
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,053
WOW! DEX SNATCHED A BAG
WHILE SAVING HONG-CHUL

888
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,931
There are at least ten zombies.

889
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,183
I noticed before.
Ten? There are that many?

890
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,436
And I learned
something new about them.

891
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,812
They respond to movement too.

892
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,481
ZOMBIES INSIDE THE BRIGHT SUPERMARKET
RECOGNIZE MOVEMENTS ACCURATELY

893
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,526
AGGRAVATED ZOMBIES ARE DIFFICULT
TO LURE AWAY BY NOISE

894
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,778
-What?
-Even if you don't make noise?

895
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,321
-Yeah, even if we're quiet.
-So they do.

896
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,115
Actually, they're not all that fast.

897
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,826
But since they're everywhere,
they block all the ways out.

898
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,203
But what's surprising

899
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,290
is that even if you run into them,
you can push them away.

900
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,083
They rush over to attack you.

901
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,169
You pushed them.
Yeah, you pushed them.

902
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,628
Right. After I pushed them away,

903
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,589
-Yes.
-I thought I was done for. But it worked.

904
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,340
And the college students before us

905
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,510
knocked down detergent as they fell,
so the floor's very slippery.

906
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,513
-I see.
-Oh, so that's why you fell earlier.

907
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,557
-Not only is it slippery…
-The zombies fell too.

908
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,684
…but there are also
broken beer bottles and stuff too.

909
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,186
-Really?
-You need to watch out.

910
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,021
I mean, wow.
The floor was a mess.

911
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,357
But we need someone bold to go.

912
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,485
-Like a closer in baseball.
-Right.

913
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,944
I was a starting pitcher.

914
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,613
-Starters are bold too.
-That's a hard position.

915
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,031
Two men should go. My partner's a woman.

916
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,741
But you have such a good command
of the ball.

917
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,659
Right, but his pitch is very slow.

918
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,411
-But he can throw curveballs too.
-Oh, really?

919
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,538
-He's known for that.
-Right.

920
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,165
What? What, what?

921
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,250
-What's wrong? What's wrong?
-What's wrong, oppa?

922
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,877
Did you get bitten?

923
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,046
-No, I didn't.
-He got scraped.

924
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,506
NOTHING'S WRONG,
HE JUST WANTED SOME ATTENTION

925
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,423
He scares me there for real.

926
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,884
-Gosh, I almost threw him out.
-Seriously?

927
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,344
I'm saying you need to be careful.

928
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,179
I mean, I went with Dex,
but I still got hurt.

929
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,347
Just keep your distance

930
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,348
-to begin with.
-If it was bad for him, then…

931
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,641
But he left Dex on purpose.

932
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,850
-No.
-Oh, gosh.

933
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,769
Hey, Jonathan.
I need more oxygen.

934
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,812
-Wow, I'm turning pale.
-What am I going to do?

935
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,272
NA-RAE AND JONATHAN WILL GO NEXT

936
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,316
Even if you run into them, just…

937
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,818
Where are the cable ties? The cable ties.

938
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,363
Wait, wait. Earlier, we had another cart.

939
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,990
-Yeah.
-I told you earlier. Put Na-rae in here.

940
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,661
And put another cart upside down.
Then it'll be like a fortress inside.

941
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,745
-Like a shark tour?
-Yes.

942
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,580
Let's test it then.
When they go out this time.

943
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,290
-You're going to abandon me.
-No.

944
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,291
-It'll be okay.
-It'll be fine

945
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,626
as long as they don't all charge at you.

946
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,503
-Will that work though?
-Try it. It'll work.

947
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,838
This part here.
I need to put it here like this.

948
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,966
Block them like this
if they charge at you.

949
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,009
-Tug it.
-Pull back to put in stuff, okay?

950
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,762
If you go like this, it's safe.
There's no chance you'll die.

951
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,808
-But I'm claustrophobic.
-You're claustrophobic?

952
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,519
Na-rae, you can see me, right?
You'll be fine.

953
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,605
Even if Jonathan
leaves you out there, I'll bring you back.

954
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,982
-Really?
-And don't cry or scream.

955
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,483
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?

956
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,818
You won't die for sure.

957
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,028
-You can't. You can't die with this.
-Noona, I'll do my best.

958
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,823
-I'll do everything I can.
-It's really happening?

959
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,032
Na-rae.

960
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,702
If you see green grape-flavored candy,
bring it.

961
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,869
You jerk.

962
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,831
I said I'm claustrophobic,
and you're asking for candy?

963
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,915
HE DESERVES MORE THAN A SLAP

964
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,959
Only if you can.
My blood sugar's low.

965
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,002
-Oppa, be quiet.
-Okay.

966
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,253
-Don't make any noise.
-I'm sorry.

967
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,715
-He's a total jerk, right?
-Stay silent.

968
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,967
Na-rae, keep your mouth shut
and stay still.

969
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,385
Don't make a sound.

970
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,803
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CHEER HER UP,
BUT SHE FEELS UPSET

971
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,141
Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

972
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,685
Noona, noona, noona, listen.

973
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,229
-I'm here. I'm here. Don't worry.
-Here.

974
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,732
-You wear this. You wear this!
-What?

975
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,858
Don't worry.

976
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,651
You have me.

977
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,028
I'm really strong, noona.

978
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,362
Oh, gosh.

979
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,408
And if that works, then from now on
we can have whoever can fit in it.

980
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,035
-Yeah. We can keep using it.
-And if it doesn't work…

981
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,911
-It's all part of the process.
-What if it doesn't work?

982
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,955
Well, we… we have other teams.

983
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:45,914
Wow.

984
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,333
How is your leg, noona?

985
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,084
-It's uncomfortable.
-It must be.

986
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,628
What should we do?

987
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,421
-No, it's okay.
-Okay. We'll go now.

988
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,298
Let's go towards the canned food first.

989
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,383
SECURE SURVIVAL SUPPLIES:
RAMYEON AND INSTANT MEALS, CANNED FOOD

990
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,928
-Oh, gosh.
-There's one in front of us.

991
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,349
How do I get past him?

992
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,184
What do I do with him?

993
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,605
Move his leg gently.

994
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,818
-I don't see them on screen.
-But there is a problem.

995
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,779
-Yeah, I heard.
-The cart can't go past the dead body.

996
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,864
Right, the students are lying
right in front of here.

997
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,491
They're done for.

998
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,619
Sorry.

999
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,246
THE DEAD STUDENT IS WAKING UP

1000
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,295
The dead body… What is it?

1001
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,797
Do they need to move the body?

1002
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,218
Let's go. Let's go.

1003
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,302
Let's go. Let's go.

1004
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,388
They don't turn right away.

1005
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,848
But we need to be careful.
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

1006
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,974
Be careful. Be careful.

1007
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,644
Hurry. What do we do? Shoot.

1008
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,439
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

1009
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,359
Why are there so many obstacles?

1010
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,655
Hey, they're coming.

1011
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,375
Not this way.

1012
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,877
Oh, no, no, no.

1013
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,754
-You can't go that way, dummy!
-No!

1014
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:23,220
HE COMES TO HIS SENSES TO FIND
THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ZOMBIES

1015
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,142
What do we do? Oh, no.

1016
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,740
Don't worry. You have me.

1017
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,534
I'm really strong, noona.

1018
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,036
Noona, I'll go!

1019
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,256
-What's he doing? What are you doing?
-Oh, no.

1020
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,424
-Hey, where is her cart?
-They got her!

1021
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,800
He abandoned Na-rae.

1022
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:06,930
They got her.

1023
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,349
-Oh, no! What do we do?
-No, no, no!

1024
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,976
-How many are there?
-Calm down. Check her cart.

1025
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,728
Here.
Look. She'll be okay.

1026
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,229
Camera one! Camera one!

1027
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,773
He abandoned Na-rae right away.

1028
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,580
Noona!

1029
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,165
THE ZOMBIE GETS HIT
EVERY TIME IT CHASES HIM…

1030
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,291
Noona!

1031
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,670
Noona!

1032
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,980
They cannot stop Jonathan.

1033
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,989
Open the door. The door!

1034
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,115
Was he bitten?

1035
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,326
They have Na-rae.
Somebody has to come with me.

1036
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,286
-Come inside.
-Come in first. Come on.

1037
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,871
-Close the door.
-They have Na-rae!

1038
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,164
We know. Close the door.

1039
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,999
She won't die.
Keep quiet for a second.

1040
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,042
Na-rae is scared.

1041
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,085
How can you say that
so shamelessly?

1042
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,463
Don't open the door.
There's one right there. Lock the door!

1043
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,548
Lock the door.

1044
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,757
Come on, lock the door.

1045
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,592
How can you be so shameless
in telling us they have Na-rae?

1046
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,469
Hey, they're here.
In front of here.

1047
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,069
What do I do?

1048
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,448
Oh, no!

1049
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,084
Save me.

1050
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,130
-Sit.
-But she's…

1051
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,048
-Have a seat first.
-I think two people will be enough.

1052
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,633
-Have a seat first. Sit.
-Let me go again.

1053
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,266
Na-rae, keep your mouth shut
and stay still.

1054
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,601
Don't make a sound.

1055
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,894
Let's go and bring her back. Come on.

1056
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,771
-What?
-Let's go and bring her back.

1057
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,648
-But right now…
-No.

1058
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,442
Don't go out like that.
No! It's dangerous.

1059
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:25,986
Okay.

1060
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,504
Where is she?

1061
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,806
Can I borrow that can?

1062
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
THEY DISCUSSED THIS PLAN PREVIOUSLY

1063
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,352
I told you that Hee-kwan is bold.

1064
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,069
Huh? What? They're all reacting.

1065
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,905
Oh, man.

1066
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,240
Oh, man.

1067
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,206
Please, help me.

1068
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,382
Oh, they're here. They're here.
They got her.

1069
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,633
-Huh?
-They're coming.

1070
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,801
Na-rae's here.

1071
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,184
Thank you! Thank you!

1072
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,228
-Careful. Be careful.
-Thank you.

1073
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,441
We can grab more stuff.

1074
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,819
Is there anything we can bring?
Any canned food?

1075
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,779
Any cans? We can put them in the cart.

1076
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,322
-Oh, no.
-We can't bring them right now.

1077
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,700
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1078
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,082
Damn it.

1079
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,259
What about Hee-kwan?

1080
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,385
Hee-kwan…

1081
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,554
Where did Hee-kwan go?
Where is he?

1082
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,806
Shoot.

1083
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,896
They caught him.

1084
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,398
Who? Is it Hee-kwan?

1085
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,108
-No! They got him!
-It's him!

1086
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,306
-He got bitten! They bit him!
-Hee-kwan!

1087
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,307
What do we do?

1088
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,227
-They got him already.
-Oh, no!

1089
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,730
I can't believe this happened.

1090
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,106
They got him already.

1091
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,985
Shit.
