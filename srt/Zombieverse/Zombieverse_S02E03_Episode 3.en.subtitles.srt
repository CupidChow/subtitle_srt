1
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,097
SAFE ZONE
YANGYANG COUNTY, GANGWON STATE

2
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,392
Our helicopter that left Jeju 10 days ago

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,312
landed in Yangyang, a safe zone, avoiding
Seoul which is currently in lockdown.

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,107
It's taking off!

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,233
Finally!

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,777
After our arrival,

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,946
we hid in an abandoned building
for ten days

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,573
to monitor the situation.

9
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,367
We've not been able to
go anywhere for ten days.

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,578
I know. We've just been hiding out.

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,540
We determined that
this place is still relatively safe.

12
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,834
We split into teams to explore the area.

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,423
Although Yangyang is safe,
there are zombies here too.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,759
The zombies seem slow, right?

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,845
Look, he's so slow.

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,930
Maybe it's Yangyang's vibe.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,057
Even the zombies here seem more relaxed.

18
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,060
The zombies seem laid-back,

19
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,520
maybe because
they were bitten at a vacation spot.

20
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,398
Hey, I see a tent over there.

21
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,192
After 20 minutes of exploration,

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,153
we found and collected tents abandoned
by campers.

23
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,655
They're abandoned, right?

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,449
Wow, we've hit the jackpot!

25
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,326
There are instant noodles.

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,744
Just collect everything.

27
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,332
During our search,
we made an unexpected discovery,

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,833
a surfing wet suit.

29
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,210
We'd be invincible in that.

30
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,961
Should we take it off?

31
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,379
Take it off, take it off.

32
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,964
Below the waist.

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,050
Hold on.

34
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,177
Come on. Let's go, Dex.

35
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,016
I think I'm used to these zombies now.

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,477
This is worth some praise.

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,229
Everyone is going to love it.

38
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,022
Hey, what's that?

39
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,191
Do you hear that? There's music playing!

40
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,901
What? "Still open for business"?

41
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,194
It's a club.

42
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,656
-Just the two of you?
-Yes.

43
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,241
-What?
-They're here together.

44
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,992
TOLD TO SEARCH BUT GOT DISTRACTED

45
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,285
How many days has it been?

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,203
-DinDin.
-Us?

47
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,413
You're loving it too much.

48
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,792
BUSINESSES ARE OPEN AS YANGYANG
HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A SAFE ZONE

49
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,377
We're here!

50
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,711
Did you find anything?

51
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,588
Hurry! It's safe here!

52
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,049
-What's that?
-You won't believe it.

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,342
-Noodles?
-And this?

54
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,885
It's an invincible suit.

55
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,096
I guess it's actually safe around here.

56
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,140
They're checking our whole body.

57
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,100
It's a publicly used establishment. Great.

58
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,017
Is that so?

59
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,102
Yes, so it'll be safe.

60
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,311
SAFETY-CERTIFIED

61
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,980
-He's checking for bites.
-Yes.

62
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,817
Hold on! One by one, please.

63
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,404
CHECKING FOR SOMETHING AT THE ENTRANCE

64
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,281
This way. Up to the second floor.

65
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,407
-Hi.
-We're a group.

66
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,783
Oh, you're a civil servant.

67
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,326
-Yes, I am.
-Second floor.

68
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,494
-Sure.
-Okay.

69
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,954
I'm with them!

70
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,998
-I'm your fan.
-Nice to meet you.

71
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,291
Is it safe here?

72
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,458
-It is.
-Okay.

73
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,585
Up to the second floor.

74
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,837
Why so happy when the world's ending?

75
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,630
Where do we need to go?

76
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,756
Maybe this way.

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,050
I like the vibe.

78
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,470
People are still smiley here.

79
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,848
This is my first time at a club.

80
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,807
Hot debut!

81
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,309
Hot club debut!

82
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,562
Look who's excited.

83
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,898
Head to the pool party
on the fourth floor.

84
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,399
SAY WHAT? THERE'S A 4TH FLOOR?

85
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:15,069
Pool party is this way
and the cafe is that way.

86
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,362
Are you filtering us?

87
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,824
Wait, I hope they don't stop one
of us from entering.

88
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,910
AHEM, THAT'S ACTUALLY YOU THREE RIGHT HERE

89
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,995
Yeah, Sae-ho is dressed too flashy.

90
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,705
-He might not get in.
-I know.

91
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,375
Miss, this way.

92
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,297
Wait, Miss.

93
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,132
What? Why?

94
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,343
I believe you're married.

95
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,763
The thing is,
married women and men can't enter.

96
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,723
I'm sorry, head to the second floor.

97
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,849
-Me?
-Second floor?

98
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,518
But my husband could be dead right now.

99
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,811
UNVERIFIED INFO, NOT CONVINCED

100
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,897
Sorry. Please head to the second floor.

101
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,815
Why me?

102
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,110
-Congratulations on your wedding.
-Well…

103
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,111
Thank you.

104
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,407
-Second floor please.
-What?

105
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,576
Why are you looking at my face though?

106
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,411
-To the 2nd floor!
-He looks so sad.

107
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,373
Fourth floor.

108
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,833
Fourth floor obviously. You're so cute.

109
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,710
-The pool party!
-I love it here.

110
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,837
-Second floor.
-They have good judgement!

111
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,589
How about us?

112
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,758
Hurry to the fourth floor.

113
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,218
Hurry.

114
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,552
Party tonight!

115
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,471
Party tonight! Go, go, go!

116
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:27,141
But this isn't the time for chitchat.

117
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,977
We shouldn't let our guard down.

118
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,728
Oh, it's Sae-ho.

119
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,481
Wait, we're the odd ones out?

120
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,566
REALIZES AS SOON AS HE SEES SAE-HO

121
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,526
They'll join us.

122
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,236
They're on the fourth floor.

123
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,946
Did we get denied entry?

124
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,239
I can't agree to this.

125
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,950
Were they judging us
based on our appearance?

126
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,368
Code Kunst…

127
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,787
He only looks good
because he's well dressed.

128
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,498
-But if you look at this face…
-No, he's not bad.

129
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,917
-How about me?
-Is it because of my big ears?

130
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,712
But in my case,
it's because I'm a civil servant.

131
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,758
-It's noisy.
-I know.

132
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,593
-What?
-What is it?

133
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,594
What?

134
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,098
This is crazy.

135
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,350
-What?
-It's a real party?

136
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,810
Unbelievable.

137
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,062
This is crazy, TAEYEON.

138
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,772
Look at the ocean view.

139
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,524
Isn't this insane?

140
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,652
This looks fun though.

141
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:24,615
It's been ages since I felt this energy!

142
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,495
ZOMBIES? WHATEVER!
FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO PARTY

143
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,957
These people are unaware
of what's going on.

144
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,586
Is anyone feeling scared?

145
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,712
No!

146
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,047
What are you all up to?

147
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,964
Get here!

148
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,841
What on earth…

149
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,094
It seems like none of them
have seen zombies before.

150
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,265
GETTING OVER THE CRISIS BY PARTYING

151
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,186
Guys repeat after me, "I want that woman"!

152
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,896
I want that woman!

153
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,814
I want that man!

154
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,485
That's really inappropriate.

155
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,569
Matchmaking.

156
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,987
They're here to pick someone up.

157
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,324
Get close and have some fun!

158
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,367
Great!

159
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,620
One more time. "I want that woman"!

160
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,039
-The music's too loud.
-So loud.

161
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,290
Any zombies outside?

162
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,250
Let's enter by covering our faces.

163
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,377
Wow, what's that?

164
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,295
What is it?

165
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,131
"I want that woman"!

166
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,054
A SHOCKING SCENE
FOR THOSE ON THE 2ND FLOOR

167
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,391
They're partying in this situation?

168
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,601
Si-young!

169
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,561
-You were up here?
-What's going on?

170
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,271
Wow, this is crazy.

171
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,023
What is this place?

172
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,735
But this isn't the time for chitchat.

173
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,446
We need to stay alert.

174
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,199
We shouldn't let our guard down.

175
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,286
FORGET ABOUT STAYING ALERT

176
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,289
Look at that.

177
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,208
There's so much food here!

178
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,001
It's just full-on party mode here.

179
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,755
It's insane.

180
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,215
Now, everyone.

181
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,342
Just as things are heating up,

182
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,720
we'd like to introduce our guest.

183
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,763
There's a guest?

184
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,725
-She's here thanks to this chaos.
-Who?

185
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,935
What? She?

186
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,854
The queen of Yangyang.

187
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,773
-Please welcome her!
-What?

188
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,942
Who is she?

189
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,943
Who is it?

190
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,028
A FAMILIAR SONG STARTS PLAYING

191
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
Oh, what?

192
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,615
What is it?

193
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,492
-Who is it?
-Oh! It's Eun-bi.

194
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,785
-Kwon Eun-bi?
-What?

195
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,703
What's going on?

196
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,163
Kwon Eun-bi.

197
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,665
-What?
-Wow, incredible.

198
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,002
-What?
-Eun-bi!

199
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,128
I can't believe it.

200
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,132
A FAMILIAR FACE AS AN UNEXPECTED GUEST

201
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,383
What?

202
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,552
Eun-bi!

203
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,223
Kwon Eun-bi!

204
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,642
-Hey!
-Eun-bi!

205
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,811
Is she here for a gig amidst this chaos?

206
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,188
She's here for a gig.

207
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,940
TRUE DEDICATION OF A PROFESSIONAL

208
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,946
Eun-bi!

209
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,167
Come on!

210
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,628
REMEMBER TO STAY ALERT!

211
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,177
Goddess, Kwon Eun-bi!

212
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,136
You're loving it.

213
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,141
She's not messing around.

214
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,186
KOREANS WILL STILL
GO TO WORK DESPITE A ZOMBIE OUTBREAK

215
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,482
Let's go!

216
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,487
It's like the Waterbomb Festival.

217
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,407
It's the Waterbomb Festival!

218
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,077
THE RAREST SCENE IN
THE HISTORY OF ZOMBIE OUTBREAKS

219
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,708
I'm a singer too.

220
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,753
VISITED YANGYANG FOR A GIG,
STAYED FOR EVACUATION

221
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,463
SHE'S NOW MAKING THE MOST OF IT

222
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,340
Kwon Eun-bi!

223
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,342
IS HE WISHING FOR HIS FRIEND'S WELLNESS?

224
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,637
Don't go!

225
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,807
Eun-bi!

226
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,225
No.

227
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,434
It's dangerous here.

228
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,729
Is she just leaving?

229
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,439
She's leaving after this?

230
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,733
Let's give her another round of applause!

231
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,734
Eun-bi!

232
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,945
It's dangerous here.

233
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,029
Is she gone?

234
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,114
MAYBE SHE HAS ANOTHER GIG

235
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,615
What a busy performer.

236
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,537
Everyone, time for the next activity.

237
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,584
Let's start the kiss time!

238
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,085
YANGYANG, THE PLACE TO BE!

239
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,587
SWEET KISS TIME

240
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,921
-What?
-Kiss time?

241
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,923
Oh, it's kiss time?

242
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:56,887
Who will be our first contestant?

243
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,930
Who is it?

244
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,981
What? Where are they?

245
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,316
THEY AREN'T ZOMBIES

246
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,777
They're actually kissing.

247
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,862
Basically a vacuum.

248
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,073
Thank you! I envy you guys.

249
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,158
The second couple.

250
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,285
Who will it be?

251
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,037
Why am I eager to watch this?

252
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,580
Where?

253
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,915
Where?

254
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,167
Shoot.

255
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,209
Kiss!

256
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,379
FAILED TO CALIBRATE

257
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,672
Hurry up, you two!

258
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,467
Kiss!

259
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,136
-Why are you licking?
-They're doing it.

260
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,726
THE PRO YOUTUBER NEVER DISAPPOINTS

261
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,061
That was great.

262
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,687
I didn't like that.

263
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,397
You didn't like it?

264
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,565
The third couple?

265
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,275
-Me too.
-Where?

266
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,193
Who will it be?

267
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,070
Where?

268
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:54,987
Oh, here.

269
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,947
-Dex.
-Oh, Dex?

270
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,121
THE PLAYFUL FRIEND PUSHES HER IN!

271
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,457
You can't allow that.

272
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,961
Dex, don't do it.

273
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:11,921
No, no.

274
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,840
No, you can't.

275
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,719
No, no.

276
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,139
You can't.

277
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,852
PROFESSIONALS WHO NEVER LET US DOWN

278
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,230
Wow, I love it here.

279
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,774
Let's look for our fourth couple.

280
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,235
At this rate, why don't we all just kiss?

281
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,320
Who will it be?

282
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,488
Where?

283
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, he's shy.

284
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,991
He's hiding his face.

285
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,451
Please show your face.

286
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,245
-Where?
-Where is he?

287
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,747
Move your hat!

288
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,917
-He's so shy! Take it off!
-Where is he?

289
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,419
What?

290
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,088
-Wait!
-What the…

291
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,631
What!

292
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,049
Hong-chul…

293
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,509
Hong-chul!

294
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,553
What's going on?

295
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,930
-Is that Hong-chul?
-It is.

296
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,314
HONG-CHUL WAS RECENTLY IN
LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATIONS WITH THEM

297
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,485
EVERYONE REMEMBERS THAT
HE GOT BITTEN BY ZOMBIE NA-RAE

298
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,403
Hold on.

299
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,821
You said Hong-chul died.

300
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,824
I swear he was bitten by the zombies.

301
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,659
Did you see it with your own eyes?

302
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,202
Yes, he died.

303
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,454
Is he a zombie?

304
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
How is he here then?

305
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,332
Maybe he's a look-alike.

306
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,835
There can't be a look-alike
for a face like that.

307
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,005
Let's look for Hong-chul.

308
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,385
He's not there, right?

309
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,181
It's time for a dance battle! Let's go!

310
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,143
It's not the right time for this.

311
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,686
But they don't know that.

312
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,104
They're clueless.

313
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,106
Ro Hong-chul!

314
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,193
I still feel uneasy about this.

315
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,986
I agree.

316
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,113
What if Sae-ho returns bitten?

317
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,324
Let's go!

318
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,493
Hong-chul!

319
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,163
Can we go upstairs?

320
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,414
There's a rooftop.

321
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,958
-Maybe he's up there.
-Oh, there?

322
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,044
Upstairs.

323
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,758
Where is he?

324
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,389
-What?
-Hong-chul.

325
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,519
Hong-chul.

326
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,024
How did all of you get here?

327
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,984
A FEW MINUTES AGO

328
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,361
Kiss!

329
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,029
HE WAS CHANTING WITH THE CROWD

330
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,822
-What?
-What is it?

331
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,115
Yook Sung-jae?

332
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,451
Wait, wasn't that DinDin?

333
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,373
Please show your face.

334
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,667
Oh, here? Wait…

335
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,377
No, no!

336
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,632
Wait, my glasses.

337
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,344
HE WAS DEFINITELY INFECTED IN INCHEON,
BUT NOW HE'S HERE IN YANGYANG?

338
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,012
-What?
-How did you…

339
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
-What?
-Hong-chul!

340
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,390
Hong-chul!

341
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,808
-Oh, Sae-ho.
-Hong-chul!

342
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,184
-Hong-chul.
-TAEYEON!

343
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,812
-Hong-chul.
-How did you all get here?

344
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,313
-What's going on?
-Why?

345
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,941
Oh, Sae-ho.

346
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,109
Why? What's wrong?

347
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,112
-Why? What's wrong?
-Gosh.

348
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,030
No, not me.

349
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,574
No, I'm okay. Don't worry.

350
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,867
He's bitten.

351
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,993
Where?

352
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,203
Over here, look.

353
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,956
-Stay still.
-No, no.

354
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,666
Over here, I see it.

355
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,376
Wait, no, no.

356
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,004
No, I'm not. Give me a moment.

357
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,130
What the heck!

358
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,716
-Look! His eye!
-His eye is weird!

359
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,260
-I'm not bitten.
-Si-young, be careful.

360
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,428
-What is it?
-I'm not.

361
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,637
No, no.

362
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,055
Don't ruin a great day.

363
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
How have you been, DinDin?

364
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,309
But how are you still fine?

365
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,852
Let's go somewhere quiet.

366
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,479
His bite mark has healed.

367
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,857
I'm fine, you know that.

368
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,984
-Come this way.
-He's weird.

369
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,112
Why do you keep laughing? Stop!

370
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,864
I've been laughing a lot since then.

371
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,907
Hong-chul!

372
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,742
-Hong-chul.
-This is it.

373
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,951
I remember now!

374
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,871
I told you to stop laughing.
Why are you laughing?

375
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,373
Let's go downstairs where Defconn is.

376
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,209
-Let's go.
-Put on your glasses and your shirt.

377
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,171
Is something wrong? We're unsure.

378
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,132
I'm totally fine.

379
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,468
Should we at least tie his hands up?

380
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,387
-I'm worried. He's like a zombie.
-That's not true.

381
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,473
But if something happens,

382
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,351
we'd probably hear people
screaming and rushing down.

383
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,393
That's true.

384
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,479
You never know when something will happen.

385
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,022
Silence makes me anxious.

386
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,358
You guys…

387
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,068
Let's just talk this through.

388
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,694
Silence makes me anxious.

389
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,030
Oh, you're all alive!

390
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,531
-What?
-Huh?

391
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,574
-Wait.
-Hey!

392
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,575
-First…
-Wait.

393
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,118
Hey, everyone step back.

394
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,912
-Let go of him first.
-Why?

395
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,705
-Defconn!
-Hong-chul died back then.

396
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,582
What happened to you?

397
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,335
I heard you and Na-rae died.

398
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,878
We thought you died.

399
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,838
How did you get here? What happened?

400
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,465
All right. Let me explain.

401
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,633
Take off your glasses.

402
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,468
-Look!
-No, no.

403
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,054
-Look at this eye.
-No.

404
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,305
-No, no.
-Look.

405
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,431
I have smiley eyes.

406
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,641
-I'm winking.
-What?

407
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,142
Tell us everything first.

408
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,602
Show me your teeth.

409
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,645
I've got good teeth.

410
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,355
Where did you get bitten?

411
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,314
-Well, I…
-Here.

412
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,732
-He's bitten.
-Where?

413
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,527
-Darn!
-Look.

414
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,362
It's starting to rot.

415
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,239
No, please hear me out.

416
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,783
Just tell us how you got here first.

417
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,118
-Dex?
-Yes.

418
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,204
What's up with him?
He's bitten on the neck.

419
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,248
But Dex, it's red here.

420
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,541
I see the teeth mark.

421
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,084
Look, it's red.

422
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,003
It's Na-rae's bite mark. It's red.

423
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:49,299
You know this, bro.
Zombies have blue blood.

424
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,884
Bro? Who do you think you are?

425
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:51,885
KEEP YOUR MANNERS

426
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,012
-Sorry.
-His mind…

427
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,306
No, I'm not out of my mind.
My eye just looks like this.

428
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,059
-He's not in his right mind.
-You're out of your mind.

429
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,605
Anyways, just tell us about your state.

430
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,566
Why aren't you a zombie yet?

431
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,775
Na-rae bit you, right?

432
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,068
-Na-rae bit me.
-Yeah.

433
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
She bit me.

434
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,612
But after a few days,

435
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,158
I opened my eyes and surprisingly,
I was still alive.

436
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,371
My bite mark healed
and didn't hurt anymore.

437
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,706
Look, I'm totally fine.

438
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,416
-Look here.
-What is it?

439
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,333
It's healed.

440
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,960
Yeah, it started healing.

441
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,170
Are you serious?

442
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,921
I'm feeling uneasy.

443
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,798
So how did you get here then?

444
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,884
So, I got out of where I was.

445
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,344
I saw on the news
that Seoul was locked down.

446
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,846
I was feeling lost but…

447
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,347
-You heard Yangyang was safe.
-Yes!

448
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,599
That's how you're here?

449
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,809
Yes, I hitchhiked and asked for a ride.

450
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,188
I feel like it's still dangerous for us.

451
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,815
They betrayed Hong-chul
and he might be here

452
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,275
to bite them out of revenge.

453
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,652
-Let me explain…
-That's cool.

454
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,198
Na-rae only opens her mouth wide
for delicious food.

455
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,365
Code Kunst.

456
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,366
Come here.

457
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,826
Be careful.

458
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,744
It's dangerous.

459
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,828
Sit farther apart.

460
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,205
Farther apart.

461
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,458
He's here for revenge since he got played.

462
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,169
Wait, why does the room feel divided?

463
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,337
-It's not.
-Come here.

464
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,379
It's our first time.

465
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,965
It's okay. That's understandable.

466
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,384
Come on, we were all colleagues before.

467
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,136
That applies when we're normal.

468
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,013
-Hey, come here.
-I'm okay with it.

469
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,641
Come on, let's not draw a line here.

470
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,311
Tell us exactly how you feel right now.

471
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,522
Do you have a fever or an urge to bite?

472
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,856
-The desire.
-Sometimes.

473
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,483
-Sometimes, I feel the urge.
-What?

474
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,779
But it goes away
when I eat something sweet.

475
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,532
Blood tastes sweet to you now, right?

476
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,202
No, I don't crave for humans.
I crave spicy stir-fried pork.

477
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,495
Stir-fried human meat?

478
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,081
I wanted stir-fried pork,
so I went to a restaurant…

479
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,125
DON'T BE THINKING ABOUT FOOD RIGHT NOW

480
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,544
Sung-jae.

481
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,255
-Let's kill him.
-Kill him?

482
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,090
Look, does this hurt?

483
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,133
Of course, it does.

484
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,050
It hurts a lot.

485
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:55,968
-It hurts?
-Yes.

486
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,178
-This is too risky.
-Does this hurt?

487
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,055
Anyways, Hong-chul…

488
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,224
Should we tie him up or something?

489
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,809
Have you bitten anyone?

490
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,102
Never.

491
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,354
What's going on?

492
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,898
I know, this is a unique case.

493
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,694
TAEYEON, let's kill him.

494
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,905
How do we do that?

495
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,118
Is he like Nezuko?

496
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,619
-Nezuko?
-Nezuko…

497
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,246
That's a fictional character.

498
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,081
RIGHT NOW ISN'T THE TIME FOR THIS

499
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,333
Hong-chul, do zombies avoid you?

500
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,794
-I'm curious too.
-You know what's cool?

501
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,963
Remember how they didn't attack
Na-rae and Kkwachu?

502
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,882
They saw me but they didn't attack.

503
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,010
Do they notice you
when you walk past them?

504
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,846
It's like running into
an old acquaintance at a reunion.

505
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,391
This means he's invincible.

506
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,268
Even if he's invincible,

507
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,478
we don't have to take him with us.

508
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,063
Right, we don't.

509
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,650
But it was pretty convenient
to get around last time,

510
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,194
since the zombies didn't attack us.

511
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,070
I know you're glad to see him.

512
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,280
No, not at all.

513
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,823
-The situation…
-You're not?

514
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,491
We need to use him as a shield.

515
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,492
Let's do this.

516
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,244
There are zombies out there.

517
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,454
-Let's get out…
-Wait.

518
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,456
Let's test if zombies really avoid him.

519
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,875
We might be safe with
Hong-chul by our side.

520
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,002
Even if he's with us, we can tie him up.

521
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,421
Let's run some tests on him.

522
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,339
Tests?

523
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,382
I heard zombies can't taste salty flavors.

524
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,260
-It's salty just by looking at it.
-This much.

525
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,970
Can you sprinkle some in your eye?

526
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,180
In my eye?

527
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,265
-Should we vote?
-I've got my own plans.

528
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,308
Why would I stay?

529
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
I hope you understand that

530
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,811
we'll have to tie you up

531
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,230
until we can trust you.

532
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,481
You can't do that.

533
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,316
-Why not?
-I've got nothing to lose.

534
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,819
Exactly, he has no reason to stay with us.

535
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,904
Why would I?

536
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,073
In a way, I died because of you all.

537
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,908
-Nonsense.
-It's not our fault.

538
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,785
-Na-rae killed you.
-Hong-chul, come on.

539
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,745
Back at the Ferris wheel,
you, you, and you.

540
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,497
It's Tsuki's fault.

541
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,874
Hong-chul is there.

542
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,335
Tsuki told them where you were.

543
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,670
That's why you died.

544
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,380
-Really?
-There were some issues.

545
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,924
IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S TSUKI'S FAULT

546
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,342
Those bastards.

547
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,135
That was so mean.

548
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,512
Where is Tsuki?

549
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,596
Why isn't she here?

550
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,890
Is everyone having a good time?

551
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,100
Yes!

552
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,184
Are you having fun?

553
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,602
Yes!

554
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,771
Eun-bi!

555
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,022
Oh, Tsuki!

556
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,357
-Why are you here?
-Hey!

557
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
It's been so long.

558
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,609
-Yes!
-How've you been?

559
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,027
-I'm Chungju Man.
-I know!

560
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,945
You know me?

561
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,154
-Of course.
-Thank you!

562
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,115
Eun-bi, why are you here?

563
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,783
Because I have a gig here.

564
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,410
I heard it's safe here.

565
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,495
-Is it safe?
-Do you know this place?

566
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,497
-This is my manager.
-Hello.

567
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,540
He knows the owner.

568
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,417
Yes, it's probably the safest here.

569
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,085
-It's better if you stay.
-Okay.

570
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,628
-I have to perform.
-Call me!

571
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,797
-I'm sad that you need to go.
-Let me be your guest.

572
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,257
I can perform as your guest.

573
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,633
-Call me.
-Oh, thank…

574
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,302
YOU JUST MET! NOT COOL

575
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,387
Stop it, please.

576
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,806
-Just go.
-Bye.

577
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,391
Eun-bi, see you later!

578
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,727
Be careful!

579
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,855
How do you feel about Tsuki right now?

580
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,440
She's…

581
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,364
Oh, Tsuki!

582
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,907
She's here!

583
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,368
You're here?

584
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,708
-Hello.
-I missed you so much!

585
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,792
Are you okay?

586
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,005
Are you okay?

587
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,381
Did his eye just light up?

588
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,717
He's grabbing her hand.

589
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,387
He's being fake.

590
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,307
She's the one being fake.

591
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,684
-Take it easy, man.
-Wait.

592
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,649
Hong-chul, it's okay.

593
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,401
Your hand.

594
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,571
-Hong-chul, let go.
-Let go first.

595
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,616
-Let go.
-What's wrong with him?

596
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,826
Hong-chul, easy.

597
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,952
I'm just asking.

598
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,496
What was that about?

599
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,247
-You changed.
-No, that's not it.

600
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,374
You're showing your true colors now.

601
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,876
I was fine until I realized

602
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,961
I could control her by holding her hand,

603
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,047
so I gripped it too firmly.

604
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,590
But I've come to my senses now.

605
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,634
You didn't think about
biting Tsuki, did you?

606
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:11,807
Well, I wouldn't mind
giving her a taste of what I endured.

607
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,017
But, I really did miss you.

608
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,352
I don't hold a grudge.

609
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,437
Indirect murderer.

610
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,106
Sit.

611
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,066
-Hello, murderer.
-Happy to see you.

612
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,067
My murderer.

613
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,527
-Murderer?
-Were you guys…

614
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,320
I think he's still holding a grudge.

615
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,488
It's my way of expression.

616
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,656
No.

617
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,033
Hong-chul, if we decide to trust you

618
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,745
but you turn into a zombie,
can we take you down?

619
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,205
No, you can't.

620
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,623
What if you turn into one?

621
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,125
We don't have a choice.

622
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,544
We can't trust you
with your eye like that.

623
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,546
If you're here to revenge against Tsuki,

624
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,550
you could hide a bunch of zombies
in a storage room and let them out.

625
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,968
If you let them out…

626
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,470
He could lead the zombies.

627
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,805
Like a cult leader, right?

628
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,349
But Hong-chul isn't that bad of a person.

629
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,685
He could be hiding them somewhere.

630
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,728
Hong-chul, why aren't you denying it?

631
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:03,608
I personally think we need Hong-chul,
but I can see that happening though.

632
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,777
He'd let the zombies in with a big smile.

633
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,737
We should be careful.

634
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,990
After everything we've been through.

635
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,949
Stay cautious!

636
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,868
But he used to be with us.

637
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,203
What do you mean? That's the past.

638
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,330
Hong-chul, never betray us again.

639
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,417
But Si-young, do you think
just telling him that is enough?

640
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,962
Are you sure that you're a semi-zombie?

641
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,046
Semi-zombie?

642
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,675
I'm not semi-zombie. I'm fully human.

643
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,427
Fully human.

644
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,095
I like the sound of that.

645
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,347
-Semi-zombie.
-I'm losing it.

646
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,974
-Semi-zombie.
-I'm fully human.

647
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,685
Like "semi-celebrity."

648
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,355
-What's that?
-That startled me.

649
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
What's going on?

650
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,570
What's going on?

651
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,863
Breaking news.

652
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,031
News?

653
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,825
How are we getting news in this situation?

654
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,452
Breaking news.

655
00:24:55,535 --> 00:25:00,498
It's been 21 days since a new virus
with violent tendencies emerged.

656
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,502
Currently, the virus is rapidly spreading
across Jeju Island.

657
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,879
We were just there.

658
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,839
Si-young mentioned earlier.

659
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,760
The Global Urgent Relief Alliance,

660
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,553
also known as GURA.

661
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,305
G, U, R…

662
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,848
GURA.

663
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,061
It's reported that they deployed
emergency helicopters to rescue people

664
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,521
who are stranded and bring them to safety.

665
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,856
We were on the same one!

666
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,233
You guys were on that?

667
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,817
How did everyone fit in that?

668
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,986
WE COULDN'T

669
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,823
As the scale of the damage grew,
a withdrawal was declared shortly

670
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,617
after the rescue operations began.

671
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,035
They stopped the rescue?

672
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,453
We were the last ones.

673
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,955
Patricia won't make it.

674
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,373
Poor Patricia.

675
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,832
She'll meet her brother.

676
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,542
In the midst of utter chaos,

677
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:49,339
the survivors are left to find
their own way to safety.

678
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,341
Let's interview one of the survivors.

679
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,427
What the heck!

680
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,471
-Oh my!
-Seriously?

681
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,555
Unbelievable.

682
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,682
They're alive!

683
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,850
-Who's that?
-Our friend, Andre!

684
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,978
I'm happy to be alive…

685
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,521
Andre was with us.

686
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,438
Was he?

687
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,731
He saved us.

688
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,649
-Really?
-Wow.

689
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,109
He must've taken them down.

690
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,487
But to come out
and be here still is everything.

691
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,823
We're strong and we survived.

692
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,575
-He's alive.
-How about Patrishu?

693
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,868
Patricia. Not Patrishu.

694
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,120
-Not Patrishu.
-Patricia.

695
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,122
-He did say "we."
-He did.

696
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,999
They must be together.

697
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,418
-Patricia.
-He probably did the interview alone.

698
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,254
What a relief!

699
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,257
Here's the next update.
We finally have some hopeful news.

700
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,342
-Hopeful?
-What's there to be hopeful about?

701
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,971
New findings and government guidelines

702
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,182
regarding the violent virus outbreak
have been released.

703
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,393
Can we trust the government's briefing?

704
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,145
It's reliable and trustworthy.

705
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,229
What nonsense.

706
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,398
It looks like we're connected.

707
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,733
What's it about?

708
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,652
My family.

709
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,862
Oh, matching outfits.

710
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,700
Citizens, we understand the struggles
and fear you have had to endure.

711
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,786
While continuing to seek
effective responses,

712
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,749
authorities have identified
a very rare group of individuals who,

713
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,625
despite being infected with the virus,

714
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,713
retain cognitive abilities
and emotional responses typical of humans.

715
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,548
-What?
-Mutants.

716
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,717
-It's Hong-chul.
-Really?

717
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,594
With a possibility of 1 in 2.5 million…

718
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,888
-One in 2.5 million?
-One in 2.5 million?

719
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,848
Lucky guy, you're a lucky guy.

720
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,852
It's estimated that only
a very small number exist domestically.

721
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,936
You're very special.

722
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,483
A sequence of antibodies not found in
existing infected individuals was found.

723
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,652
This has led to the observation
of a new response

724
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,988
that reduces the activity of the virus.

725
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,948
So this is a scab.

726
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,158
-It's healing.
-No way.

727
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,576
Are you the chosen one?

728
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,827
Yes, 1 in 2.5 million.

729
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,205
-Then you're not a zombie.
-That's right.

730
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:49,834
Based on this discovery,
we're urgently working on

731
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,463
developing treatments and potentially
preventative measures

732
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,923
using this sequence of antibody.

733
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,508
This could be a sign of hope.

734
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,592
Wait, be quiet.

735
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,344
No cases have been found yet.

736
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,096
But due to the urgency,

737
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,848
a 50 million won reward is offered
for information on individuals

738
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,308
with this rare condition.

739
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,476
Fifty million won?

740
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,689
And 500 million won for their location.

741
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,774
Five hundred million?

742
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,904
We don't get taxed, right?

743
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,572
You do get taxed.

744
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,199
That'll be around 300 million?

745
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,452
Those who escort them
to the National Medical Center in Seoul

746
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,455
will receive a maximum reward
of five billion won.

747
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,540
What?

748
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,752
Five billion won…

749
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:39,717
We will also arrange
a safe accommodation for you afterwards.

750
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,804
To summarize the briefing…

751
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,723
We need to take him.

752
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,058
-To Seoul!
-Five billion if we bring him there?

753
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,021
Hey, Dex.

754
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,108
You could easily buy
an expensive place in Apgujeong.

755
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,912
Oh, my.

756
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,539
Don't tie me up.

757
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,541
Wow, this is amazing. Is this really me?

758
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,460
-I need the restroom.
-Go together.

759
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,670
I need to use the restroom. I'll prove it.

760
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,963
You're worth 5 billion.

761
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,674
If you just call,
it's already 500 million.

762
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,177
Let's go together.
I need to go to the restroom too.

763
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,929
-You'd be misunderstood.
-Go together in a group.

764
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,431
Code Kunst, come with me.

765
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,642
Hong-chul, we'll protect you from now on.

766
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,479
You wanted to kill him.

767
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,230
Oh, I'm suddenly feeling hurt.

768
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,065
You called me a semi-zombie earlier.

769
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,526
-No, that's…
-As if you were a cockroach.

770
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,361
You sprinkled salt on me too and I…

771
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,572
Okay, let me just use the restroom first.

772
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,991
Let's go together with Dex.
Come on, Hong-chul.

773
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,243
Do you normally go together?

774
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,953
Yes, we go together.

775
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,831
-This is really unpleasant.
-Hey, this is good.

776
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,170
But even if we had the money…

777
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,131
-Realistically, money is…
-We can't even use it now.

778
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,091
We don't even need money anymore.

779
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,053
What's the use of
having money in this situation?

780
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,722
The point is to take him
to make the antibodies.

781
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,681
Money is a bonus.

782
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,434
If we spray it like pesticides
from a helicopter,

783
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,102
everyone will return to normal.

784
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,313
It's about saving humanity, not the money.

785
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,272
That's right.

786
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,692
National Medical Center
is near Jongno-gu in Seoul.

787
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,735
Located in Gangbuk.

788
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,946
If we get into the hospital, we're safe.

789
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,614
We'd survive if we get in the hospital.

790
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,868
They will also arrange
a safe accommodation for you afterwards.

791
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,995
We are doing this
for the good of the public.

792
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,581
We're taking Hong-chul
for the good of the public, right?

793
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,666
Yes.

794
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,584
ABSOLUTELY NOT BLINDED BY MONEY!

795
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,087
From what I heard,

796
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,465
I think it's a good idea
to take Hong-chul there.

797
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,011
But do we need him alive?

798
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,642
What are you on about?
The antibody should be fresh and alive.

799
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,144
HIS EYES ARE FILLED WITH WILD IDEAS

800
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,729
Your gaze is getting weird.

801
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,982
No, it was purely out of curiosity.

802
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,109
His eyeballs are almost popping out.

803
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,697
We need to live.

804
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,658
Tell them what happened in the restroom.

805
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,577
-Isn't it the same?
-It's the same color?

806
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,829
He was just weak,
otherwise, it seems fine.

807
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,997
Did you call me weak?

808
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,748
-I wasn't weaker than you.
-Really?

809
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,833
Sorry, Hong-chul.

810
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:22,964
Hey, what humanity needs right now are
people with rare antibodies like yours.

811
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,299
To get things back to normal.

812
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,802
According to the news,
if I go with Defconn, he'd get 5 billion.

813
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,053
I don't need the money.

814
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,346
If I go on my own, I'd get it.

815
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,181
You can keep the money.

816
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,892
Humanity needs you.

817
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,310
Yes, we don't need the money.

818
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,352
We don't need it.

819
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,521
No, it'll be 500 million won per person.

820
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,776
There are ten of us.

821
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,694
HEY, READ THE ROOM

822
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,198
HE DESPERATELY NEEDS THE MONEY

823
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,158
Ten of us…

824
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,744
If it's 500 million won,
you excluded Hong-chul.

825
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,290
Just come with us to the hospital.

826
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,125
I can just go on my own.

827
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,711
Someone else must need it
more than you do.

828
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,254
The number of rooms is limited.

829
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,756
I'm fine with the corridor.

830
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,007
I'd just go anyways.

831
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,634
Seeing the news, I should go.

832
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,927
-You bastard!
-Here…

833
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,803
Let's go together!

834
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,139
We'll accompany you there.

835
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,141
Don't bother. I just need a walking stick.

836
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,727
Do you know what people are saying?

837
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:23,483
They could chop you up,
put you in dry ice and take you there.

838
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,859
-The person next to you.
-Here?

839
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,861
DON'T EXAGGERATE

840
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,571
The civil servant next to you.

841
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,742
Sorry, but wouldn't developing
the antibodies mean he has to die?

842
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,452
No, they'd just extract it.

843
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,664
Officer, if you say that,
he would never go.

844
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,877
Hong-chul,
even if we bring you to the hospital,

845
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,879
we don't know what they'll do to you.

846
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,005
You'll need us.

847
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,507
That sounds very important.

848
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,466
-Yes.
-True.

849
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,926
PERSUASION IS WORKING

850
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,469
They might open your head up.

851
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,681
We will protect you so that
nothing happens to you.

852
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,559
Hong-chul, this is a gift from my heart.
It's from Chrome Hearts.

853
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,937
DESIGNER SUNGLASSES
SAE-HO'S PRECIOUS ITEM

854
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,231
Let him try it on. This looks way better.

855
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,315
-Way better.
-Really?

856
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,317
-You look good. Clap!
-No, well…

857
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,360
-Okay.
-Looks good.

858
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,945
Sung-jae might be right.

859
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,697
Yes, we need to accompany you.

860
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,407
If I did go because they needed me…

861
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,325
They might open you up.

862
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,411
You're really wise, Sung-jae.

863
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,579
Hong-chul,
if you have even the tiniest amount

864
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,665
of love for humanity…

865
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,501
That's right,
you'd be the king of a new era.

866
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,169
I'll keep a record of you.

867
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,922
Better to have people
visit your bakery than zombies.

868
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,590
-Good point.
-That's true.

869
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,641
Sit down and have a madeleine.

870
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,934
I love madeleines.

871
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,689
-Do you guys want it?
-Looks sweet.

872
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,191
I haven't eaten in ten days,
but I found it there.

873
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,077
You can still enjoy food.

874
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,621
Have a bite. Give it back after.

875
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,874
He wants it back.

876
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,876
You're only allowed one bite.

877
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,170
-He's still selfish.
-Just a bite.

878
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,465
-Just one bite.
-Still selfish.

879
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,592
Just one bite.

880
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,095
Get him!

881
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:23,019
Get him!

882
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,021
Catch him! He's so fast!

883
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,149
Wow, he just runs off like that?

884
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,486
Be careful!

885
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,987
Why is he so fast?

886
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,616
I knew this would happen.

887
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,494
-He never changes, really.
-I should've doubted him.

888
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,121
Geez, he's so fast.

889
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:44,999
Hey, slow down!

890
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,796
I'm exhausted.

891
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,052
-Hold on.
-What?

892
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,512
Zombies!

893
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,068
Everyone's a zombie!

894
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,070
Everyone at the party turned into zombies.

895
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,913
THE ZOMBIE WHO HAD
HIS SURFING WET SUIT TAKEN AWAY

896
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:27,041
FOLLOWED THEM TO THE CLUB
BUT GOT BEATEN UP INSTEAD

897
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,086
Hey, come on!

898
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,256
HE ENDED UP BEING CAUGHT BY DRUNKEN PEOPLE

899
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,050
-Let's go!
-Come on!

900
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,305
THE ZOMBIE'S PATIENCE IS BEING TESTED

901
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,723
Up we go!

902
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,267
Zombie!

903
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,729
My nose! Shoot!

904
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,064
Darn it!

905
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,073
Manager!

906
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,753
Party!

907
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,591
Wait…

908
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,428
Oh, finally.

909
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,347
Hey!

910
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,308
You jerks!

911
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,727
-There are zombies!
-A lot of them.

912
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,069
He's strolling around casually.

913
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,155
It's true that he's a half-zombie.

914
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,573
Goodness!

915
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,744
Why did he do that?

916
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,412
What's going on?

917
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,665
Over here!

918
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,837
I'm over here!

919
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,548
-It's Eun-bi.
-I'm here!

920
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,218
Over here!

921
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,302
We should save her.

922
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,554
Wow, what do we do though?

923
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,389
There are too many of them.

924
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,557
Should we go down first?

925
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,558
Here!

926
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,643
Hold on, this…

927
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,774
Hong-chul went down.

928
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,817
He went down the elevator?

929
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,986
Let's catch him first.

930
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,281
Darn!

931
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,282
Those bastards.

932
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,700
-Ro Hong-chul!
-Get him!

933
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,244
-He's there!
-Catch him!

934
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,745
Filthy bastards!

935
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,871
Selfish jerks!

936
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,081
Don't run away, Hong-chul!

937
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,998
Get away!

938
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,375
-Hong-chul!
-Don't come!

939
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,377
-Ro Hong-chul!
-Get away!

940
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,837
-Catch him!
-Stop following!

941
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,339
Hey, we'd all die!

942
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,298
You evil jerks!

943
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,634
Oh, my legs!

944
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,803
-Hong-chul, wait!
-Don't come!

945
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,721
-Where is he going?
-Wait.

946
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,722
What is it?

947
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,848
Where is this place?

948
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,854
There's blood over there!

949
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,690
-Where?
-On the blanket!

950
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,858
-Oh, my. What's that?
-Geez.

951
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,242
What is that?

952
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,535
Wait, don't go in.

953
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,829
It feels like we shouldn't go in.

954
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,875
A SUSPICIOUS MOTEL BY THE BEACH

955
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,044
I don't think we should enter it.

956
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:17,962
What the heck?

957
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,880
When did you put that on?

958
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,840
As I was running.

959
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,508
THE WET SUIT DEX AND SUNG-JAE BROUGHT

960
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,176
-Hong-chul went in there.
-What?

961
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,553
Let's see where he is.

962
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,971
He went in already?

963
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,639
He could escape from the back.

964
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,349
-Check the back.
-Did he escape?

965
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,434
Oh, from the back?

966
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,727
Go and check the back.

967
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,978
We'll watch the front.

968
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,566
There's no back door.

969
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,568
-Really?
-Defconn, there's no back door.

970
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,569
He'd be in there then.

971
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,321
We just need to block the front.

972
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,493
-Where?
-There!

973
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,162
THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY TURNED ON

974
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,246
-Look!
-That startled me.

975
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,748
Up there too!

976
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,124
That silhouette!

977
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,417
Let's look from here.

978
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,381
8 ROOMS LIT UP

979
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:06,135
HUMAN-SHAPED SILHOUETTES
ARE SEEN IN ALL THE ROOMS

980
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,637
Which silhouette is it?

981
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,556
So is it one of them?

982
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,099
Try and catch me!

983
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,229
-Where?
-You rats!

984
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,231
-That guy is insane.
-Come in here!

985
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,025
He chose the difficult path.

986
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,027
Hong-chul, come out! Let's just talk!

987
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,780
This is crazy.

988
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,031
We need to catch him.

989
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,617
Wait, isn't that a walking stick?
Over there?

990
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,161
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,
YOU CAN FIND HIS LOCATION

991
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,747
-Hong-chul had a hat on.
-That's right.

992
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,795
-But that one's wearing a hat too.
-Oh, you're right.

993
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,590
-This one's a rocker.
-A rocker.

994
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,842
It's going to break its neck.

995
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,720
The one on the left is obviously a zombie.

996
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,014
It's definitely a zombie. It's so still.

997
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,558
I think everyone in there is a zombie.

998
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,104
HONG-CHUL IS HIDING IN
ONE OF THESE LIT ROOMS

999
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,858
Wait, maybe Hong-chul was staying here.

1000
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,569
Yes, he did say
he has been here for a few days.

1001
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,154
He must've ran back home.

1002
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,447
That makes sense.

1003
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,534
Even if there are zombies,
he won't be harmed in there.

1004
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,411
This is like home to him.

1005
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:18,082
SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN INVITED TO PLAY A GAME
DESIGNED BY HONG-CHUL

1006
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,217
They won't come in here.

1007
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,468
Bastards.

1008
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,226
How reassuring.

1009
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,437
ANOTHER ZOMBIE IS IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW

1010
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,230
Move.

1011
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,192
That's right.

1012
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,861
I'll give you food later.

1013
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,286
YOO HEE-KWAN, THE FIRST VICTIM
ON THE DAY OF THE OUTBREAK

1014
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,289
It's Yoo Hee-kwan!

1015
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,334
HONG-CHUL, WHO NEEDED A SHIELD,
DRAGGED HIM TO YANGYANG

1016
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,753
Hee-kwan.

1017
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,550
Wait, let's try to figure out
why he's being like this.

1018
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,219
Do we really need
to walk into our own grave?

1019
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,637
Do we have to be played?

1020
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,181
We need the antibodies.

1021
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,265
Why? The money?

1022
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,850
No, it's not about the money.

1023
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,227
They're providing us a safe place to stay.

1024
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,563
Think about humanity and your husband.

1025
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,565
Since when did you care about humanity?

1026
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,901
We can't run away like this forever.

1027
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:31,280
Let's say we did bring him, then what?
Are we going to split it?

1028
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,908
-I mean…
-We'll split.

1029
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,327
With 500 million won,
you could buy luxury bags

1030
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,370
and change your car.

1031
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,622
Let's catch him.

1032
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,584
Hong-chul might run out
so we shouldn't all go in.

1033
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,002
Some of us need to stay.

1034
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,463
There's no back door.
This is the only exit.

1035
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,923
Let's partner up in twos.

1036
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,257
We'll head in first.

1037
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,093
If we can't find him, the next goes in.
That's the system.

1038
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,303
ORDER
TSUKI & SAE-HO

1039
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:58,057
I'll go in with Si-young.
Then TAEYEON with DinDin.

1040
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,811
If we don't come back out,
just assume we're gone.

1041
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,396
No, then the next team enters.

1042
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,190
Then, we'll pay our last respects…

1043
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,316
The lights are off!

1044
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,360
-The lights are off!
-Head in.

1045
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,819
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1046
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,906
We'll be on the watch here. Be careful!

1047
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,533
-Okay, we'll be back.
-Careful.

1048
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,617
Careful!

1049
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,550
FIND HONG-CHUL WHO'S HIDDEN
IN THE ROOM AND SAVE HUMANITY

1050
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,389
It feels like we won't see them again.

1051
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,348
No way…

1052
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,685
First…

1053
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,980
-It's okay.
-No, no.

1054
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,022
No, no.

1055
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,524
-I can't, I'm scared.
-Why?

1056
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,943
I can't go in.

1057
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,613
THE MOTEL IS FILLED WITH TRACES OF ZOMBIES

1058
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,991
Wait, slowly. I got you, don't worry.

1059
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,327
HE DOESN'T SEEM OKAY

1060
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,037
Should we avoid making noises?

1061
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,291
It's okay.

1062
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,710
It's this room.

1063
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,087
-But that one's wearing a hat too.
-Oh, you're right.

1064
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,464
THE ROOM WITH A SILHOUETTE
THAT LOOKED LIKE HONG-CHUL

1065
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,311
The door's locked.

1066
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,648
ALL THE DOORS ARE LOCKED
LOOK FOR A WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR

1067
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,945
Tsuki. It's a body.

1068
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,697
-What? A body?
-Yes.

1069
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,782
HE MISSED IT WHILE TRYING TO ACT COOL

1070
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,159
Don't worry.

1071
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,410
That's crazy.

1072
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,203
Insane.

1073
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,205
Is it just a body?

1074
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,541
Wait, Sae-ho. Maybe…

1075
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,044
Look from here…

1076
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,550
Get out!

1077
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,344
Get out!

1078
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,596
THEY EXIT WITHIN 1 MINUTE

1079
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,431
What is it?

1080
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,974
-Zombie!
-What's wrong?

1081
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,226
-There's a zombie!
-A zombie!

1082
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,937
We were going to head upstairs…

1083
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:09,938
-Fight them!
-On…

1084
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,273
Someone was on the floor.

1085
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,191
Oh, my.

1086
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,442
Did you check the room?

1087
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,736
We did but the door is locked.

1088
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,613
-It's locked?
-Open the other doors!

1089
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,615
BARELY ESCAPED DEATH BUT GETS SCOLDED

1090
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,492
-Let's go!
-Come on!

1091
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,035
Sae-ho, try the first floor.

1092
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,078
Okay, don't worry!

1093
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,079
NO ONE IS WORRIED

1094
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,121
Come on!

1095
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,126
Should we put this over the zombie?

1096
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,628
-Is it gone?
-I don't see it.

1097
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,837
Oh, please.

1098
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,381
The keys are here!

1099
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,634
2 WEEKS AGO

1100
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,094
Welcome!

1101
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,554
Excuse me!

1102
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:54,066
THE KEYS WERE SCATTERED ON THE STAIRS
BY THE GOOD-HEARTED MOTEL OWNER

1103
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,028
-Is it gone?
-I don't see it.

1104
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,488
Oh, please.

1105
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,198
The key's here!

1106
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,037
Hey!

1107
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,165
NEW RECORD! THEY EXIT WITHIN 10 SECONDS

1108
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,708
What's wrong?

1109
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:16,004
Sae-ho, please!

1110
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,339
-Stop running out.
-No!

1111
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,133
-What's wrong?
-Oh, my head.

1112
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,175
Hear me out.

1113
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,760
On the staircase…

1114
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,679
-No.
-There are room keys.

1115
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,348
Pick those keys and head to the room.

1116
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,641
We're off.

1117
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,143
Wait, are you explaining to us?

1118
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,395
Don't just stand there and explain things!

1119
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,814
It's moving a lot.

1120
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,107
He keeps screaming!

1121
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,316
You shouldn't scream.

1122
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,152
You'll attract the zombies.

1123
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,029
DinDin, please.

1124
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,457
A MASTER OF DISAPPEARING,
THE OWNER HAS VANISHED AGAIN

1125
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,335
What room was it?
Oh, we need to go to room 102.

1126
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,129
THEY GOT THE ROOM KEYS

1127
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,927
Room 102.

1128
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,517
I opened it.

1129
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,364
Huh?

1130
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,246
It's in here.

1131
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,414
It's inside.

1132
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,000
Seriously…

1133
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,885
I locked the door. It's okay, Tsuki.

1134
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,136
-Did you lock it?
-Yes.

1135
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,095
Okay.

1136
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,180
-Not him.
-It's not.

1137
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,224
FOOLED BY HONG-CHUL'S DISGUISED ZOMBIE

1138
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,437
THEY HEAD TO THEIR NEXT TARGET, ROOM 203

1139
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,114
Come here.

1140
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,283
Room 203.

1141
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,663
Oh, it's here.

1142
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,668
The door…

1143
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,799
-Sae-ho, zombie! Sae-ho!
-Where?

1144
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,845
-Sae-ho!
-Where?

1145
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,903
Hey!

1146
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,288
A DEAD END

1147
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,878
Sae-ho!

1148
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,342
Okay…

1149
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,270
It's okay.

1150
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,479
-No, wait.
-It's okay.

1151
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,564
It's okay.

1152
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,282
Tsuki, go that way.

1153
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,584
Why? Why?

1154
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,501
Why?

1155
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,170
Tsuki, why are you alone?

1156
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,880
-Where's Sae-ho?
-Was he bitten?

1157
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,008
Oh, no!

1158
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,515
Tsuki!

1159
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,863
This is driving me crazy.

1160
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,199
FORCED TO GO UP TO THE ROOFTOP

1161
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,625
Oh, I'm doomed.

1162
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,086
-Where's Tsuki?
-Oh my!

1163
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,170
Why are you alone?

1164
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,463
She went to look for you.

1165
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,756
She's looking for me?

1166
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,715
Tsuki is here!

1167
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,966
-She's here.
-Where?

1168
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,551
-Where's Sae-ho?
-Up there!

1169
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,928
Did you leave her behind?

1170
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,638
No, she's the one who ran away.

1171
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,889
ALMOST MISUNDERSTOOD AGAIN

1172
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,058
The zombie reading the newspaper is fake.

1173
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,102
-It's not room 102?
-It's not him.

1174
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,396
THEY WERE ONLY ABLE TO CHECK ROOM 102

1175
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,816
The zombies only look at things
that are below their eye level.

1176
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,734
I tried jumping over them.

1177
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,404
If you sense something's wrong,
tell me to run.

1178
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,321
Okay.

1179
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,531
TARGET: ROOM 104, 204

1180
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,366
-First floor first?
-Should we?

1181
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:11,007
THE MOTEL'S OWNER MIGHT
APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE

1182
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,639
They said it's not room 102.

1183
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,267
THEY'RE OFF TO CHECK
ROOM 104 AT THE CORNER

1184
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,022
It's under repair.

1185
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,748
Just be really quick.

1186
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,514
Shoot!

1187
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,308
Go up!

1188
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,317
Go up!

1189
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,780
Hurry up!

1190
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,159
SO SCARED, HE MAKES ANIMAL NOISES

1191
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,494
-Darn!
-Where's Si-young?

1192
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,537
Wait…

1193
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,999
SOMEHOW,
ONLY LOSERS ARE GATHERING ON THE ROOFTOP

1194
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,751
Crawling on four limbs.

1195
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,629
How did only the guys
end up on the rooftop?

1196
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,130
That doesn't mean anything…

1197
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,260
SHE OPENS ROOM 204 TO COMPLETE THE MISSION

1198
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,364
Oh, Si-young?

1199
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,824
Isn't it crazy?

1200
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,326
Where's Defconn?

1201
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,369
Oh, Si-young!

1202
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,620
Where's Defconn?

1203
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,704
Hey.

1204
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,998
Why did you run
to the second floor instead?

1205
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,167
I was checking the room!

1206
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,837
DON'T FORGET WHY YOU'RE IN THERE

1207
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,215
Can you help out instead
of standing on the rooftop?

1208
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:19,386
We were trying to go down but
this zombie was blocking our way.

1209
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,137
It would've stopped us too then.

1210
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,597
But first…

1211
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,724
SHE'S SPEAKING THE TRUTH

1212
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,059
What do you want…

1213
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,936
What?

1214
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:28,979
Let's discuss this.

1215
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,647
You cowards!

1216
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,191
-What is it?
-If you want to talk, come in!

1217
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,651
I'm going to kill you!

1218
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,361
-Where are you?
-You'd be killed first!

1219
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,280
Live by dying, die by living!

1220
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,116
If you want to die, you will live.
If you want to live, you will die.

1221
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,492
You will all perish!

1222
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,828
If only

1223
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,414
DON'T FALL FOR CUSTOMIZED TACTICS

1224
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,957
Those are the wrong lyrics.

1225
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,917
-If I were fully human
-Let's go.

1226
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,127
We need to kill him.

1227
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,430
He's definitely on the second floor.

1228
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,557
THE TACTIC ENDED UP BECOMING A CLUE

1229
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,438
ROOM 201 IS HONG-CHUL'S HIDEOUT

1230
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,065
What's our plan?

1231
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,525
-Zombies…
-Quiet as a mouse?

1232
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,943
You just have to be quiet.

1233
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,862
-Quiet as a mouse.
-Avoid them quietly.

1234
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,615
-Stay low.
-Be quiet.

1235
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,574
DinDin.

1236
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,534
He's not coming in.

1237
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,995
Hee-kwan would enjoy eating DinDin.

1238
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,955
You startled me!

1239
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,123
Darn it!

1240
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,042
You scared me.

1241
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,419
Oh, DinDin. You remember him, right?

1242
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,963
DinDin?

1243
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,391
If something's wrong,
run to the first floor.

1244
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,154
-Quiet as a mouse.
-Avoid them quietly.

1245
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,409
This way!

1246
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,563
THE MOUSE QUIETLY MADE IT THROUGH

1247
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,834
Room 201!

1248
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,003
AMIDST THE DISTRACTION,
HE HEADS TO THE TARGET

1249
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,090
IT'S HONG-CHUL'S ROOM

1250
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,635
Room 201.

1251
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,013
I got a good room.

1252
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,723
They won't find me here.

1253
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,141
Lucky guy.

1254
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,941
MEANWHILE, AT THE POOL PARTY

1255
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,192
Go!

1256
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,028
Go away!

1257
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,696
I told you to go away!

1258
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,657
Oh, no. She survived alone.

1259
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,452
I'm here!

1260
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,829
Over here!

1261
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,539
She shouldn't shout like that.

1262
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,255
But what do we do?
There are too many of them.

1263
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,840
It's too dangerous.

1264
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,758
Here!

1265
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,468
EUN-BI IS ISOLATED IN THE POOL

1266
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,719
Help me!

1267
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,346
We're going over to save her, right?

1268
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,598
Yes.

1269
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,391
HIS INSTINCT TO AVOID KICKS IN

1270
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,143
Go away!

1271
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,186
Go!

1272
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,812
Dex, can we do it?

1273
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,065
Dex, do you think we can save Eun-bi?

1274
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:07,697
QUEST: OPERATION UNDERWATER
SAVE EUN-BI FROM THE ZOMBIE POOL

1275
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,744
THE MUSIC THAT THE DJ PLAYED
BEFORE DYING IS STILL PLAYING

1276
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,913
What do we do with all the zombies?

1277
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:15,830
Go!

1278
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,707
Go away!

1279
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,465
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE,
YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT

1280
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,349
THE ZOMBIES ARE MOVING IN A FUNNY WAY

1281
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,266
What's going on?

1282
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,143
Wait, hold on.

1283
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,063
They're dancing to the music.

1284
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,272
Oh, they're dancing!

1285
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,565
-They dance?
-Yes.

1286
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,900
To the music.

1287
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,444
ZOMBIES REPEAT ACTIONS
FROM WHEN THEY WERE ALIVE

1288
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,029
Even when they're dead?

1289
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,322
He's popping.

1290
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,907
NOT BAD FOR A ZOMBIE

1291
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,285
No, wait. They stand still
when the music is on.

1292
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,496
They dance when there's a beat.

1293
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,664
Oh, the buildup.

1294
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,706
Let's have a look.

1295
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,750
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE MUSIC IS NEARING

1296
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,632
Look over here.

1297
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,217
They're reacting.

1298
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,179
EVEN MORE INTENSE DANCE MOVES

1299
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,889
See, they're moving to the beat.

1300
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,016
We need to play the music.

1301
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,520
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY CAN CONTROL
THE PARTY ZOMBIES WITH A STRONG BEAT!

1302
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,064
-Okay.
-They're dancing to the beat.

1303
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,858
Even when they're zombies.

1304
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,068
We need to make sure the beats don't stop.

1305
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,319
Okay.

1306
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,905
QUEST OBJECTIVES:
HYPE UP THE ZOMBIES, SAVE EUN-BI

1307
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,949
Code Kunst, you know how to play this.

1308
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,410
-Yeah, I do. So…
-Let's move to the booth.

1309
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,537
-Help me get there.
-Okay.

1310
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,247
-This way.
-To the DJ booth.

1311
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,707
-This way.
-Let's go.

1312
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,041
-Let's go first.
-Come on.

1313
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,751
Sung-jae, let's go.

1314
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,253
Don't wander around.

1315
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,880
Let's go.

1316
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,174
It's doing a head spin.

1317
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,342
They can head spin?

1318
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,469
They don't need more hype.

1319
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,345
ZOMBIES ARE TOO BUSY
DANCING TO LOOK AROUND

1320
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,105
OH NO! THE MUSIC ENDED

1321
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,483
The music ended!

1322
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,577
THE FUN IS RUINED,
AND THE ZOMBIES ARE ANGRY!

1323
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,417
Turn it back on!

1324
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,003
Up, up!

1325
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,922
Okay!

1326
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,720
MUST TURN THE MUSIC BACK ON
TO MAKE THEM DANCE AGAIN

1327
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,055
Up!

1328
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,065
Oh, the music stopped! Damn it.

1329
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,736
Hey, jump!

1330
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,987
-Jump!
-Jump!

1331
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,376
Come in, Dex!

1332
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,601
THE PARTY IS BACK ON WITH A STRONG BEAT

1333
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,605
DON'T BE STAGGERED

1334
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,065
Hey,

1335
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,192
what if we go underwater?

1336
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,151
Underwater?

1337
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,445
I don't think they can bite us underwater.

1338
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,863
HE PROPOSES AN UNDERWATER PLAN

1339
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,741
Just go. If they try to bite you,
go underwater.

1340
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,742
Okay.

1341
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,830
THEY CAN LIVE BY AVOIDING
THE ZOMBIES UNDERWATER

1342
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,748
Let's go.

1343
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,333
I'll go first.

1344
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,669
I'll go first.

1345
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,010
HE ACCIDENTALLY PUSHES A DANCING ZOMBIE

1346
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,972
A STRONGER BEAT IS NEEDED TO DISTRACT IT

1347
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,479
CODE KUNST SAVES HIM JUST IN TIME

1348
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,399
Now! Now's the time!

1349
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,027
Sung-jae! Hurry!

1350
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,618
HALFWAY THERE TO RESCUE EUN-BI

1351
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,891
THE SPEAKERS AROUND THE POOL
OVERLOADED AND SHUT OFF!

1352
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,630
Oh, no.

1353
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,948
SUNG-JAE IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

1354
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,231
MADE EYE CONTACT WITH A ZOMBIE!

1355
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,019
HE GETS CAUGHT ON A BODY
FLOATING IN THE WATER

1356
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,149
What do we do?

1357
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,202
