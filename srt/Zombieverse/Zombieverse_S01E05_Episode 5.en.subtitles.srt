ONE MONTH AGO
HWANGCHON-RI

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,892
Son!

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,854
Mother, I could've gotten it.

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,397
It's too heavy for you to carry.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,982
Here. Try one.

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:24,941
Gosh.

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,901
It's so delicious.

11
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,487
Even a rock cooked by you
would taste good.

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,656
Is that so? You're my good boy.

13
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,326
Mother, let me put on
a fun performance for you.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,705
Ta-da!

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,757
-What's that?
-What's that?

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,300
Mother.

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,552
I'll be right back, so just wait a little.

18
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,387
Sir!

19
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,972
Sir!

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:03,021
THE 5 OF THEM ARE DEEP ASLEEP
IN COMPLETE DARKNESS

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,113
What's this?

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,866
Damn it, what is this?

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
Hey.

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,204
-Hey, Jonathan. Our hands.
-What?

25
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,498
-DinDin.
-Shit, our hands are tied up.

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,166
Our legs are tied up too.

27
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,376
THEIR HANDS AND FEET ARE TIED UP
AND ALL THEY SEE IS DARKNESS

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,087
-It hurts.
-Our hands are tied up.

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,505
-What's going on?
-It hurts.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,881
Why am I tied up?

31
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,591
-Dex!
-What?

32
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,926
-Patricia!
-What's going on?

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,011
-Hong-chul!
-Patricia.

34
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,930
-Where is Patricia?
-Hong-chul.

35
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,394
I don't want to die.

36
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,107
-Our hands.
-It's not working.

37
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,236
This…

38
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,908
I got it off.

39
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,911
My wrists are thin enough to slip through.

40
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,248
Dex, no!

41
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,125
-Mine is off.
-It's off.

42
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,292
We're all untied now.

43
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,420
We can't untie our feet.
Our hands are untied now.

44
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,132
-Hey! Na-rae!
-Na-rae!

45
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,341
Park Na-rae!

46
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,384
Kkwachu!

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,844
-Kkwachu!
-Kkwachu!

48
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,303
Doctor!

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
Kkwachu Hyung!

50
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,974
-Na-rae!
-Doctor!

51
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,191
6 HOURS AGO
HWANGCHON-RI TOWN HALL

52
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,113
THE 10TH TOWN CHIEF, LEE JUN-HYEOK

53
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,657
I feel so sluggish.

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,575
Na-rae.

55
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,536
THEY ARRIVED AT THE PROVIDED LODGING
ROARING DRUNK

56
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm so sleepy.

57
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,747
I finally wiped off the blood.

58
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,708
-DinDin, earlier…
-Look at those plaques.

59
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,294
I'm so happy that
we get to sleep somewhere warm.

60
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,211
I love it.

61
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,588
With blankets, at that.

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,755
I know.

63
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,424
-It's so nice.
-I'm going to sleep.

64
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,758
There's even a chamber pot.

65
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,218
-Is there?
-Wow, look at it.

66
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,512
-You can torment them.
-My goodness.

67
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,930
Be like, "Use it at night!"

68
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,266
What happened to your arm?

69
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,059
Oh, no. What happened?

70
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,019
Gosh, what do I do?

71
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,770
THE BITE WOUND IS DEFINITELY WORSE
THAN THE DAY BEFORE

72
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,771
It looks so gross.

73
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,565
Jeez, your arm…

74
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,401
It must be so painful.

75
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,864
I'm sorry to say this…

76
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,115
We've been together.

77
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,618
-Yes, we have.
-You haven't turned into zombies yet.

78
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,161
-And we won't.
-We won't.

79
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,830
Your scar got worse.

80
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,958
What are you talking about?
It's itchy, so I just scratched it.

81
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,920
Don't do that!

82
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,755
-It's just my skin.
-Seriously.

83
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,342
The problem is that
we'll be defenseless at night.

84
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,509
What if you suddenly turn?

85
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,470
-Then we'll all die.
-How many hours have we been together?

86
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,763
We haven't changed.

87
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,889
But it was daytime.

88
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,098
-It's about time.
-Right.

89
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,016
"About time"?

90
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,601
Oh, it's about time for you to die.

91
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,518
No, it's not.

92
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,437
-Then what if
-It's time for you to die.

93
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,356
you spend the night outside.

94
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,359
If you're still fine after that,
we'll be able to trust you.

95
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,819
The leader should make a decision.

96
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,446
Are you joking? It's so cold outside.

97
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,281
This is the only warm room.

98
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,991
-It's very cold outside.
-It's freezing.

99
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,910
Not outside. There are many rooms.

100
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,328
It's so cold out there.

101
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,455
It's freezing there, same as outside.

102
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,291
-We'll give you some blankets.
-Then you shouldn't have gotten bitten.

103
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,880
You fucking asshole.

104
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,757
SHOULD I JUST BITE HIM?

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,716
You know I'm right.

106
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,134
-Which one should I bite?
-You're not wrong.

107
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,469
Eeny meeny miney mo…

108
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,429
THE HALF-ZOMBIE
CHOOSES HER PREY IN ADVANCE

109
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,556
Did you enjoy it? Was it fun?

110
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,017
Why are you doing this?

111
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,145
How would they do it in Japan?
They should sleep outside, right?

112
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,357
Tsuki, please.

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,276
They hate inconveniencing others.

114
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,194
-It's too cold.
-Can you sleep in the same room?

115
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,655
-In Japan, culturally…
-I don't know.

116
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,199
But don't be upset.

117
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,243
We're not asking you to go outside.

118
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,120
-We'll just be in different rooms.
-Right.

119
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,747
-It's freezing out there.
-It's really cold.

120
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,207
It's not that warm in here.

121
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,709
It's so cold in here.

122
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,585
What do you mean? It's warm.

123
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,045
-It's hot.
-It feels hot?

124
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,964
It's not. Perhaps only zombies feel hot.

125
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,632
-It suddenly feels cold.
-It's cold.

126
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,134
Isn't it? Then go sleep outside.

127
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,428
-It's cold there too.
-Gosh, seriously.

128
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,596
No, I don't want to go outside!

129
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,188
-Then let's keep the door open.
-Keep it open?

130
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,565
Keep it open as we sleep.

131
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,400
Just put your legs inside. Okay?

132
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,445
-Let's just go.
-Jeez.

133
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,613
-Give us some blankets.
-We'll give you a comforter.

134
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,534
I'll open it for you.

135
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,910
THE SURVIVORS KICK THE HALF-ZOMBIES OUT

136
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,330
It's so cold.

137
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,541
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO THEM…

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,460
Good night, Na-rae.

139
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,627
Good night.

140
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,130
Na-rae.

141
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,007
Park Na-rae!

142
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,677
-Good night.
-Good night.

143
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,721
-Doctor!
-Kkwachu Hyung!

144
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,972
Kkwachu Hyung!

145
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,808
Kkwachu!

146
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,238
It's freezing.

147
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,991
-My entire body hurts. Wait.
-My body is stiff.

148
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,243
I slept so uncomfortably.

149
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,120
My body is so stiff since it's so cold.

150
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,664
Na-rae, we're locked in here!

151
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,501
What? Wait a second. We're cold.

152
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,503
-Are you cold?
-Na-rae!

153
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,837
-Open the door!
-Help us!

154
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,881
Na-rae, someone tied us up in here!

155
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,966
Someone locked us up in here, Na-rae!

156
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,552
-Kkwachu Hyung!
-We're locked in here!

157
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,679
-Kkwachu!
-We can't get out!

158
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
Quiet down.

159
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,563
What's wrong?

160
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,482
-What's wrong with your face?
-What?

161
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,150
There are veins on your face.

162
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,610
Your veins are bulging.

163
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,028
20 HOURS AFTER BEING INFECTED

164
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,488
I don't know what I look like.

165
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,405
Your eyes are bloodshot.

166
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,160
Park Na-rae's condition has worsened.

167
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,290
Maybe it's because we slept in the cold,
but I can't move my arm.

168
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,250
Hold on.

169
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,380
Kkwachu Hyung's condition has worsened.

170
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,465
I can't move my left arm.

171
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,842
I can't move my right arm.

172
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,428
Na-rae, someone has tied us up in here!

173
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,806
-I'm sure you're sleeping fine. What now?
-Kkwachu Hyung!

174
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,350
Please open the door. Please!

175
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,894
-What?
-Wait, who locked this?

176
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,938
Did you lock it to keep us out?

177
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,857
I think the town chief did it.

178
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,942
-Our drinks.
-He must've drugged us.

179
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,777
-I think he drugged us.
-I see.

180
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,322
If only Hong-chul was missing,
I'd assume he had fled.

181
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,825
-Right.
-But Patricia is missing too.

182
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,578
-Why did you kick us out?
-Exactly.

183
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,706
Exactly.

184
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,251
-Why did you kick us out?
-Exactly.

185
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,670
-This isn't the time to talk about that!
-Na-rae.

186
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,968
-My arm isn't working.
-It feels weird.

187
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,347
THE TABLES HAVE TURNED
FOR THE HALF-ZOMBIES AND THE HUMANS

188
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,766
Doctor! Na-rae!

189
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,102
We don't have the key.

190
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,354
Go look for it on your side.

191
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,023
Wait a second.

192
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,066
-What?
-"Go look for it on your side"?

193
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,818
-"Go look"?
-How disrespectful.

194
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,820
-He didn't mean it.
-No.

195
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,614
Na-rae, it's because we're desperate.

196
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,409
Sorry, he misspoke. We're sorry.

197
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
We're sorry.

198
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:19,373
Na-rae, our fate depends on you and Hyung.

199
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,292
I'm sorry, but…

200
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,793
"I'm sorry, but"?

201
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
-I'm truly sorry.
-Okay.

202
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,839
Please find the key and help us.

203
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,383
THEY'RE BOWING DOWN AND PLEADING!

204
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,427
You're kneeling
as you're saying this, right?

205
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,470
-Of course.
-Yes.

206
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,721
-Kneeling?
-Of course.

207
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,890
Try asking more sincerely.

208
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,018
Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung,

209
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,313
we've been through
so many crises together.

210
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,148
Oh, no. Those poor people.

211
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,816
-What do we do?
-Sit down here.

212
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,193
-What's this?
-Clothes.

213
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,825
SI-YOUNG'S PLEA CONVINCED THE ZOMBIES

214
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,662
There are five of us in here.
Please help us just this once.

215
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,871
-Please save us.
-Na-rae.

216
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,332
I feel bad for Si-young.

217
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,584
-It's not like we can just save her.
-I know.

218
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,336
-Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung.
-Yes?

219
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,131
We stayed with you
even though you became half-zombies.

220
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,093
Don't call them half-zombies, you punk!
They're human beings.

221
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,636
Watch what you say.

222
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
Na-rae, you're a heroine.

223
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,597
Okay, seriously.

224
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
I'm only helping
because Si-young gave me this jacket.

225
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,394
Na-rae, thank you so much.

226
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,603
Thank you.

227
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,773
A new quest has been created.

228
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,692
ESCAPE THE ROOM
FIND A WAY TO OPEN THE LOCK

229
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,321
There's one last room besides that one.

230
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,241
-What's this room for?
-Oh, my. Look!

231
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,618
-Holy crap.
-Where is it? What's this?

232
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,874
THEY DISCOVER A CCTV MONITORING ROOM

233
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,001
-What's this?
-Wait.

234
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,877
-These are real.
-Wait. There they are.

235
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,963
-Jonathan and Si-young.
-Right.

236
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,798
Wave your hand if you can hear me.

237
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,592
They can hear us.

238
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,635
-They can hear us.
-What should we do?

239
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,597
They should move to the center.
The door won't open otherwise.

240
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,098
-Over there.
-Right.

241
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,308
Listen, you five!

242
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,934
Take three steps back.

243
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,978
Wait. Left foot first.

244
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,354
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

245
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,524
-One, wait…
-Left foot?

246
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,318
But your left foot is my right foot.

247
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,153
-Right.
-Si-young's left foot.

248
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,404
-This is funny.
-Jeez.

249
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
They're not synchronized at all.

250
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,700
-One, two.
-One, two.

251
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,578
-One, two.
-One, two. Be careful.

252
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,455
-Is this right? Is it working?
-No.

253
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,458
Jonathan, we need to move together.

254
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,959
HE CAN'T EVEN OPEN HIS EYES TO WALK

255
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,337
-Should we move forward again?
-Okay.

256
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,921
-Yes. One, two.
-One, two.

257
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,424
-Wait, don't move forward.
-Don't move forward.

258
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,301
Si-young, turn counterclockwise.

259
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,345
-This way. One.
-One, two.

260
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,555
-Two.
-Why are they asking us to do this?

261
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,223
THEY'RE BEING TRAINED LIKE DOGS

262
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,850
There's a wardrobe in front.

263
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,018
-Wardrobe?
-Open it.

264
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,519
-DinDin and Si-young.
-Open it?

265
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,105
There's a wardrobe
by DinDin and Si-young. Open it.

266
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,190
-Okay.
-That's it.

267
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,529
-What's wrong?
-What?

268
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,031
BOWLS: STAINLESS STEEL BOWLS
FROM THE TOWN FESTIVAL

269
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,115
They're bowls!

270
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,285
They're just bowls.
It's okay, they're harmless.

271
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,371
They're harmless. There are no zombies.

272
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,497
Wait a moment.

273
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,415
Why the heck did you tell us to open it?

274
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,876
Well, we don't know what's what…

275
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,836
-Wait. DinDin.
-Did he just yell at us?

276
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,922
-"Why open it"?
-Did you yell at us?

277
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,466
I'm going to kill them when I get out.

278
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
DinDin.

279
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,762
-He didn't yell at you.
-No, he didn't.

280
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,347
HE SPEAKS IN A NEW TONE
TO MANAGE THE SITUATION

281
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,140
-He didn't.
-We're sorry!

282
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,102
We're trying to figure it out too, DinDin.

283
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,396
-He didn't.
-I didn't yell at you.

284
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,147
What did you do wrong, DinDin?

285
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,483
I raised my voice.

286
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,609
That's right.

287
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,486
THANKFULLY, NA-RAE (NOT A HUMAN)
ISN'T AS ANGRY ANYMORE

288
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,530
-Yes.
-It's all our fault.

289
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,365
It was a misunderstanding.

290
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,991
I'll really kill them right away.

291
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,928
Sir!

292
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,305
ABANDONED RICE MILL
A BANQUET FOR MOTHER

293
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,684
TWO MEATY PREY HAVE ARRIVED
AT THE ZOMBIE MOTHER'S DINNER TABLE

294
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,768
Hong-chul, over there!

295
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,061
Hong-chul.

296
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
SHE'S BEEN STARVING,
INSISTING ONLY ON LIVE PREY

297
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,654
Wait.

298
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,948
Look, she's tied to a pillar.

299
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,325
-Hey, she can't come closer.
-Is that right?

300
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,327
Look, she can't reach us.

301
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,746
HER MOVEMENT IS RESTRICTED
AS SHE'S TIED TO A ROPE

302
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,542
Did she recognize the town chief earlier?

303
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,754
Mother, it's me. Mother.

304
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,590
-Oh, no.
-Mother.

305
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,676
Are you still there?

306
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,470
Ma'am.

307
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,931
FOOD SHOULDN'T TALK

308
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,643
What if we start a fire with the candles?

309
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,146
CANDLES: LAVENDER-SCENTED.
CAREFUL, OR YOU'LL BECOME COOKED MEAT.

310
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,981
Wait, she can't reach us.

311
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,317
Over there…

312
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,777
Wait, the way it's tied.

313
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,697
When you anchor a boat,
you tie it this way so it can come undone.

314
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,199
It's one of the boating knots.

315
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,455
A little more.

316
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,583
If I pull it a little,
it might come undone.

317
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,627
-Should we pull together?
-Patricia.

318
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,753
Where should I grab it?

319
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,213
-I'm sorry.
-Hong-chul.

320
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,048
-I think it got tighter.
-Hong-chul.

321
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,342
IT'S TIED QUITE TIGHTLY NOW

322
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,676
Goodness, Hong-chul.

323
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
-It got even tighter.
-Hold on.

324
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
Let's think.

325
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:27,848
Like this…

326
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,267
Hey, it worked.

327
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,644
THE FOOD WASN'T PACKAGED PROPERLY

328
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,103
Hey, I think it'll work.

329
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,522
What if it snaps?

330
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,191
THEY MUST KEEP IN MIND
THAT THE ROPE COULD SNAP

331
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,192
Wait.

332
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,735
Please wait, ma'am.

333
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,237
-I want to live.
-I got it.

334
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,947
-I really do.
-Okay, I got it.

335
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,782
Hong-chul, one second.

336
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,535
-Are you going to betray me?
-No, I won't.

337
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,037
-I won't. Trust me.
-You won't, right?

338
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,622
She must be hungry.

339
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,501
I got it. Let me see your hands.

340
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,211
SHE HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO WATCH HER PREY GET AWAY

341
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,379
Let's go outside first.

342
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,508
It's locked from the outside.

343
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,760
Can we check the other side?

344
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,720
-Which side?
-Can you draw her attention?

345
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,389
Okay. Grandmother, Mother.

346
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,436
HE SAID HE'D LURE HER,
BUT HE'S POINTING THE OTHER WAY??

347
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,191
YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS

348
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,153
Hong-chul!

349
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,155
MOTHER HAS CHANGED HER TARGET

350
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,992
Your voice is louder.

351
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,451
Your voice is louder.

352
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,248
Over here. Hurry!

353
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,126
-Oh, my God!
-Hurry!

354
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,586
Hurry!

355
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,921
-What do we do?
-It's blood!

356
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,382
THE FOOD HAS PUT KETCHUP ON ITSELF

357
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,758
Should we put her in here?

358
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,177
Put her in there?

359
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,722
You'll put her in there?

360
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,848
THE OLD LADY CAN'T BELIEVE HER EARS

361
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,975
There's no way to get out of here.

362
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:53,893
Wait.

363
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,020
It's flapping.

364
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,230
THEY DISCOVER A SMALL WINDOW IN THE BACK

365
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,608
-Isn't that a window?
-Will we fit through?

366
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,862
Climbing up there would be difficult too.

367
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
-We need to stack things.
-Let's make it fair.

368
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,199
-One person shouldn't take all the risk.
-Right.

369
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,035
The old lady can reach that.

370
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,495
One of us distracts her,
while the other stacks stuff.

371
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,873
-Okay.
-Then we switch roles and so on.

372
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,416
Will you go first?

373
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,710
Sure, Hong-chul.

374
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,712
Doesn't the one suggesting it
usually go first?

375
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,048
DON'T BOTHER EXPECTING ANYTHING FROM HIM

376
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,132
Okay.

377
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,051
I'll go there first.

378
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,929
I'll draw her attention this way.
You put something there.

379
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,263
-Hong-chul.
-Yes?

380
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,640
-Don't worry.
-You trust me, right?

381
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,433
-Yes, completely.
-I trust you too.

382
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,062
Ma'am. Hold this, please.

383
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,731
Do you want to go first or should I?

384
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,400
You little…

385
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,860
She's abandoning me.

386
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,487
PATRICIA STABS HIM IN THE BACK FIRST!

387
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,657
Wow, Patricia.

388
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,452
HE CAN'T JUST LET HER ABANDON HIM

389
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,870
Hey!

390
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,996
-Hey!
-Hey, wait!

391
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,457
Hey!

392
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,005
EMERGENCY!
HER PANTS ARE ABOUT TO FALL DOWN

393
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,758
Hey!

394
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,718
Hong-chul!

395
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,844
Did you escape?

396
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,763
PATRICIA ESCAPES FIRST!
HONG-CHUL DID NOT SEE THIS COMING!

397
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,931
Hong-chul!

398
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,516
-Hey!
-Wait.

399
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,768
I'll come back.

400
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,771
That little…

401
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,689
I'm jealous.

402
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,857
HONG-CHUL GETS BETRAYED
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 31 HOURS

403
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,901
MEANWHILE, AT DOG TRAINING

404
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,695
-One, two.
-One, two.

405
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,905
I think the key is inside the jewelry box.

406
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,198
There's a weird…

407
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
squeaky toy and dentures too.

408
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,162
It's important for someone.
Don't throw them away.

409
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,580
Keep the dentures.

410
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,250
-Step four steps back.
-Four steps.

411
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,960
-One, two.
-One.

412
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,295
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED
FROM THE CONTINUOUS TRAINING

413
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,255
-One…
-One…

414
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,590
Look behind Tsuki and Jonathan.

415
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,843
Is this it? What is this fruit called?

416
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,885
What is it?

417
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,679
Aren't they ripe persimmons?

418
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,889
Ripe persimmons?

419
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,516
Ripe persimmons!

420
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,184
-Ripe persimmons?
-Yes.

421
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,978
Are they well-ripened?

422
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,397
Come on. We're suffering over here!

423
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,441
-I have no clue either.
-Seriously.

424
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,317
The key could be inside them.

425
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,279
-You might find the key as you eat them.
-Gosh, seriously.

426
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,159
THEY GROW EXHAUSTED

427
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,121
AT THE HALF-ZOMBIES' JOKES

428
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,998
I found something.

429
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
Shit, the chamber pot.

430
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,169
Fuck, it's the chamber pot!

431
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,628
What's a chamber pot?

432
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,921
You pee in it.

433
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,340
Is there anything inside?

434
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,759
-It stinks.
-Darn it.

435
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,344
HALF-FULL CHAMBER POT:
A PORTABLE TOILET USED BY MAYBE 50 PEOPLE

436
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,804
Gosh, it's partly full.

437
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,972
There's a chamber pot, right?

438
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
-Yes.
-Open the top.

439
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,142
-Did you put your hand in it?
-Yes.

440
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,353
-What's inside?
-This isn't going to work.

441
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,564
THE LEADER HAS BLOWN UP

442
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,483
-When I get out,
-Yes?

443
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,109
I'll kill both of you immediately.

444
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,903
-I'm going to kill you too.
-Fine.

445
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,112
-Wait.
-Earlier…

446
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,906
-Don't do this, seriously.
-Earlier…

447
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,908
I saw a wooden board earlier over there.

448
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,202
Let's break open the door with it.

449
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,411
Let's move back first.

450
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,621
-Move back.
-Move back first.

451
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,580
-Hey!
-One, two.

452
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,207
-Wait.
-They'll break the door?

453
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,335
Wait! Wait one second!

454
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,003
Wait. Stay calm.

455
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,880
-Everyone, I got the board.
-Did you?

456
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,466
The quest has been suspended.

457
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,886
-Hong-chul, run!
-Wait.

458
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,972
HONG-CHUL ALSO ATTEMPTS
TO ESCAPE USING A TOOL

459
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,060
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

460
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,019
Hong-chul, run!

461
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,314
IT'S SAD ENOUGH THAT SHE'S A ZOMBIE,
BUT SHE ISN'T EVEN RESPECTED

462
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,524
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

463
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,109
-My goodness.
-One more time.

464
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,110
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

465
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,361
Okay, one more time.

466
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,362
Hong-chul.

467
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,322
SHE'S COMPLETELY DRAINED

468
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,532
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

469
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,871
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

470
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,706
-Okay!
-Yes!

471
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,212
OW! THE KNEECAPS!!

472
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,676
My shoulder hurts.

473
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,094
Are you okay?

474
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,304
-Are you okay?
-Hey, we made it out.

475
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,306
-Okay!
-My goodness!

476
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,558
Hey, that worked.

477
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
Let's kill them.

478
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,523
We didn't…

479
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,984
No need to explain. It's fine.

480
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,069
-One, two.
-I wonder who tied you up.

481
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,404
They turned so pale.

482
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,072
It's okay.

483
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,032
It's because we slept in the cold room.

484
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,701
Your veins are bulging out more.

485
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,785
The right side.

486
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,414
AS EXPECTED,
THE HALF-ZOMBIES DON'T LOOK SO GOOD

487
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,333
THEY HAVE A REASON
TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE NOW

488
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,251
Watch your legs.

489
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,669
-One, two.
-One, two.

490
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,838
-Let's go with them.
-We'll come too.

491
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,882
Wait. We'll go out first.

492
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,092
Fine. You're so on edge.

493
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,385
Why are you being like that?

494
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,469
-Are we all here?
-Yes.

495
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,014
-One, two.
-One, two.

496
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,515
-One, two.
-One, two.

497
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,267
-One, two.
-One, two.

498
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,977
-Great.
-One, two.

499
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,104
-One, two.
-One, two.

500
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,649
FIVE OUT OF SEVEN ESCAPED

501
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,320
Hong-chul, thank you so much.

502
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,863
No, you did it yourself.

503
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,781
You even let me go first.

504
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,659
-Thank you.
-I didn't let you go first.

505
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,619
You did great.

506
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,162
That stings.

507
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,748
TWO ESCAPED

508
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,796
-One, two.
-One, two.

509
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,716
-One, two.
-One, two.

510
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,384
-One, two.
-One, two.

511
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,303
-One, two.
-One, two.

512
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,555
Hold on.

513
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,893
Which way should we go?

514
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,102
Let's hide first.

515
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,314
They have arrived at a new location.

516
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,691
-Let's go.
-One, two.

517
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,110
-One, two.
-One, two.

518
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,820
-One, two.
-One, two.

519
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,822
-One, two.
-Be careful.

520
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,074
Over there.

521
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,500
Let's go this way. To the right.

522
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,584
This way?

523
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
-One, two.
-One, two.

524
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,005
-One, two.
-One, two.

525
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,382
-One.
-One, two.

526
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,758
Would they have found out
that we got away?

527
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,885
I don't know. We need to move fast.

528
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,554
Damn it.

529
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:05,973
One…

530
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,433
Two…

531
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,228
-Anything here? Look around.
-One, two.

532
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,771
I see something.

533
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,564
Is that a saw on the right?

534
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,565
Yes, it is.

535
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,860
-Cable cutters over there.
-Cable cutters? Nice.

536
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,155
-Let's cut it.
-It's hot.

537
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,159
Now…

538
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,579
That's much better.

539
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,878
We can hide in here.

540
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,841
IT'S QUIET IN THE FACTORY
AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE AROUND

541
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,759
There are a lot of places to climb.

542
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,721
Shouldn't we hide
somewhere up there until sunrise?

543
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,763
It's dangerous, so…

544
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,223
Go ahead. You put them on.

545
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,182
I'm okay.

546
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,059
People wear these for work.

547
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,394
We could hit our heads.

548
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,604
Let's go up and look first.

549
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,106
Then think about what to do.

550
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,214
Are you all right?

551
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,135
-I'm scared.
-Careful.

552
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,847
Careful.

553
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,477
I think it's the safest here.

554
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,353
It'll be easy to defend ourselves here.

555
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,939
-We can block them here.
-Since it's steep.

556
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,322
Jeez, what was that sound?
Is there a zombie inside?

557
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,410
There are zombies.

558
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,854
THESE ARE THE WORST ZOMBIES
THEY'VE SEEN BY FAR

559
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,276
What the fuck?

560
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,907
FACTORY FULL OF ZOMBIES
A FILIAL LOVE GONE WRONG

561
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,202
There's a cage.

562
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,163
That's…

563
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,916
PEOPLE MUST HAVE DONE THIS TO THE ZOMBIES

564
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,084
Look over there.

565
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,796
Someone locked them in there.

566
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,756
It's like a zombie prison.

567
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,009
-I think they're their pets.
-What happened? Who did this?

568
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,974
What do we do?

569
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,904
Shit.

570
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,907
Hide.

571
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,117
Get away!

572
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,619
What?

573
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,496
Get away!

574
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,081
It's the town chief.

575
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,876
Get away!

576
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,295
You little…

577
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,927
It's the town chief.
He locked them up here.

578
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:36,766
THEY'VE BEEN HANDLING AND KEEPING
THOSE WHO WERE ZOMBIFIED BY MOTHER

579
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,567
Those sons of bitches.

580
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,611
Shoo! Away.

581
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,785
How dare you come near us?

582
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,247
Block them.

583
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,420
Jun-hyeok, what happened to your arm?

584
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,672
Is that blood?

585
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,008
Go bring the disinfectant.

586
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,344
Now that I got hurt,

587
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,846
I feel braver.

588
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,184
I want to get those bastards
and crush them in a machine.

589
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,061
So what happened, Jun-hyeok?

590
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,979
My mother…

591
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,650
They tied her up like a dog and ran away.

592
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,693
-What?
-Those bastards!

593
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,405
Mother!

594
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,158
Mother, what happened?

595
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,535
Who did this? Get up.

596
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,870
Get up.

597
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,376
Mother!

598
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,961
It's me, your son!

599
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,129
I'm your son.

600
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,758
Damn it, what is this?

601
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,929
Mother, are you okay? Those bastards.

602
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,641
Mother, wait here, okay?

603
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,268
Wait here.

604
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,985
Those little…

605
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,989
I think they're talking about us.

606
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:19,786
I told you not to roam around!

607
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,207
THEY LET OUT A STRONG REACTION
TO THE VICIOUS BLOW

608
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,252
Hold on.

609
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,586
What was that sound?

610
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,590
I think there is a rat in here.
A very big one.

611
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,384
Isn't there?

612
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,846
Over there,

613
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,514
there,

614
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,725
-and there.
-There.

615
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,143
-Look around.
-Okay.

616
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,937
-Hey, you guys come with me.
-Okay.

617
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,272
-What do we do?
-What now?

618
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,608
Hide as best as you can, okay?

619
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,070
-Let's get out of here.
-Hide.

620
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,156
I'll go this way.

621
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,949
You go that way. I'll go this way.

622
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,871
I think we should go out that way.

623
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,664
HIDE-AND-SEEK
HIDE FROM THE TOWN CHIEF'S MEN

624
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,208
THE FACTORY'S SECOND FLOOR ISN'T BIG

625
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,753
THEY NEED TO SEPARATE
SO THEY WON'T BE FOUND

626
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,676
DINDIN (FLYING SQUIRREL)
UNDER THE STAIRCASE, ABOVE THE PIPES

627
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,477
JONATHAN (MOLE)
THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN STRUCTURES

628
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,941
THE SUBLEADER
FEARLESSLY GOES INSIDE A MACHINE

629
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,653
LEE SI-YOUNG (CLIMBER)
INSIDE A MACHINE ON THE 2ND FLOOR

630
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,039
THE LEADER IS EVEN MORE EXTREME!

631
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,125
DEX (PRO CLIMBER)
THE TOP OF THE STEEL STRUCTURES

632
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,177
TSUKI (MAGICIAN OF SPACE CREATION)
BETWEEN STEEL BOARDS

633
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,181
DEX, JONATHAN

634
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,185
LEE SI-YOUNG, DINDIN, TSUKI

635
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,853
You better hope I don't find you.

636
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,662
You're like rats in a trap.

637
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,503
You don't see them?

638
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,095
AWARD OF APPRECIATION
LEE JUN-HYEOK

639
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,555
FILIAL SON AWARD
LEE JUN-HYEOK

640
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,766
THE TOWN CHIEF'S UNDERLINGS
HAVE FINISHED THEIR SEARCH

641
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,799
Step aside.

642
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,884
Okay, Jun-hyeok.

643
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,844
My goodness.

644
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,806
I got you!

645
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,141
What are you doing here?

646
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,059
No!

647
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,604
What are you waiting for?

648
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,813
-Get her.
-No!

649
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,399
Please, sir.

650
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,859
Stay still!

651
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,028
Get her.

652
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,155
Where are you going?

653
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,407
Stop! Where do you think you're going?

654
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,201
-Hold on to her.
-Take her.

655
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,037
Hold on to her tightly and go down.
I got your back.

656
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,955
Hey, clear the way.

657
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,333
For Jun-hyeok…

658
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,751
Just follow him.

659
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,256
-Hey, open it.
-Open the door.

660
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,467
Hey, put her up here.

661
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,844
-Hurry up and get in there.
-I'll do it.

662
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,554
-Go up.
-Goodness.

663
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,392
Oh, my God!

664
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,102
-Stay in there, okay?
-Oh, no!

665
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,940
THE PRISONER NEXT DOOR WELCOMES HER

666
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,318
You can't do this.
You can't do this to me!

667
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,486
Make sure it's locked.

668
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,364
Yes, Jun-hyeok.
We won't make the same mistake.

669
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,741
Look, Jun-hyeok. It's locked this time.

670
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,662
Hey, what happened?

671
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,080
I think Tsuki got caught.

672
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,965
What do I do?

673
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,716
Move aside.

674
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,432
What is that?

675
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,226
Listen carefully.

676
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,144
Where are the rest?

677
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,688
I don't know.

678
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,814
Tell me now!

679
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,775
I said I don't know. I really don't.

680
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,654
I really don't know,
but I don't think they're in here.

681
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,406
-I was the only one here.
-Go.

682
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,367
-I'm so scared.
-Go.

683
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,910
Listen out there!

684
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,705
I'll make sure to find you.

685
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,963
DinDin.

686
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,341
DinDin. Dex.

687
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
THEY EMERGE FROM THEIR HIDING SPOTS

688
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,719
Jonathan.

689
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,970
-Jonathan.
-Where is Dex?

690
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,054
-Come out.
-Okay.

691
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,180
He's coming down.

692
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,183
Tsuki.

693
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,310
Yes?

694
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,020
Are you okay?

695
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,314
I'm… not okay.

696
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,607
SHE'S STUTTERING DUE TO FEAR

697
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,734
-I'm not okay.
-Tsuki, hang in there.

698
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,110
We'll rescue you.

699
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,656
Help me. Please.

700
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,991
THEY MUST RESCUE HER
WHILE THE TOWN CHIEF IS AWAY

701
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,534
The problem is

702
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,621
it's too dangerous for us to go ourselves.

703
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,208
If Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung come here,
they can go save her.

704
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,253
We shouldn't have abandoned them.

705
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,006
We should've brought them along.

706
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,259
Actually, it wasn't me who abandoned them.

707
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,847
When I get out,

708
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,766
I'll kill both of you immediately.

709
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,434
I'm going to kill you too.

710
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,312
-Let's go with them.
-Wait. We'll go out first.

711
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,730
Why are you being like that?

712
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,318
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES

713
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,614
Is it that one?

714
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,408
Did they really go that way?

715
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,536
But I can't walk properly.

716
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,040
I keep slowing down.

717
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,299
Gosh, my heart.

718
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,760
We can't let our guard down here either.

719
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,555
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SCREAM
IN A PLACE FILLED WITH ZOMBIES

720
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,350
What? What's this?

721
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,310
Be careful.

722
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:04,899
What was that?

723
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,025
Jeez.

724
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,238
I hear something.

725
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,869
Si-young!

726
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,916
-My goodness.
-You scared me.

727
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,459
Jeez.

728
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,794
-What's this?
-What?

729
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,550
Damn.

730
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,469
Holy crap.

731
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,972
Hong-chul!

732
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,227
-What…
-Where were you?

733
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,937
-We were…
-Did you escape?

734
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,939
We didn't. We were dragged off by someone.

735
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,607
I'm over here!

736
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,860
Please help me.

737
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,319
The town chief is the bad guy.

738
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,654
-He locked up Tsuki.
-Yes, he is.

739
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,989
He took us.

740
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,909
The town chief's mother became a zombie,
and he tried to feed us to her.

741
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,827
Alive?

742
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,120
-Yeah.
-Yes.

743
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,540
Does that mean all these people here
got bitten by his mother?

744
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,459
YES, THAT'S CORRECT!

745
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,465
When the mother tried to eat us,

746
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,718
she was tied to something
and couldn't go far.

747
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,512
THEY REALIZE THAT
MOST ZOMBIES ARE TIED TO SOMETHING

748
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,890
She couldn't move far, so we got away.

749
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,937
But there are a few that aren't tied up.

750
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,981
-Jeez.
-Some are tied up.

751
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,860
SOME ZOMBIES ARE SLOW
BUT CAN MOVE FREELY

752
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,784
What do we do about her?

753
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,452
What do we do?

754
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,079
Well…

755
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,372
The key is over there.

756
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,665
They left the key.

757
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,126
THEY SEE THE KEY TO THE CAGE
LEFT ON THE OFFICE TABLE

758
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,299
Should I…

759
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,510
Should I make some noise?

760
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,719
Should I make…

761
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,350
TSUKI AND THE OFFICE
ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM

762
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,897
First, let's do this.

763
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,692
That door over there.
The inside is a safe zone.

764
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,403
So I'll go get the key first.

765
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,949
THE STEALING STRATEGY SEEMS PLAUSIBLE

766
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,993
When Tsuki screams,
they still go that way.

767
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,788
When Tsuki screams,
I'll go in and get the key.

768
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,332
Then we can think about the next steps.

769
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,416
Okay?

770
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,338
HE CHANGED AFTER BEING APPOINTED
AS COMMANDER

771
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,904
Hold on.

772
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,781
Tsuki.

773
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,741
-Tsuki.
-Yes?

774
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,285
Now.

775
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,877
Look. They're going toward her.

776
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,467
What do I do?

777
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,721
Tsuki, we're sorry. And thank you.

778
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,108
He got the key.

779
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,113
But we can't open it for her.

780
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,115
How will we go there? Some aren't tied up.

781
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,329
HE LOOKS AROUND TO SEE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING USEFUL

782
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,793
RC CAR: A REMOTE-CONTROLLED TOY CAR.
NOT SURE WHY IT'S IN A FACTORY.

783
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,422
He's bringing something.

784
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,133
Did you get the key?

785
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,761
Si-young, I got the key and this too.

786
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,347
Oh, my God!

787
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,058
-What's wrong?
-Look at that.

788
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,226
Shit.

789
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,602
What is that?

790
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,937
THERE'S A GRUESOME DEAD ZOMBIE

791
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,021
Look.

792
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,818
We can use that.

793
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,404
We can give her the key with this.

794
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,614
Can you drive it well?

795
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,995
HE'S KNOWN AS THE SIDE MIRROR-WRECKER

796
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:31,999
I'll have to try.

797
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,042
IT LOOKS EASY IN MOVIES

798
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,045
But you can't see the path
from down there.

799
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,172
You can see it well from up here.

800
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,799
I'll crack the door open.

801
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,259
Will it work?

802
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,635
Let me try it first.

803
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,262
-But…
-If it doesn't work,

804
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,930
I'll take it out and bring it up.

805
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,056
I'll try it first.

806
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,182
-Sure.
-Okay.

807
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,644
THEY COULDN'T PERSUADE THE COMMANDER

808
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,064
We have the key and an RC car.

809
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,482
-An RC car?
-Yes.

810
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,735
DinDin will put the key inside the RC car
and send it over there.

811
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,903
THERE AREN'T MANY AT THE TOP

812
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,988
I think it'll work.

813
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,531
-Hey.
-Tsuki.

814
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,368
-Yes?
-We'll send a toy car to you.

815
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,704
-A mini car.
-A mini car?

816
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,455
And we'll put the key inside it.

817
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,249
Pull up the key, okay?

818
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,333
Okay, I got it.

819
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,377
-Unlock the door yourself.
-Okay.

820
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,796
It might be more dangerous
if she unlocks it.

821
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,382
Will she be able to get it from there?

822
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,094
Okay.

823
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,516
THIS ISN'T TOP GUN

824
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,768
Okay, DinDin is ready.

825
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:39,233
THIS IS HIS FIRST MISSION AS COMMANDER

826
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,239
IT'S DEFINITELY DOABLE
IF HE NAVIGATES THE EMPTY SPACES

827
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,660
BUT HE MUST AVOID
THE BOTTOM PATH FULL OF ZOMBIES

828
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,747
The quest begins.

829
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,291
RESCUE TSUKI!
DELIVER THE KEY WITH AN RC CAR

830
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,934
IT'S GOING WELL SO FAR

831
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,270
It's curving.

832
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,195
IT'LL REACH THE CAGE
IF IT CONTINUES STRAIGHT!

833
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,281
I think it might work.

834
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,201
Hey, DinDin.

835
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,827
I don't think he can see from there.

836
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,955
THE RC CAR IS OUT OF HIS LINE OF SIGHT

837
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,708
NOW HE MUST RELY ON HIS INTUITION

838
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,464
Hey, the noise.

839
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,800
IT MADE SOME NOISE

840
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,597
THE ZOMBIES REACT TO THE RATTLING KEYS

841
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,571
Hey.

842
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,198
Please…

843
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,786
THEY'RE SLOWLY REMINDED OF
THE PARKING LOT NIGHTMARE…

844
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,919
IT ENTERS THE DANGEROUS AREA
FULL OF ZOMBIES

845
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,184
-Darn it, it dropped.
-Oh, no.

846
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,477
The key dropped?

847
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,312
DROPPED IN THE SWARM OF ZOMBIES!

848
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,982
Great, you dropped it
right in the middle of them.

849
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,361
-My gosh.
-Gosh, right in the middle.

850
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,737
They're playing soccer with it.

851
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,823
THAT'S A GREAT BACK AND FORTH VOLLEY

852
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,288
Oh, no.

853
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,290
It won't be easy for Tsuki.

854
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,505
EVEN THE CHANCE FOR ANOTHER TRY IS GONE

855
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,053
The quest has been suspended.

856
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,432
Maybe we should've
thrown it to her from here.

857
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,142
Seriously.

858
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,352
It failed completely.
That flipped over too.

859
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,355
We should've thrown it to her
from the edge over there.

860
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,442
Hey, why didn't you do it from here?

861
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,736
Why do you always insist on your own way?

862
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,237
We have a leader.

863
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,281
This group doesn't need a leader.

864
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,158
THEIR TEAMWORK CRUMBLES

865
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,242
But that…

866
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,953
By the way, I saw something.

867
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,371
Si-young saw it too.

868
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,248
There's a corpse over there.

869
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,167
They've dissected it.

870
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,003
Jeez, you can see its intestines.

871
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:52,343
But if we put zombie blood on ourselves,
they wouldn't bite us.

872
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,720
It worked for Na-rae and Kkwachu Hyung.

873
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,972
If we put that zombie blood on us and go,

874
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,266
perhaps we wouldn't be bitten.

875
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,060
-Put blood all over ourselves?
-Yes.

876
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,939
PUTTING ON ZOMBIE BLOOD
SOUNDS TRULY AWFUL!

877
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,697
But do we really have to rescue her?

878
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,533
-Tsuki?
-Hong-chul.

879
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,450
THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT!

880
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,746
Please help me.

881
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,289
Just asking.

882
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,791
Must we rescue her?

883
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,125
No matter what?

884
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,836
Hong-chul, she's the youngest among us.

885
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,297
I was just asking. What do we do?

886
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,011
Then you try it.

887
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,179
I go again?

888
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,764
You're the commander.

889
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,392
But the leader…

890
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,686
-You don't listen to me anyway.
-But…

891
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,188
But what has he done
as a former UDT soldier?

892
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,815
Any volunteers?

893
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,235
NOBODY STEPS FORWARD

894
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,778
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Anyone?

895
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,530
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Anything is fine.

896
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,407
Rock, paper, scissors, then. One loser.

897
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,534
-Just one person.
-We're seriously…

898
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,743
Or will you do it?

899
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,287
-Will you be okay?
-Si-young, what do you say?

900
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,329
-Putting blood…
-Okay.

901
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,956
You were on Sweet Home.

902
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,666
Please give me the key.

903
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,587
If you don't play, you're it.

904
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,838
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Scissors.

905
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,051
-Okay.
-We're good.

906
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,428
HONG-CHUL AND DINDIN WON…

907
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,013
How could that happen?

908
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,682
I was destined to win.

909
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,766
I said I'd go.

910
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,852
-I said I'd go too. Sorry.
-Seriously.

911
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,645
Oh, well. Too bad.

912
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,105
Rock, paper, scissors!

913
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,066
YOU CAN TELL WHO WON

914
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,693
They're that happy?

915
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,405
Si-young, I don't think I can get it!

916
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,198
THEY'RE SO HAPPY
THEY CAN'T EVEN HEAR TSUKI

917
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,742
Tsuki, hang in there.

918
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,788
Jonathan, I'll give you
a chance to be honorable.

919
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,707
Volunteer yourself.

920
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,336
If you don't play, you're it.
Rock, paper, scissors.

921
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,171
-If you don't play…
-Wait.

922
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,505
They think alike.

923
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,966
If you don't play, you're it.
Rock, paper, scissors.

924
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,509
-Jonathan!
-Is it me?

925
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,846
JONATHAN IS IT

926
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,930
Good luck.

927
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,557
HE'S ENJOYING IT QUIETLY LIKE A LEADER

928
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,393
Jonathan, you didn't play scissors.

929
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,104
Say you played a heart sign
to volunteer yourself.

930
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,231
Dex, I actually

931
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,192
played a heart sign, not scissors.

932
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,735
Cut your bullshit and go.

933
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,488
-Go with the power of love.
-I'll go then.

934
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,868
After you put on the blood,

935
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,578
you'll have at least one minute.

936
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,664
-One minute?
-One or two minutes.

937
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,040
-Put it on.
-Put it on.

938
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,751
And dunk your face in the bucket.

939
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,378
-Then check.
-Hey, seriously.

940
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,421
If that works,
let's all go bring it to her.

941
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,716
But Hong-chul, we can't go twice.

942
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,636
Hey, let's put it on him and try first.
You never know.

943
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,304
-We'll watch you put it on.
-But…

944
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,056
It's fine that he puts it on, but…

945
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,934
Go see your brother off.

946
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,310
Patricia, do you want to go?

947
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,233
-I'll…
-Patricia, don't come.

948
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,692
-What?
-You stay over there.

949
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,111
Patricia, go see him off.

950
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,655
No, I'll say bye to her from here.

951
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,536
Jonathan, you have to come back.

952
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,996
You have to come back.

953
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,136
What's wrong?

954
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,805
Damn it.

955
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,684
This is awful. What happened?

956
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,229
THE ZOMBIE'S BODY IS MORE MANGLED
THAN WHAT THEY WERE TOLD

957
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,945
HE'S ALREADY GAGGING
THINKING ABOUT PUTTING ON ZOMBIE BLOOD

958
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,449
Put this on your body.
Then just pick up the key,

959
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,660
hand it over to Tsuki,
and return right away.

960
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,414
Okay?

961
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,417
Okay. Let's do it.

962
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,931
-Is it warm?
-It's cold.

963
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,684
Is it cold? Why does it have to be cold?

964
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,563
-Gosh, look at that.
-He touched it.

965
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,315
It's full of intestines.

966
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,528
-Jeez, he's putting it on him.
-He put on a lot.

967
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,905
Oh, my God.

968
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,826
HE'LL HAVE TO GENEROUSLY PUT IT
ALL OVER HIS BODY TO RETURN SAFELY

969
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,580
The blood really stinks.

970
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,166
Gosh, the smell.

971
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,961
It's okay.

972
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,049
Please look after Patricia for me.

973
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,800
No, don't be so overdramatic.

974
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,844
THE LEADER STERNLY SCOLDS HIM

975
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,514
Patricia, you're really
something else too.

976
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,141
If I were you,
even if it were empty words,

977
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,935
I would've offered to go instead.

978
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,019
But you seem so okay.

979
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,897
IN THIS SITUATION, YOUR OWN SAFETY
COMES BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

980
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,358
I don't think they'll recognize you now.

981
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,073
You never know.

982
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,033
-Please look after Patricia.
-Okay.

983
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,117
Jonathan.

984
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,290
Let's go, G.

985
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,003
Come back right away if you can't make it.

986
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,216
The quest begins.

987
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,593
RESCUE TSUKI!
DELIVER THE KEY DISGUISED AS A ZOMBIE

988
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:35,978
AFTER SOME TIME, THE SMELL OF BLOOD
WEARS OUT AND ZOMBIES MAY NOTICE HIM

989
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,316
Success or failure will be determined
the moment he gets out.

990
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,028
Goodness.

991
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:54,204
HE MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH A ZOMBIE!

992
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,257
Hey, it's working.

993
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,467
-It's working.
-It's working.

994
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,721
-Jonathan, you need to move quickly.
-Jonathan, hurry.

995
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:15,934
IT'S BEST TO MOVE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE

996
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,361
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO AVOID CONTACT WITH ZOMBIES

997
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,285
HE CAN'T MOVE AS ZOMBIES BLOCK HIS PATH

998
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,120
He must be scared.

999
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,080
They do approach him.

1000
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,749
They do, but they don't bite.

1001
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:42,210
-Jeez, they might attack him.
-Jonathan…

1002
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,754
I feel so terrible for him.

1003
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,635
HE TRIES TO CLEAR THE PATH

1004
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,802
Move.

1005
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,889
Move, please.

1006
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,265
But…

1007
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:00,395
I thought they couldn't see.

1008
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,814
If you get bitten there,
you'll die like Hee-kwan.

1009
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:04,983
Move.

1010
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,446
Move.

1011
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,659
Move, please.

1012
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,457
Move, please.

1013
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,167
HE'S WASTING TOO MUCH TIME THERE

1014
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,712
Move, please.

1015
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,217
He can't get surrounded.

1016
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,468
You can't get surrounded!

1017
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:35,389
IF HE GETS SURROUNDED,
HE CAN'T COPE WITH AN EMERGENCY SITUATION!

1018
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,598
Move, please.

1019
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,062
I said, move.

1020
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,109
HE PUSHES THE ZOMBIES AWAY
BY FORCE IN THE END!

1021
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,201
He's doing great.

1022
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,452
Run, Jonathan!

1023
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,620
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT!

1024
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,871
Jonathan!

1025
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,957
-Why?
-He's getting bitten!

1026
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,922
THE ZOMBIES REALIZED THAT HE'S HUMAN!

1027
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,555
What?

1028
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,058
THEY'VE RECOGNIZED THEIR PREY
IN FRONT OF THEM!

1029
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,893
What?

1030
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,689
Jonathan, go!

1031
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,857
-Run!
-Jonathan!

1032
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,233
-Go! Run!
-Jonathan!

1033
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,484
-Run!
-Jonathan!

1034
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,531
THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE
IS TO RUN AT FULL SPEED!

1035
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:40,537
HE STILL HAS A CHANCE
IF HE DISPLAYS HIS HERCULEAN STRENGTH

1036
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,292
-Jonathan!
-Jonathan!

1037
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,002
Jonathan!

1038
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,978
HE'S ALMOST AT THE EXIT!

1039
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,773
Jonathan!

1040
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,191
Jonathan! Watch out!

1041
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,985
-No!
-The zombies!

1042
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:29,294
THE ZOMBIE WHO HAS TASTED BLOOD
TAKES DOWN JONATHAN

1043
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,340
Patricia!

1044
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
Jonathan!

1045
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,596
-Patricia!
-Jonathan, come back in!

1046
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,556
Jonathan!

1047
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,312
Patricia!

1048
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,532
-Jonathan!
-The zombies!

1049
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,158
Jonathan, no!

1050
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:01,827
Jonathan!

1051
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,453
Patricia!

1052
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,580
Patricia!

1053
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,876
Hold Dex's hand!

1054
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,836
Be careful!

1055
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,257
Close the door!

1056
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:40,532
UNFORTUNATELY, HE GOT BITTEN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE EXIT

1057
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,703
Oh, no.

1058
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,876
THE HUMAN JONATHAN IS NO LONGER WITH THEM

1059
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,929
Hey.

1060
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,393
-Are you all right?
-Dex, I got bitten badly.

1061
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,855
DinDin, what do we do?

1062
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,858
Jonathan got bitten.

1063
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,491
I got bitten all over here.

1064
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,743
I got bitten here too.

1065
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,370
Jonathan got bitten.

1066
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,247
Where did he get bitten?

1067
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,707
Why did he have to get bitten?

1068
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,126
We just saw it happen.

1069
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,804
Why did he have to get bitten?

1070
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,433
The blood didn't last long.

1071
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,478
Where were you bitten?

1072
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:56,149
Hong-chul, please come check.

1073
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,487
Please come check.

1074
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,618
-Earlier…
-Are you okay?

1075
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,036
Where did you get bitten?

1076
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,788
Oh, no.

1077
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,039
Where did he get bitten?

1078
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:14,042
Well, starting from his arm…

1079
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,464
Which part?

1080
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,550
Here?

1081
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,219
Hong-chul.

1082
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,972
-Hong-chul, stop it.
-Seriously.

1083
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,015
-This side?
-Yes.

1084
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,351
I think my left arm got bitten a lot.

1085
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,435
But…

1086
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,403
He's completely out of it now.

1087
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,240
-What do we do?
-No…

1088
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,701
Patricia, you're so…

1089
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,245
It's your brother.
Why are you distancing yourself?

1090
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,664
Because I'm so worried.

1091
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,755
Patricia, don't come near me.

1092
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,844
-You might get bitten.
-She's standing the furthest away.

1093
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,637
She hasn't helped you at all.

1094
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,975
Are you sure you guys are close?

1095
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,309
I seriously…

1096
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,229
-She hasn't even touched you.
-My goodness.

1097
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,731
But…

1098
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,982
Goodness.

1099
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,192
I'm going to kill you.

1100
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,445
SHE'S IMPRESSED BY
HER BROTHER'S VENTRILOQUISM SKILLS!

1101
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,988
You'll be dead before her.

1102
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,116
EVEN THE LEADER IS MOVED
BY THEIR SIBLING LOVE

1103
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,869
We shouldn't do it
using the blood again, right?

1104
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,495
Do it again?

1105
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,040
Or if you're still conscious,
why don't you go again?

1106
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,208
-Hong-chul.
-Do you want to kill him twice?

1107
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,209
-No, but…
-Seriously.

1108
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,713
A BOLD IDEA THAT'S DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST

1109
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,131
Wait.

1110
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,466
Wait.

1111
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,801
So this is the character you're going for.

1112
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,013
-But…
-But he isn't wrong.

1113
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,097
He's already…

1114
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,099
-Listen.
-She seems to agree.

1115
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,768
Stop laughing.

1116
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,604
Objectively speaking,
Jonathan won't get bitten out there.

1117
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,356
But the problem is that Tsuki is a human.

1118
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,859
How should we bring Tsuki out of there?

1119
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,862
He's suffering.
Let's lay him down somewhere safe first.

1120
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,489
-Let's go up first.
-He's getting worse.

1121
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,782
Stop pointing that at him.

1122
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,033
Sorry.

1123
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,242
-I'm sorry.
-But…

1124
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,036
Or Jonathan could…

1125
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,623
Let's go up to somewhere safe.

1126
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:20,960
THEY HAVE TO PLAN
THE NEXT STRATEGY IN A SAFE ZONE

1127
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,463
Lie down here first.

1128
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,215
Sit down and lean here, Jonathan.

1129
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,258
Jonathan, don't open your eyes.

1130
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,551
HE'S NOT DEAD YET…

1131
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,513
-Hong-chul, what should we do?
-Tsuki, can you open it?

1132
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,390
-Do you have the key?
-She has it.

1133
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,725
Good job.

1134
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,644
How do I get out?

1135
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,438
There is no way for Tsuki to get out.

1136
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,108
There is no way you can go
one more time, right, Jonathan?

1137
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:44,901
Sorry?

1138
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,196
If Jonathan brings her the bucket,
the problem will be solved.

1139
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,615
He looks incredibly resentful of us.

1140
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,991
HE CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH
AT THEIR HEARTLESSNESS

1141
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,284
I don't know.

1142
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,205
But come to think of it,
the town chief will return soon.

1143
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,666
We have to resolve this before he returns.

1144
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,752
I just noticed
that there's a pulley over there.

1145
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,130
So if Tsuki can just get to that,

1146
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,882
I think we can
pull her up using the pulley.

1147
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,384
But how will she get there?

1148
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,469
The problem is
that she needs to get there.

1149
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,055
IF SHE HOLDS THE ROPE FROM BELOW,
THEY COULD PULL HER UP

1150
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,228
Honestly, we could save her right away
if Na-rae and Kkwachu were here.

1151
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,313
We shouldn't have abandoned them.

1152
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,107
There's no solution.

1153
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,072
-Is this the right place?
-Is this it, Hyung?

1154
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,245
Kkwachu Hyung, this half-zombie is dying.

1155
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,833
Did you hear that?

1156
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,959
I think it's Na-rae.

1157
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,794
Look at the ropes there.

1158
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,754
They must've freed themselves here.

1159
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,173
Park Na-rae!

1160
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,384
-We're over here! Where are you?
-Kkwachu!

1161
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,137
We've been walking
for the past three hours.

1162
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,805
It took us so long.

1163
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,265
This will take us a whole day.

1164
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,268
24 HOURS SINCE INFECTION
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MOVE

1165
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,936
Will we be able to get there?

1166
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,105
I can only walk slowly.

1167
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,649
We walked through the rice paddies.

1168
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,193
-We're glad you're here.
-Glad you're here.

1169
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,652
We've been thinking of you.

1170
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,779
SHE HUGS THE ZOMBIE
THEY PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED

1171
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,781
-Did you get bitten?
-He doesn't look good.

1172
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,575
-Jonathan got bitten because…
-Yes?

1173
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,286
Tsuki is locked up over there.

1174
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,496
-Over there?
-Yes.

1175
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:20,914
But…

1176
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,665
What is this place?

1177
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,253
IT'S A HORRIFYING SIGHT,
EVEN TO A HALF-ZOMBIE

1178
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,339
We discovered the key over there.

1179
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,257
Jonathan got bitten while delivering it.

1180
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,430
We can't go there.

1181
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,598
Oh, my goodness!

1182
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,809
-Here's what we're thinking.
-Okay.

1183
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,563
Jonathan, Na-rae,
and Kkwachu Hyung go down there.

1184
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,107
-You push them out.
-You form a circle and push them.

1185
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,443
-You put Tsuki in the middle.
-And bring her here.

1186
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,695
-We'll help.
-Okay, let's go.

1187
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,324
THEY AGREED WITHOUT HESITATION

1188
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:59,035
We have to try it. There is no other way.

1189
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,870
The town chief will be here soon.

1190
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,163
Zombie Trio, you can do it.

1191
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,041
-Zombie Trio.
-Zombie Trio, let's do this.

1192
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,253
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

1193
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,588
I feel much more relieved now.

1194
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,923
-You can do it!
-I feel bad.

1195
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,299
Thank you so much.

1196
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,634
We abandoned them.

1197
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,220
-Be careful.
-Step here. Slowly.

1198
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,305
Tsuki, hang in there just a little longer.

1199
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,515
I'm coming!

1200
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,225
My gosh. Thank you so much.

1201
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,269
The zombies wouldn't bite you then?

1202
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,770
I don't think they would.

1203
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,147
-Will they not bite Jonathan either?
-Let's go, Jonathan.

1204
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,274
Don't worry.

1205
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,028
See? They're friends now.

1206
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,531
They're not so bad
if you get used to them.

1207
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,241
They're friends now.

1208
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,325
My goodness.

1209
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,954
HE LOOKS LIKE A DRUNK FRIEND,
NOT A SCARY ZOMBIE

1210
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,163
They're friends.

1211
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,540
You bit me already.

1212
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,083
FRIENDS DON'T HOLD GRUDGES

1213
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,586
Nice to meet you.

1214
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,046
Why are you lying on the floor?
It's not good for you.

1215
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,673
Tsuki!

1216
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,217
THEY ARRIVE AT THE CAGE
WITHOUT MUCH RESISTANCE

1217
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,927
GET HER OUT AND BRING HER BACK!

1218
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,053
Won't it open?

1219
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,848
Why can't you put the key in? That's it.

1220
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,270
-Who are those punks?
-It's open.

1221
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,355
What are you waiting for? Get them!

1222
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,356
It's the town chief.

1223
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,608
Who are those punks?

1224
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,567
What's going on?

1225
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,152
-Get them!
-No!

1226
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,695
-Get them!
-No!

1227
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,740
Hey!

1228
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,783
-Sir!
-Please stop!

1229
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,868
-We're human.
-Sir!

1230
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,952
Don't move!

1231
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,662
How could you lock up a person?

1232
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,252
Please help me! Please pull me up!

1233
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,130
RESCUE TSUKI!
THE SACRIFICIAL PULLEY

1234
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,715
Someone has to go down with this.

1235
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,801
Someone heavier than Tsuki
has to go down to lift her up.

1236
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:40,595
But if you go down…

1237
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,809
Please pull me up!

1238
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,771
If someone takes the rope and goes down,

1239
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,607
their friend below will survive.

1240
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:56,402
But they'll fall into a horde of zombies.

1241
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:00,198
IF NO ONE DOES ANYTHING,
TSUKI WILL BECOME PREY TO ZOMBIES

1242
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,867
What will they do?

1243
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,039
Five.

1244
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,708
Four.

1245
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,127
Three.

1246
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,129
Two.

1247
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,173
One.

1248
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:23,846
Can you do it?

1249
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,932
-When Tsuki comes up, grab her.
-We'll grab her.

1250
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:26,933
Okay.

1251
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,734
Hey, Tsuki!

1252
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,736
-Tsuki, he's coming!
-Watch your feet.

1253
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,075
Be careful.

1254
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,202
Be careful!

1255
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,171
Come this way.

1256
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,464
Hong-chul, this way.

1257
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,304
DEX ALWAYS LOOKED AFTER OTHERS
RATHER THAN HIMSELF

1258
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,772
HE WAS A GOOD LEADER

1259
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:27,994
We got her.

1260
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,079
Oh, no. What about Dex?

1261
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,417
Dex!

1262
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,380
-Dex!
-Don't move!

1263
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,591
Dex! Let go of me!

1264
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,717
Dex, no!

1265
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:48,890
Dex!

1266
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,769
NO ONE EXPECTED THIS SCENARIO

1267
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,770
Dex!

1268
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,494
Wow, he's amazing.

1269
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,501
-Come on. Just a little more.
-Let's pull him up.

1270
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,835
Let's pull the rope.

1271
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,929
Just a little more.

1272
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,056
-Just a little more, Dex.
-You can do it!

1273
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,183
You're almost there!

1274
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,977
Wow, he's amazing!

1275
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,399
-Thank you so much!
-That was great!

1276
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,400
Thank you so much.

1277
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,529
HE IS A GOOD LEADER!

1278
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,199
Good job. We're next.

1279
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,492
Please help us!

1280
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,701
Don't move!

1281
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,411
-Hyung!
-Doctor!

1282
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,539
-Hyung!
-Jonathan!

1283
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,542
You have nowhere to escape, got that?

1284
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,919
-Just go!
-Run now!

1285
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:00,962
You bastard!

1286
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,255
-Just go!
-We got this.

1287
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,798
Town chief, you're horrible!

1288
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,007
Hold on to them tightly.

1289
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,136
What?

1290
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,429
What's going on?

1291
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,523
What is that?

1292
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,155
A new survivor has appeared.

1293
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:37,164
ZOMBIEVERSE

ALL NAMES, BUSINESSES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

1295
