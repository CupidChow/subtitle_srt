JONATHAN GETS INFECTED
(6 SURVIVORS AND 3 INFECTED)

15
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,879
AND

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,716
NOW

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,190
-This is bad.
-What if that happens to us too?

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,116
18 HOURS AFTER GETTING INFECTED,
JONATHAN DIES AND BECOMES A ZOMBIE

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,660
Jonathan has died.

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,707
What do we do now?

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,000
Come out. We need to talk.

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,335
What should we do now?

23
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,420
Wow, so you really do turn into a zombie.

24
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,756
What do we do?

25
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,426
-Now eight of us are left?
-What do we do?

26
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,308
-Eight?
-We didn't really think this would happen.

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,394
Because Kkwachu Hyung
and Na-rae didn't turn,

28
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,273
we were still having fun learning
about things in the midst of all this.

29
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,068
But now, it really hits home
seeing this happen to Jonathan.

30
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:57,075
THE REALITY IS THAT THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH

31
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,701
-Oh, no.
-Gosh, darn it.

32
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,662
In any case,

33
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,956
we're going to leave this place.

34
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,666
And as for Jonathan,

35
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,334
to be honest,

36
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,838
the problem is
whether we can bring him with us.

37
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,840
Then let's all talk about it.

38
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,759
-In order to bring him…
-Don't feel guilty.

39
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,969
You can be honest, okay?

40
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,304
It's okay to say no.
No one will blame you.

41
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,934
THE FIRST TEAMMATE TO BECOME A ZOMBIE

42
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,146
THEY DISCUSS WHAT THEY'LL DO
ABOUT ZOMNATHAN

43
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,856
You go first, Patricia.

44
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,400
-It's her brother. I'm sure she wants to.
-Of course.

45
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,861
-You never know.
-Is that so? What do you think?

46
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,781
Your thoughts matter the most.

47
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,950
-Yes.
-For us to make a decision.

48
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,785
To be honest, I want to bring him.

49
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,245
Yes, that's only right.

50
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,329
-Right.
-As family.

51
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,624
It's not because I'm not infected,
but don't we all feel the same way?

52
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,418
If I get bitten and become like that,

53
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,588
I would rather you guys left me.

54
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,090
-That would be better.
-Honestly, he's already dead.

55
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,551
-We won't be able to move around quickly.
-I agree.

56
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,969
And when you think about it,

57
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,638
it'd be better for Jonathan to stay here.

58
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,724
-Rather than going around,
-You saw earlier.

59
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,225
-it'd be better to stay here.
-With Gyeong-cheol, the cameraman.

60
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,894
-He can train him.
-Mr. Kim can.

61
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,689
I'm also waiting
for a cure to be developed.

62
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,816
I'm keeping him under my protection.

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,860
-They might find a cure later.
-Yes.

64
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,573
Leaving Jonathan under his care
isn't the same as totally abandoning him,

65
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,699
so I feel a bit better.

66
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,201
Sure, we can leave Jonathan here.

67
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,204
But how can we blindly trust Mr. Kim?

68
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,916
What if he cuts off his limbs
and conducts experiments?

69
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,834
-Oh, no.
-Then what?

70
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,920
Gosh, don't say that in front of Patricia.

71
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,087
Let's be objective here.

72
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,840
He treats the zombies here horribly.

73
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,009
Do you think he'll take care of Jonathan?

74
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,761
PERHAPS JONATHAN
MIGHT GET TREATED LIKE THIS TOO

75
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,680
But how will we take him?
Tie up his hands and feet with chains?

76
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,934
-He's unable to communicate now.
-It'd be harder on him.

77
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,061
I think it'd be more painful for him.

78
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,938
It's really about this one thing.

79
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,106
Whether it puts us in danger or not.

80
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,984
If we bring him,
we put ourselves in danger.

81
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,528
If we leave him here, we don't.

82
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,239
Putting myself in Patricia's shoes,

83
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,366
I want to bring him.

84
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,076
But the right thing for us to do

85
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,536
is to leave him here.

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,789
-Tsuki, what if he was your family?
-Yes?

87
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,291
Would you leave them
if this happened to your family in Japan?

88
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,668
HARD TO REFUTE "YOUR FAMILY"

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,879
We don't know what happened
to our own families either.

90
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,715
Patricia, can you leave your brother here?

91
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,469
If we bring him,
we put ourselves in danger.

92
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,595
I think it'd be more painful for him.

93
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,973
It'd be better for Jonathan to stay here.

94
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,391
I would leave him.

95
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,269
He can't communicate with us at all
in his current state.

96
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,728
Patricia, what do you think?

97
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,608
I agree.

98
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,819
DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT?

99
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,492
"REAL FAMILY" MAKES A BOLD DECISION

100
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,328
I just…

101
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,123
The way I see it…

102
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,416
You're really heartless.

103
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,003
The way I see it, I think
Jonathan's hearing still works fine.

104
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,213
When Patricia said she'd leave him,

105
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,674
-he kept screaming.
-Right?

106
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,551
Are you real siblings?

107
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,553
BLOOD IS THINNER THAN WATER…

108
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,179
-You should've said,
-Are you real siblings?

109
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,307
"Leave him here. I'll stay here with him."

110
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,433
Oh, really?

111
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,351
-It could be a cultural difference.
-Right?

112
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:15,148
I was just saying we should leave him
to ensure our safety.

113
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,441
Ro Hong-chul!

114
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,861
HE'S COMMUNICATING BETTER NOW
THAN HE DID WHEN HE WAS HUMAN

115
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,863
Well, I don't think we can leave him here.

116
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,240
-He's not entirely gone yet.
-Yes.

117
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
-She's right.
-Okay.

118
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,244
Let's have a show of hands
for bringing him or not.

119
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,495
Who wants to leave him?

120
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,753
LET'S LEAVE HIM
HONG-CHUL, DEX, AND DINDIN

121
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,465
Who wants to bring him?

122
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,012
LET'S BRING HIM
SI-YOUNG, PATRICIA, AND NA-RAE

123
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,514
ABSTAINED
KKWACHU HYUNG AND TSUKI

124
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,849
TIED AT 3 TO 3
THEY COULDN'T DECIDE

125
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,768
Let's be objective.

126
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,186
Let's say we bring Jonathan.

127
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,645
Then all of a sudden,

128
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,647
Na-rae and Kkwachu turn into zombies too.

129
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,357
That won't be easy.

130
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,903
Then there will be
three zombies against us.

131
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,489
What if the two of you
turn into zombies tomorrow?

132
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,282
Our fears could become a reality.

133
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,076
I feel that you're being

134
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,454
so hypocritical right now.

135
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,916
If another one of us becomes a zombie,
you'll abandon that person too?

136
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,292
It's not abandoning.

137
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,002
Yes, it is.

138
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,129
We're just going separately.

139
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,341
We stay together if we can
work together like we're doing now.

140
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,177
But Jonathan is incapable
of communicating with us.

141
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,262
So you'll abandon us
if we become like that.

142
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,347
I wouldn't say "abandon."

143
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,974
What if I were to become like that?

144
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,726
I'd bring you along.

145
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,729
How would you do that?
You can't even move your arm properly.

146
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,857
Then if any of us turns into a zombie,
you'll abandon that person?

147
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,400
-How will I…
-Even if you're that person?

148
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,693
Yes, of course.

149
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,961
-Mr. Kim is here.
-What's that?

150
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,420
Well, I have it.

151
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,380
Okay.

152
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,591
-Have what?
-You'll be able…

153
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,553
-to safely travel…
-What?

154
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,221
I got the coordinates for a boat.

155
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
-What?
-There's a boat?

156
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,974
What? A boat?

157
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,394
AN UNEXPECTED GAMECHANGER
HAS BEEN INTRODUCED

158
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,398
Oh, there is one.

159
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,024
The coordinates are here too.

160
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,068
In two hours.

161
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
From now?

162
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,614
We must get there
before the boat's departure time.

163
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,285
We should go now. We ought to hurry.

164
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,788
Other people like us could come too
following these coordinates.

165
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,956
Right, we can work together.

166
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,793
We'll need to join forces with them,
but if we have Jonathan…

167
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,885
This worry suddenly came to mind.

168
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,344
Because of Jonathan,

169
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,558
Na-rae and Sung-woo might not
be able to get on the boat either.

170
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,226
It just occurred to me.

171
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,646
If it's just us,
they can just pretend to be human.

172
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,065
But with Jonathan,
he'll draw people's attention.

173
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,358
Think about it, Na-rae.

174
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,361
If we bring Jonathan,
you two can't pretend to be human.

175
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,322
We must leave now.

176
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,620
Let's go with what Patricia wants to do.

177
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,662
Okay, Patricia.

178
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,751
You make the call.

179
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,420
If we go now, we can get on the boat.

180
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,089
But if we bring Jonathan,
they won't let us on.

181
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,466
We'll do as you say.

182
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,899
I'll be realistic here.

183
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,694
WHAT?????

184
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,030
Wait a second.

185
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,615
Okay, we have an answer.

186
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,450
THE WORD "REALISTIC" SAID IT ALL

187
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,451
Let's go.

188
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,622
His family abandoned him. It wasn't us.

189
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,750
-She didn't abandon him.
-His family is leaving him here.

190
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,876
-She didn't abandon him.
-Jonathan!

191
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,336
His family has chosen a new family.

192
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,379
-She has no choice.
-Right.

193
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,047
-But that's the reality.
-Jonathan.

194
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,508
Jonathan, I'm sorry.

195
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:15,054
HER EXPRESSION AND WORDS DO NOT MATCH

196
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,808
We need to go.

197
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,434
-It leaves in two hours.
-We only have two hours.

198
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,435
Let's go now.

199
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,813
Hurry, it leaves in two hours. Let's go!

200
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,147
Sorry, Jonathan.

201
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,066
-Hyung.
-Yes?

202
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,528
We won't be able
to get on the boat anyway.

203
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,113
We can't.

204
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,161
53 HOURS SINCE THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK

205
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,581
ONE DEAD

206
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,166
ONE DEAD AND ABANDONED

207
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,337
EIGHT ESCAPED

208
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,844
2:10 A.M.
WOLMIDO, INCHEON

209
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,891
Are we at the correct coordinates?

210
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,892
-Yes, we are.
-It's correct.

211
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,269
-We're safe.
-We made it.

212
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,478
-We're safe!
-Let's go.

213
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,771
-We don't have time.
-We're safe!

214
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,148
Whoever's alive should survive!

215
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,316
-We're safe!
-All right!

216
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,567
Wait for me!

217
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,361
This is the location
based on the coordinates.

218
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,446
We're safe!

219
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,531
-Where?
-The boat?

220
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,325
Where's the boat?

221
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,871
There is no boat.

222
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,915
-We got here on time.
-This is the right location.

223
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,292
-Are you sure it's here?
-Yes, it's correct.

224
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
What's that?

225
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
-What?
-Isn't that the boat?

226
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
Did it leave already?

227
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,176
It looks like it already left. There!

228
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,594
-Oh, no!
-Fuck!

229
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,012
Over here!

230
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,764
-Over here!
-We're over here!

231
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,307
-Wait!
-No!

232
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,142
-No!
-Hey, boat!

233
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,603
-You have to take us!
-What?

234
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,772
-There are humans here!
-No!

235
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,273
Please take us!

236
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,525
-It's because we hesitated.
-Just 15 minutes!

237
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,277
If we got here ten minutes earlier…

238
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,987
We should've hurried, but Jonathan…

239
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,822
-Don't blame Jonathan.
-Darn it!

240
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,282
You're such jerks.

241
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,660
-If only we got here a little sooner.
-Wait.

242
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,286
We can see it right over there.

243
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
Don't fight!

244
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,623
If only we got here a little sooner.

245
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,668
-Whoever's alive should survive.
-You're evil!

246
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,424
Listen. Mr. Kim said earlier
that there will be two boats.

247
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,718
-Tomorrow morning? Okay.
-There's another one five hours later.

248
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,136
-Okay.
-Gosh, seriously.

249
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,763
We can get on the next one.

250
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,972
Can we go in somewhere?

251
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,477
-How about over there?
-Where?

252
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,729
Yes, the Ferris wheel over there.

253
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,068
-Let's go.
-Let's go now.

254
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,820
-Whoever's alive should survive.
-Let's go!

255
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,863
It's so cold. Come on!

256
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,456
Let's hold out for five hours in here.

257
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,837
THEME PARK AT THE END OF THE WORLD
5-HOUR UNLIMITED RIDE PASS

258
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,089
They have arrived at a new location.

259
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,676
There might be zombies. Be careful.

260
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,936
Places like this could actually be safer.

261
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,521
But it's too quiet here.

262
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,989
The ferris wheel is up there.
Let's go there.

263
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,158
Let's go somewhere high up, Hong-chul.

264
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,165
But I can't see anything.

265
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,750
-Slow down.
-Walk slowly.

266
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,461
-Okay.
-Gosh.

267
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,887
We're here. This is it.

268
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,556
We can see everything from here.

269
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,602
I don't think anyone's here.

270
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,812
I know. It's so nice.

271
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,940
The Ferris wheel is high up in the air.

272
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,193
We'll be fine up there for five hours.

273
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,614
But it's not turning. The machine is off.

274
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,823
Even if we hide inside,

275
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,367
there will be nothing we can do
if zombies come in.

276
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,787
Can't we turn on the lights here?

277
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,167
Let's follow the cable line
and see if there's a switch.

278
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,960
-He's right.
-Yes, he is.

279
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,629
Over here?

280
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,589
I think it's connected over here.

281
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,593
-But it's a little scary since it's dark.
-I think it's this.

282
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,303
This?

283
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,181
It looks like
a very large electrical panel.

284
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,558
How do we…

285
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,748
The lights came on.

286
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,959
It's moving!

287
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,127
Over there. We can be safe up there.

288
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,796
It looks so pretty!

289
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,381
We did it!

290
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,197
But will it really be all right?
It's too bright.

291
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,283
It's so pretty!

292
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,395
What?

293
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,688
We're at a theme park!

294
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,273
Wait, there are zombies.

295
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,026
There are zombies!

296
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,069
They're all zombies here too.

297
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,404
What do we do?

298
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,322
Jeez.

299
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,207
This is the most we've seen so far.

300
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,959
But there weren't any earlier.

301
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,960
Everyone, be quiet.

302
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,629
There are so many of them.

303
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,508
There are so many zombies. Over here!

304
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,177
-Hey, don't yell.
-Over here!

305
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,846
-Na-rae, what's with you?
-What are you doing?

306
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,848
-Na-rae is acting strange.
-How?

307
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,892
-No.
-She's waving at the zombies.

308
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,811
She's just teasing them.
Come to your senses.

309
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,939
Hyung, I don't feel so good.

310
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,107
I think everyone who was here got bitten.

311
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,318
They came out
because we turned on the lights.

312
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,487
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

313
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,364
If we hadn't, they wouldn't have known.

314
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,994
ZOMBIES POURED OUT IN RESPONSE TO
THE LIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF THE RIDES

315
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,956
Wait, I think there are people over there.

316
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,208
-There are people!
-Over there.

317
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,250
-On the ride.
-Over here!

318
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,755
There are some kids there.

319
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:11,345
THERE ARE SURVIVORS
ALL THROUGHOUT THE THEME PARK

320
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,555
Shouldn't we help them?

321
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,265
We have weapons at least.

322
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,309
-But there are too many zombies.
-Oh, no.

323
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,358
How can we get past that?

324
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,860
We've been trained and have guns too.

325
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,405
The child… We have to save the people.

326
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,449
Those of us who are fine
should go down first

327
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,410
-What about us?
-and figure out a path.

328
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,578
What about us? We don't come along?

329
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,497
Root for us from here.

330
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,249
-You can't abandon us, okay?
-Hang in there.

331
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,291
We always helped you.

332
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,793
You can't abandon us.

333
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,795
-What are we supposed to do here?
-See you.

334
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
Jeez, look at the zombies.

335
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,642
The zombies here are all young.

336
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,853
They were visitors here.

337
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,979
-Right.
-Seriously.

338
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,106
Let's hide here behind those guns.

339
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,525
-Right, let's hide.
-Okay.

340
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,736
I'm scared. That's it.

341
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,449
There are some gloves.

342
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,576
Let's put them on.

343
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,370
So there are people on the tagada,

344
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,664
the carousel, and the bumper cars.

345
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,791
There is also a child on the tagada.

346
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,045
We can't all move at once.

347
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,254
-Let's split up.
-Let's split up.

348
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,757
Wait. Two, four… There are six of us.

349
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,799
Teams of two.

350
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,760
-Three teams.
-Okay, then.

351
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,846
The team going to the area
with the most zombies takes the weapons.

352
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,390
Damn it, they're coming.

353
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,061
I don't think you'll need
a lot of weapons for the tagada.

354
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,647
But as for the carousel,
you can shoot down the zombies.

355
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:51,195
THEY'RE PERFECT TARGETS
FOR SHOOTING PRACTICE

356
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,989
Then whoever's good at shooting
should take the guns.

357
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,866
-Tsuki or Si-young.
-I'm terrible at it.

358
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,950
-I'll go.
-You all saw.

359
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,202
Then Si-young goes to the carousel.

360
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,579
Since Si-young and I
were a team yesterday,

361
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,998
-Okay, I'll go with Dex.
-I'll go with her.

362
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,209
Dex, you choose the carousel?

363
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,628
Well, since Si-young is going there…

364
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,879
Since we were a team…

365
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,089
-Is that right?
-Yes.

366
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,465
-What about you?
-I…

367
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,342
What are you thinking?

368
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,762
Come on. Just a little more.

369
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,640
HE WANTS TO KEEP DEX FOR HIMSELF

370
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,767
-It's nothing.
-What's that look in your eyes?

371
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,103
I think he'll abandon me if I go with him.

372
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,854
-I don't trust Hong-chul.
-I don't trust him either.

373
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,816
-I'd rather go to the tagada.
-Then let's go together, DinDin.

374
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,984
-Have you ever been on a tagada?
-No.

375
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,194
-Have you?
-Yes.

376
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,238
You're not going there to ride it for fun.

377
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,198
But Tsuki is a good dancer.

378
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,324
So what?

379
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,243
You can dance on the tagada.

380
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,369
The zombies are coming.

381
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,912
DAY 3… EVEN THE LEADER IS LOSING HIS MIND

382
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,581
-What's up with Dex?
-Dex can be quite silly.

383
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,333
HE EVEN PLAYS WHACK-A-MOLE

384
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,459
Keep your heads down.

385
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,923
Darn it.

386
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,091
Should we not go?

387
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,637
THE FATE OF THE SURVIVORS DEPENDS ON THEM

388
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,851
Let's do this.
Patricia and I go to the bumper cars.

389
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,060
You two go to the carousel.

390
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,103
CAROUSEL TEAM
SI-YOUNG AND DEX

391
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,856
And the agile Tsuki and DinDin
can go to the tagada.

392
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,067
-Let's rescue people and gather again.
-Okay.

393
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,778
-See you later.
-Let's survive and meet again.

394
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,696
What's wrong?

395
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,739
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

396
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,907
Why did you come out this way?

397
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,450
There are too many over there.

398
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,286
HE'S BEEN CRAWLING FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS

399
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,590
Seriously.

400
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,343
How come they're not moving?

401
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,345
Their heads are still intact.

402
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,972
Are they all asleep?

403
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,974
THEY SEE A FRIGHTENED STUDENT
IN THE FURTHEST CORNER

404
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,978
-Over there.
-Hello.

405
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,524
IT'S A YOUNG STUDENT…
THEY NATURALLY WANT TO RESCUE HER!

406
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,942
-Is she alive?
-Yes.

407
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey, look at this.

408
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,405
"When the cars are operating,
electricity runs through the floor."

409
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,323
"Do not enter!"

410
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,409
A current flows through the floor.
We'll have to ride the cars.

411
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,247
The floor cannot be stepped on
as a current flows through it.

412
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,627
They must ride the bumper cars
to rescue the survivor.

413
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,254
In order to survive,

414
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,175
they must not awaken the sleeping zombies.

415
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,471
Hey, who should go?
It's too narrow for both of us to go.

416
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,641
You're young,
so you must like theme parks.

417
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,767
So you should go.

418
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,976
Me?

419
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,603
Let's make it fair.

420
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,105
One of us distracts her,
while the other stacks stuff.

421
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,857
-Okay.
-Will you go first?

422
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,567
Sure, Hong-chul.

423
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,111
Doesn't the one suggesting it
usually go first?

424
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,405
THEY NEVER YIELD TO EACH OTHER
NOTE: THE AGE GAP IS 23 YEARS

425
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,741
THIS ISN'T DÉJÀ VU

426
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,867
I go in?

427
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,619
Let's come up with a plan.

428
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,121
-I'll ride that and go that way.
-Okay.

429
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,123
You just clear the path for me.

430
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,084
I'm taking on all the danger.

431
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,627
I don't think so.

432
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,047
If you clear the path,
I'll risk myself and go rescue her.

433
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,091
-We have great teamwork.
-I trust you, Hong-chul.

434
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,176
-Just push that, okay?
-I said I trust you.

435
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,552
HE HAS NO INTENTION OF LISTENING TO HER

436
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,554
-Gosh.
-Careful.

437
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,223
Jeez.

438
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,892
Oh, come on.

439
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,728
Be careful, Hong-chul.

440
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,355
-Oh, gosh!
-Be careful!

441
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,274
OH, NO! HIS GROIN IS SPLITTING

442
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,733
Be careful!

443
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,776
Be careful.

444
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,070
Be careful.

445
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,740
Hey, you'd better do it.

446
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,117
What?

447
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,118
Me?

448
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,786
THEIR ACTIONS ALREADY
MAKE HER FEEL HOPELESS…

449
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,329
Ride this over there.

450
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,416
The quest begins.

451
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,751
RESCUE THE STUDENT!
WHILE THE ZOMBIES ARE SLEEPING

452
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,888
HE NEEDS TO BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL
NOT TO WAKE ANY OF THE ZOMBIES

453
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,143
Oh, this is…

454
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,103
Oh, this is…

455
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,604
The corpse.

456
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:11,121
THE ZOMBIES AREN'T MOVING AT ALL SO FAR

457
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,541
Hey, I think it's safe.

458
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,667
You come too.

459
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,127
They aren't moving.

460
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,297
Hang in there.

461
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,438
What do I do? Hong-chul.

462
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,106
What do I do?

463
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,826
Yes. Come here.

464
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:55,373
Just come over now. Step on the cars.

465
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,251
A COLLISION OCCURS!!

466
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,169
Oh, no.

467
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,213
-Oh, gosh.
-What's happening?

468
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,090
-What's going on?
-Hong-chul.

469
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,091
What's going on?

470
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,675
Hong-chul.

471
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,636
THE ZOMBIE, SENSITIVE TO VIBRATIONS,
SUDDENLY REACTS

472
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,182
-Hong-chul!
-It's not moving!

473
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,308
A CHAIN REACTION OF COLLISIONS

474
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,685
Wait.

475
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,686
Oh, no.

476
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,108
Gosh, this isn't working.

477
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,276
Hong-chul!

478
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,034
Hey kid, come over here!

479
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,744
ALL THE ZOMBIES ARE AWAKE NOW!

480
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,579
Hey, kid!

481
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,997
Hey, how do I do this?

482
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,626
Hey, this isn't working.

483
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,461
HE ABANDONS THE STUDENT AND FLEES

484
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,588
Hong-chul, you can't just run away!

485
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,674
Get away!

486
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,553
Get away! I said get away from me!

487
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,179
Get away! I said get away from me!

488
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,014
Wait right there. Be quiet.

489
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,850
THANKS TO PATRICIA, THE PATH IS CLEAR!

490
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,435
Hong-chul, go!

491
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,812
Grab her!

492
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,647
-Hong-chul.
-Come here.

493
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,524
Hong-chul!

494
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,318
THEY SUCCESSFULLY GET THE SURVIVOR

495
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,196
I'll lure them.

496
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:15,036
Come, all of you.

497
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,581
Come, all of you.

498
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,000
Come, all of you.

499
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,835
(BACKING UP)

500
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
Go straight.

501
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,463
HE MUST'VE BEEN A GOOD DRIVER
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE

502
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,923
Wait a minute!

503
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,426
Hong-chul!

504
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,261
Oh, no!

505
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,933
Come on. Hong-chul, follow me.

506
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,561
Hong-chul!

507
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,985
THIS TIME, HONG-CHUL IS IN TROUBLE

508
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,278
Hong-chul!

509
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,073
Wait, Hong-chul.

510
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,368
Hong-chul.

511
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,455
Hong-chul!

512
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,795
Okay, I'm coming.

513
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,547
Don't you dare come near me!

514
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,218
Wait, Hong-chul. I'll save you!

515
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,305
Hold on.

516
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,183
SHE'S MIGHT DIE FIRST?!

517
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,309
Wait.

518
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,729
I don't know. Let's just go!

519
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,483
What? Oh, my God!

520
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,777
Hey, stop it!

521
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,612
Oh, no!

522
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,741
Don't come near me!

523
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,160
No! Don't come near me!

524
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,871
-We can go now, Hong-chul!
-Patricia!

525
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,539
Go now, Hong-chul. Go!

526
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,167
Patricia!

527
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,128
Oh, no!

528
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,341
THANKS TO PATRICIA,
HONG-CHUL AND THE SURVIVOR ESCAPE

529
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,802
Patricia.

530
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,303
Patricia!

531
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,601
SHE HAD JUST BEGUN DRIVER'S ED

532
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,728
-Hong-chul!
-Yes!

533
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,731
That's it. You got it.

534
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,027
Hong-chul!

535
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,737
You got this.

536
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,990
Good job.

537
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,700
THEY MADE IT OUT
OF THE HELLISH COURSE SAFELY

538
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,993
Patricia.

539
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,623
GREAT WORK!

540
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,042
Quest complete.

541
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,086
QUEST COMPLETE
RESCUE THE STUDENT!

542
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,963
-There are zombies.
-What?

543
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,172
Zombies over there.

544
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,966
Shouldn't we go down there too?

545
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,093
You can't see very well?

546
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,304
You still haven't lost
your sense of humor.

547
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,973
TSK TSK… SHE CAN'T EVEN TELL
THE FRONT FROM THE BACK

548
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,433
Let me help you.

549
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,727
Check it out. Over there.

550
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,520
Wow, it's insane!

551
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,689
One, two, three, four…

552
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,690
Five…

553
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,736
Let's just enjoy it.
We don't have any strength left now.

554
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,076
If I had known that I'd die like this,
I would've lived a dirtier life.

555
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,411
Dirtier?

556
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,954
You're dirty enough already.

557
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,998
45 HOURS AFTER GETTING INFECTED,
THEY SENSE THE END IS NEARING

558
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,918
I struggled my way out of Mokpo
and came to Seoul,

559
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,589
being called a workaholic
as I hustled to save up money.

560
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,550
But now I'll die lonely.

561
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,512
I may have said a lot of racy things,

562
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,140
but I didn't even get to date
that many guys.

563
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,850
THAT'S TMI!

564
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,227
Shit, this sucks.

565
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,690
WHILE THE HALF-ZOMBIES
CONTINUE TO GRUMBLE

566
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,943
DINDIN AND TSUKI APPROACH
THEIR MISSION LOCATION

567
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,653
-We have to open the gate
-Yes.

568
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,489
-and get those people out.
-Okay.

569
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,873
-What do you want?
-Please open the gate.

570
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,417
-Please open it.
-There are people inside. Open the gate.

571
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,627
-Are you a zombie?
-No.

572
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,045
-I'm the DJ.
-We're not zombies either.

573
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,005
-Open the gate.
-Please open it.

574
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:54,964
-Hurry.
-One moment.

575
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,800
It's open.

576
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,551
Are you okay?

577
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,220
We have to get out of here.

578
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,971
Were you bitten? Are you okay?

579
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,681
-Shit!
-Are you okay? You go first.

580
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,350
Thank you.

581
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,976
-Oh, no.
-Hurry out.

582
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,436
-What do we do?
-Damn.

583
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,190
THE HUMANS LEFT AND ZOMBIES RUSHED IN

584
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,527
THE DJ COULDN'T ESCAPE IN THE END…

585
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,574
Are you okay?

586
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,747
-I lost it.
-What?

587
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,165
-What did you lose?
-Oh, no.

588
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,375
What's wrong?

589
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,878
My daughter has asthma,
so she needs her medicine.

590
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,839
I think she dropped it there.

591
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,923
An inhaler?

592
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,259
-Yes.
-Oh, no.

593
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,969
You can't wait?

594
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,887
-How could she?
-How old are you?

595
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,056
-I'm 26.
-You're 26?

596
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,602
NOT A CHILD,
JUST SOMEONE WHO LOOKS VERY YOUNG

597
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,355
What does that matter?

598
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,941
You're 26. Why did you ride that
with your bag open?

599
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,193
NO MERCY FOR AN ADULT

600
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,112
-She's cute.
-First,

601
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,238
let's get Kkwachu Hyung.

602
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,282
-Okay. I'll go get him.
-The half-zombie is a doctor.

603
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,408
Let's bring him.

604
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,617
I'll go get him then.

605
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,537
Your side will get cold
if you lie on the floor.

606
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,872
Hey, Na-rae.

607
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,582
Keep switching sides, okay?

608
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,000
-Okay.
-That way, you'll get evenly cold.

609
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,086
-That's it, flip over.
-Wow, you're so smart.

610
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,088
WE SHOULD JUST LAY HER TO REST IN PEACE…

611
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,423
-Doctor.
-Hold on a second.

612
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,091
We're having fun turning. What's wrong?

613
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:24,012
-I have a favor to ask.
-What is it?

614
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,680
-The child we saw earlier.
-What?

615
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,182
-The child?
-The child…

616
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,476
has this illness, you know?

617
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,145
-The illness that makes your heart beat.
-"Heart beat"?

618
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,147
HAVING TROUBLE COMMUNICATING WITH A DOCTOR

619
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,356
-What is it?
-Asthman.

620
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,608
-"Asthman"?
-"Asthman"?

621
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,067
Who's "Asthman"?

622
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,070
Is that someone's name? Ms. Asthman!

623
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,323
So what now?

624
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,450
-She has asthma.
-I see, she has asthma.

625
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,659
-You have to come.
-Okay.

626
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,994
Please.

627
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,288
ALTHOUGH HALF-ZOMBIE,
HE STILL UPHOLDS THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH

628
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,250
I'm flipping over.

629
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,878
-My goodness.
-Kkwachu Hyung.

630
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,254
-He's not a zombie.
-Hello.

631
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,923
I'm a doctor.

632
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,385
The cold air can aggravate it.
It's dangerous if you don't spray it soon.

633
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,597
She could die.
There's no emergency care for this.

634
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,849
THERE'S NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO BACK AND FIND IT

635
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,559
Then stay here for now.

636
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,145
-Come with us since we know the ride.
-Come with you?

637
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,855
-Yes, let's save her.
-Okay.

638
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,065
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

639
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,274
Come back safely.

640
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,110
Okay, let's do our best.

641
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,698
-Sir, please open the door.
-Please.

642
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,659
She left her inhaler. She has asthma.

643
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,954
HOW IS THE DJ STILL ALIVE
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED???

644
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,249
10 MINUTES AGO
THE TAGADA WAS FULL OF ZOMBIES

645
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,501
Hold on. I'll spin it for you.

646
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,922
Two of you over there,
don't roll around together.

647
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,881
That's it.

648
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,341
You zombies might collapse.

649
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,760
HE DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
AND SHOWS THEM A GOOD WOLMIDO TIME

650
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,887
You're finally almost all unconscious.

651
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,726
Please don't ever come back.

652
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,396
THE DJ IS ALMIGHTY
WHEN YOU'RE RIDING THE TAGADA…

653
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,607
They've passed out.
We have to find it quickly.

654
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm a half-zombie. They wouldn't bite me.

655
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,502
Right, they don't bite you.

656
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,339
-Oh, shit! It's Yoo Hee-kwan!
-How…

657
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,966
-It's Yoo Hee-kwan!
-DinDin!

658
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,140
If I get bitten,
I'll come get you as a zombie.

659
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,017
I'm going to be zombie food.

660
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,939
EVEN AFTER BECOMING A ZOMBIE

661
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,108
HE DIDN'T FORGET HIS PROMISE

662
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,861
THE PITCHER WITH 100 WINS

663
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,157
-DinDin!
-He won't bite you, Hyung.

664
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,074
I…

665
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,534
Hello.

666
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,454
I'm still scared.

667
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,914
Spin it.

668
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,540
Spin it now!

669
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,960
THEY DESPERATELY NEED
THE DJ'S HELP IN THIS QUEST

670
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,549
The quest begins.

671
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,800
FIND THE INHALER
YOO HEE-KWAN'S DISCO FEVER

672
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,640
Don't come for us!

673
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,393
No!

674
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,155
Oh, my God!

675
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,871
No!

676
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,292
-No!
-DinDin!

677
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,301
Don't do this!

678
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,222
When will it end?

679
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,894
ZOMBIE HEE-KWAN DOESN'T FALL

680
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,108
Why isn't that zombie falling down?

681
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,073
ONLY THE INNOCENT HALF-ZOMBIE ROLLS AROUND

682
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,871
THIS IS THE BALANCE OF A PRO ATHLETE

683
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,832
Is he a tagada expert?

684
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,211
Hold down Yoo Hee-kwan!

685
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,798
HE'S ABOUT TO GET CAUGHT!

686
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,478
You can't take off his pants. This is bad.

687
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,068
HIS FEEBLE LEGS ALMOST GOT EXPOSED!

688
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,659
AS PROMISED, HE ONLY GOES AFTER DINDIN

689
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,374
HIS (USELESS) REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

690
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,628
You're all right.

691
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,505
I'll spin you.

692
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,058
TSK, TSK…
KKWACHU HYUNG CAN'T GET UP AT ALL

693
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,476
No!

694
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,521
I'm a zombie. I am a half-zombie.

695
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,320
AVOIDING HEE-KWAN IS ONE THING,
BUT THEY MUST NOT FORGET THE INHALER

696
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,654
Find it!

697
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,865
That corpse!

698
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,200
That corpse!

699
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,160
Hurry up and find it!

700
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,127
Stop!

701
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,881
THEY JUST NEED TO ESCAPE NOW!

702
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,049
I found it!

703
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,052
I think they got it now.

704
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,180
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED AFTER 2 MINUTES…

705
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,683
I think it's all good now.
Just hold on a second.

706
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,102
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER?

707
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,311
NO WAY!

708
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,358
WITH AN IRON WILL,
HE GOES AFTER DINDIN AGAIN

709
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,121
DinDin!

710
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,625
HE'S NEARING THE END OF HIS LIMIT

711
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,169
Come here!

712
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,555
No!

713
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,766
-No!
-No!

714
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,107
NO MORE ENERGY LEFT TO HANG ON

715
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,363
IN THE END,
HEE-KWAN COULDN'T KEEP HIS PROMISE

716
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,240
Please move now. Hurry.

717
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,951
And please rescue me too.

718
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,327
Don't run away without me.

719
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,413
He's so weird.

720
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,998
-Please rescue me too.
-Run!

721
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,584
Yoo Hee-kwan.

722
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,587
Quest complete.

723
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,505
QUEST COMPLETE
FIND THE INHALER

724
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,304
-Honey!
-Please.

725
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,346
Please help me.

726
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,265
Over here!

727
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,142
What's going on?

728
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,185
Hey!

729
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,728
THEY FIND A SURVIVOR ON THE CAROUSEL

730
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,313
Excuse me, please save her.

731
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,023
My girlfriend is trapped there.

732
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,065
-Girlfriend?
-Yes.

733
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,776
-The foreigner with blonde hair?
-Yes.

734
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,777
HE MADE IT OUT BUT LEFT HER BEHIND

735
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,945
Don't come near me.

736
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,113
She's from Russia.

737
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,782
-Why did you escape by yourself?
-There are too many.

738
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:46,037
HE ESCAPED WITHOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND…
DEX CAN'T COMPREHEND THIS

739
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,622
Please, do something.

740
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,373
Don't ask us. You do something.

741
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,625
-You're ridiculous.
-Wait.

742
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,084
Please come here first.

743
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,628
-Hide as much as you can.
-Follow us.

744
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,714
KOREA IS A SAFE COUNTRY!
WE CAN'T LET A FOREIGNER DIE!

745
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,965
Save me!

746
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,761
There are too many,
so we can't go on there.

747
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,764
FIVE ZOMBIES ARE SURROUNDING THE SURVIVOR

748
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,974
I think there are more than ten zombies.

749
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,894
THE ZOMBIES ON THE CAROUSEL
ARE BUCKLED IN AND CAN'T SEEM TO MOVE

750
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,562
Please help me.

751
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,480
Honey!

752
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,981
Be quiet.

753
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,024
All right.

754
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,817
You see the one in a school uniform?

755
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,069
That one and that one.

756
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,905
IF THEY CAN GET RID OF THE THREE
ON THE RIGHT WITH THE POTATO GUN

757
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,448
We need to shoot just those zombies.

758
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,409
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CAN
SECURE AN ESCAPE PATH!

759
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,036
How many potatoes do we have now?

760
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,663
We only have ten left.

761
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,208
-Hurry up and do something!
-Be quiet. What's wrong with you?

762
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,459
Why are you whining?

763
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,544
-You should've saved her yourself.
-But…

764
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,545
Wait.

765
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,425
The survivor is surrounded by zombies
because the lights were turned on.

766
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,886
They only have ten chances to shoot.

767
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,348
There are three zombies they must kill.

768
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,726
Hurry up and do something!

769
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,355
The boyfriend won't let it slide
if they fail.

770
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,192
-The quest begins.
-I've never hit a moving target before.

771
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,903
You must shoot carefully.
We don't have many chances.

772
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,575
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM LAST NIGHT
WHEN THEY WERE HAVING FUN AND CHEERING

773
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,414
IT'S HER FIRST TIME SHOOTING REAL ZOMBIES
INSTEAD OF MANNEQUINS!

774
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,540
I'm nervous.

775
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,459
It might be very loud.

776
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,711
What's her name?

777
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,671
-It's Tina.
-Tina?

778
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,464
What's your name?

779
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,382
It's I-su.

780
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,550
-I-su?
-Yes.

781
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,467
I-su and Tina.

782
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,428
YOU MUST MEMORIZE PEOPLE'S NAMES
TO BECOME A HERO

783
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,596
-I'll save Tina no matter what.
-Please.

784
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,473
-Is it loaded?
-Honey!

785
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,184
-Be quiet.
-Yes, be quiet.

786
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,102
Please.

787
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,359
Please help me!

788
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,903
I said, save me!

789
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,322
Tina almost got hit.

790
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,865
What the heck are you doing?

791
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,242
OOPS! SHE ALMOST RUINED EVERYTHING
RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO

792
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,869
I'm so scared.

793
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,246
It never occurred to me
that Tina could get hit.

794
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,831
We have to save her at all costs.

795
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,124
THEY HADN'T CONSIDERED
THAT THEY COULD HIT TINA!

796
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,210
-Si-young, you can do it.
-Yes.

797
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,921
You must do this. You can do it.

798
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,301
THAT WAS CLOSE!

799
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,677
That was so close.

800
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,013
Come on. You have to focus.

801
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,015
-Focus, my foot.
-Gosh, seriously.

802
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,350
Want to get smacked with this broom?

803
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,392
Hurry up.

804
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,894
-Jeez.
-What's wrong with him?

805
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,270
-Tell me about it.
-Hurry!

806
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,229
What's wrong with him?

807
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,565
-Honey!
-I said be quiet, damn it.

808
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,608
But she keeps calling for me.

809
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,318
HE'S VERY ANNOYING
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ASKING FOR A FAVOR…

810
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,153
Let me focus. Be quiet.

811
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,044
-Headshot.
-He got hit.

812
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,087
That was impressive.

813
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,005
-Did you see that?
-Si-young.

814
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,216
It hit the zombie right in the face.

815
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,802
All right.

816
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,471
-It's actually working.
-You saw it, right?

817
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,723
THE BOYFRIEND SEEMS TO HAVE
TERRIBLE MOOD SWINGS

818
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,184
See? I told you to wait and see.

819
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,396
You're so impatient, I-su.

820
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,732
-One died, so shoot the one to his left.
-Okay.

821
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,068
-Hey, Seong-jin.
-Yes?

822
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,486
-No, it's I-su.
-It's I-su.

823
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,655
-Oh, I-su.
-Yes?

824
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,156
Who's Seong-jin, Si-young?

825
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,622
Was Tina hit just now?

826
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,874
SHE CAN'T LOOK UP DUE TO EMBARRASSMENT

827
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,378
Look, she's alive. She's full of energy.

828
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,382
It did fly right above her head, though.

829
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,758
I know.

830
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,677
But she's not my girlfriend.

831
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,053
NOT A GOOD IDEA TO PROVOKE THE BOYFRIEND

832
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,179
Be quiet, both of you.

833
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,687
IT FLEW RIGHT ABOVE HER HEAD

834
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,189
You asshole!

835
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,816
You almost hit Tina!

836
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,317
WOW! HONESTLY, SHE CAN'T ARGUE THIS TIME

837
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,694
What the hell are you doing?

838
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,779
Move aside. Should I shoot instead?

839
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,906
THE BOYFRIEND IS GOING CRAZY

840
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,992
I don't want to do it anymore.

841
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,618
SHE'D RATHER QUIT THAN SHOOT PEOPLE…

842
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,954
Honey, hang on just a little longer.
I'm coming.

843
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,582
Si-young, Tina almost died.

844
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,293
Hurry. What are you doing?

845
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,627
-I can't believe this guy.
-Jeez.

846
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,337
THEY'D LIKE TO JUST SHOOT HIM FIRST

847
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,965
-Quiet down.
-Man, this isn't easy, okay?

848
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,009
I hit on her for two weeks.

849
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,052
-Where did you guys meet?
-At a singles bar.

850
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,889
HE'S HESITATING TO HELP HIM…

851
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,557
Hurry up and shoot.

852
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,393
ONLY FOUR POTATOES LEFT

853
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,984
-I got the hang of it now.
-You got it?

854
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,111
SHE WAS ZEROING IN UNTIL NOW!
SI-YOUNG'S GOT THE HANG OF IT

855
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,238
Can't you see Tina is scared?

856
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,617
I'll definitely hit one this time.

857
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,202
-I'm shooting.
-Okay.

858
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,163
-Okay!
-She hit one.

859
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,916
-Okay!
-She hit one.

860
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,084
-She hit one.
-You got this.

861
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,044
Two down.

862
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,046
Reload now and hit another one.

863
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,005
Hit another one.

864
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,757
HER NEXT TARGET MIGHT BE THE BOYFRIEND

865
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,133
What's his problem?

866
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,480
You killed another one.

867
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,691
-Did you just see that?
-A top marksman who never misses!

868
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,860
She got him.

869
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,906
PERHAPS THANKS TO THE WHINING,
SHE NEATLY TOOK DOWN THE ZOMBIES

870
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,325
NOW THEY CAN RESCUE TINA!

871
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,910
-Are they unconscious?
-I think so.

872
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,328
Go bring her now.

873
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,664
Honey.

874
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,333
Honey, come quickly.

875
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,376
Hurry.

876
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,674
I did it. I saved you.

877
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,841
You're the best.

878
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,219
THEY DEFINITELY SHOULD'VE JUST SHOT HIM…

879
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,470
What the heck?

880
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,888
-Thank you.
-What's wrong with him?

881
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,806
Hold on!

882
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,140
Damn it. Run!

883
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,394
-There are zombies.
-What?

884
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,147
THEY ENCOUNTER ZOMBIES
BEFORE THEY COULD BE THANKED!

885
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,399
Wait for us, you punk!

886
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,821
Wait a second.

887
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,824
THEY FLEE TO A TRAMPOLINE
OUT OF ALL PLACES

888
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,703
THERE'S NO WAY OUT!

889
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,337
HUH? THE ZOMBIES CAN'T HANDLE IT

890
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,047
Bouncing zombies.

891
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,968
-What's wrong with them?
-What do we do?

892
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,262
-What do we do?
-They're rolling around.

893
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,014
TERRIBLE BALANCE!
THEY FIGURED OUT THE ZOMBIES' WEAKNESS

894
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,726
Keep rolling around.

895
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,019
Roll around some more.

896
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:27,855
It's exhausting.

897
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,358
THIS ZOMBIE SEEMS A BIT DIFFERENT

898
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,276
Please!

899
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,779
Hold on.

900
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,906
They're out of it.

901
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,368
THE ZOMBIE WITH GREAT BALANCE
KEEPS FOLLOWING THEM

902
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,411
What the hell?

903
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,833
HE'D EVEN QUALIFY TO BE ON PHYSICAL: 100!

904
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,209
He's scaring me.

905
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,591
-This way.
-Dex.

906
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,719
Let's go, Si-young.

907
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,887
Jump.

908
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,889
LUCKY! THEY FOUND THE ONLY EXIT

909
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,015
Please.

910
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,860
Don't come near me.

911
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,072
Don't come near me!

912
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:19,907
Get lost!

913
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,251
We were almost caught.

914
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,545
Quest complete.

915
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,840
Which way do we go now? That way?

916
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,050
-Is it that way?
-Jeez.

917
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,136
I can't even see well anymore.

918
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,596
-Me neither.
-Who is this?

919
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,889
-It's me.
-You're not a zombie?

920
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,182
Were you about to hit me?

921
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,517
What do we do?

922
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,477
Shouldn't we do something?

923
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,646
-They're all working very hard, right?
-Yes.

924
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,064
What could half-zombies do?

925
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,649
-Then…
-Let's do whatever we can.

926
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,859
-Let's clean up for them.
-How?

927
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,903
How else? We should gather them up.

928
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:08,789
THE ZOMBIES GATHER AROUND
THE NOSTALGIC SOUND OF THE VUVUZELA

929
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,542
Zombies!

930
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,127
No way. What?

931
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,586
Stop. Stop right there.

932
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,964
It's him, isn't it? The mohawk.

933
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,175
I feel bad. Sorry about then.
We should've taken care of your corpse.

934
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,219
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, Hee-kwan.

935
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,264
Since we gathered them here,
should we go somewhere together?

936
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,557
-Attention, please.
-Let's go.

937
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,768
The staircase is narrow. Two at a time.

938
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,062
-Great.
-The staircase to the right.

939
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,692
Your joints don't bend very easily, right?
I know how that feels.

940
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,486
You have to use them often
to strengthen your joints.

941
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,738
Please be careful.

942
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,575
We gathered so many of them, right?

943
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,452
-Yes, we did.
-All the zombies are here.

944
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,454
Hee-kwan's keeping up quite well.

945
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,872
Okay, come up carefully.

946
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,498
This way.

947
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,917
If you enjoy thrill rides,
sit in the back section.

948
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,502
If not, sit in the middle.

949
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,879
My goodness, Hee-kwan.

950
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,046
How awful.

951
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,674
The P.E. majors are here. My goodness.

952
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,802
All right, let's take a group picture.

953
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,305
On the count of three, say "zombie."

954
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,390
One, two, three. Zombie.

955
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,978
-Great.
-They love it.

956
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,399
TA-DA! THE SAFETY BARS LOWER
AND RESTRAIN THEM

957
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,944
NOW THEY CAN'T MOVE AT ALL

958
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,739
Okay, let's depart now.

959
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,827
Enjoy your trip.

960
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,456
Wave your hands as you go up.

961
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,791
My goodness, that's great.

962
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,252
-Raise your hands.
-They know how to enjoy the ride.

963
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,007
Put your hands up.

964
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,260
Wave your hands.

965
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,101
Wave your hands.

966
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,019
How great.

967
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,480
Wave your hands.

968
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,899
HE'S SLOWLY STARTING TO FEEL IT!

969
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,195
THEY REACH A 90-DEGREE INCLINE!

970
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:06,740
Shit!

971
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,912
-Someone said, "Shit."
-Wait.

972
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,665
THEY'RE JUST HEARING THINGS

973
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:20,128
WOLMIDO'S SCARY VIKING SHIP
MAKES THEM WET THEIR PANTS

974
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,440
Oh, my goodness.

975
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,401
One more time?

976
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,783
-They really love it.
-They do, right?

977
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,327
-Here you go.
-Have a fun trip. Bye.

978
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,328
Go!

979
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,455
Bye, Viking! Bye-bye.

980
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,090
3 HOURS LEFT
UNTIL THE RESCUE BOAT ARRIVES

981
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,551
-The Ferris wheel.
-Just go anywhere.

982
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,635
We're almost done.

983
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,057
I don't even have enough strength
to blow on this.

984
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,185
Kkwachu and Na-rae… What?

985
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,104
What?

986
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,814
What's wrong with them?

987
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,733
You're here.

988
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,942
That scared me!

989
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,819
-Oh, no.
-We're not dead yet.

990
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,404
-We're not dead.
-Are you okay?

991
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,072
-We were having fun.
-Are you okay?

992
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,742
-Na-rae, open your eyes.
-Yes?

993
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,910
-Are you okay?
-She was dozing off. Wake up.

994
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,120
Her eyes are bloodshot.

995
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,123
-Doctor, are you okay?
-We were dozing off. We're okay.

996
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,668
Who is that over there?
It's a person, right?

997
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,128
What the heck?

998
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,546
-In the control room.
-What?

999
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,298
Hey, go check.

1000
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,382
-Isn't it a zombie?
-Who is that?

1001
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,719
Oh, my goodness

1002
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,096
-My God.
-Are you human?

1003
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,139
Look carefully.

1004
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,265
I work here.

1005
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,391
Are you all right?

1006
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,018
-He looks fine.
-He's trembling.

1007
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,855
If we hold out for three hours,
we can get on a boat.

1008
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,357
Come with us then.

1009
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,942
-Please take me with you.
-Yes, we promise.

1010
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,402
I'm so cold.

1011
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,739
Na-rae, what's wrong?

1012
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,282
I'm so cold.

1013
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,243
-You're like an electric eel.
-I'm so cold.

1014
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,038
-Dex, I'm so cold.
-Are you cold?

1015
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,289
What are these?

1016
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,207
Walkie-talkies.

1017
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,210
-We'll borrow these for a moment.
-Channel one.

1018
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,045
Once you get on the Ferris wheel,

1019
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,506
-Yes?
-you can't open the door from the inside.

1020
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,175
Someone has to open the door
from the outside.

1021
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,844
-You get it, right?
-Please open the doors in three hours.

1022
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,471
Since you have to open them for us,

1023
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,765
-I'll just hide here until then.
-hide until then.

1024
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,226
How many cars
are available for us to ride?

1025
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,352
A total of five.

1026
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,271
Please get them on first.
They're a little contaminated.

1027
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,315
Don't say that they're contaminated.

1028
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,484
-They've been exposed.
-Don't say contaminated.

1029
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,735
Ro Hong-chul.

1030
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,988
-Get in. The door is open.
-Go for it, Hyung.

1031
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,824
-Yes, it's dangerous.
-Get in now.

1032
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,492
-Before the door shuts.
-Gosh.

1033
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,128
Kkwachu Hyung.

1034
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,462
Yeah?

1035
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,131
We're going to die.

1036
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,008
No, we've been holding up well so far.

1037
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,390
I'm so thirsty.

1038
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,562
Why are you up there already?

1039
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,605
-To get on.
-We need to get on too.

1040
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,441
Tsuki, let's ride this one.

1041
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,985
Come on. Get in. Hurry.

1042
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,323
-See you in three hours.
-Wait.

1043
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,616
Okay.

1044
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,577
We made it. We're safe.

1045
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,871
Hey, Patricia, we're alive!

1046
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,997
We made it!

1047
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,958
Let's hold out for three more hours.
Then we'll survive. Let's go!

1048
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,961
We made it.

1049
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,255
We're safe now.

1050
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,007
We're safe now! Look.

1051
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,384
-We can do it.
-They can't come up here.

1052
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,845
I can see the ocean on the right.
After three hours…

1053
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,930
-We made it.
-Once we get to the water,

1054
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,349
-the zombies can't follow us.
-We're safe.

1055
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,851
Tomorrow we'll be at the ocean.

1056
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,979
-It's so beautiful.
-We'll escape to the ocean tomorrow.

1057
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:09,858
Let's hold out for three more hours.
Then we'll survive. Let's go!

1058
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,527
-Let's go! We can do it.
-Let's go!

1059
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,241
It's been such a rough three days.

1060
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:26,500
I used to be really scared
of closed spaces like this.

1061
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,461
-But now I'm so happy.
-Now…

1062
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:34,090
There's no place like it.
I feel a bit relaxed now.

1063
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,844
I want to sleep comfortably
without any worries.

1064
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,387
There were many scary moments.

1065
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,183
But I felt less scared
when we were together.

1066
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,396
It looks pretty from above.

1067
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,397
It's not bad.

1068
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,401
-Get away from me!
-What's going on?

1069
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,070
Well, earlier…

1070
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,531
Get away from me!

1071
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,575
-Wait, who is that?
-Isn't that the employee's voice?

1072
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,337
Hey, there are zombies.
There are so many of them.

1073
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,005
The employee got bitten.

1074
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,257
The door won't open.

1075
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,050
He's not moving.

1076
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,472
What do we do?

1077
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,266
Who's going to open the door for us?

1078
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,771
We're going to die!

1079
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,576
ZOMBIEVERSE
