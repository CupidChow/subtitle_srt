1
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:22,693
- Tasty.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,680
Hey, Yoon-gyeong.
I’m wondering something.

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
What is it?

4
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:32,074
When was your first sex experience?

5
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,074
Uhmm.. I was eighteen?

6
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,907
Wait, what? Eighteen?

7
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:44,184
You know, I was always hot.

8
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:48,184
I envy you, bitch.

9
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,547
Oh my gosh.

10
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:55,741
I got it! One-night stand.

11
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,374
- I’m going to meet a one-night stand tonight.
- What?

12
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:01,168
I really wanna have sex before I turn 21!

13
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,713
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:06,898
- While you are enjoying your sex life since you were 18…
- Hey!

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,797
But me?

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,500
I've been kissed only by someone that
I don´t even remember her name during a drinking game.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,180
I can't believe it.

18
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:20,279
Hey, you could help me.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,820
- Do it for our friendship.
- What do you mean?

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,820
You and me…?

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,999
- What are you saying? Are you mad?
- Then what?

22
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,999
Let me tell you something.

23
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,501
So..

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,080
It’s a little bit scary.
Because It’s my first time to have a one on one date.

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,700
If things aren’t going well, you should help me.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,520
So, I will have to watch you all day?

27
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:57,529
It would be your perfect birthday present for me.

28
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,518
And do you have someone in mind?

29
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,218
I’m going to find now.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,039
When did you download dating applications?
There’s everything.

31
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,966
How about this one?

32
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:17,966
Looking good.

33
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,507
You don’t even look at it.

34
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:25,907
Seoul / Today, one on one / find anybody.

35
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:29,391
And my gender identity..

36
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:36,037
- What?
- Are you a butch or femme?

37
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:39,709
I’ve never thought of that before.
Do I have to decide?

38
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,709
Because It’s easy to meet someone.

39
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,078
Then.. Fellagirly?

40
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:47,852
And done!

41
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:53,595
Seoul, one on one, fellagirly.
Cool.

42
00:02:58,971 --> 00:02:59,971
Wow, great.

43
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:05,576
(Perfect one-night stand)

44
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,580
- She's so hot.
- Oh my gosh.

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,900
- Hey, look at me.
- You look good.

46
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,840
I feel like my heart is going to burst.
She’s totally my style.

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,680
- Don’t trust selfies at all.
- Why?

48
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:33,781
Let’s make our signals.

49
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:38,081
First, if you like her, touch your lip.

50
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:40,697
Like this?

51
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,500
Yeah, like that.

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,011
And.. If you don’t like her.

53
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,511
How about it?

54
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,279
Help me.

55
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:54,196
Great.
And I’ll save you.

56
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:01,041
It must be difficult to be successful
in the first meeting, right?

57
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:05,755
What if she’s my destiny?
I feel so nervous.

58
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,733
Destiny? Don’t be silly.

59
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:26,247
Excuse me. Are You Maro?

60
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:30,740
(ID: Haku, Age: 24,
Gender Identity: fellagirly, Etc: exchanging selfies)

61
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,720
You must be Haku.
Please have a seat.

62
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,440
- The traffic is so heavy, isn’t it?
- A little bit.

63
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,450
Would you like some coffee?

64
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,709
Yes. Iced americano please.

65
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:14,392
- I’ll have one iced americano please.
- Yes, please wait a moment.

66
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:22,881
She will bring it right away.

67
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:53,724
You… look a little different from your selfie.

68
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:55,826
Sorry?

69
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,708
I mean your photo is better than you.

70
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:05,289
(You’re so full of yourself.)

71
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,812
That’s what I say.
We can’t trust selfies nowadays.

72
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,312
But, you look exactly the same in your photos.

73
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,427
(Yoon-gyeong, help me.)

74
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:29,324
- I’m sorry, but I have to go.
- Huh?

75
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,011
Here’s your coffee.

76
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,248
I guess It was not what it meant to be.

77
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,231
Let’s go to see the next person.

78
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,931
Wait for me!

79
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:19,335
- Is this your first time to have a one-night stand?
- Yes…

80
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:25,668
- Then.. It’d be difficult for us..
- Why?

81
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,089
Actually, I have an unconventional taste.

82
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:36,362
Unconventional?
What is your taste?

83
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:38,337
It’s like…

84
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:45,477
Do you happen to know BDSM?
I’m kind of a masochist.

85
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:46,901
Let me tell you..

86
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:51,021
It doesn’t hurt much.
It’s so much fun being hung on something.

87
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,372
I prefer not to tie the end of something.
Dripping wax from the candle…

88
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,009
You can feel aroused.

89
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,989
(ID: Love is like war, Age: Secret
Gender Identity: Butch with long hair, Etc: Normal style)

90
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:01,276
- If you…
- No, thanks.

91
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,876
It’s very fun.

92
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:06,876
- Would you like to see it?
- No…

93
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,093
If you take a look, you’ll get it.

94
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:21,314
- This is not what you think. Just touch it.
- No. I’m fine. Thanks.

95
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,300
I got one for beginners.

96
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Wait!

97
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,748
- Hey, she’s a weirdo.
- You need to respect her taste!

98
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:45,587
- She even brought her things for beginners.
- Then why don’t you date her?

99
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,287
- What’s her phone number?
- Shut up!

100
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:11,247
I’m sorry.
I have to work out at this time.

101
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,796
It’s okay. I’m fine.

102
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:17,796
When you’re healthy,
you could have love and have sex better.

103
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:19,997
You're right.

104
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,720
Good shape! Good sex.. I mean, love!

105
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,120
(ID: Honey, Age: 27
Gender Identity: butch, Etc: jogging)

106
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,753
- Shall we speed up a little?
- What?

107
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,173
Hey, excuse me..?!

108
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,306
(She’s not even Lee Bong-ju.)

109
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
What the…!

110
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,260
What happened now?

111
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Oh my god. I think I'm gonna die.

112
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:29,013
Fucking good sex.

113
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,940
- My legs are like jelly.
- Please take a seat. You look out of breath.

114
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,940
No no. She’s running so fast.
She might come here.

115
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,449
Hurry up! Let’s go!

116
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:53,437
Are you ok?

117
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:59,061
No. I’m starving.

118
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,644
Please don’t screw it up this time.
I’m so tired.

119
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,145
She’s almost here.
Go, go!

120
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,230
(ID: Song Yu-na, Age: 23
Gender Identity: femme, Etc: A big fan of Song Yoon-A)

121
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,831
-Where are you now? I’m almost there.
-I’m seating on the bench.
- I’ll be right there.

122
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:50,746
Are you…

123
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,746
- I mean, the Lesbian app.
- Sorry?

124
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:56,624
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.
- You must be surprised.

125
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,624
I’m that Song Yu-na.

126
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,239
Have you ever dated men?

127
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,865
Or don’t you have any plan for meeting a man?

128
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:09,286
Damn it motherfucker.
Die you bastard!

129
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:12,286
- Hey.. You.. What are you?
- I’ll call the police. Fuck off.

130
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,759
Ji-hye, Are you ok?

131
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,022
He is such a pervert.

132
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:26,893
Yoon-gyeong..

133
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:36,215
I was so scared. I couldn’t move.

134
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,101
It’s alright.

135
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,629
It’s not your fault. Stop crying.

136
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:17,436
Do you have to have sex at your age?

137
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:24,108
I thought I’d get everything at 20 years old.

138
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:31,810
You know. Go to a nice university, make a lot of friends,
date someone, and have sex.

139
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,998
But in reality,
I just never became interested in my major.

140
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:40,198
I spend so much time doing a part time job
for my tuition and living expenses.

141
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,799
Forget it. It’s bullshit.

142
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:50,677
I just want to get one at least.

143
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:03,526
What are you looking at?

144
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,629
Make a wish and blow it out.

145
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,620
Don’t you know?
You should make a wish before you blow out eyelashes.

146
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,500
Ah.. Okay.
Wait a minute.

147
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,934
- Are you done?
- Yes.

148
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,575
Hey, Ji-hye.. Do you..

149
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:03,247
Yoon-gyeong,
why don’t we go to a lesbian bar?

150
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,632
- Lesbian bar?
- I’ll buy you a drink.

151
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:09,632
- Please celebrate my 21th birthday tonight.
- Okay.

152
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,541
How could you date so many women?

153
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,019
You know, life is about timing.

154
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:42,482
Why should I be the only one to be unlucky in love?

155
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:47,028
- I’m sorry.
- No, I’m fine.

156
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,028
(Oh.. She’s cute.)

157
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:59,260
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

158
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,301
- Are you here alone?
- Yes, I am.

159
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:04,890
I’ve never been anywhere like this before.
It’s a bit awkward.

160
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,490
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes.

161
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:12,486
Ah~ I see.

162
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,049
- Let’s have some together if you’d like.
- Really? Thanks.

163
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,549
Cheers.

164
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,303
Happy birthday.

165
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:46,647
- I’m hungry.
- Me, too.

166
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,412
You’re the best at cooking ramen.

167
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:20,412
Come over more often.
I’ll cook it for you.

168
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,760
Can I come here everyday?

169
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,360
Do You wanna come over everyday?

170
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,800
It’s really annoying.

171
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,313
She was really strange.

172
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,106
She said she came to write her report to the bar.

173
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,088
The subject was ‘Sex and society’?

174
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:57,503
A hetero girl went out to a lesbian bar
for writing a report?

175
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,103
Maybe she wanted to
get better grades in school.

176
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,858
Last night, you answered
the survey questions really hard.

177
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,115
You know I work hard all the time.

178
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:20,663
Enjoy the meal.

179
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,910
This is really good.

180
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:34,928
By the way, what did you wish for yesterday?

181
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:41,104
What is it, a secret?

182
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,731
This tastes great.
