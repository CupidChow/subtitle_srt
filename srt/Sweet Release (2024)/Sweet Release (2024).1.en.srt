20
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,307
I’ll miss you.

21
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,976
Me? Or just my body?

22
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,791
Can't it be both?

23
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,018
But seriously...

24
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,888
I'll miss you when I'm in Kanlaon.

25
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,815
It’s only temporary, I promise.

26
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,516
It’s just my father
needs me now because...

27
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,750
Because he’s sick.

28
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,208
And I understand that, Nato.

29
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,704
I'll be back soon, okay?

30
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,896
I'll be back.

31
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,025
And when I come back.

32
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:54,236
We’ll finally start our lives together.

33
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:58,321
We'll get married,
we'll have our own place.

34
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,679
Our own children.

35
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,958
You know, Nato...

36
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:06,268
There are some things
that we need to focus on first.

37
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,549
We'll get there before you know it.

38
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,196
Our time will come, Xan.

39
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,000
Just wait a little more.

40
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,351
Just a little more.

41
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,087
Hey.

42
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,852
Ah...

43
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:23,294
I’ll miss you too.

Hey, are you okay?

47
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,112
Yeah, I’m okay. Sorry.

48
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:39,776
I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,611
Relax.

50
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,870
I’ll suck you off.

51
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,174
Hey, babe.
It’s okay, come here.

52
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:53,987
But babe...

53
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,440
I just want you to have
a happy memory before you leave.

54
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,530
Who said I'm not having fun?

55
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:03,533
Do you really have to do this?

56
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:05,166
I have to, Rian.

57
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,583
I know.

58
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,355
But it’s so hard, Tim.

59
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:11,738
I know, babe,
and you know it too.

60
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,867
I need to find myself.

61
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:16,345
And besides, there are things
I need to prioritize.

62
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,916
Why does it have to be so far?

63
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:20,458
Why can't you just fly off
to Siargao or something?

64
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,854
Why does it have to be Europe?

65
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,678
You already know my reasons, right?

66
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,423
Fine.

67
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,320
But, can you please
promise me something?

68
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,471
What's that?

69
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:33,588
Promise me that whatever happens
while you find yourself...

70
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,583
You’ll still find your way
back to me.

71
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,462
Promise me.

72
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,265
Promise.

73
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,917
He loves me.

74
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:44,442
He loves me not.

75
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,650
He loves me.

76
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:49,010
He loves me... not.

77
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:57,216
So, Tim's really going to Europe?

78
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,291
Yeah.

79
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,298
But I thought you were going
to try to change his mind?

80
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,456
Xan.

81
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,959
I really tried.

82
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:07,067
I tried really hard.

83
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,292
But him? He wasn’t hard.

84
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,438
[chuckles]

85
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:13,893
Ah, I get it now!

86
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:18,123
Tim's leaving because
you're so bad in bed!

87
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:19,378
Screw you.

88
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,098
Hey, I’m kidding!

89
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,115
Don’t get mad.

90
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:32,733
Nato already left,
so you can't be mad at me.

91
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,088
Okay, fine.

92
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,673
You’re so dramatic,
all you have to do is say sorry.

93
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,961
But seriously, how are you?

94
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:44,544
I don’t know, Xan.

95
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:46,626
Tim said...

96
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,502
he wants to find himself but...

97
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,413
why do I feel like he's
losing me in the process?

98
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:55,942
That's how it is.

99
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,894
Sometimes when people change,

100
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,003
so do their priorities.

101
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:04,194
But I don't even know
if he's coming back from Europe.

102
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,129
And now, there’s you and Nato.

103
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,041
I just can't imagine
everything falling into place.

104
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,013
It's like...

105
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:14,775
Everything seemed so certain before.

106
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,505
But now?

107
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:18,684
It’s like we’re floating on air.

108
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,900
I just feel so lost, Xan.

109
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:27,923
You know...

110
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,067
Sometimes

111
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,864
we need to stray off certainty,
so we can find ourselves.

112
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:39,561
And that's why I think
it’s not just Tim who needs time

113
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:40,943
to find himself.

114
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,343
Maybe you need it too, Ri?

115
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,418
Why don't you try finding yourself too?

116
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,150
Enjoy being single.

117
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:49,755
Right?

118
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,775
You are the last person I expected
to give me that advice.

119
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,567
How come?

120
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,750
Well,

121
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:00,733
You'd tell me to
stick it out for a bit.

122
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,108
And you know,

123
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,150
just like you and Nato,

124
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,053
you two have been together
since you were in the sixth grade.

125
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:08,083
If he wasn't leaving,

126
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,552
I’m pretty sure there’d be
a ring on your finger by now.

127
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,224
If he wasn't leaving.

128
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:16,174
But that’s not our reality.

129
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:18,442
He’s leaving.

130
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:19,694
And that’s that.

131
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,552
So you're not sticking it out then?

132
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:25,226
Should I wait for
something that's unsure?

133
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,275
Wow!

134
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:29,941
Xan, is that you?

135
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:32,233
Am I sensing some character development?

136
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:34,192
[laughs]

137
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,109
Like I said earlier...

138
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:38,960
People change.

139
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:43,942
Since you have
a sudden change of heart,

140
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:47,180
why don’t you join me
in the single life?

141
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,226
Wait.

142
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:50,184
Why are you dragging me into this?

143
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:51,731
Hey, Xan!

144
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,692
You’re supposed to follow your own advice!

145
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,929
Don't be just all talk!

146
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,141
You got to practice what you preach.

147
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:00,453
You go to walk the walk.

148
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,805
I’m not saying I’m down,

149
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,525
but, if I do say yes,

150
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:05,916
what did you have in mind?

151
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,228
I’m actually not sure.

152
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,211
All I know is
that you have to join me.

153
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:13,167
Unbelievable! You want me to join you,
but you don't even have a plan!

154
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,150
Hey! I’m serious about this!

155
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,264
Come on!

156
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,103
Let's find ourselves...

157
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,430
Together.

158
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:20,725
[giggles]

159
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:22,775
No one gets left behind?

160
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,586
No matter what.

161
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,734
Yeah!

162
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,051
Hey! Calm down!

163
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,784
[chuckles]

164
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,588
So, where are going?

165
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:37,704
I don’t know.

166
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,194
I'll figure something out.

167
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:42,995
But I’ll be here to pick you up
in the morning.

168
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:44,550
Alright.

169
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,287
What the hell?

170
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,577
[Lucas crying]

171
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:50,725
Oh, Lucas.

172
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:52,087
Are you okay?

173
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,525
Sir, are you okay?

174
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,261
Are you hurt? Were you robbed?

175
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:01,647
Should we call the police?

176
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:03,686
Are there any officers nearby
or something?

177
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,318
Lucas, breathe, okay?

178
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:08,796
It's okay.

179
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,468
Hey.

180
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,765
[Lucas crying]

181
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,567
Wait, just stay put.

182
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:18,811
[Lucas crying]

183
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:19,875
Is that him?

184
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,221
Who?

185
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,483
Your neighbor’s mysterious son.

186
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,794
[Lucas crying]

187
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,525
That’s him, alright.

188
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,608
In fairness, he’s cute.

189
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,961
[Lucas crying]

190
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,092
He's alright, I guess.

191
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,140
I guess if he weren't always
so lost in thought.

192
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:37,667
He’s kind of weird.

193
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,832
- Weird can be fun.
- [clicks tongue]

194
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,416
Damn it, Ri.

195
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,228
Don't even think about
getting it on with him.

196
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,377
Hey, it’s true!

197
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,524
You know, let’s just
get back to him.

198
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,391
I mean, he’s just there.

199
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,172
[Lucas crying]

200
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:52,258
So, how are you?

201
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,375
Are you okay?

202
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:55,383
I’m okay.

203
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:58,010
I’m okay. I’m sorry, Xan.

204
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,547
Are you sure you’re okay?

205
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,321
You say you're okay,
but you're sobbing.

206
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:04,757
I really am okay.

207
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:07,317
It’s nothing.

208
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,085
It’s nothing.

209
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,015
Then why are you crying?

210
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:15,955
Nothing.

211
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:20,023
My family's just going
through a lot right now.

212
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:21,866
Okay, okay.

213
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,591
But...

214
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,817
If you need someone to talk to,

215
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:28,150
we’re here and we’re ready to listen.

216
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,762
Thank you, Xan.

217
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:33,958
And?

218
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,116
Rian.

219
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:37,378
Thank you, Rian.

220
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:40,025
Sorry for bothering you.

221
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:42,403
Okay...

222
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,290
I’m going to head back inside.

223
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,222
Hey, sad boy!

224
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,400
Why don't you come with us?

225
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:58,756
Where?

226
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,998
Well... We still don't know...

227
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:05,265
Don't worry about it.
We don't want to bother you.

228
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,942
Don’t listen to Xan.

229
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,538
Come on!

230
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:09,969
It'll be a great distraction

231
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,675
from whatever
you're crying about.

232
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,109
And besides, it's the journey
that counts.

233
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,640
Come on, let’s go!

234
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:17,901
Maybe next time.

235
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,405
I might just ruin your trip.

236
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,135
But thanks for the offer.

237
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,045
Okay.

238
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,015
If you change your mind,
I'll be here tomorrow.

239
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,054
Okay?

240
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,750
[breathing heavily]

241
00:12:51,836 --> 00:13:02,003
[moaning]

242
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:13,128
[moaning]

243
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:21,818
[car honking]

244
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:45,812
Do you still have room for one more?

245
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,482
Yes! The more the merrier!

246
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:52,794
What's this?

247
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:54,692
You’re going to drive.

248
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:56,169
Me?

249
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,929
We don’t even know
where we’re heading!

250
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,997
Wasn't this whole “me finding myself too”
thing your idea?

251
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,794
Then help me find myself!

252
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:08,935
Come on.

253
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,437
Love you.

254
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,232
Yeah, whatever.
You really made me your driver?

255
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:16,459
So, where are we heading?

256
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,724
I actually don’t know.

257
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:21,513
I have an idea.

258
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,450
Perfect! Thank you, Lucas!

259
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:25,536
- Where are we heading?
- Wait a second.

260
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:26,707
Lucas.

261
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:30,341
You have to promise first that
you won’t be a buzzkill this entire trip.

262
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,154
Actually, yeah.

263
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,990
Acorrding to Xan,
you’re a bit of an introvert.

264
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,419
Promise. I won’t be a buzzkill.

265
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,700
Yes! Okay, let's go!

266
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:40,825
Come on.

267
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,561
Lucas, can you hand me
the box at the back?

268
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,929
Which one? This one?

269
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,085
Yeah.

270
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,789
Thank you.

271
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:18,976
What’s up with that?

272
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,976
- Thank you.
- Look inside.

273
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:24,500
There’s nothing in there.

274
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:28,647
Wrong. It's filled with
endless possibilities.

275
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:30,757
Weirdo.

276
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:32,961
So, what is it for?

277
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,974
Look, I want this trip

278
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,656
to be the best thing
any of us has ever experienced.

279
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:40,930
So our goal is to fill this box up

280
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:43,210
with as many memories as possible.

281
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:46,109
Is that okay, Lucas?

282
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,450
You’re right.

283
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:52,066
Lucas, are you okay?

284
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:54,614
All good.

285
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,848
Just thinking.

286
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:58,127
More like... overthinking!

287
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,226
Care to share?

288
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:02,025
It’s nothing important.

289
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,065
Okay, then...

290
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,180
Why don't we state our reasons

291
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:15,672
why we are on this
soul searching trip of 2024?

292
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay Xan, you go first.

293
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,351
Why me?

294
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,391
It’s your idea, you go first.

295
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,758
Hmm, okay fine.

296
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm here because
I want to find myself.

297
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,025
That's that.

298
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:32,687
Xan?

299
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:38,555
I just needed a breather
before I take on my problems.

300
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,387
Okay.

301
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,030
Lucas?

302
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,890
What?

303
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,409
Lucas!

304
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,491
[groans]

305
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,037
Let’s go.

306
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:52,211
You weren't even listening...

307
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:57,195
Stop the car!

308
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Ri!

309
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,568
I said stop the car!

310
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,422
I've always wanted to say that.

311
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,250
It’s so cinematic, right?

312
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:09,639
[chuckles]

313
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,734
Have you lost your mind?

314
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:14,554
Hey, Lucas.

315
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:18,046
Didn't you promise not to
ruin the mood during our trip?

316
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,025
Then, what are you doing?

317
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,347
Sit on top.

318
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,794
Hey.

319
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,567
Just listen to me.

320
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,608
Get on top of the car!

321
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,367
Here?

322
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,544
Uh-huh.

323
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:34,992
Just trust me.

324
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:36,792
Okay?

325
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,775
Now close your eyes...

326
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,483
Take a deep breath...

327
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,900
Breathe in...

328
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:48,942
Breathe out...

329
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,222
Now, just take it all in...

330
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,400
Xan, drive now.

331
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:58,129
He might fall.

332
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,331
He won’t.

333
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,245
Hold on tight!

334
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:07,828
- Whoa! Hey!
- [girls laughing]

335
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:47,003
You know what, why won't you guys
just make my teasing a reality?

336
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,333
[Rian giggling]

337
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,459
She’s got a huge crush on you.

338
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:51,917
Did you know that?

339
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,481
- She’s just hungry.
- [laughs]

340
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,987
So, let’s grab some dinner?

341
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,148
Yes, please.

342
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,072
Let’s find a place to eat.

343
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:04,442
There! I'm sure we can
grab a bite over there.

344
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:08,132
I don’t care where we eat,
I just need food.

345
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:10,784
Alright. Diva's Delight it is!

346
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:43,784
[cheering]

347
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,557
Please welcome our next performer.

348
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,760
Aries Night!

349
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,229
[cheering, clapping]

350
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:54,520
[audience clapping]

351
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,695
You really chose to eat here,
out of all places, huh?

352
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,851
You said you were fine with anything!

353
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:55,870
Are you crying?

354
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,221
Are you homophobic?

355
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,243
[Rian crying]

356
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:03,331
Did seeing drag queens make you cry?

357
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,674
[audience cheering, clapping]

358
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:24,667
[Rian crying]

359
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:26,596
Come on, let’s go out.

360
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,442
Lucas, wait here, okay?

361
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:34,510
[Rian crying]

362
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:39,010
Girl, you were amazing! Werk!

363
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,815
Thank you, dear.

364
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:44,276
Go, go brush your teeth first.

365
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:45,471
Go on.

366
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,390
Hey!

367
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,628
Hey, handsome.

368
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,069
Hi!

369
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,186
Hey!

370
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,530
Psst!

371
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:55,419
- Come here.
- Me?

372
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:56,444
Yeah.

373
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,719
Come here.

374
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:07,120
Why are you all alone
in this kingdom of goddesses?

375
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:08,961
Oh!

376
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,336
My friends are just talking outside.

377
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,604
I figured that
they might need some space.

378
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:15,044
Well!

379
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:18,987
There’s a scene outside?
And you’re stuck here with me?

380
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,456
Am I instant noodles?

381
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:23,971
Because...

382
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,269
Lucky me!

383
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,169
Aye!

384
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:30,859
[clicks tongue]

385
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,573
Why do you look so sad?

386
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:34,943
You’re in a drag bar!

387
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,034
It's the happiest place on earth!

388
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,651
We’re just doing our thing here.

389
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:43,432
I don’t know, you all seem so confident.

390
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:44,999
And I’m a little jealous because...

391
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,963
I wish I was as brave as you.

392
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,784
[exhales]

393
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:54,953
Confidence?!

394
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,042
Come on, come with me.

395
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,995
Let me help you out... Kidding!

396
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,502
- Come on!
- Where?

397
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,776
I have an idea. Come on!

398
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:05,915
- Ri.
- [Rian crying]

399
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,932
What’s wrong?

400
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,276
The drag queens were great in there!

401
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:13,187
[Rian crying]

402
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:15,628
[Rian crying]

403
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,250
Tim’s gay, Xan.

404
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,448
What the heck?

405
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,393
[Rian crying]

406
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:26,846
I couldn’t understand
what he meant when he said

407
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,674
that he wants to find himself.

408
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,728
[Rian crying]

409
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:34,581
He just wanted to be real with himself,
and I couldn't understand it.

410
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:37,919
Because we’ve been
together for so long.

411
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:40,417
It didn’t cross my mind
that it could happen.

412
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:42,003
It didn’t.

413
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:43,028
[Rian crying]

414
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:51,222
[audience cheering, applauding]

415
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:55,010
Okay, ladies, gentlemen,
and everyone in between...

416
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:58,885
Please welcome to
the stage on his debut...

417
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,338
What’s your name again?

418
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Hey!

419
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,300
Me?

420
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:05,909
No, your mom! Of course, you!

421
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,495
- What’s your name?
- It's Lucas.

422
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:09,878
Lucas...

423
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:13,861
Ladies and gentlemen...

424
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:17,465
And everyone in between,
please welcome to the stage...

425
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,144
It's Lucas!

426
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,958
[audience cheering, applauding]

427
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,954
- Come here.
- Why me?

428
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,660
Come on, get up here!

429
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:27,565
Dance! Come on!

430
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,987
Dance!

431
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Go!

432
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,869
Move your hips! Dance!

433
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:33,288
[audience murmuring]

434
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:34,812
There’s a crowd!

435
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:38,167
[audience murmuring in disapproval]

436
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:40,192
There’s too much people!
It's humiliating!

437
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:45,595
Come on! You can do it!

438
00:24:45,620 --> 00:25:02,424
[audience cheering, applauding]

439
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:05,409
Energy! Energy!

440
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:07,323
[audience cheering, applauding]

441
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:14,721
It's Lucas! It's Lucas!

442
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,995
[Rian crying]

443
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,145
I'm sorry, Ri.

444
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,876
That does suck.

445
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:26,682
But if you really love him,
you have to let him go.

446
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,503
[Rian crying]

447
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:31,830
At least, you know
you’re not at fault, right?

448
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,720
Maybe, you’re just not
the one he’s looking for.

449
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,669
[Rian crying]

450
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:42,643
You know what?

451
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:48,698
I don’t think Nato’s coming back.

452
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:52,207
What?

453
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:01,885
He can only return
once his father recovers.

454
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,026
Or, well...

455
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:05,643
If his father dies.

456
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,583
That’s why...

457
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,875
I tried breaking it off
when we last saw each other.

458
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:16,294
But Ri,

459
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:21,199
I don’t think I can do it.

460
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:24,593
You can’t just stay
because you’re comfortable.

461
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:28,624
I know, Ri.

462
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,338
But you deserve better than that.

463
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,414
I’m just scared because...

464
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,151
It’s so hard to be alone.

465
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:42,653
Especially right now, with all
of the things I’m going through.

466
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:47,992
I don’t even know
if I can handle all of it.

467
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:49,836
Xan...

468
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,125
No matter how much
I want to finish school,

469
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,327
it’s not even possible anymore.

470
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,226
Why?

471
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,555
My family.

472
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:06,117
They're all relying on me.

473
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:08,398
That’s why...

474
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:17,753
I can’t finish school because I need
to work in order to support them.

475
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,345
You’ll never be alone, okay?

476
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:23,119
You know that.

477
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,135
No one gets left behind.

478
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:26,664
No matter what.

479
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:29,453
No one gets left behind no matter what.

480
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:32,221
It's Lucas!

481
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,026
It's Lucas!

482
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,859
It's Lucas!

483
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:37,658
Don’t ask.

484
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:39,236
I paid for everything.

485
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:41,578
But it’s a long story.
The important thing is it’s all paid for.

486
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:42,913
By the way,

487
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,995
I got you something.

488
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:47,679
Aries Night’s false eyelashes!

489
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,764
- For your memory box.
- Wow.

490
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,539
- Oh, for your memory box.
- All good?

491
00:27:52,564 --> 00:27:54,687
Xan, I’ll drive.

492
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:57,439
- Okay, fine. Thank you.
- You two need to rest.

493
00:27:57,464 --> 00:27:59,410
- Okay? Come on.
- Let’s go.

494
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:00,769
- No more crying.
- Follow me.

495
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:34,558
[groans]

496
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:39,669
[moans]

497
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:51,845
What happened?

498
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,802
I don’t know.

499
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:55,927
The car just stopped.

500
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:57,878
Shit!

501
00:28:58,382 --> 00:28:59,857
Shit!

502
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:01,195
Don’t get mad at me.

503
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,353
Shit!

504
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,519
I forgot to gas up

505
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:07,812
when I picked you guys up earlier.

506
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:09,710
- [groans]
- Are you serious?

507
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:11,894
- I’m so sorry, guys!
- Damn it, Ri!

508
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,748
We’re in the middle of nowhere!

509
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:14,831
I'm sorry!

510
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:17,414
Nothing’s going to happen if we wait!

511
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:18,640
Damn it!

512
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
You know what?

513
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:21,954
Let’s just hitchhike!

514
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:22,995
No!

515
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,702
We can't just leave
my dad's car here!

516
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:28,415
- Then, what are we supposed to do here?
- Shut up, Xan, okay?

517
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,578
Let me think for a bit.

518
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:32,487
Wait.

519
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,781
What if we just push the car?

520
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,945
- Push! Just push!
- [groans]

521
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:42,948
I don’t wanna do this anymore,
I’m so sweaty.

522
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:45,492
- Just a little bit more.
- We can do this.

523
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,711
Just push!

524
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,456
There! There’s a house!

525
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:54,412
Oh, Thank God!

526
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,898
- Let’s go!
- Oh, let’s go!

527
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,370
Wait.

528
00:29:58,395 --> 00:29:59,270
Xan!

529
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:00,784
You knock on their door.

530
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,029
[Xan knocking on the door]

531
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,312
Is anybody home?

532
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:10,171
What is it?

533
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:15,795
Hi, I'm Xan, this is Rian,
and that's Lucas.

534
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,367
- They’re my friends.
- Good evening.

535
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:18,392
Well...

536
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,873
We ran out of gas.

537
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:25,507
And we were wondering
if you could help us out.

538
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,054
Our car is just right out there.

539
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:33,773
It’s pretty late already, I’m not sure
if there’s any gas stations open in town.

540
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,984
Can you wait for a minute?

541
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,523
Let me ask my husband.

542
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:37,582
Alright.

543
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:38,953
- Abel?
- What?

544
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,338
Why?

545
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,253
Oh, who are these people?

546
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:46,531
They ran out of gas.

547
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:49,218
Love, maybe we can help them?

548
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:52,700
Oh, all of the gas stations
are closed by now.

549
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,593
Is that so?

550
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:59,014
Sorry, we have to wait until tomorrow
before we can sort you guys out.

551
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:00,476
Come in.

552
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:02,387
Just spend the night here.

553
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:04,234
- Take a rest.
- Salve.

554
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:05,585
Love.

555
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:06,975
It’s okay.

556
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,804
We don’t want to disturb you.

557
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:10,695
We’ll just sleep in the car.

558
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,968
It’s too dangerous to
sleep in your car at this hour.

559
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,765
Go on, come inside.

560
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,562
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

561
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:25,991
Aren't they beautiful?

562
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,561
My husband made them.

563
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:31,576
Abel aims to celebrate the
beauty of the female genitalia

564
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:33,492
and the power it holds.

565
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,123
That one looks similar to yours.

566
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:39,614
- It's the same shape.
- Hey!

567
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:41,421
Don’t touch that!

568
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:42,968
Sorry.

569
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,279
I'm sorry about my husband.

570
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,247
He's really particular
when it comes to his artworks.

571
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:51,851
I'm sorry too.

572
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,591
I didn’t mean to raise my voice.

573
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,544
I just hold my art pieces
close to my heart.

574
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,114
Here, have some water.

575
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:00,974
I'm sure you're all pretty tired.

576
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:02,215
Thank you.

577
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:05,365
Give me a moment, I’ll just set up
some towels for you in the bathroom

578
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:07,215
so that all of you can settle down.

579
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,021
- Alright.
- Thank you.

580
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,088
Take care of them.

581
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,174
I just touched it...

582
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,370
You’re in trouble...

583
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:21,625
Stupid.

584
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,455
Hey, are we even safe here?

585
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:25,198
Just let it be.

586
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:26,917
We don’t have a choice.

587
00:32:29,254 --> 00:32:31,836
- What's that?
- [laughing]

588
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:05,558
Hey.

589
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,891
Why are you so shy?

590
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,583
Come join us!

591
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,315
Don’t be shy!

592
00:33:10,617 --> 00:33:11,950
The water’s running!

593
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:18,336
Raise your arms.

594
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:20,336
What the heck.

595
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:23,740
It seems like you’re getting a hard on.

596
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:25,099
[laughing]

597
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:26,226
Can I take a look?

598
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,351
[giggling]

599
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:29,219
Right here, right here.

600
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,362
It's cold! [giggling]

601
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,010
These look like boobs too.

602
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:46,284
[laughing]

603
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,862
See? We’re not
wasting any water here.

604
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:53,854
[squeals]

605
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,651
[laughing]

606
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:58,171
Come here.

607
00:33:58,196 --> 00:33:59,729
[laughing]

608
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:16,424
[chattering, laughing]

609
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:21,034
[squeals]

610
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:30,643
[faint moaning coming
from the other room]

Xan...

627
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,169
Are you okay?

628
00:36:57,905 --> 00:36:58,943
Ri?

629
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,677
I need something.

630
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,518
What is it?

631
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:03,984
Are you okay?

632
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,137
Are you horny?

633
00:37:22,355 --> 00:37:23,688
Yeah, I’m sorry.

634
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:26,544
They’re so loud.

635
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,488
I’m so turned on.

636
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,669
Where?

637
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,445
Is it here?

638
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:46,564
You’re so wet.

639
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,639
Please?

640
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:59,711

[breathing heavily]

651
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:08,944
Hey, are you going to take long?

652
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,761
Can you hurry up? My stomach hurts!

653
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,284
I’m coming!

654
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:20,970
Well... that was different.

655
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:24,546
It was okay.

656
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:25,611
Just okay.

657
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:28,393
I mean...

658
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:30,752
It was good, don't get me wrong.

659
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,351
You’re great in bed.

660
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:36,119
But I don't think I'm into pussy.

661
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:40,549
Oh, Lucas is here.

662
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,986
Let’s rest.

663
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:44,439
Go settle here in the middle.

664
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:47,155
Hey.

665
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:49,346
- What are you waiting for?
- Let's sleep!

666
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:13,256
- You look so beautiful, my love!
- Do we really have to leave this early?

667
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:15,697
Of course, we still have
a long way to go.

668
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,463
Hey, you guys are finally awake.

669
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:21,010
Good morning!

670
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:24,346
By the way, I already
got gas for your car.

671
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,407
I wanted you guys to sleep in

672
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,265
since it looks like
you really needed some rest.

673
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:31,111
Thank you so much, Sir Abel.

674
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,518
Thank you so much as well, Ma’am Salve.

675
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:35,589
You've been a great help to us.

676
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:38,571
No worries. Just make sure
to take care on your trip.

677
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:42,135
- We will!
- Thank you again for your hospitality.

678
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,377
We'll go ahead.

679
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:45,026
Let's go.

680
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:49,375
In fairness, they were pretty kind.

681
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:54,063
It’s just, they’re a little weird.

682
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:57,796
Yeah, and super horny!

683
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:00,471
- [laughing]
- [moaning]

684
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:01,871
[laughing]

685
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,010
Why are you laughing, Lucas?

686
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:06,880
Maybe the reason why
he disappeared last night...

687
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:08,530
[laughing]

688
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,798
Were you able to finish at least?

689
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:14,057
Hey! It’s not like that.

690
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,087
We don’t believe you.

691
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:19,174
Why would you go out
in the middle of the night to shit?

692
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,274
What’s the matter?
I was only gone for a moment.

693
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:25,009
Missed me?

694
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:27,291
Wow, you're so full of yourself.

695
00:42:28,252 --> 00:42:29,252
Jeez...

696
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:33,958
Anyway, let’s do a stopover
so we can eat.

697
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:36,690
Oh wait, before I forget...

698
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,135
Surprise!

699
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:42,171
Hey! This is the piece
I touched last night!

700
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:43,817
Yeah, it’s the one you touched.

701
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,963
And now, you can touch it
whenever you want,

702
00:42:45,988 --> 00:42:47,915
and you can even play with it.

703
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,268
- Yes!
- You idiot!

704
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,963
Abel’s gonna freak out when he finds out
that one of his pieces is missing.

705
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:54,196
I don’t care at all.

706
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:59,635
Abel’s going to be all “Hey!
Why are you touching that!?”

707
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,052
No, no, it’s more like this...

708
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:02,979
“Hey! You’re not supposed to touch it!”

709
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:08,004
[laughing]

710
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:09,427
Stop the car!

711
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:10,988
- Hey, that’s my line!
- I’m just kidding!

712
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:12,754
I really gotta pee.
Wait here.

713
00:43:12,779 --> 00:43:13,904
Go piss, girl.

714
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:19,977
Hi! May I use the restroom?

715
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,065
Sure!

716
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:27,830
Thank you, miss.

717
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,594
- Let's go, let's go.
- Where are we going?

718
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,674
Hurry, let’s go!
That includes you, Lucas!

719
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:38,817
- Alright.
- Okay.

720
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:43,784
Hurry up! Let’s go!

721
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,360
Uh, Sir...

722
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:54,471
This is a ladies-only place,
you’re not allowed to enter.

723
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,634
But Ma’am...

724
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,594
He’s gay.

725
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:03,337
Oh, alright, come in.

726
00:44:03,362 --> 00:44:04,760
Thank you.

727
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:06,155
Let’s go.

728
00:44:10,432 --> 00:44:11,900
A lesbian bar?

729
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:13,463
Really, Xan?

730
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:14,909
What are we doing here?

731
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,526
Not looking for dick, obviously.

732
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:24,112
You said you wanted
to find yourself, right?

733
00:44:25,113 --> 00:44:26,988
So why not try here?

734
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:28,013
Come on!

735
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,862
You’re really messing with me.

736
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:34,630
Seriously, just give it a shot.

737
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:37,655
Then if it’s not for you,
then it’s fine!

738
00:44:37,706 --> 00:44:41,509
And I know for a fact that this
adds up to your list of experiences, right?

739
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:44,540
Wow.

740
00:44:45,732 --> 00:44:46,815
Are you down?

741
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,440
Fine! Okay! I’ll do it!

742
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:50,657
Waitress!

743
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:53,213

[cheering]

757
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,432
It seems like you don’t
need my help anymore.

758
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:04,346
Don’t worry about me,
I can handle myself, okay?

759
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,300
Hi.

760
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,511
Hi. I’m Rian.

761
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:10,536
I’m Sab.

762
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:13,275
I saw you
from across the room earlier.

763
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,425
Are you all alone?

764
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,900
No, I’m with my friends,

765
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:18,877
and I think you’re
gonna like them.

766
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:20,800
Here are my friends.

767
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,255
Miles and Ara.

768
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,405
- Hi, I’m Ara.
- Hi.

769
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,671
- Nice to meet you.
- You’re so pretty.

770
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:26,286
Thank you, you too!

771
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:27,682
My name’s Rian.

[giggling]

773
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,405
Do you want to join us?

774
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:34,869
Yeah, sure! Why not?

775
00:46:35,104 --> 00:46:37,042
[ladies giggling]

776
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:38,908
Good luck!

777
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:42,623
Hey!

778
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:45,838
My best friend has
some really good game!

779
00:46:45,863 --> 00:46:47,571
Three girls in one night?!

780
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,506
I wish that was me.

781
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:51,488
Come on, let’s drink.

Hey!

788
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:14,327
You pervert!

789
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,735
Why don’t you just come with me?

790
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:22,047
There we go.

791
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:28,430
You know, I kind of want
to give you a bath.

792
00:49:37,113 --> 00:49:39,154
Take your shirt off.

793
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:37,988
My love? Why is it curved?

794
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:40,977
It's not supposed to do that.

795
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:13,195
Hey...

796
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:15,023
What are you doing?

797
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:28,109
What are you doing?
I’m trying to sleep!

[Xan mumbling]

799
00:51:34,812 --> 00:51:36,854
Hey, how are you?

800
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:39,258
Were you able to feel anything?

801
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:40,983
Maybe found yourself?

802
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:42,898
I enjoyed it.

803
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:45,525
But I don’t think I came
that much in one night.

804
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,363
Wait, I’m nauseous.

805
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,130
- [retches]
- But I think I’ll stick to penises.

806
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:55,821
Okay, okay! If that’s what you think!

807
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:58,625
But the question is,
were you able to grab a souvenir?

808
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:00,703
Check the box!

809
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:10,241
- [chuckles]
- You dumbass!

810
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:12,363
[laughs] You too!

811
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,780
[laughing]

812
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,915
She’s not going to miss that
because of what we did last night.

813
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:18,105
So?

814
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,836
Back to dicks again?

815
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,030
Actually...

816
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:24,234
I found the perfect distraction.

817
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:25,676
I mean, if it’s okay with you.

818
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:26,701
Who?

819
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,271
Lucas?!

820
00:52:31,296 --> 00:52:32,633
[chuckles]

821
00:52:32,706 --> 00:52:34,741
He’s yours! My God.

822
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:38,021
I have so much things going on,
and I can’t add anymore to my plate.

823
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:39,046
Okay?

824
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:40,363
[laughing]

825
00:52:40,388 --> 00:52:42,346
- Thank you.
- Let’s go.

826
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:43,371
[giggles]

827
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,211
Thank god, we found
a place to stay in.

828
00:53:09,902 --> 00:53:11,485
Is this what a motel looks like?

829
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:14,468
You’ve never been inside a motel?

830
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,914
[laughs]

831
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:22,639
You know,

832
00:53:23,108 --> 00:53:25,015
you’re such a mystery.

833
00:53:27,092 --> 00:53:29,311
Hey, hey! Dibs on the bathroom!

834
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:33,539
You good?

835
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:36,812
HHere’s my jacket, take it.

836
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:38,136
Thanks.

837
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:42,593
What are you doing?

838
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,672
Do you want your jacket to get soaked?

839
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:50,023
I can’t just put it over my wet clothes.

840
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:00,742
You can look now.

841
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,134
You know...

842
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,820
I can feel how heavy
your baggage is.

843
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,030
Why?

844
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:12,992
Is it that obvious?

845
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:17,789
I think I know just the
thing to loosen you up.

846
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,372
Xan!

847
00:54:20,397 --> 00:54:21,789
We’re going to head out.

848
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:23,071
Go!

849
00:54:23,373 --> 00:54:24,373
Come on.

850
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:25,562
Where are we going?

851
00:54:25,655 --> 00:54:27,156
Let’s go! Just trust me!

852
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:24,466
NATO: I love you, Xan.
Wait for me.

857
00:56:44,373 --> 00:56:47,716
- Where are we going?
- Just trust me!

858
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:49,209
Where are we going?!

859
00:56:52,706 --> 00:56:54,450
Hey!

860
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:55,896
Rian!

861
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:58,559
I don’t have any plans of dying tonight.

862
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:00,126
Please.

863
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:02,714
At least not yet.

864
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,407
You’re so morbid.

865
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:07,307
[chuckling]

866
00:57:07,562 --> 00:57:08,896
We’re not here to jump.

867
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,396
We are here to scream.

868
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:12,523
Scream?

869
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:14,797
Why?

870
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,272
No questions asked.

871
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,095
Lucas, you need
to release your inhibitions!

872
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,590
Your fears, your worries!

873
00:57:20,615 --> 00:57:22,530
It'll weigh you down

874
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:24,146
if you’re keeping it all inside.

875
00:57:24,347 --> 00:57:25,572
Okay? So...

876
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:26,597
Scream!

877
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,410
Alright, watch me.

878
00:57:28,717 --> 00:57:30,213
[screaming]

879
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,208
Hey! Shh!

880
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:33,441
- [screaming]
- Shhh! Stop that!

881
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:34,771
[screaming]

882
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:36,247
I won't stop!

883
00:57:36,272 --> 00:57:37,349
Hey!

884
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,532
- [screaming]
- Shhh!

885
00:57:39,571 --> 00:57:42,177
[screaming]

886
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,473
[chuckles]

887
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,294
What was that?

888
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:50,446
Another one!

889
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,196
You can do better
than that! Come on!

890
00:57:52,221 --> 00:58:02,292
[screaming]

891
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:04,921
[laughing]

892
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:05,946
You’re right.

893
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:08,186
It did help.

894
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:12,667
See? I told you!
You should just trust me.

895
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,324
Okay?

896
00:58:22,413 --> 00:58:23,496
What’s happening?

897
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:25,469
[chuckling]

898
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:30,490
[laughing]

899
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,338
This is the only dance I know.

900
00:58:33,363 --> 00:58:34,803
Oh, this one? Do you know the steps?

901
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,613
[laughing]

902
00:58:36,905 --> 00:58:38,170
Spin!

903
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:39,803
Spin again!

904
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,560
[laughing]

905
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,898
Hey Lucas, I...

906
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:00,492
I wanted to ask you about something.

907
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:05,547
That night when we found you
crying in front of Xan’s house...

908
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:07,078
Why were you crying?

909
00:59:10,238 --> 00:59:11,238
Hey.

910
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:14,780
You’ve seen all of me,
you don’t have to be shy anymore.

911
00:59:15,325 --> 00:59:16,338
Come on.

912
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:17,630
You can tell me anything.

913
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:18,841
I won’t judge you.

914
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,030
I promise.

915
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:22,130
That night,

916
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,482
I found out that

917
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,819
one of the people closest to me

918
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:32,641
is terminally ill.

919
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:36,185
They said they haven’t
got much time left.

920
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:45,655
I’m so sorry, Lucas.

921
00:59:52,766 --> 00:59:55,786
Ma’am? Sir? You’re not allowed up here.

922
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:58,035
Please, just return to your room.

923
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:00,504
Alright, we’re sorry, sir.

924
01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:01,747
We’re heading down.

925
01:00:02,446 --> 01:00:03,654
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

926
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:12,146
Ri, were you the last one
who held the key?

927
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:14,546
No, maybe it’s with Lucas.

928
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:16,113
Lucas, do you have the key?

929
01:00:16,138 --> 01:00:17,405
No, it’s not with me.

930
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:18,816
I never touched it.

931
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:20,046
Oh no, ma’am, sir...

932
01:00:20,071 --> 01:00:23,621
There’s an extra charge
if you lost the key.

933
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:26,062
Can’t you just waive the fee?

934
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:27,881
We don’t have any more room
in our budget.

935
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:30,942
I apologize, but it’s not
my problem anymore.

936
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:32,380
And it’s only 300 pesos.

937
01:00:32,405 --> 01:00:34,732
This motel is such a cheapskate.

938
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:36,911
Xan, I’ll just pay for it.

939
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:41,144
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma’am.

940
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:43,155
- Come again soon!
- Hey, it’s alright.

941
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,661
I have no idea where
we could’ve lost the key.

942
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:53,200
Thank you, sir!
Come again soon!

943
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:56,886
Hi sir, are you planning to check in?

944
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:02,575
They just checked out
a couple of minutes ago.

945
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:09,685
Oh, what is this?

946
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:11,965
[laughing]

947
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,030
Hey Rian!

948
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:14,596
You’re such a liar!

949
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:16,612
You made us believe that
you didn’t have the key!

950
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:18,375
Now, we paid for nothing!

951
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:20,624
Xan, just calm down!

952
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,779
I just didn’t want to waste
a good remembrance.

953
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,615
Cut it, the money
was more important.

954
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:29,614
Shit. So much has happened
during this trip.

955
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:32,115
And we still haven’t
reached our destination.

956
01:01:33,217 --> 01:01:35,646
I’m hoping it’s worth it.

957
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:38,296
Hey, it’ll be worth it. Okay?

958
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:41,255
Just trust the universe.
I’m the universe, by the way.

959
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,880
[giggling]

960
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,857
Hey Lucas, what’s your favorite food?

961
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,146
- Adobo?
- Adobo?!

962
01:01:51,443 --> 01:01:52,613
You’re so basic.

963
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:53,686
Well, then.

964
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,474
What’s your favorite color?

965
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,755
- Red.
- Red?

966
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,982
Interesting...

967
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:01,564
Okay...

968
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:04,357
What’s your favorite sex position?

969
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:06,046
Why are you asking about that?

970
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:08,488
Hey, it’s my turn and I’m the only one
allowed to ask questions!

971
01:02:08,513 --> 01:02:10,466
Well, you’ve been asking questions
for a while now!

972
01:02:11,138 --> 01:02:12,741
You've already asked more
than 21 questions already!

973
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:14,622
You’re overreacting!
It’s not over 21!

974
01:02:14,646 --> 01:02:18,154
- Alright, it’s my turn.
- Okay, game.

975
01:02:19,047 --> 01:02:22,622
Xan, if you were an animal,
what would it be?

976
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,131
What kind of question is that?

977
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:28,529
[laughing]

978
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,990
Hey Xan, you good?

979
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:38,997
Sorry, what was the question again?

980
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:41,043
You’re not listening!

981
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:46,761
I said, if you were an animal,
what would it be?

982
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,591
A bird.

983
01:02:48,616 --> 01:02:50,044
Just flying around all day.

984
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,709
Always free, that’s it.

985
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:54,901
Okay, fine.

986
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,167
But what’s your favorite color?

987
01:02:57,422 --> 01:03:00,004
Hey, Lucas! Now, you’re just
copying my questions.

988
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:01,849
I’ll ask the questions again!

989
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,583
Okay.

990
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:08,386
Xan, why aren’t you answering your phone?

991
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,810
Nothing, it’s just Nato calling.

992
01:03:13,948 --> 01:03:15,051
Xan.

993
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:18,427
If you don't like him anymore,
you could at least tell him.

994
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:20,403
Are you really not gonna tell him?

995
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,770
Ri, I’m not ready.

996
01:03:25,128 --> 01:03:26,586
I’ll ask a different question.

997
01:03:26,634 --> 01:03:27,638
Let's see...

998
01:03:29,695 --> 01:03:31,052
I don’t want to play anymore.

999
01:03:32,963 --> 01:03:35,231
Xan, you’re sulking already.

1000
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,711
- Jeez, Xan.
- Let’s play a different game.

1001
01:03:37,736 --> 01:03:38,794
Here’s one.

1002
01:03:39,794 --> 01:03:41,002
The quiet game!

1003
01:03:41,144 --> 01:03:42,811
Nobody talks.

1004
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:46,321
Xan, I’m sorry, okay?

1005
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:47,346
Alright.

1006
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:48,662
I said the quiet game!

1007
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:49,997
I said no talking!

1008
01:03:57,992 --> 01:04:00,992
Let's go!

1009
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:03,388
- [laughing]
- So cool!

1010
01:04:14,224 --> 01:04:15,347
What happened?

1011
01:04:19,613 --> 01:04:20,613
Uh...

1012
01:04:21,204 --> 01:04:22,276
Sir?

1013
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,792
Excuse me...

1014
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:26,569
What happened?

1015
01:04:26,716 --> 01:04:28,007
My tricycle broke down.

1016
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:29,324
Is there anything we can do?

1017
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:31,378
I’m afraid not.

1018
01:04:31,432 --> 01:04:33,338
Is it going to take long?

1019
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,026
I’m not sure.

1020
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,421
Let’s just wait. I already called
the local authorities for help.

1021
01:04:38,446 --> 01:04:40,055
They'll get it all fixed in a bit.

1022
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,727
Alright, thank you.

1023
01:04:42,164 --> 01:04:46,488
But we’ll just leave
the car here and wait.

1024
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:48,531
Okay, ma’am. I apologize
for the inconvience.

1025
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:50,463
No worries, take care of my car please.

1026
01:04:50,589 --> 01:04:52,891
- My dad will kill me.
- Okay, ma’am.

1027
01:04:53,229 --> 01:04:55,727
- No need to worry.
- Alright. Thanks!

1028
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:06,016
Come on, Xan.
This will be good for you.

1029
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:11,530
[giggling]

1030
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:14,010
[coughing]

1031
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:22,047
[giggling]

1032
01:05:27,405 --> 01:05:30,071
[coughing]

1033
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:33,016
[giggling]

1034
01:05:36,022 --> 01:05:37,304
The throat hit’s pretty intense.

1035
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,844
[coughing]

1036
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:44,024
- [Rian laughing]
- What's so funny?

1037
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:48,172
Sleep, baby.

1038
01:05:48,197 --> 01:05:49,977
Love you!

1039
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:55,691
- Shit, Rian
- What?

1040
01:05:55,716 --> 01:05:57,839
I’m too high, I can’t get it up.

1041
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:00,313
[laughing]

1042
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:07,241
Can I tell you guys something?

1043
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:13,719
The whole reason why I went
on this whole finding myself trip

1044
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,921
is because I thought that

1045
01:06:16,946 --> 01:06:19,755
when we come home,
everything will be back to normal.

1046
01:06:20,334 --> 01:06:23,062
No Tim finding himself.

1047
01:06:23,421 --> 01:06:25,421
No gay boyfriend.

1048
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:28,032
Like nothing ever changed.

1049
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:36,530
For me, I want the opposite.

1050
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:41,489
I’m wishing that maybe
everything will change.

1051
01:06:42,362 --> 01:06:45,187
Our financial situation,

1052
01:06:45,726 --> 01:06:48,766
the fact that I can’t
continue my studies,

1053
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:51,813
and the thing with me and Nato.

1054
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,821
I hope when we get back

1055
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:59,500
my parents would reveal
that everything’s a prank

1056
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:03,072
That we’re actually rich.

1057
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:08,969
That I’m an heiress.

1058
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:11,765
Lucas?

1059
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:13,180
Your turn.

1060
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,609
- Me?
- Yeah.

1061
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:22,421
When I was a child,

1062
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:25,289
my family and I went on
a swimming trip in Camarines Norte.

1063
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:29,624
We were still complete back then.

1064
01:07:29,649 --> 01:07:30,983
No struggles.

1065
01:07:33,652 --> 01:07:36,430
I think that was the happiest
moment in my life.

1066
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,899
All I want is to feel that
kind of happiness again.

1067
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:52,469
Excuse me, guys.

1068
01:07:54,558 --> 01:07:55,703
Lucas?

1069
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,546
I’ll handle him, Ri.

1070
01:07:58,893 --> 01:07:59,984
You wait here.

1071
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:20,524
What happened to you, Lucas?

1072
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:22,265
Are you okay?

1073
01:08:25,796 --> 01:08:26,796
Xan...

1074
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:29,336
I don't have much time left.

1075
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:32,386
Hey, what are you saying?

1076
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:37,202
I’m sick, Xan.

1077
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,132
I’m terminally ill.

1078
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:45,132
The doctor said I don't have much time.

1079
01:08:45,196 --> 01:08:47,696
[Lucas sobbing]

1080
01:08:54,003 --> 01:08:55,218
I’m sorry, Lucas.

1081
01:08:55,893 --> 01:08:57,248
I didn’t know.

1082
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,948
Don’t worry, everything will be okay.

1083
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:10,878
This moment feels sparkly.

1084
01:09:11,534 --> 01:09:15,049
I think I need sparklier shoes.

1085
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:25,409
Where did those two go?

1086
01:09:25,956 --> 01:09:28,588
Ri and I are here for you.

1087
01:10:03,397 --> 01:10:06,116
Let’s go, Ri’s waiting for us.

1088
01:10:09,277 --> 01:10:10,304
Xan!

1089
01:10:10,883 --> 01:10:12,061
Xan, I'm sorry!

1090
01:10:12,187 --> 01:10:13,187
Xan!

1091
01:10:15,828 --> 01:10:17,686
I figured that asshole
would leave my dad's car.

1092
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:18,988
Why are you rushing?!

1093
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:20,289
Just get in the car.

1094
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:21,875
We’re here, calm down!

1095
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,351
She said get in the car!

1096
01:10:23,461 --> 01:10:24,655
Okay.

1097
01:10:51,546 --> 01:10:52,796
Argh!

1098
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:04,524
Hey.

1099
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:07,703
What's going on with you two?

1100
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:11,109
Get out, Xan.

1101
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:16,983
Stay there, Lucas.

1102
01:11:29,454 --> 01:11:30,477
What is it?

1103
01:11:30,932 --> 01:11:31,991
I saw you.

1104
01:11:33,655 --> 01:11:34,687
Saw me what?

1105
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:36,089
What?

1106
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:38,656
I saw what you were doing, Xan!

1107
01:11:38,909 --> 01:11:41,320
I thought that was the
last thing on your mind!

1108
01:11:42,026 --> 01:11:43,359
Right...

1109
01:11:44,047 --> 01:11:45,380
Ri, calm down.

1110
01:11:45,717 --> 01:11:46,883
Nothing happened.

1111
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:48,288
Nothing happened?!

1112
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,643
- You two were making out!
- I see.

1113
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,205
Okay, he kissed me.

1114
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:56,216
But I backed off
before anything happened.

1115
01:11:56,241 --> 01:11:57,571
You said I could make a move!

1116
01:11:57,596 --> 01:11:59,471
You said you have no interest in him!

1117
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:00,861
My God, Ri.

1118
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,267
It is the truth!

1119
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:04,993
I don’t like him at all!

1120
01:12:05,064 --> 01:12:06,189
He’s yours!

1121
01:12:06,707 --> 01:12:09,255
Wow, you’re so generous.

1122
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:11,244
You know what? Screw you!

1123
01:12:12,717 --> 01:12:15,104
My God, Ri!
You’re so difficult!

1124
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:18,791
Says the coward who can’t
even talk to her boyfriend!

1125
01:12:19,694 --> 01:12:21,212
You’ve crossed the line!

1126
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,963
I already told you nothing happened!

1127
01:12:23,988 --> 01:12:26,377
You’re being a brat again!

1128
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:27,815
Wow.

1129
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,135
Maybe I’m a brat
but at least I’m not low class!

1130
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:36,127
You only got to where you are
because of me!

1131
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,393
Damn you! You even sugarcoated it.

1132
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:42,291
You could have just said
that I’m dirt poor!

1133
01:12:42,457 --> 01:12:44,612
And yeah, I'm poor,

1134
01:12:44,637 --> 01:12:47,363
but at least, I’m doing
something with my life!

1135
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:50,681
All you do is ask from your dad!

1136
01:12:50,706 --> 01:12:52,931
Then you’re going to say
that your life is hard?

1137
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:56,151
Just because your boyfriend’s
not attracted to you anymore

1138
01:12:56,176 --> 01:12:58,737
Because he likes dick too, dumbass!

1139
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:00,166
Hey!

1140
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:03,143
- [gunshot]
- [screams]

1141
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:04,627
You piece of shit!

1142
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:07,737
Stop screaming!

1143
01:13:08,946 --> 01:13:11,737
I know you stole my masterpiece!

1144
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:13,702
Give it back to me!

1145
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,893
I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

1146
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:17,354
We’ll just pay for it!

1147
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:19,518
We’re so sorry!

1148
01:13:20,682 --> 01:13:24,588
I told you clearly
not to touch my work!

1149
01:13:26,289 --> 01:13:27,823
But what did you do?

1150
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:31,501
It’s there!

1151
01:13:31,526 --> 01:13:34,579
Just take it!
But please don’t hurt us!

1152
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,814
Have mercy on us, please!

1153
01:13:37,404 --> 01:13:38,946
You, get it!

1154
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:41,463
- [crying]
- It’s in the memory box!

1155
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,795
- You even stole from me!
- Don't hurt us, please!

1156
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,143
- Please!
- You took it with you!

1157
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:46,712
[crying]

1158
01:13:46,737 --> 01:13:48,505
Sir, just shoot me!

1159
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,860
- No!
- Really now?

1160
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:51,571
- Do you want me to shoot you?
- Lucas, what are you saying?

1161
01:13:51,596 --> 01:13:52,946
Shoot me!

1162
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:55,546
Please sir, just shoot me!
I’m going to die anyway!

1163
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:58,363
What the hell, Lucas?
What are you saying?

1164
01:13:58,388 --> 01:13:59,424
Everybody shut up!

1165
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:02,075
I don’t want any drama!

1166
01:14:02,225 --> 01:14:04,596
I just want my masterpiece back!

1167
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,666
So give it back,

1168
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,487
before I change my mind!

1169
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:11,268
Just give it to him!

1170
01:14:11,339 --> 01:14:15,893
[Rian and Xan sobbing]

1171
01:14:16,596 --> 01:14:18,951
Next time, you better know
who you're messing with.

1172
01:14:20,738 --> 01:14:24,526
[sobbing]

1173
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:25,557
Screw you three.

1174
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:27,885
[sobbing]

1175
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:33,354
Holy shit, he had a gun.

1176
01:14:34,058 --> 01:14:35,424
I am so sorry.

1177
01:14:35,964 --> 01:14:37,846
I feel like it’s all
my fault, you know...

1178
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:40,799
- Sorry. - I’m so sorry.

1179
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:41,840
Sorry.

1180
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:44,339
Ugh, why'd I do that?

1181
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:46,630
I’ll head to the car.

1182
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,983
I think you guys need to talk.

1183
01:14:56,268 --> 01:14:57,268
Rian...

1184
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,292
Do you remember what
I told you at the rooftop?

1185
01:15:05,838 --> 01:15:07,442
The person who was close to me?

1186
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:10,751
The one with the terminal illness?

1187
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:15,674
Rian, it’s me.

1188
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:20,416
What are you saying?

1189
01:15:21,535 --> 01:15:22,827
You’re dying?

1190
01:15:25,031 --> 01:15:27,244
I only have a few months left, Rian.

1191
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:32,995
No...

1192
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:35,594
You’re joking, right?

1193
01:15:35,874 --> 01:15:41,245
I mean, you don’t look like
someone who’s dying.

1194
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,120
I have Stage IV Metastatic Kidney Cancer.

1195
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:56,425
Oftentimes, it’s the chemo that
makes people like me look sick.

1196
01:15:57,948 --> 01:16:00,885
But because I don't want to suffer
slowly and painfully, if in the end...

1197
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:05,418
I'll die anyway.

1198
01:16:07,053 --> 01:16:14,205
I decided to do everything I want
to do before my time runs out.

1199
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:20,877
Wait, you don’t mean...

1200
01:16:22,218 --> 01:16:23,244
Yeah.

1201
01:16:25,944 --> 01:16:30,725
Lucas, I didn’t expect you to turn us
into accessories to a crime.

1202
01:16:31,242 --> 01:16:35,500
Because in some weird, twisted way,
you’re using us to basically kill yourself.

1203
01:16:37,128 --> 01:16:38,517
It’s not like that.

1204
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,734
Are you sure about this?

1205
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:48,376
I’ve been thinking about this
for a long time.

1206
01:16:49,294 --> 01:16:54,808
But at the end of the day,
this is what I truly want.

1207
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:20,733
We better get going then.

1208
01:17:22,021 --> 01:17:23,069
Not yet.

1209
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:25,270
I think there’s something
you need to do.

1210
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:28,328
Go for it, Rian.

1211
01:17:28,946 --> 01:17:30,196
Talk to Xan

1212
01:17:30,221 --> 01:17:31,358
before we leave.

1213
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,476
Hi.

1214
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,179
Can we talk?

1215
01:17:42,599 --> 01:17:44,030
Come on.

1216
01:17:44,443 --> 01:17:46,068
Please?

1217
01:17:50,388 --> 01:17:51,523
Xan?

1218
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:56,359
Look, I am so sorry

1219
01:17:56,384 --> 01:17:57,781
for everything I said earlier.

1220
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,680
Okay? None of that is real.
I didn’t mean any of it.

1221
01:18:00,796 --> 01:18:02,088
It was just my emotions.

1222
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:05,967
I’m sorry too.

1223
01:18:07,826 --> 01:18:08,879
Okay.

1224
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:12,336
Can we please make a pact?

1225
01:18:16,128 --> 01:18:20,586
I want us to promise
that no matter what happens,

1226
01:18:22,104 --> 01:18:25,579
we will never ever let
a guy come between us.

1227
01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:29,692
Sounds like a good idea.

1228
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:31,242
Of course. I thought about it.

1229
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,192
But in all seriousness,

1230
01:18:36,773 --> 01:18:38,891
you’re my bestfriend, okay?

1231
01:18:39,065 --> 01:18:40,142
I love you.

1232
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:42,000
So dramatic.

1233
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:43,608
Yeah, yeah, I love you too.

1234
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:48,133
Ew!

1235
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:49,533
Are you ready?

1236
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:50,766
For what?

1237
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:53,414
To be an accessory to a murder?

1238
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,988
- [Rian laughing]
- Okay, okay.

1239
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:58,234
- Let’s go!
- Alright, let's go!

1240
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,327
Xan?

1241
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,708
- Hmm?
- Are we there yet?

1242
01:19:11,405 --> 01:19:13,363
Nope!

1243
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,922
It's taking forever!

1244
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:26,437
Xan!

1245
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:28,406
Xan!

1246
01:19:28,955 --> 01:19:30,593
Are we there yet?

1247
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:33,617
Not yet.

1248
01:19:43,925 --> 01:19:45,297
Xan?

1249
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:47,844
Are we there yet?

1250
01:19:50,242 --> 01:19:51,367
Yes!

1251
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,805
Really?!

1252
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:55,202
No!

1253
01:19:55,227 --> 01:19:57,398
Wait, there! Look!

1254
01:19:58,482 --> 01:20:01,077
- That’s it!
- [squeals]

1255
01:20:01,102 --> 01:20:02,866
Let’s go!

1256
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:04,765
There you go! We're here!

1257
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,609
- Are you happy?
- Let’s go!

1258
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:14,217
[screaming]

1259
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,321
Let’s go!

1260
01:20:15,321 --> 01:20:18,555
[screaming]

1261
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,242
- It’s so beautiful!
- It’s so nice here!

1262
01:20:21,267 --> 01:20:23,914
I haven’t been to the beach in forever!

1263
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:25,569
See?

1264
01:20:25,594 --> 01:20:27,601
I told you!
It’ll be worth it.

1265
01:20:27,626 --> 01:20:30,109
Thank god, we're finally here!

1266
01:20:30,134 --> 01:20:31,301
This is great!

1267
01:20:31,378 --> 01:20:34,500
I think a bonfire
would be perfect, huh?

1268
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:37,937
Yeah! Yeah!

1269
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:39,503
Do you remember when you guys
left me at the bar?

1270
01:20:39,528 --> 01:20:41,875
- Uh-huh.
- This is what I did.

1271
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:47,190
It's Lucas! It's Lucas!

1272
01:20:47,215 --> 01:20:49,383
- I even did this move.
- Seriously?

1273
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,750
Of course!

1274
01:20:50,775 --> 01:20:51,923
Yeah!

1275
01:21:22,367 --> 01:21:24,140
Lucas, can I ask a question?

1276
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:27,297
Go for it.

1277
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:31,458
What made you decide
to not undergo treatment?

1278
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,853
Yeah, how come?

1279
01:21:32,878 --> 01:21:34,828
What made you decide to give up?

1280
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:40,695
I didn't give up.

1281
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,556
Who told you that I gave up?

1282
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:47,792
For me, it's better to end my life

1283
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:51,673
according to how I want to end it,

1284
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:54,634
rather than wait for
my sickness to kill me.

1285
01:21:54,789 --> 01:21:57,329
That’s the reason I wanted
to go with you guys.

1286
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:01,205
Because I wanted my story to end here.

1287
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,275
Here, where I was once happy.

1288
01:22:19,429 --> 01:22:26,990
Why are so sad? You promised
not to be a buzzkill, remember?

1289
01:22:30,235 --> 01:22:32,609
Have a shot!

1290
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:41,664
Cheers!

1291
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:46,170
Xan?

1292
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:47,560
What?

1293
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:50,479
- Do you remember what you told me?
- Which one?

1294
01:22:50,504 --> 01:22:53,844
When you and Nato had sex at the chapel?

1295
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:56,000
You bitch! That’s a secret!

1296
01:22:56,914 --> 01:23:00,781
What about you? You had sex
on your father’s bed!

1297
01:23:00,806 --> 01:23:03,461
- What? What?
- Shut up!

1298
01:23:03,486 --> 01:23:05,711
- He might hear you!
- No!

1299
01:23:05,896 --> 01:23:09,148
[laughing] Wait, he's not here.

1300
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,742
At least mine’s on a bed.

1301
01:23:12,775 --> 01:23:14,680
Not under the altar.

1302
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,272
Why are you so quiet?

1303
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:20,797
You keep eating.

1304
01:23:21,187 --> 01:23:22,187
Yeah!

1305
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:26,461
Okay Lucas, I have a question for you.

1306
01:23:26,486 --> 01:23:30,359
Where’s the craziest place
you’ve ever had sex?

1307
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:33,000
- Yeah!
- [giggles]

1308
01:23:34,775 --> 01:23:35,781
Nowhere.

1309
01:23:35,806 --> 01:23:38,389
Yeah, why are you guys laughing?

1310
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,750
I’m a virgin.

1311
01:23:40,775 --> 01:23:45,500
- Do you want to not be a virgin?
- Do you want us to fight again?

1312
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:46,867
Just say it.

1313
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,492
I swear.

1314
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:51,352
- Look at him!
- I swear, I’m still a virgin.

1315
01:23:53,539 --> 01:23:55,000
It’s true, I’m still a virgin.

1316
01:23:55,898 --> 01:23:57,578
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1317
01:23:57,603 --> 01:23:58,603
Seriously?

1318
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:01,233
It’s actually on my bucket list.

1319
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,125
Sadly, I don’t think it’ll happen.

1320
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:06,379
Lucas...

1321
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:11,094
You can’t die
without having sex.

1322
01:24:14,343 --> 01:24:16,531
We’ll take care of you.

Congrats! You’re not
a virgin anymore.

1333
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,772
Thank you! How was it?

1334
01:28:32,209 --> 01:28:33,417
Was it okay?

1335
01:28:33,477 --> 01:28:38,179
It was okay,
around four out of ten.

1336
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:41,092
Hey, you’re so mean!

1337
01:28:41,257 --> 01:28:42,446
It wasn't that bad.

1338
01:28:42,471 --> 01:28:46,101
Maybe 4.5 out of ten?

1339
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:47,920
I’m sorry.

1340
01:28:48,155 --> 01:28:49,906
It was my first time.

1341
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:52,921
We’re just joking.

1342
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:54,239
You did great.

1343
01:28:54,303 --> 01:28:58,453
And you left lasting memories.

1344
01:28:59,297 --> 01:29:03,742
I think he has enough
energy to prove himself.

1345
01:29:08,507 --> 01:29:09,507
Xan?

1346
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:10,944
Where are you going?

1347
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:14,265
To face my reality.

1348
01:29:17,772 --> 01:29:20,005
Wish me luck, you two!

1349
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,729
Good luck!

1350
01:29:53,117 --> 01:29:55,307
Hello, Nato?

1351
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:57,432
Xan? My love!

1352
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,096
Why are you just calling me now?

1353
01:30:00,065 --> 01:30:02,183
- Nato...
- How are you?

1354
01:30:02,519 --> 01:30:03,519
Have you eaten?

1355
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:09,612
Nato...

1356
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:11,721
Is there a problem?

1357
01:30:16,936 --> 01:30:18,448
Xan? My love?

1358
01:30:20,765 --> 01:30:22,251
Nato, let’s end this.

1359
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,378
What are you saying?

1360
01:30:27,568 --> 01:30:29,838
I can’t just be here waiting for you,

1361
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:33,530
unsure when you'll be coming back.

1362
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:40,317
I don’t even know
if you’re coming back at all.

1363
01:30:41,113 --> 01:30:45,155
Xan, I already told you
that I’m coming back.

1364
01:30:45,702 --> 01:30:48,159
- Just wait for me.
- How long?

1365
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,250
A year?

1366
01:30:54,632 --> 01:30:55,681
Five years?

1367
01:30:58,331 --> 01:30:59,628
Ten years?

1368
01:31:03,615 --> 01:31:05,729
What if we drift apart?

1369
01:31:10,185 --> 01:31:14,604
What if we’re not the same people
we loved before when you come back?

1370
01:31:15,996 --> 01:31:17,034
But Xan...

1371
01:31:21,296 --> 01:31:23,166
I’m not happy anymore, Nato.

1372
01:31:26,969 --> 01:31:28,205
Nato?

1373
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,089
I understand.

1374
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,167
I know what I’m asking
from you is not easy.

1375
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:38,424
If you’re not happy anymore,
I can't force you.

1376
01:31:39,547 --> 01:31:42,721
I love you too much
for me to do that.

1377
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:48,988
I’m sorry.

1378
01:31:49,219 --> 01:31:50,604
I’m sorry too, Xan.

1379
01:31:55,821 --> 01:31:57,237
Goodbye, Nato.

1380
01:31:57,787 --> 01:31:59,221
