[Love Is Like A Cat]

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,475
Did you sleep well?

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,894
No.

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,520
Are you not feeling well?

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,364
Does your arm hurt a lot?

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,236
Don't touch me.

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,363
Oh, sorry.

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,081
What's with the iciness?

9
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,710
What's with him?

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,695
Maybe his injury is acting up.

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,798
It's only a contusion, it'll heal over time.

12
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,341
He's a celebrity.

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,185
Even a small injury must worry him.

14
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,145
Deok Gu...

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,647
You're old now...

16
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,449
But I'll make sure they won't harm you.

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,997
Can we talk?

18
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,749
I have nothing to say to you.

19
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,259
It seems like you do.

20
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,043
Between animals and humans,

21
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:36,353
who do you trust more?

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,391
Tell me.

23
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,412
I trust animals more.

24
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,738
Really?

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,398
Then as much as you trust them,

26
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,403
they must trust you too, right?

27
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,680
Yes, but why do you ask?

28
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,041
What's up with them?

29
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,709
I'm not sure.

30
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,670
Is it a lover's quarrel?

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,630
Don't be ridiculous.

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,632
There's something going on.

33
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,551
Watch them carefully, okay?

34
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,047
Okay.

35
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:33,570
All right.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,280
This is a variety show, right?

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,040
They can't air any of this.

38
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,005
Mr. Uno, is something up?

39
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,090
Why are you so down?

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,807
Our show might flop.

41
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,761
We have to ride the wave while it's high.

42
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,805
Do you understand what I'm saying?

43
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,014
Producer Lee.

44
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,439
Yes?

45
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,069
Can I ride on a motorcycle?

46
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,024
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

47
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,901
It'll look good on screen.

48
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,737
How about having Deok Gu ride shotgun?

49
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,155
Deok Gu?

50
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,616
What's the thing that allows people
to ride next to a motorcycle?

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,160
- A sidecar.
- Right.

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,341
I think it'll look good on screen

53
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,874
and the audience would love it
if you took Deok Gu on a ride.

54
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,883
What do you say?

55
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,504
Sounds good.

56
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,838
I'll get it prepared.

57
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,306
Let me know if you need anything.

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,343
Okay.

59
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,429
Hyung.

60
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,639
Will you be okay?

61
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,524
Yes, don't worry.

62
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,588
The camera is switched off.

63
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,799
They won't know the camera is on, right?

64
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,720
That's right, it looks as if it's turned off to them.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,221
And the audio?

66
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,932
We have to use the camera's microphone.

67
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,225
We have no choice.

68
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,923
Fine.

69
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,591
Let's go.

70
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,434
Hey! What are you doing?

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,414
Uno hyung?

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,311
I thought you trusted animals?

73
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,523
But you're going to put Deok Gu down?

74
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,598
Why? For what?

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,779
He just said "put down", right?

76
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,086
Yes, that's right.

77
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:26,041
"Put down".

78
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,206
It's because he's old, right?

79
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,668
Now that you don't want him,
you're going to kill him?

80
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,035
But Deok Gu trusted you!

81
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,383
What does that make of him?

82
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,176
That's not it, Hyung.

83
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,394
This is for Deok Gu.

84
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,953
Killing him is?

85
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,750
You bastards!

86
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,414
What do we do?

87
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,528
What if we have to stop filming?

88
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,490
Do you not understand what's going on?

89
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,284
I'm not sure.

90
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,036
What's happening?

91
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,788
This is absolutely huge.

92
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,903
So you're going to air everything?

93
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:16,001
About putting him down and Uno hitting him?

94
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,729
Of course.

95
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,770
Deok Gu's heart

96
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,141
is infested with heartworms.

97
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,950
What?

98
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,073
Heartworms.

99
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,842
It's like...

100
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:52,412
he has cancer.

101
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,247
Cancer?

102
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,090
I don't know how much longer he'll live.

103
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,495
A week...

104
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,712
or 15 days?

105
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,931
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,590
You said you were badly hurt

107
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,088
by a dog you loved in your childhood.

108
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,395
I didn't want you to get hurt again.

109
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,847
Is Deok Gu's condition,

110
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,458
really deteriorating?

111
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,583
Jun Hyuk hyung said

112
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,902
it's a miracle that he's alive.

113
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,946
Every minute and second

114
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:38,241
is excruciatingly painful for Deok Gu right now.

115
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,800
What about surgery?

116
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,941
Isn't that an option?

117
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,850
There's only one way

118
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,617
to ease his pain now.

119
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,159
Good morning, Uno hyung.

120
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,671
Hi.

121
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,926
How's your arm?

122
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,835
Yes, it's fine.

123
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,678
Do we have a lot to do today?

124
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,438
Why?

125
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,310
Can I ask you a favor?

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,728
You can't.

127
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,149
You don't even know what it is yet.

128
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,648
Whatever, it's a no.

129
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,163
Why are you being weird?

130
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:46,609
I'm not.

131
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,486
You're being weird this morning.

132
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,473
How so?

133
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,332
You're mad at me, right?

134
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,161
Hold on a second.

135
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,171
I'm busy.

136
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,509
You there.

137
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,465
Do you know what's up with him?

138
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,763
I don't know.

139
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,473
Did you forget about yesterday?

140
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,206
Yesterday?

141
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,688
This is for Deok Gu.

142
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,739
Killing him is?

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,325
You bastards!

144
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,340
Hello?

145
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,801
How long must I wait?

146
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,137
Not much longer.

147
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,123
I planted a trustworthy spy.

148
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:00,683
We'll be getting something soon.

149
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,602
I made it clear that I can't wait very long.

150
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,395
Don't worry.

151
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,614
I don't plan on dragging this out either.

152
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,230
What?

153
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,011
You have nothing to say?

154
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,346
I'm going then.

155
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,222
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,684
I'm really sorry.

157
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:44,357
I thought you were going to put down Deok Gu

158
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,737
because he's old and useless.

159
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,087
It hurt a lot, right?

160
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,323
Can you hit me back

161
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:10,211
just like how I did?

162
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,257
Hit me as much as you want.
Until you're satisfied.

163
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,100
Go on, hit me.

164
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,160
It's fine.

165
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,615
I have nowhere to hit you, even if I wanted to.

166
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:35,236
What do you mean?

167
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,330
Why is your face so perfect?

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,780
Do you really think that?

169
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,538
Don't I have a cold face?

170
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,540
That's what everyone says.

171
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,874
It's not.

172
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,686
If anything,

173
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,178
it's hot.

174
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,676
You're pretending to be cold
to hide your hotness.

175
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,792
You can see all that

176
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,472
with your eyes?

177
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,402
More like,

178
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:07,776
I can feel it.

179
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,939
From this heart...

180
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,633
and also,

181
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,001
from your eyes.

182
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,097
Are you,

183
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,438
not going to do me a favor?

184
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,222
This was it?

185
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,808
You wanted me to help you
create memories with Deok Gu?

186
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,611
Yes, I wanted to do something for him.

187
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,190
Thank you, Hyung.

188
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,479
No, thank you.

189
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,321
Make sure to check
the battery along the way.

190
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,364
Will do.

191
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,991
Hyung!

192
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,202
Should I follow you?

193
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,101
No, I want to go alone with Deok Gu.

194
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,385
Let's go Deok Gu.

195
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:37,146
♫ Can I open up your heart? ♫

196
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:43,574
♫ I have no idea how I feel ♫

197
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,778
♫ My heart flutters when I see you ♫

198
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:52,498
♫ It's okay to open up my heart ♫

199
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,169
♫ You may be clumsy ♫

200
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,915
♫ But my heart that was closed ♫

201
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:02,759
♫ is opening up to you ♫

202
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,638
♫ Slowly step-by-step ♫

203
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,679
♫ I'll go towards you ♫

204
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,818
Deok Gu.

205
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:19,442
I had a dog I was super close to

206
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,986
named Gold in the past.

207
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,793
After my mom passed,

208
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:28,336
I leaned on Gold a lot.

209
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,790
But one day,

210
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,611
Gold got mad at me...

211
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:41,917
and left me.

212
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,675
I was so heartbroken.

213
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,225
Since then,

214
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,591
I can't get close to any dog.

215
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,905
But thanks to you Deok Gu,

216
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,123
I'm able to open up my heart...

217
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,791
to dogs now.

218
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,403
Thank you so much, Deok Gu.

219
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,311
I'm so grateful I met you.

220
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:19,586
♫ What a feeling ♫

221
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:24,701
♫ Open in your side ♫

222
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:27,260
♫ I can feel it ♫

223
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,927
♫ Open in your side ♫

224
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:36,895
♫ In the night when everyone is sound asleep ♫

225
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,607
♫ Our love becomes a star ♫

226
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,570
♫ With our hands held together ♫

227
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:51,659
♫ Shall we run or not? Then the moment we lock our eyes ♫

228
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:59,182
♫ What a feeling. Open in your side ♫

229
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:01,878
♫ I can feel it ♫

230
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:07,634
♫ Open in your side ♫

231
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,388
♫ This might be love ♫

232
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,295
♫ Just like a cat ♫

233
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:18,520
♫ Hug me ♫

234
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,232
♫ Baby, kiss me ♫

235
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:29,781
♫ Love is like a cat ♫

236
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:35,404
♫ Love is ♫

237
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:40,240
♫ like a cat ♫
