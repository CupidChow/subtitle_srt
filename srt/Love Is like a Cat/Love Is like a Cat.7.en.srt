My poor Uno.

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:17,325
Why does he have to go through all that trouble because of that boss?

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,278
What trouble? It's so much fun!

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,689
Is it fun?

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,509
Is that funny to you?

7
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:28,470
Can't you see Uno struggling?

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,997
That's what the viewers like.

9
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:36,286
I can't watch this anymore. Call Producer Lee.

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,370
Why?

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,289
Tell her we're quitting.

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,590
I can't bear to watch him struggling anymore.

13
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,036
I'm proud of you.

Section Manager Pi.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,265
Why don't you announce it officially
after this show is over?

16
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,434
What kind of announcement are you talking about?

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,800
Of course, it's about the guardian announcement.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,358
That's a great idea, but wouldn't we have to hear what Uno thinks?

19
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,177
No.

20
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,996
I've made up my mind.

[Weekly Viewership Ratings]

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,520
The viewership ratings rose by three percent!

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,213
Great.

24
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,940
Now, this is only the beginning.

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,743
But will there be something more shocking?

26
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,844
Uno's afraid of dogs.

27
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,996
So?

28
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,465
So, let's do an overcoming trauma mission.

29
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,843
Let's do that as today's mission.

30
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,863
Take Deok Gu for a walk.

31
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:57,033
Uno, you need to go out for a walk with Deok Gu.

32
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,729
What's the penalty if you can't complete the daily missions?

33
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,249
Whenever I fail, I'll have to extend my time here for another day.

34
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,262
So, does that mean you'll have to stay longer
after the one month of filming?

35
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,933
Isn't it a good thing if he stays here longer?

36
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,064
Should we try that mission?

37
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,780
It's okay.

38
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,232
Good boy.

39
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:39,768
Are you really going to be okay?

40
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,870
Don't worry.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,022
Deok Gu's pretty old.

42
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:46,791
Also, he went through a bad situation recently.

43
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,226
So, he's sensitive. Be gentle with him.

44
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,881
I get it.

45
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,258
You must never lose the leash.

46

00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:50,649

00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,782
It's important to us.

86
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:09,351

Are you okay?

93
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,725
That hurts...

94
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:56,031
I guess you sprained your ankle. Can you stand up?

95
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,357
I think you shouldn't move. Let me call for some help.

96
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,424
I guess I didn't bring my phone.

97
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:19,022
What...

98
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,548
What should we do now?

99
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,008
Well, have some rest for now.

100
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,811
If we don't come back, people will start to look for us.

101
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,323
Can't you get in touch with them?

102
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,863
No, Dae Byeol left his phone here.

103
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,683
Don't we need to call the police?

104
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:49,410
Police? Do you want to cancel the show?

105
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,638
But what if they got into an accident?

106
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,083
Then we should use that as well.

107
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,630
Producer Lee, what happened?

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,632
- We have to wait.
- Until when?

109
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,217
Let's wait until the next morning for now.

110
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,843
Don't we need to call the police first?

111
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:08,221
Dae Byeol is with him,

112
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,599
so even if something happens to Uno, he's not alone.

113
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,950
What if they both got into an accident?

114
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,976
Excuse me!

115
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,853
Why are you stirring up trouble?

116
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:18,539
Who do you think is feeling the most nervous here?

117
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,943
If anything happens to them, the show is over!

118
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:25,154
That's why I'm saying we have to think more cautiously.

119
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,600
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:49,128
I should've held onto Deok Gu well.

121
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,481
I'm sorry as well.

122
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,759
I'm sorry I yelled at you

123
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,887
and accused you dumping him.

124
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,943
It was because I got angry.

125
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,753
I know.

126
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,844
My mom...

127
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:36,216
Passed away when I was young.

128
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,137
And my dad...

129
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:44,967
is Korean,

130
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,767
but he left me and my mom

131
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:51,952
when I was three.

132
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,143
My relatives took me and raised me
when I was eight after my mom passed away,

133
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,415
but I was so lonely.

134
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,877
Just then,

135
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,168
I met a dog.

136
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,453
His name was Gold.

137
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,065
He was a stray dog.

138
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,497
Both of us didn't have anyone.

139
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,535
We got close to each other,
and I played with Gold every day.

140
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,065
We played together,

141
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:39,766
and shared our food with each other.

142
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,507
In a way,

143
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,704
Gold was my only friend.

144
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,833
But one day,

145
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,512
Gold just disappeared.

146
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,876
I searched all around the neighborhood...

147
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,408
every single day.

148
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,969
In hope,

149
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:09,095
of finding Gold.

150
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,427
And then came one day,

151
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,710
I finally found him.

152
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,745
But when Gold saw me,

153
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,406
he started to barked at me.

154
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:41,977
I called out his name and approached him,

155
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:46,350
but he started to bare his teeth...

156
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:52,568
And then

157
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,400
he tried to bite me.

158
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,146
I got scared of Gold acting like that

159
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,308
and ran away from him.

160
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,746
Since then, I was scared of dogs.

161
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,819
Maybe...

162
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,020
Gold got too old and had dementia.

163
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,466
Dementia?

164
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,778
Dogs get dementia, too.

165
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,451
Do you think that was the case?

166
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,826
Why did you come to Jun Hyuk's animal hospital?

167
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:09,750
I wanted to see if Deok Gu was doing well.

168
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,683
He reminded me of Gold.

169
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,600
Then,

170
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,003

♫ Like when we first met ♫

184
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:54,964
♫ I got a crush on you ♫

185
00:14:54,964 --> 00:15:02,461
♫ Can't stop thinking about you ♫

186
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:09,032
♫ Please be with me ♫

187
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:14,683
♫ Always like when we first met ♫
