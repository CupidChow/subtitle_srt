This single photo can destroy Pi Uno.

Will you be okay?

9
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,084
Yes, I should finish the job.

10
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,712
You made the right decision.

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,464

- Okay.

13
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,094

Doctor, have you seen the news?

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,489
Mr. Uno and Mr. Dae Byeol
are the most searched people online right now.

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,532
Is this real?

19
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,534
Why are you bringing this up?

20
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,583
I need to get away for a bit.

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,383
What's the best action we can take now?

22
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,830
If the fact that Uno
is your son comes to light now,

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,681
it might affect our company very negatively.

24
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,644
What do you advise?

25
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,576
I think Uno should take a break from Korea

26
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:47,691
and go back to Thailand for the time being.

27
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,141
Also, I think you should reconsider

28
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:52,737
your relationship with him.

29
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,245
So that's what you think.

30
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,540
All right.

31
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,620
Are you okay?

32
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,464
It doesn't bother me.

33
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,551

00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,743
He's a celebrity.

36
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,184
He's probably in a very bad spot now.

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,729
A bad spot?

38
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,730
That's what you're worried about?

39
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,544
Did you not get hurt?

40
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:35,198
I know very well how much pain
you were in because of Chi Sub.

41
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,575
You should brace yourself.

42

43
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,205

44
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,046
I know that too.

He'll leave me...

54
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,568
What will you do now?

55
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,615
Deny everything. Say it was against your will.

56
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,450
I can't do that.

57
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,150
This is the only way.

58
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,788
Just say you didn't want to,

59
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,907
but the other party forced it on you,

60
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,169
and that you'll take legal action.

61
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,248
You know that's not true.

62
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:16,965

00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,228
Why did you do it?

71
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,425
I thought about who might've taken the photo.

00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,416

00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,373
Why did you do it?

75
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,672
I'm reminded of the first time I came here.

76
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,976
I can clearly remember

77
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,373
how you welcomed me with a big smile.

78
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,180
The reason I'm here

79
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,060

00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,029
you only had eyes for him.

84

You smiled at Uno hyung instead of me,

85
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,770
and your warm eyes which only looked at me

86
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,456
started to only look at Uno hyung.

87
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,085
I couldn't stand that.

88
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,591
I simply wanted you
to look at me the same way again.

89
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,176

92
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,979
then you'd only look at me again.

- Mr. Lee.

Uno do you think a love like that exists?

105
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,989
A love where you gamble everything for one person.

106
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,821
I'm sure a love like that exists somewhere.

But the story doesn't match Uno.

187
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,745
It's too melodramatic.

188
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,122
How can I say this...

189
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,041
It's not sophisticated.

190
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,878
I think you need to watch some variety shows.

191
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,631
That's how you keep up with trends.

192
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,499
Like "Dooby Dooby Job". It's so fun.

193
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,762
They're filming a second season.

194
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,339
Hyung.

195
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,823
Are you sure about this outfit?

196
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,345
Of course.

197
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,430
I'm here to work.

198
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,726
But it's for TV. You look like a bum.

199
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,575
Think about it, Seong Joo.

200
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:18,899
How would you feel if
someone came to work in a suit?

201
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,403
I'd obviously be mad.

202
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,154
- So-
- So?

203
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,577
I'll put that person to work
to the point that he'll want to cuss me out.

204
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,566
You need a talking to, you punk.

205
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,130
Hyung, here you go.

206
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,478
I'll see you.

207
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,311
Stay on your toes.

208
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,897
Focus the camera on Uno. Okay.

209
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,150
Let's kick start "Dooby Dooby Job: Season 2"!

210
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,027
Focus the camera.

211
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,038
What's with the uniform?

212
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,789
Don't I look good?

213
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,461
This is how one should dress for work.

214
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,506
You're such a rookie.

215
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,301
Aren't we filming the opening
for "Dooby Dooby Job: Season 2"?

216
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,969
That's right.

217
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,224
Then the least you could do is dress up.

218
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,185
♫ The one that we dreamt of. ♫

219
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:44,965
♫ No matter what others say, I'll come with you ♫

220
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:51,807
♫ What a feeling, open in your side ♫

221
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:59,208
♫ I can feel it. Open in your side ♫

222
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,293
I missed you. Do you know that?

223
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,475
Me too.

224
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,966
Also, I love you.

225
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,886
I love you too.

226
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,680
♫ I'll hold hands with you ♫

227
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,658
♫ Shall we run or not? The moment our eyes meet ♫

228
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:27,183
♫ What a feeling. Open in your side ♫

229
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:35,569
♫ I can feel it. Open in your side ♫

230
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:43,291
♫ This might be love. Just like a cat ♫

231
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,517
♫ Hug me ♫

232
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:50,344
♫ Baby, kiss me ♫

233
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:57,997
♫ Love is like a cat ♫

234
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:03,469
♫ Love is ♫

235
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:09,072
♫ like a cat ♫

236
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:37,675
♫ Can I open up your heart? ♫

237
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:44,076
♫ I have no idea how I feel ♫

238
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:47,102
♫ My heart flutters when I see you ♫

239
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:52,943
♫ It's okay to open up my heart ♫

240
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:59,468
♫ You may be clumsy. But my heart that was closed ♫

241
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:03,320
♫ is opening up to you ♫

242
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,883
♫ Slowly step-by-step ♫

243
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:17,768
♫ I'll come to your side step by step ♫

244
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:25,600
♫ What a feeling. Open in your side ♫

245
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,885
♫ I can feel it. Open in your side ♫

246
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:40,012
♫ This might be love. Just like a cat ♫
