When is he coming?

4
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,243
Look him him,

5
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,427
what the heck is he doing?

6
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,835
You scum!

7
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:29,811
Thank you for saving me.

8
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,965
At least tell me your name...

9
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,092
Cut.

10
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:45,461
End slate!

11
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,641
Scene 10. Cut 7. Take 1.

12
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,735
Hey, Uno.

13
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,238
You killed it today. Really awesome!

14
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,349
You tore through the monitor

15
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,794
with just one look.

16
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:02,369
The fight scene was so professional!

17
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,509
Totally awesome!

18
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:05,500
Please translate for him.

19
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:06,663
- Director.
- Yes?

20
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,175
Our Uno understands Korean.

21
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,333
Oh, right.

22
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,001
Ah, I always forget.

23
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,634
But how do you understand Thai?

24
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,410
Our company specializes in Thailand,

25
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,719
so I roughly understand.

26
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:20,882
Is today's shoot over?

27
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:22,563
Let's go.

28
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,044
Man, this guy.

29
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:31,159
He looks great, but he's too cold.

30
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,887
He's missing, this, heart.

31
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,889
Oh, it smells nice.

32
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,349
The taste is even better.

33
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,518
- It's a reward.
- Thank you.

34
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:18,911
But isn't that outfit uncomfortable?

35
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,684
You can wear something comfortable.

36
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,328
I prefer this.

37
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,199
I feel like I have right thoughts

38
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,269
in proper attire.

39
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,759
Does that mean we

40
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,806
have no right thoughts?

41
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:32,849
Ah! No, sir, I didn't mean it like that.

42
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,251
Seeing him flustered, it's true.

43
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:36,802
You must be thinking that

44
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:37,873
we have no class, huh?

45
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,437
No, I absolutely didn't think so.

46
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:43,926
Told you he's fun to tease.

47
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,053
You're right.

00:05:58,284 --> 00:05:59,860
What's going on?

51
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,439
It's nothing.

52
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:03,170
How could that be?

53
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,489
Is it about money?

54
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,134
If it's urgent, tell me.

55
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,712
Can't let the kids go hungry.

56
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,340
Don't worry. I can handle it.

57
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,164
Should I change my hairstyle a bit?

58
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:17,475
To which style?

59
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,266
Well...

60
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:20,682
Cut it a bit shorter?

61
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:23,459
Well...

62
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:30,144
Everything looks great on you.

63
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,348
Do what's comfortable for you.

64
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,837
You keep saying that,

65
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,668
and that's why I can't choose one.

66
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:43,919
The food's getting cold.

67
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,144
Go ahead and eat first.

68
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:27,194
Seongju!

69
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,773
What is it?

70
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:34,863
Isn't that a dog?

71
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:36,624
Yes.

72
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,139
Is it dead?

73
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,687
No, it's still alive.

74
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,423
Looks like someone abandoned it.

75
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:44,893
What? Here on the roadside?

76
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:47,800
When they get tired of raising them,

77
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:48,925
they often abandon them

78
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:49,957
like this on the roadside.

79
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,084
Let's go.

80
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:56,249
Hey, are we just going to

81
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,350
abandon it like this?

82
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,476
Are you going to take it and raise it?

83
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,367
Me?

84
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,276
Then put it in the car.

85
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:04,772
What?

86
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,066
I said put it in the car.

87
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:09,946
If you put it in the car,

88
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,171
what about you?

89
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:12,800
You won't ride with a dog, will you?

90
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,360
You can't even go near

91
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:15,587
a four-legged beast.

92
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,099
Plus,

93
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:19,493
You really hate dogs, right?

94
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,449
Aren't you the one who parked here?

95
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:24,601
Oh, I just wanted to check.

96
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,442
But why are you angry at me?

97
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,114
Did I tell you to let him in?

98
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,301
Put it in the car quickly.

99
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:33,051
Why must you be mean?

100
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,076
Hurry up.

(HA 1217)

105

Tom.

106
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:44,112
We're here, hold on a little longer.

107
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:55,901
Thank you.

Hello.

109
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,140
It's urgent.

110
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:01,795
Okay, don't worry.

(Check-up room)

112
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,488
What happened to you?

113
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:32,340
How was it?

114
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,747
Fortunately, you came quickly

115
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:34,999
I cleaned out its stomach,

116
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,069
it should be fine.

117
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:37,932
Lately,

118
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,905
people likes to use rat poison.

119
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,226
Yes, it seems like my Tom ate some rats.

120
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:43,823
That's why it got poisoned.

121
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,073
Thank you.

122
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,206
Just that?

123
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,328
Okay,

124
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:51,816
I'll treat you to Samgyeopsal.

125
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:52,889
Since it's come to this,

126
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:54,342
let's go with hanwoo sirloin.

127
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,400
Stop kidding around.

128
00:10:58,386 --> 00:10:59,434
How about

129
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,897
some cold beer with the Samgyeopsal?

130
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,566
- Sound good?
- Okay?

(JS Building)

132
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,430
Hello.

133
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:28,160
Uno,

134
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,828
Bong Joon-woo, the director,

135
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:31,807
will be here soon, you know?

136
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:33,565
He said this time, the movie is

137
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,979
being made as a global project and

138
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:36,151
we're planning to send it to

139
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:37,228
the Berlin Film Festival.

140
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:38,510
I asked him to put you in

141
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:39,932
for the male lead role.

142
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,924
Director Bong said he needs to

143
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,682
have a real-life meeting first.

144
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,622
Haa...

145
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,706
But why the sigh?

146
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,809
That male lead character

147
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,329
is a blind poet.

148
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,765
So?

149
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,072
I want to get the role somehow...

150
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,787
But director Bong said

151
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,822
your image is too cold.

152
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:07,877
Too cold?

153
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:10,521
That's why I

154
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,825
asked him to have a talk to you first.

155
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,442
Once we meet in person and talk,

156
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:15,803
he might see that our Uno

157
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,139
is a really warm guy.

158
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,874
Why tell such lies?

159
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:22,222
Well, I have to try my best, you see.

160
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:24,727
And the roles that keep coming in...

161
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,463
This is a new script for this time.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,713
This "Heartless special forces member".

163
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,032
This "Heartless sniper".

164
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,943
And this "Heartless cyborg".

165
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:35,851
It's a cyborg, it's naturally heartless.

166
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,242
Right. Because it's a machine,

167
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,458
it's heartless.

168
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,907
Anyway, Director Bong's film this time,

169
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:44,320
we have to get it

170
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,875
by any means necessary.

171
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,743
Honestly,

172
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:49,819
this work,

173
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,825
what's the real reason for accepting it?

174
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,303
We talked about it.

175
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,966
It's a global project.

176
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,132
Try to get the Best Actor award

177
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:58,288
at the Berlin Film Festival.

178
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,439
Your life will change drastically.

179
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,168
Yours or mine?

180
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,158
It will benefit both of us.

181
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:05,848
But above all,

182
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:08,016
this male lead is a poet, right?

183
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,289
He writes poems

184
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:14,009
for his loved one with his last breath.

185
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:16,669
If you do that, your image will

186
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:18,630
completely change, and it'll be amazing.

187
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,481
Then,

188
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,098
just give me the role.

189
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,505
I'm confident I can play the role.

190
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,501
Uno,

191
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:27,895
do you think such a guy really exists?

192
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,636
Someone that dedicates everything

193
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,523
solely for one beloved person.

194
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,501
I guess they must have existed

195
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:37,561
somewhere in the world.

196
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,920
A beautiful love.

197
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,185
Where in the world could such love be?

198
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:43,968
Yeah, I guess not.

199
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:45,333
Anyway,

200
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,685
when Director Bong comes later,

201
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,927
be as gentle as possible.

202
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,578
Here, look, like this.

203
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,287
Director,

204
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:53,888
this is a role

205
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,566
I've really wanted to try.

206
00:13:56,363 --> 00:13:57,729
If you give me a chance,

207
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,674
you won't regret it,

208
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:00,928
Director.

209
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,965
I can't do that. I'll leave.

210
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,327
No, no, no, no, no!

211
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:08,490
Sit down, sit down. Just stay still.

212
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,450
I'll talk to him myself.

213
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:12,170
You just need to smile,

214
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:13,664
Smile, you know?

215
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:14,689
Just smile.

216
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,953
Ugh...

217
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,408
Director Bong is here.

218
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,613
Hello. Please have a seat.

219
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,800
