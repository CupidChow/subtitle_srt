00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
Producer Lee.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,812
Aren't you going to report this?

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,272
I want to wait a little more.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,908
Wait for what?
It's clearly a problem!

6
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,904
Call the police.

7
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,322
Okay.

8
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,574
What about the broadcasting company?

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,583
I'll call them.

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,998
Look!

11
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,166
He's here.

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,133
It's Uno!

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,390
Oh!

14
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,813
Oh, he's here!

15
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,102
Are you okay?

16
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,604
Yes.

17
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,275
What happened to your leg, Hyung?
Is it serious?

18
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,443
I'm fine, don't worry.

19
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,944
Where was he?

20
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,362
At the mountain.

21
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,156
We couldn't make it down
because it was dark.

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
I didn't have my phone either.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,617
Oh.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,911
It was on the tool cart.

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,621
Thank you.

26
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,456
Was the camera operating properly?

27
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,509
It ran out of battery during the night.

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,672
Hey, shouldn't you be asking
about his wellness first?

29
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,633
Can't you see they're perfectly fine?

30
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,093
I have a job to do.

31
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,260
No, what I'm saying is-

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:41,393
This all happened because I was careless.

34
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:44,234
Let's go in and get you treated first.

35
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,279
Check the data first.

36
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,788
Okay.

37
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,176
He strained his muscles.

38
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,476
He'll be better in no time,

39
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,804
after applying some medicine and icing it.

40
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,683
You iced my ankle when I twisted it.

41
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,892
I was reminded of that.

42
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,853
Good job.

43
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,896
Are you hurt anywhere?

44
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,860
No, I'm fine.

45
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,236
Where are you going?

46
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,238
My room.

47
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,948
Should I assist you?

48
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,414
- It's fine.
- I'll do it.

49
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,967
Something happened between
you two last night, right?

50
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,926
Happen? Such as?

51
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,469
That look.

52
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,463
What about it?

53
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,133
It's been a while.

54
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,141
What has?

55
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,901
It's they way you looked at Chi Sub.

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,815
About Chi Sub,

57
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,441
I told you not to talk about him.

58
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,952
I hope you won't make the same mistake.

59
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,199
Why are you here?

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,368
I need to look for Deok Gu.

61
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,245
I'll look for him with Gi Min.

62
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,212
Get some rest.

63
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:11,142
I'm okay now.

64
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:12,961
At least, let me drive.

65
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,171
Fine, you can just drive then.

66
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,172
Okay?

67
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,598
Okay.

I can no longer reach you ♫

♫ when we were in love ♫

♫ Somebody to love ♫

74

Deok Gu.

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,272
♫ Somebody to love ♫

76
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,318
♫ A story about just you and me ♫

Good job, boy.

83
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,997
Thank you, Deok Gu.

84
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,641
Thank you so much.

85
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,509
Thank you for coming back, Deok Gu.

86
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,463
My gosh.

87
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,091
Gosh, no way.

88
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,134
I can't believe he's touching a dog.

89
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,761
How is that possible?

90
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,430
It's so touching.

91
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,691
What is this?

92
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,400
This won't bring in views.

93
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,272
The dog came back on its own. How boring.

94
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:42,276
Something worth shooting has to happen,

95
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,043
like Uno having to look
for the dog in crutches and getting lost.

96
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,881
I'm Reporter Na Cheon Su.

97
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,299
I know.

98
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,302
I heard you have a request?

99
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,382
I need you to write an article for me.

100
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,265
What's the level you're hoping for?

101
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,769
To the point that you can bury his career.

102
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,229
You better not fail.

103
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,261
Just trust me with the task.

104
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,898
Stop.

105
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,428
Stop.

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,972
Stop.

107
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,446
Will you be okay?

108
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,226
You even took off all your protective gear.

109
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,562
Don't you think you're moving too fast?

110
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,522
Have you forgotten?

111
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,358
I can even pet Deok Gu now.

112
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,526
I know that.

113
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,821
How's your ankle? Has it gotten better?

114
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,710
Well, I can walk now. See?

115
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,800
Are dogs royalty?

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,012
Hotel, cafe, and even a pool too.

117
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,597
Hey.

118
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,558
Didn't you say I shouldn't
make money off of dogs?

119
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,853
Yet you're doing the same
bloody thing, aren't you?

120
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,940
Leave now. If you don't, I'm not
responsible for what happens next.

121
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,941
Hey.

122
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,276
My farm is on the verge
of closing down because of your report.

123
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,694
Listen carefully.

124
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:54,450
Before it closes down, I'm going to kill
all the remaining dogs and hang them in front of your cafe.

125
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,168
Just a heads up.

126
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,306
Tae Seok.

127
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,684
Hurry up and clean up.

128
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,302
Aigoo.

129
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,649
I'm always done, Hyungnim.

130
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,468
What will you do about the dogs?

131
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,297
What else can I do?

132
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:32,396
I'll give them to someone else.

133
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,616
You're leaving
the dog farming business then?

134
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,893
I'll start again once it quietens downs.

135
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,016
Hey.

136
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:43,250
Nothing makes better money
than breeding dogs.

137
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,223
We just have to lie that they're purebred

138
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:48,004
and people will go nuts for them.

139
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,639
Why do people care about a dog's pedigree?

140
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,259
It's complete bullshit.

141
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,680
A dog's pedigree is more important than
a person's genealogy nowadays.

142
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,610
It makes money.

143
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,314
You little shit.

144
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,116
Why are you scared, you idiot?

145
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,286
Welcome.

146
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,569
I can't wait any longer.

147
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,078
He might really kill them all.

148
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,998
But those dogs are his private property.

149
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,459
Does that give him the right to kill them?

150
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,003
Do you know what he said today?

151
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,340
He said he's going to kill them all
before closing down his farm.

152
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,266
No way.

153
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,857
You know it too,

154
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,280
that he's capable of it.

155
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,489
- Good job.
- You too.

156
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,033
- Don't be late tomorrow.
- Okay.

157
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,119
Head straight home today.
You need to cut down on your drinking.

158
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,463
Gosh, don't worry.

159
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,706
I won't drink.

160
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,750
I'm going on a diet starting today.

161
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,710
As if a skunk could stop farting.

162
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,360
Right?

163
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,970
They're all gone.

164
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,563
Let's go.

165
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,207
What?

166
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,462
What are you doing?

167
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,131
Where are you two going?

168
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,170
Well...

169
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,925
The thing is...

170
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,393
It's not somewhere
you can accompany us.

171
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,898
I know you're going to the dog farm.

172
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,060
How did I know?

173
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,186
Did you forget that I'm an actor?

174
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,583
You two were giving out signals all evening.

175
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,107
I'd be dumb not to know.

176
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,193
You're right, but it can
be dangerous so stay put.

177
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,946
Did you forget that I'm an action star?

178
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,657
That's acting. It's all fake.

179
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,869
One has to be somewhat good
to be able to fake it.

180
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,164
I'm certain I'll be better than either of you.

181
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,062
You're a public figure.

182
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,209
You could get in trouble
if something goes wrong.

183
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,756
Why do you care?
It's my life.

184
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,383
Please let me go.

185
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,093
You better not blame us later.

186
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,136
Hyung!

187
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,055
What? He wants to go.
Let him come.

188
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,983
Having another ally is always good.

189
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,063
Will you really be okay?

190
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,694
Yes.

191
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,692
It's over there.

192
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,100
It's quiet.

193
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,041
Let's go.

194
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,486
What are these dogs?

195
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:10,872
He's breeding dogs illegally.

196
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:13,457
Illegally?

197
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,891
How?

198
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,608
He intentionally drugs them,

199
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,277
to get them to breed.

200
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:23,488
Then,

201
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,381
the mom will keep birthing pups
her entire life until she dies.

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,301
What about the puppies then?

203
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,839
He sells them.

204
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,645
Puppies are money makers.

205
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:41,437
Why is he hiding his farm?

206
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,861
He's probably trying to evade the police.

207
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,844
Those bastards.
