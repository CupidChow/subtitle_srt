Do you think this is your house? How can you just sneak in?

00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:09,661
Do you think this is your house? How can you just sneak in?

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:13,539
It's illegal to continue selling puppies
after your company has been terminated.

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,667
You know why our business got terminated.

6
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,655
I'm calling the police...If you don't release the dogs.

7
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,529
I'm calling the police...If you don't release the dogs.

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,255
Go for it! But you can't call the police.

9
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,032
Go for it! But you can't call the police.

10

Do you know why?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,098
I'm going to mince you all up and feed you to the dogs.

I think he's dancing.

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,930
I'm asking why the heck he is dancing right now!

18
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,087
Uno, what are you doing?

19
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,788
That's Wai Khru.

00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:13,225
Wai Khru? What's that?

00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:14,599
Wai Khru? What's that?

22
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,677
It's a ritual that Muay Thai athletes do before the match.

23
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:23,074
Like Uno said, he isn't just pretending to know martial arts.

24
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:28,921

I'm all right.

00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,116
I don't think you broke any bones.

34
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:14,736
But make sure to take an x-ray tomorrow, okay?

35
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,432
You are a doctor. If you say it's okay, then it'll be fine.

36
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm a vet.

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,669
A vet's a doctor too.

38
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:27,582
I would've gotten them all with my hands
if I weren't waiting for the police!

What's going on with you guys?

Are you all out of your minds?

42
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,262
It's all my fault.

43
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,650
I shouldn't have taken Uno with me.

44
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,086
How can you do such things
when you already know you shouldn't?

45
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:50,447
What if Uno sustained a more serious injury?

46
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,033
Then we can't air the show.
It'll be a huge loss!

47

Producer Lee, I'm okay.

48
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:59,539
Also, I'm the one who followed Dae Byeol.

49
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,208
It's not his fault.

50
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,625
Uno, you are a professional.

51
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,879
You have to act professionally.

52
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,089
Also, did you wear the camera vest?

53
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:10,985
How can you do such a thing without a camera?

54
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,178
Did you forget that we are filming a show?

56
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:21,369
We filmed with this as evidence. Would this be helpful?

Let me see.

58
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,658
If your actor decides to do something dangerous,

59
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,520
you should stop him, but instead,
you just watch him do it?

60
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,648
What would have happened
if the police didn't arrive on time?

61
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm the one who called the police.

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,362

Did you just call me Hyung?

72
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,345

How severe is Uno's injury?

84
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:23,092
I heard he just got some bruises.

85
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:26,279
It's unacceptable. Call the show and tell them he's quitting.

86
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,197
Chairman, I think it's better to let him

87
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:34,309
finish filming until the end of this show.

88
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,379
Why?

89
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,655
It's because it's about trust.

90
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,551
Even if Uno comes back to the company later on,

91
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,736
I think his image is crucial.

92
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,308
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

93
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,615
But when this show is over,

94
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,070
I'll let the world know that Uno is my son.

95
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,052
Until then, make sure to keep this a secret inside the company.

I've worked in the Entertainment department for ten years.

It's all thanks to you, Producer Lee.

We are talking about season 2 already.

And we want Uno to be in season 2 as well.

Above all, viewers are rooting a lot for Uno.

I think I need to ask Uno first about doing season 2.

I think Deok Gu's previous owner dumped him

If it had progressed that much,

181
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:20,300
even breathing would bring tremendous pain to Deok Gu.

182
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:27,461
What if we push the euthanasia until the end of the show?

183
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:31,328
It's too cruel for Deok Gu to wait until then.

184
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,458
Deok Gu needs to get euthanasia?

185
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,583
That can't happen!
