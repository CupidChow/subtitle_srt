♫ I can see you in myself ♫

188
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,149
Don't push yourself too much.

189
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,960
Take a break if you're tired.

190
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,299
All right.

191
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,528
♫ The promise you made ♫

192
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,883
♫ On the warm spring day ♫

193
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:40,471
♫ I can no longer keep it ♫

194
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:45,920
♫ Hug me, I want to stay with you all time ♫

195
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,412
♫ Somebody to love ♫

196
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:57,379
♫ A story about just you and me ♫

197
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,131
♫ Somebody to love.♫

198
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,428
♫ My memories have left me ♫

199
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,741
♫ You are now ♫

200
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:12,029
♫ Only a scenic memory ♫

201
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,248
♫ That's been left behind ♫

202
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:17,486
♫ Even when I close my eyes ♫

203
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:21,814
♫ I can no longer see you ♫

204
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:34,692
♫ I'm in between your arms ♫

205
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:39,249
♫ Somebody to love ♫

206
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:43,442
♫ A story about just you and me ♫

207
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:48,002
♫ Even when I close my eyes I can feel you ♫

208
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:52,001
♫ I do ♫

209
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:56,654
♫ Somebody to love ♫

210
00:14:56,654 --> 00:15:01,109
♫ A story about just you and me ♫

211
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:07,324
♫ Remember the memory that has left ♫

212
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,080
♫ Say no more love ♫

213
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,855
♫ It can no longer reach me ♫

214
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:29,745
♫ Somebody to love. I want to with you all time ♫
