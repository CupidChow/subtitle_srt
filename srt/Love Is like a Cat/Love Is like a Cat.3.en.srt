[Love Is Like A Cat]

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,188
Seong Joo.

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,107
Yes?

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,027
What kind of kid were you when you were young?

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,570
Me?

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,947
I was just an ordinary child.

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:35,285
I was average in my studies, sports, and height.

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,814
I hung out with my friends who were like me and played computer games.

9
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:42,776
I guess you can say,
I was a very ordinary kid.

10
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,296
I'm very jealous of that ordinary.

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,106
Did something happen?

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,984
Well...

13
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,348
What do you think if I do a variety show?

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,450
You on a variety show?

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,461
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:06,357
Just be honest with me.

17
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,609
Don't do it.

18
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,860
I'm not on board with it.

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,278
And the reason is?

20
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,807
You have your own unique mood and vibe.

21
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,868
Merciless?

22
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,329
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,955
It's an inhumane,

24
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,876
ruthless, icy, and full-of-yourself image.

25
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,252
Hey!

26
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,129
That's just your feeling, isn't it?

27
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,841
No, I'm not talking about your personality.

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,885
I'm saying that's your image.

29
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,171
Also, that's your charming point.

30
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:43,694
Wait, are you actually going to get on a variety show?

31
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,010
Why am I so bad at reading the room?

32
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,354
If there's no woman, what's the scandal?

33
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,131
Of course, they won't tell us.

34
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,591
It's a weapon they want to use when they need it.

35
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,898
Hello, we are from TV M.

36
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,733
TV M, the broadcasting station?

37
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,302
Yes, I'm Producer Lee Eun Yeong from TV M.

38
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:18,272
Since you applied to get on the show, we are here to scope out the location.

39
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,575
What do you mean I applied for the show?

40
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,579
You applied to be on the show "Dooby Dooby Job."

41
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,614
Give me one second.

42
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,905
- Gi Min.
- Yes, Boss?

43
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:36,424
There are people from the broadcast station.
Do you know what's going on?

44
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,118
Broadcast station?

45
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,969
Yes, they said it's a show called "Dooby Dooby Job."

46
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,554
Oh, I know that show!

47
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,724
That's a variety show where the celebrities work on other occupations.

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,769
Will our dog cafe also be on that show?

49
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,173
No, they said we applied for that show.

50
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,807
Maybe your roommate applied!

51
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,644
Jun Hyuk, seriously!

52
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,482
Hyung, you did this, right?

53
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,669
Hello, Mr. Lee. This is Nurse Yoon speaking.

54
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,796
Oh, can you put Jun Hyuk on the phone?

55
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,532
He's in an operation right now.

56
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:20,385
Is it something urgent?

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,513
He applied for me to be on a TV show
without my consent.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,956
A TV show?

59
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,849
Yes, it's called "Dooby Dooby" or something.

60
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,086
Apparently, he applied for my dog cafe
to be on that show.

61
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,480
He did it on his own without consulting with me!

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,224
Oh, no! How could he?

63
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:38,210
When does he get out of the surgery?

64
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,197
What should I do?

65
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:45,618
It seems like the operation will take a long, long time.

66
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,205
It's a very difficult surgery.

67
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,917
When he gets out of the operation, I'll tell him you called.

68
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,445
Please tell him that I'm furious and about to lose it.

69
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,950
What did he say? Did he apply?

70
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,678
Apparently, he's in an operation!
That's a total lie.

71
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,756
I also think your roommate is totally lying to you.

72
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,526
I think there is some misunderstanding.

73
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,569
Misunderstanding?

74
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,070
Yes, we never applied to be on that show.

75
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,555
Really?

76
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,365
Then, who's Lee Dae Byeol?

77
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,284
Sorry?

78
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,410
That's our Boss's name, who's right here.

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,895
Are you Mr. Lee Dae Byeol?

80
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,913
Yes, that is my name, but...

81
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,500
Look over here at the applicant's name.
It says Lee Dae Byeol, right?

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,544
So you did apply for the show.

83
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,255
I'm saying that is my name.

84
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,507
But I didn't apply for it.

85
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:46,687
Anyway, I never applied for this show.
So I'm sorry, but please leave.

86
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,100
Excuse me, sir, but we are busy people.

87
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,977
If you made this application as a joke,

88
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,556
we can ask for compensation through our legal team.

89
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,566
Compensation?

90
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,694
I think it's better for you to check again first.

91
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,749
We'll check again on our side first.

92
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,258
- I'll be back.
- See you later!

93
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,297
I'm sorry, but our boss is a bit shy.

94
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:19,253
There'll be no problem filming in this space, right?

95
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,632
By the way, I'm Oh Gi Min, and I'm a part-timer here.

96
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,409
Also, I'm an aspiring actor.

97
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,896
Action acting.

98
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,466
Teary acting.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,672
Method acting, I'm confident in all of them.

100
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,608
Even if I become a big shot,
if you call me in any variety shows,

101
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,027
I'll always get on the show.

102
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,279
We don't have time for this.

103
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,848
Okay, please follow me this way.

104
00:06:56,332 --> 00:07:00,169
Others are desperate to be on the show.

105
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,032
Can't you just be on the show for my sake?

106
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,225
I beg for you. Please?

107
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,264
Are you really going to be like this?

108
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,408
Then, the scandal.

109
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:17,061
What are you going to do about that?

110
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,212
It doesn't matter.

111
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:21,131
How does it not matter? It's a scandal.

112
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,494
Once a scandal breaks out, it can end a celebrity's life!

113
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:29,122
If it breaks out, I'll take responsibility.

114
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,645
Uno, let's just do this one variety show, okay?

115
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:38,125
Then, we don't have to worry about
your scandal, you can change your image,

116
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,475
and I don't have to worry anymore.

117
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,087
No is no.

118
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,414
Please turn down that variety show.

119
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,754
Shall we go home?

120
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,944
I have a place I want to stop by.

121
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,405
Welcome.

122
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,182
"Welcome?"

123
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,642
Yes, welcome.

124
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,505
What are you scheming now?

125
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,839
I applied for the variety show.

126
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,216
Why?

127
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,635
I'm asking why did you apply?

128
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,345
For the money.

129
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,097
I'm the one who's making the money.

130
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:39,460
The problem is you are spending more than you are making.

131
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,312
I can take care of that on my own.

132
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,981
Oh, can you?

133
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,593
The rent, the management fee, and the labor cost.

134
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,822
You also bring in every stray dog you ever see.

135
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,225
And you say you can take care of that.

136
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:58,162
So, are you saying I should ignore the stray dogs?

137
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,106
When did I say to ignore them?

138
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:06,837
I'm saying if you want to take care of them,
you should make money doing something else.

139
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,748
I don't want to make money by showcasing my babies.

140
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,262
They are poor little things who got abandoned.

141
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:18,140
Hey, I took out my house deposit to invest in you.

142
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm a shareholder of your dog cafe.

143
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,232
So, are you wielding your power on me?

144
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,009
Yes, I am.

145
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,880
Who brought in this doggy?

146
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,782
Someone I don't know.

147
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:55,620
The person who brought him already paid for the whole treatment.

148
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,599
Whoever the person is, they did a good deed.

149
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:02,152
By the way, I take back what I said
about the shareholder and stuff.

150
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,895
You are a shareholder.

151
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,897
You didn't say anything wrong.

152
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,960
I didn't mean to boast.

153
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,160
What's happening to him now?

154
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,997
The person who saved him said he couldn't raise him.

155
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,461
It won't be easy for him to get adopted since he's old.

156
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,939
You are not thinking what I'm thinking, right?

157
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,688
You can't do that.

158
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:37,370
You can't adopt any more stray dogs.

159
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,598
- Let's make this the last case.
- Think about your financial situation.

160
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:45,118
You know what will happen to him if he doesn't get adopted.

161
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,788
He'll get euthanasia.

162
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,193
You can't let that happen to him either, can you?

163
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,503
How can you do that?

164
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,565
Let's get him adopted first.

165
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:06,123
There's something that people say.

166
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,484
Everyone's born with something to eat.

167
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,396
Don't worry.

168
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:13,815
I won't make you starve.

169
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,897
Good boy.

170
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:20,162
Your name is Deok Gu now.

171
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:24,106
Deok Gu. Do you like it?

172
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,460
Let's go home.

173
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:49,375
Can you just check if he's doing okay?

174
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,403
They asked if we were going to take him.

175
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,880
So I told them we couldn't adopt him.

176
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,558
Then what will happen to him?

177
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:01,504
They'll probably send him to an animal shelter.

178
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:04,540
Do they look for someone to adopt them there?

179
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,726
Yes, usually, that's how it works.

180
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,185
But...

181
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,356
If he doesn't get adopted in ten days
after going to the shelter...

182
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,066
Then what happens?

183
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,651
They get euthanised.

184
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,219
Euthanised? So, they'll kill them?

185
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,670
Yes.

186
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:27,696
- I'll be back.
- Wait.

187
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,202
- Seong Joo.
- Yes?

188
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,989
Don't you want to raise the dog?

189
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,398
Me?

190
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,553
You know that I'm still living in my parents' house.

191
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,154
My parents have a weak respiratory system.

192
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:47,248
If I bring a dog with me, they will kick me out immediately.

193
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,837
Is there anybody who will adopt him?

194
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,059
I'm not sure.

195
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,758
I can't really think of anyone.

196
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:58,235
Besides CEO Choi...

197
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,836
Yes, our CEO!

198
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,074
Okay.

199
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,341
What is it?

200
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,552
I have a favor to ask.

201
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,329
Can you take care of just one dog?

202
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,765
Did I not tell you I have a dog fur allergy?

203
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,867
Also, I don't want to do you a favor.

204
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:34,271
Come on! Are you really going to come out like this?

205
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,133
Yes. You also didn't accept the variety show that I asked you to go on.

206
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,009
I'll get on the show.

207
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,286
It's fine. I don't need it-- What?!

208
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:43,538
What did you just say now?

209
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,450
I'll get on that variety show.

210
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,078
Are you sure? Are you really getting on that show?

211
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,071
Yes, I'll do it.

212
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,941
Uno, I love you.

213
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,820
You are really my brother.

214
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,587
I do love you, Uno.

215
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,049
I don't know about love, but it's only under one condition.

216
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,471
What will be that condition?

217
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,345
The dog I talked about earlier,

218
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,850
you have to take care of him until the end.

219
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,031
If you send him to another place,

220
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,254
you know what's going to happen, right?

221
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,340
Okay, don't worry! I'll take care of him forever.

222
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,569
But you also promised me. You can't change your words, okay?

223
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,555
All right.

224
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,340
Okay!

225
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,787
You heard it, right?

226
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,909
Tell them we'll adopt the dog.

227
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:38,886
Are you really going to get on a variety show?

228
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:42,180
I promised already, so go tell them.

229
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,949
Hurry up.

230
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,420
Hurry!

231
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:57,875
♫ It's okay to open up my heart ♫

232
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,645
♫ It may be clumsy,

233
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:04,250
but my heart that was closed ♫

234
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,120
♫ is opening up to you ♫

235
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,930
♫ Slowly step-by-step ♫

236
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,890
♫ I'll go towards you ♫

♫ I'll come to your side step by step ♫

238
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:30,440
♫ What a feeling, open in your side ♫

239
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,170
♫ I can feel it ♫

240
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,740
♫ Open in your side ♫

241
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,660
♫ This might be love ♫

242
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,550
♫ Just like a cat ♫

243
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:53,480
♫ I like that I'm by your side ♫

244
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,700
♫ There must be a galaxy of our own ♫

245
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,474
♫ The one that we dreamt of ♫

246
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,200
♫ No matter what others say, ♫

247
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,398
♫ I'll come with you ♫

248
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:29,146
♫ What a feeling, open in your side ♫
