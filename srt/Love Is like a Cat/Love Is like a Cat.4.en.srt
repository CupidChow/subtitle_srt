[Love Is Like A Cat]

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,426
Hello, I recently dropped off a stray dog with you.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,761
Oh, yes. Hello.

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,114
You should be proud of your kind deed.

5
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:18,810
We're thinking of adopting the dog.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,828
Oh, is that so?

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,732
What's going on?

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,360
It's about the dog Mr. Lee took.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,487
I thought you said
you weren't going to adopt the dog?

10
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,824
Yes, but things have changed.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,617
Oh...

12
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,619
The dog is no longer here.

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,304
What do you mean?

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,834
Hyung.

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,669
The dog got adopted.

16
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,630
What? "Adopted"?

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,953
Yes. But the dog went to an adoption center,

18
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,427
so we can adopt if we want to.

19
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:58,099
Forget it, as long as the dog was taken. That's enough.

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,785
Right? That's good.

21
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,396
What about the variety show?

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,039
Cancel it.

23
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,042
Hold on.

24
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,581
"Hello, Mr. Uno. I'm Producer Lee Eun Yeong from 'Dooby Dooby Job'".

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,043
"Thank you for agreeing to star in our show."

26
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,755
"I hope to meet you soon to discuss the program."

27
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,132
"Thank you again."

28
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,025
Producer Lee?

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,847
Uno agreed to doing the show.

30
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,641
Yes, I'm telling you.

31
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,017
Don't worry about anything.

32
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,061
He seems very determined.

33
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,814
He's growling about how he'll eat up the show.

34
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,498
Growl.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,610
Yes, okay. Gosh, all right.

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,419
Okay then.

37
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,090
Pi Uno.

38
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,971
Okay, perfect.

39
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,875
He told her already.

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,002
He sure did.

41
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,979
I should still cancel, right?

42
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,565
I'll do it.

43
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,676
Pardon?

44
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,219
Do what?

45
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,679
The variety show?

46
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,180
Seriously?

47
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,142
I already gave my word.

48
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,144
But, still...

49
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,413
I'm glad the dog got adopted.

50
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,778
Tell the program you won't be lending them the space.

51
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,363
I won't do that.

52
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,587
Hyung, I may not hit animals,

53
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,577
but I can hit humans.

54
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,829
You can just view me as an animal then.

55
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,748
Shall I be a cat? Meow.

56
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,749
Or a hamster? Squeak.

57
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,834
Or a parrot?

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,478
Squawk, squawk.

59
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,924
"Squawk?"

60
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,342
What is that?

61
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,011
You're ridiculous.

62
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,554
Am I not sexy?

63
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,639
No, you're not.

64
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,224
Think about it, Hyung.

65
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:07,770
Our animals will get stressed
if the program's staff keeps coming by.

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,441
Also, having a celebrity here
will only disturb our work.

67
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,319
Do you know how much the daily rental rate is?

68
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,045
I'm not interested.

69
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,131
It's 500,000.

70
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,845
A month would mean 50 times 30,
which totals to 15,000,000 won.

71
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,499
Think of it this way, Dae Byeol.

72
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,418
If you just put up for a month,

73
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,005
our cafe will earn more,
making it easier to operate.

74
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:38,927
Which also means,
you can give Deok Gu a better life.

75
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,971
So let's just put up with it for one month.

76
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,656
Okay?

77
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,205
I promised her that you'll raise a dog.

78
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,358
You didn't change your mind, did you?

79
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,443
Right?

80
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,545
I told you I will.

81
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,976
You know this, yes?
It's a simultaneous interpreter.

82
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,130
We use this a lot now
due to foreign celebrities.

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,634
You'll be wearing this on our show too.

84
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,178
Language won't be an issue.

85
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,430
I understand.

86
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,365
Let's finalize the contract.

87
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,339
Pi Uno.

88
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,030
Thank you for coming on our show.
We'll repay you with a good program.

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,535
Could you give us a moment, please?

90
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,803
Oh, all right.

91
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,528
I was told you know something about me.

92
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,239
I don't want anyone to know about my past.

93
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,049
I understand. Don't worry.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,427
I'm a woman of my word.

95
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,839
Sir, look.

96
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,215
What?

97
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,593
Remember how staff
from a program recently came by?

98
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,136
"Dooby Dooby Job".

99
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,220
What about it?

100
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,015
An article just came out
about Pi Uno starring on that show.

101
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,058
Pi Uno?

102
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,936
He's a famous actor
in both Korea and Thailand.

103
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,731
There's talk that one of his parents is Korean.

104
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,026
But nothing's been revealed,
so he's a mysterious actor.

105
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,252
I hope Pi Uno would come here.

106
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,679
Back up. Go on!

107
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,956
How would he come here?

108
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,000
You'll never know.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,419
The guests choose where they'll work.

110
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,132
Who knows, Pi Uno might pick our dog cafe.

111
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,276
This will truly become my dream job then.

112
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,738
Wake up.

113
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,527
Is it true that Uno will be on a variety show?

114
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,655
According to the article, it seems confirmed.

115
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,365
A variety show?

116
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,410
Do you think Uno would do well, Section Manager Pi?

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,580
Considering his personally,
I think it's going to be tough.

118
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,598
I think so too.

119
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,796
Also, Uno's image might be tarnished
if our relationship comes to light.

120
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,425
I think it's best you just sit back and watch for now.

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,110
You should take your time in meeting him.

122
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,196
Right.

123
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,783
I was being too selfish.

124
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,840
Kids!

125
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,540
Slowly.

126
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,776
Off you go! Okay.

127
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,221
How fun!

128
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:29,331
Okay, let's go!

129
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,920
It's been 20 days
since he started working at the day care.

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,280
Oh Myeong Dal is a professional
at taking care of kids now.

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,080
He now knows better than anyone

132
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,092
about what the kids need and what they have to eat.

133
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,903
- Are you okay?
- The problem is his stamina.

134
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,264
That's a piece of cake.

135
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,350
You might go on a deep-sea fishing vessel.

136
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,518
Or?

137
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,646
One celebrity even went to an Antarctic base.

138
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,441
An Antarctic base? Why?

139
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,584
To feed penguins.

140
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,404
You're saying, whatever I pick,

141
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:18,081
I need to go and work there?

142
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,018
Yes. You must do your best for a month.

143
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,340
I hope I'll pick something like
selling noodles in Thailand.

144
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,983
Gosh, that'll be no fun.

145
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,601
The manager doesn't need to go work too?

146
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:41,496
My job is to quietly watch on.

147
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,550
- You should try.
- Hurry up!

148
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,908
Hello, everyone!
Celebrities trying a job for one month.

149
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,743
"Dooby Dooby Job"!

150
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,247
We have Mr. Pi Uno joining us today.

151
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,974
Please come on out, Mr. Pi.

152
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,481
All right.

153
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:16,931
Gosh, it feels like a dream
getting to see the biggest star right now.

154
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,059
- Yes, this is why I love my job.
- Same here.

155
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,352
- That's right.
- Yes.

156
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,288
Please say hello to our audience.

157
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,526
My name is Pi Uno.

158
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,045
I'll give my very best.

159
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,366
Well, okay.

160
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,536
- He just cut straight to the point.
- He sure did.

161
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:43,499
What motivated you to come on our show?

162
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,477
I plan to be completely genuine.

163
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,483
"Genuine..."

164
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,638
- That's very important.
- Yes, it is.

165
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,473
- It's his first time on a variety show.
- Right.

166
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,142
- I think he's very nervous.
- Yes.

167
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,645
Let's jump straight to picking the job then.

168
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:09,275
Is there a job you want?

169
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:14,447
I'd prefer something related to cooking or cars.

170
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,116
Both would be fantastic options.

171
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,242
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

172
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,871
On the flip side,
is there something you'd like to avoid?

173
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm not a fan of animals,
so I'd like to avoid that.

174
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,963
Oh, I see.

175
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,343
But the god of variety shows
always gives people the option

176
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,971
- that they want to avoid.
- Exactly.

177
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:43,684
I'm curious to find out
what the god of variety shows has in mind.

178
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:48,606
What will you do
if you happen to pick an animal-related job?

179
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:53,986
Well, I'll be genuine and do my very best.

180
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,947
Oh, genuine...

181
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,549

It's the moment of truth now.

185
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,941
Could you come closer to the wheel?

186
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,096
There are many options.

187
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,347
That's right.

188
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:26,268

00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:58,968
- My gosh! "Helping out at a dog cafe".
- "Helping out at a dog cafe"!

196
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,803
Congratulations!

197
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:05,099
Mr. Pi Uno, the man who suffered
a traumatic incident involving animals,

198
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,729
has been chosen to help out at a dog cafe.

199
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,789
How are you feeling?

200
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:20,589
Well, I'll be genuine and do my best.

201
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,411
Are you okay, Mr. P-Pi Uno?

202
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,163
Try to breath.

203
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,998
Yes.

204
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,974
Genuinely.

205
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:39,092
Will Mr. Pi Uno do a good job
working at a dog cafe for a month?

206
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:43,095
I'm so curious and excited.

207
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:48,601
We're worried and excited,
plus female fans' hearts are fluttering.

208
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,144
- That's right.
- Yes.

209
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,105
The place that Mr. Pi Uno chose today is

210
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,375
a dog cafe!

211
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,371
Are you okay, Hyung?

212
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,749
What do you think?

213
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,728
There were 20 options and I chose the dog cafe.

214
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:22,009
Who knew I had such terrible luck?

215
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,428
I'm sure there's a way.

216
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,196
Like what?

217
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,141
The boss will figure something out.

218
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,951
So lighten up!

219
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,747
I'm totally screwed!

220
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,375
Calm down, Hyung!

221
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,949
It's not because Uno doesn't want to do it.

222
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,076
He's traumatized by animals.

223
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,247
I understand,
but this is a promise to the viewers.

224
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,834
I know, which is why I'm begging you.

225
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,503
Please let him spin the wheel again.

226
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,589
No, that's not fair.

227
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,384
What if there's an accident
because of his trauma?

228
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,886
He might end up overcoming it.

229
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,514
I'm sure the viewers would love to see that.

230
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,432
That's if things go well.

231
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,435
- If something bad happens-
- It's okay, I can do it.

232
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,744
What?

233
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,166
What she said is true.

234
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
I'll do it.

235
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,170
He's saying he'll do it, right?

236
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,740
I expected nothing less from you.

237
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,742
That's a wonderful mindset.

238
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,161
I did a great job casting you.

239
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,747
We'll be going as planned then.

240
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,417
Look, Producer Lee.

241
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,060
- Producer Lee!
- That's enough.

242
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,382
What if something bad happens?

243
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,427
It's fine. I'll have to train myself.

244
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,069
Train?
