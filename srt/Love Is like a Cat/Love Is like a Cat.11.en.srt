Is today Deok Gu's birthday?

00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,900
Deok Gu's sick.

00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:21,021
What? Deok Gu's sick?

I wanted to treat you better.

I'm so sorry, Deok Gu.

00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,076
Deok Gu must be thankful to you.

Thank you for coming back.

It's time for us to let him go.

We are only prolonging Deok Gu's pain.

Farewell, Deok Gu.

When the time comes,

35
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,827
for me to go the heavens,

36
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:34,105

I know!

42
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,392
I feel bad for Deok Gu,

43
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:20,526
and I feel bad for Uno, too.

44
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:25,598
That was filmed after 9 PM.

45
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,133
Didn't they say they won't roll the cameras after 9?

46
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,951
They obviously knew,

47
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,295
about Deok Gu's euthanasia.

48
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,180
And they waited to film it.

49
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,545
Producer Lee!

50
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:53,064
Producer Lee!

51
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,821
What's up with the episode that's airing right now?

52
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,382
Uno, it's not 9 PM yet.

53
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,509
You shouldn't be coming over here right now.

54
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,980
That's not the issue.

55
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,264
You guys filmed after 9 PM.

56
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,611
That's because...

57
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:10,773
it was worthy enough material to broadcast.

58
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,649
Are you saying,

59
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,717
Deok Gu's death is worthy material?

60
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,736
Is Deok Gu's death an attraction?

61
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,487
I didn't say it that way.

62
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,656
It's all for the show and you.

63
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,974
Look at the viewership ratings!

64
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,243
Did you say it's for me?

65
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,977
Who decided that?

66
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,547
Did you think I would be happy if the ratings
went up by showing Deok Gu's death?

67
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,471
Listen,

68
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:37,310
I can't work on this show anymore.

69
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,738
Oh, really? You can't?

70
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,785
It's not going to be fun for all of us.

71
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:45,954
Did you forget about your scandal?

72
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,930
Think wisely, Uno.

73
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,683
If you come out like this, I won't just stay quiet.

74
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,520
You said you know about my scandal, right?

75
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,918
I wanted to keep it quiet about my father,

76
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,482
not because of who he is,

77
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,321
but because I didn't want people to gossip about my mother!

78
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,615
A poor Thai woman seduced a wealthy Korean man.

79
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,492
People will gossip like that and exaggerate things!

80
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:12,289
- But...
- A scandal?

81
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,291
I don't care a thing about my scandal.

82
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,251
Write an article, or do whatever you want to do about it.

83
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,728
I'm not doing this show anymore.

84
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,422
You guys...

85
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:26,502
Get out of here right now.

86
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,138
Where should we head to?

87
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,764
Just start the car.

88
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,224
Okay.

89
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,131
How have you been?

90
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,423
People think I decided to do a
variety show to change my image.

91
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,045
But I might have decided to do it because of you.

92
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,355
When I first met you in front of the vet,

93
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,555
I saw how much you love animals and kids
and thought why I couldn't be like you.

94
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,780
And when I came here and reunited with you,

95
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,603
I thought maybe this coincidence might be destiny.

96
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,905
Through the time I was here,

97
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:31,014
I learned from you to love animals and other people.

98
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,835
But when I saw that the TV show was using

99
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,849
Deok Gu's death for more viewership,

100
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,034
I felt bad for you and couldn't bear it.

101
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,799
I'm sorry,

102
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:55,000
that I left without a proper apology to you.

103
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,257
The reason why I love animals more than people is...

104
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:14,280
like self-defense for me not to get hurt by other people.

105
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,362
I had a crush on a school senior when I was young.

106
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:25,167
I confessed my feelings to him after a long thought.

107
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,644
And he loved my songs...

108
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:31,031
and me.

109
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,511
We loved each other with everything.

110
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,222
Please don't go.

111
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:39,767
This is the best for all of us.

112
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,451
Please,

113
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,006
Chi Sub...

114
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,529
I beg you.

115
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,763
Goodbye.

116
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,750
Hyung, I love you.

117
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,793
I can't let you go like this.

118
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,478
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,794
But when our relationship got revealed to others,

120
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:18,443
he left to go abroad

121
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:21,623
without any hesitation.

122
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,065
After that time,

123
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:29,764
I was afraid to love anybody...

124
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,486
and I was afraid to sing.

125
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:51,332
I had no idea.

126
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,994
I didn't know...

127
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:02,115
that you had such a deep wound.

128
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,984
I've liked you...

129
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,835
Since the moment when I first met you.

130
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,518
I've loved you...

131
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,564
From the moment when I first met you.
