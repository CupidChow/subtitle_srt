00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:36,851
Hello.

4
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:37,989
It's me.

5
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,869
Come meet me today.

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,798
I know you

7
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,571
understand Korean perfectly well.

8
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,647
Listen carefully.

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,744
If you avoid me again today,

10
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:54,016
I'll reveal everything about you.

11
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,188
Got it?

12
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,492
Yeah, I'll go.

13
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:00,601
I'll send someone to pick you up.

14
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,157
No need.

15
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:17,162
Do you think he'll come?

16
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,454
If he said he's coming, he'll come.

17
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,788
I hope he does.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,174
Let's go.

19
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,927
Seems like you're enjoying it.

20
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,576
- Iced Americano.
- Double shot.

21
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:17,741

Thank you.

Hey, I'm going to see Tom later.

29
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,905
He's so carefree even though he

30
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,757
doesn't have money for medical expenses.

31
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:16,919
- The key.
- Yes?

- The key?
- Yeah.

33

- Where are you going?
- Well...

34
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:22,404
Just personal business, I'll go alone.

35
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,526
Ah, still, I can drive you.

36
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,795
The car is big too.

37
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,259
No need. Just give me the key.

38

I can go alone. You just rest.

But still...

40
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,777
- Oh.
- Right?

41
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:39,355
- As expected, you want me to drive.
- That dog.

42
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:40,662
Yes?

43
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,748

Shall we go together?

46
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,531
No, just send me the location.

47
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,650
Just send it to me.

Oh my, how handsome.

50
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,109
Even the sight of him getting off

51
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,351
with a tumbler is sexy.

52
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,975

Seriously,

56
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:21,078
were we so sinful in our past life?

58
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:37,916
You're here, Director.

59
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:39,504
Yes. Have a good day.

60
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,990
Shall I get you a tea?

61

You look a lot like Mom.

83
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:10,964
resented me a lot, huh?

That I

85
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,990
- broke up with your mother...
- You guys dated?

86
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,688
I don't think so.

87
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,208
You see my mother as a toy, right?

88

When you're done playing,

89
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,219
you threw her away.

90
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:23,598
You didn't take any responsibility.

91
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,881
That's absolutely not true.

92
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,403
- I...
- Do you know

93
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,009
how much my mother waited for you?

94
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,749
How much she missed you?

95
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,345
How much she cried because of you?

96
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:38,875
My mother

97
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,497
waited for you until her last breath.

98
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:42,797
Were you even aware?

99
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,052
At that time, I had no choice.

100
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,591
When I returned to Korea,

101
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:52,223
I discovered mom was

102
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,166
diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

103
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,325
I couldn't possibly go to Thailand

104
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,419
in that situation.

105
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,418

108
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:09,691
for a few months,

109
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:11,449
I returned to Chiang Mai,

110
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,282
but you two weren't there.

111
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,412
I heard from neighbors that

112
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:18,483
you two went to Bangkok,

113
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:19,708
so I went to Bangkok,

114
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,874
but I couldn't find you two.

115
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:24,581
Lies.

116
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,185
I don't believe it.

117
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,122
Can you

118
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,439
give me some time, please?

119
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:41,996
What time?

120
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,773
Time for me to tell you the truth.

121
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:46,228
I don't need it anymore!

122
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,844
The reason I came here today is...

123
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:51,548
I don't want to have

124
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,609
any relationship with you.

125
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,885
I just want to see

126
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,765
the kind of person who abandoned Mom!

127
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,430
Uno!

128
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:00,655
No matter what anyone says,

129
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,800
you're my son.

130
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:03,858
Now as your father,

131
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:04,986
I'll take care of you.

132
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,240
I'm not a kid anymore!

133
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,121
I don't need a father like you!

00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,487

Sorry, I don't watch variety shows much.

139
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,714
It hasn't been long since it started,

140
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,052
so it hasn't become very popular.

141
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,244
Ah, I see.

142
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,286
Let me get straight to the point.

143
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,587
We want to cast Mr. Pi Uno in our show.

144
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:43,915
What do you think?

145
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,418
Uno?

146
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:47,392
- A variety show?
- Why?

147
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,229
Do you think it was a new program,

148
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:50,690
so you didn't want to come?

149
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,279
No, no, it's not that.

150
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,095
Can our Uno handle variety shows?

151
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
He's so introverted.

152
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:03,124
His image also doesn't seem
suited to variety shows.

153
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,309
We'll handle the image issue ourselves.

154
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:07,425
If Uno appears on a variety show,

155
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,917
he'll have more Korean fans.

156
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,552
Uno won't lose anything,

157
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:12,320
and his image will improve.

158
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,008
Ah, but...

159
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:16,580
People may not like it.

160
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,459
It's enough to be good at acting.

161
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,909
No need to be good at variety shows.

162
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:21,317
Are you refusing?

163
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,872
No, no, it's not that.

164
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,251
I would like to ask Uno's opinion first.

165
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:26,759
If I have

166
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:30,025
a card that Uno cannot refuse,

167
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,278
what will you do?

168
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:33,103

Move, I said move!

175
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:06,270
Step back!

176
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:08,602
Little one, please step back!

177

Don't come closer!

No!

182
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:19,766
May I hold it?

183
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,059
There, there, it's okay.

184
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,683
It's okay.

185
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:29,705
You must be really shocked, right?

186
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,293
It's okay.

187
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:38,114
It feels better now.

00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,895
There's none that doesn't bite.

192
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,703
What's going on?

193
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,175
That person seems to be afraid of dogs.

194
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
So, I...

195
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,258
That guy.

196
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:14,781
Where have I seen that face before?

197
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:15,953
You saw him?

198
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:16,953
Where?

199
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,345
Is he a singer?

200
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:20,495
An idol?

201
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,584
He used to be an idol,

202
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:22,772
but now he's an actor.

203
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,855
He does look popular.

204
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,831
And why is he here?

205
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,128
Could he be here to adopt a puppy?

206
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,507
Right.

207
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,089
These days, it's a trend among

208
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,914
entertainers to adopt dogs.

209
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,208
So what if he's a popular entertainer?

210
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,980
Are entertainers allowed to

211
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:41,996
abuse animals?

212
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:45,383
How's Tom?

213
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:46,648
It's alright now.

214
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:47,656
You can take him home.

215
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,891
Thank you, brother.

216
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:09,593
Uno!

217
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:10,665
No matter what anyone says,

218
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:11,541
you're my son.

219
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:12,610
Now as your father,

220
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:13,852
I'll take care of you.

221
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,740
Mom...

222
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:21,840
Please don't look at me like that.

223
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,429
I can't forgive that person.

224
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,201
I can never forgive someone like him.

225
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,673
I met Director Bong,

226
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,049
He said the lead role's image

227
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,260
doesn't match yours.

228
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,026
Actually, it's fine.

229
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,693
I didn't expect much.

230
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,648
Yeah.

231
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:52,211
Then...

232
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,959
How about trying something different?

233
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,478
Something different?

234
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,380
Do you want to try variety shows?

235
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,631
Variety shows?

236
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,193
You know variety shows are

237
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,654
trending these days, right?

238
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:05,302
No, I don't like it.

239
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:08,191
It's a new variety show,

240
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:09,853
called "Doobi Doobi Jab".

241
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:11,748
The PD in charge came to me personally,

242
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,187
saying she wants you to appear.

243
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,243
No, I don't like it.

244
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:17,269
I know.

245
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,750
I told her so.

246
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:22,357
But the PD

247
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,845
said some strange things.

248
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,199
Strange things? What did she say?

249
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,696
She said you must appear on the show,

250
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,613
or you'll be in trouble.

251
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,330
Trouble?

252
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,746
Rumors.

253
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,595
She said she would spread rumors.

254
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,837
Rumors?

255
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,173
Uno, do you happen to have a girlfriend?

256
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:45,955
No, there's none.

257
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,608
No, the PD mentioned a rumor.

258
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,766
Yeah, I thought so.

259
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:54,492
You wouldn't have one.

260
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:57,726
If it's not about a girl, then what?

261
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:01,525
If you're curious, ask her yourself.

262
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,733
Do you think she'll tell me?

263
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,627
It's a weapon used to threaten others.

264
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,409
And...

265
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:10,602
What does the PD want?

266
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,304
To appear on a variety show.

267
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:13,862
She wants to use you

268
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,534
to boost the ratings of her show.

269
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:18,375
Then... I yield.

270
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,961
She won't spread rumors.
