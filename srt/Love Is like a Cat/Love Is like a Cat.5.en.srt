If the cafe gets selected, it's all good.

00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,938
It'll be good for the dog cafe's promotion.

What's that?

50
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:43,980
It means they will sponsor an unlimited
amount of doggy food, snacks, and supplies.

Why?

52
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,622
It's for indirect advertising.

53
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,736
The sponsorship is under the condition
of getting exposure on the show.

00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:39,925
but if the viewers are not into it,
you'll get the penalty.

182
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,927
Wow, it really feels like a variety show!

183
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,496
It really is a variety show.

184
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:54,857
What are you doing?

185
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,734
Don't you know me?

186
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,085
Sorry?

187
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,114
Forget about it.

188
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,451
There is only one thing to keep in mind here.

189
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,574
Humans for animals,

190
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:09,663
and animals for humans.

191
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,610
If you harm animals in any way,

192
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,534
you will get kicked out of here immediately.

193
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,389
Well, we should introduce ourselves for the prize!

194
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,926
I'm not doing it.

195
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,869
Why won't you when there's a prize?

196
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,579
It could be supplies of dog food.

197
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,364
I'll go first!

198
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,590
Hello, I'm 21 years old, a part-timer in this dog cafe, Oh Gi Min.

199
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,069
I'm an aspiring actor and want to become a great actor.

200
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,856
I'm Min Jun Hyuk, 28 years old.

201
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:06,180
I'm a veterinarian, and my affiliation is...

202
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,240
in your heart.

203
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,664
I'm Lee Dae Byeol.

204
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,333
25 years old.

205
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,144
I'm currently running this dog cafe.

206
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,514
A special talent to show...

207
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,389
I'll try to do an impression.

208
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,716
First, it's Actor Lee Jung Jae.

209
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:58,044
"Didn't your joke go too far?"

210
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:08,281
Next, I'll do an impression of Actress Kim Hye Soo.

211
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,797
"Stop right there!"

212
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:16,365
"I can shoot you!"

213
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,280
Hello, everyone.

214
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,469
I'm Pi Uno.

215
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,936

216

and I currently work in Thailand and Korea.

217
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:50,335
I'll do my best to work hard

218
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:54,319
and make the most of my time here.

219
00:15:54,996 --> 00:16:00,442
And I'll sing for a little bit.

220
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:10,819

It's a great start.

228
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:49,963
♫ Can I open up your heart? ♫

229
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:56,518

230
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,628
