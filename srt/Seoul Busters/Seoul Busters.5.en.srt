I'm not sure
if this is related to the case, but…

00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,147
We only need information
relevant to the case.

Any information would be helpful.
Please go ahead.

Hyojoo's ex has been giving her

Her ex?

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,868
Yes, Nam Junghyun
from the physical education department.

13
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,287
They briefly went out last year,

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,041
but he's been harassing Hyojoo
ever since they broke up.

He's the reason
Hyojoo took a leave of absence.

00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,803
Has she reported him to the police?

19
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,889
The police said
there was nothing they could do.

20
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,975
Also, he's from a wealthy family.

21
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,312
You didn't actually see him that day,
did you?

22
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,897
No.

23
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,276
But I have a feeling he was nearby.

24
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,362

We're not going in the same direction.

55
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,965
They briefly dated,

56
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,719
and he's been harassing Hyojoo nonstop
since they broke up.

57
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,679
He's even been fined for stalking.

58

I bet he's the culprit.

59
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,561
[Junghwan] Judging from the texts
he sent her that night,

60
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,022
he must've been keeping tabs on her.

61
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,857
Isn't it obvious?

62
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,317
We don't know for sure yet.

63
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,235

I found out who he was.

66
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,408
[Minseo] He's Kang Sangdu,
the owner of Lucky Chicken,

67
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,910
the place across from One Shot Chicken.

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,164
They've been at odds
since day one.

69
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,415
One thing to note

70
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,752
is that he's been suspected
in three arson cases.

71
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,211
Arson?

72
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,421
[Junghwan] There you have it.

73
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,089
No, let's not jump to conclusions.

74
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,258
No, we shouldn't.

75
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,678
Yoon Minsoo, the owner of the restaurant,

76
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,930
and Song Sanguk, the landlord,
are also suspects.

77
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,307
[Yubin] They both have fire insurance.

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,434
In the event of a fire,
Yoon Minsoo receives 300 million won,

79
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,770
and Song Sanguk
receives over a billion won.

80
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,938
The latter has
more than four fire insurance policies.

81
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,940
That does raise a red flag.

82
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,651
[Minseo] Why would he have
so many fire insurance policies?

83
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,988
-We've finally solved the case, sir.
-[Yubin] No, not yet.

84
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,907
You're right. We haven't solved it yet.

87

-Not really.

He's a 19th-century Realist painter.

159
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,956

to paint biblical scenes, he said this.

It indicates that the fire started
from flammable liquid.

It seems someone splashed flammables
and set the fire.

[Eunkyung] That's the typical scenario.

-[police chief] Where's the captain?
-[Junghwan] He'll be back any minute, sir.

534
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,996
What brings you all the way here?

535

Are you sure you want to know?

536
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,586
Do you know who just called me? Huh?

537
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,131
The head of our division at headquarters.

538
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,176
I heard you brought in an innocent person
and grilled him.

539
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,511
[police chief shouting]
You even used violence!

540
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,013

You're talking about Nam Junghyun.

546
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,277
[Minseo] But it's not our fault.

547
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,280
The suspect refused to be interviewed…

548
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,283
[loudly] …and assaulted a detective.
Should we have tolerated that?

549
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,826
What are we, punching bags?

550
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,370
[police chief] Hey, Seo Minseo.

551
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,999
Do you think you're in a position
to talk back to me?

552
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,209
-No, sir.
-[loudly] Listen.

553
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm not letting this one slide.

554
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,797
Send your captain to me
as soon as he comes back.

555
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,883
And be prepared for disciplinary action,
all of you.

Got that?

[Junghwan] This is bad.
This is really bad.

00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,200
This is going to be a nightmare.

00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,581
Hey, why would you take the fall for me?

570
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,334
I just couldn't stand it.
After all you went through…

571
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,379

-[in English] Me too.
-[slurps]

577

Don't let it get to you.

How can we not?
It keeps bugging me.

579
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm concerned too.
The chief totally flipped his lid.

580
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,486
Don't worry about the chief's lid.

581

More importantly, Hyojoo won't be able
to give any statements for a while.

-I think you should see this.
-[Minseo] What is it?

584
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,373
The captain told me
to keep an eye on Chicken Hunter,

585
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,083
so I turned on notifications,

586
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,668
and he just posted a new video.

587
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,503
Hello, this is Chicken Hunter.

588
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,423
[Chicken Hunter] I'd like to apologize
to everyone

and watched our videos.

Besides our first few videos,

591
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,891
we had been paid by restaurant owners
to create favorable content.

-It hasn't been easy for us either.

593

Did they lie about

595

00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,319
Contrary to popular belief,

598
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,780
Cooking involves chemistry.

599
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,867
In other countries,
many scientists are also chefs.

600
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,245

They can't all be fake.

605
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,547

Maybe not.

You're on TV all the time.
You're quite the star now.

00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,463
Right, I want your autograph.

I would've kept it myself.

wouldn't it be strange

Three months' worth at once?

830
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,315
It was to stop his policy
from being canceled.

831
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,775
Was he after the insurance money then?

832
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,861

up to 300 million won.

835
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,994
After deducting expenses,
he'd be left with around 100 million won.

836
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,788
But here's the thing.
He's taken out a lot of loans.

837
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,209
The principal alone
exceeds 100 million won.
