-Can't you see? It says "97 Union" here.

353
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,809
-Were you born in '97?
-Yeah.

354
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,227
-So you're 27 years old?
-No.

355
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,646
-I knew it. You almost had me there.
-[♪ comical music playing]

356
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,314
My birthday hasn't passed yet.
I'm still 26.

357
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,274
You must've been through a lot.

358
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,692
-[glasses clink]
-Hey, thanks.

359
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,656
-[♪ comical stinger]
-[man] Ah!

360
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,783
Hey, you...

361
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,204
Ah!

362
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,666
[both laugh]

363
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,211
[Chelyong] You did a good job back there.
Let's drink.

364
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,839
-Thank you, sir.
-Drink up.

365
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,932
-Ah!
-You're a good drinker.

366
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,100
I'm not bad.

367
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,518
That's good.

368
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,563
Let me treat you sometime.

369
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,231
Sounds good.

370
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,817
Let's meet up when we both have time.

371
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,070
Can I ask you something, sir?

372
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,196
What is it?

373
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,410
I've lost a ton of money gambling online.

374
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,203
-So?
-That taught me a thing or two

375
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,746
about online gambling.

376
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,874
Now I understand
how the whole thing works.

377
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm basically an expert.

378
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,670
So I'd like to run a business,

379
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,965
but I can't get my hands on the program.

380
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,511
So you're saying
you want to run a gambling site?

381
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,222
Give me a chance, and I'll work hard.

382
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,974
Hm...

383
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,937
That's not my decision to make.

384
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,107
Have you ever heard of Lawyer Yoon?

385
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,194
I can give you his messenger info.

386
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,447
At the end of the day,
he's the one who decides.

387
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,366
That'll be very helpful, sir.

388
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,204
-Have a drink.
-Of course.

389
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,122
Drink up. Bottoms up.

390
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,381
Hannuri Travel Agency

391
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,384
[Tansik] This is Dongbang
from the Dongbang Group.

392
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,721
I'm reaching out because I'd like to join
your online gambling business.

393
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,390
Get back to me, and I'll risk it all.

394
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,642
Lawyer Yoon

395
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,768
All right, sent.

396
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,019
Good.

397
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,520
The die is cast.

398
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,189
All we can do now is wait.

399
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,984
[Joongryeok] I'm worried we're relying
too much on this Lawyer Yoon.

400
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,403
This is the only way to bust their boss.

401
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,073
Mastar only communicates with him.

402
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,241
To lure Lawyer Yoon,

403
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,537
keep posting about our activities
on social media.

404
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,581
Share two posts each every day.

405
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,667
That's too many.

406
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,377
-You think so?
-Yes.

407
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,753
Then make it three.

408
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,964
Let's just settle for two.

409
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,259
Listen, Detective Moo.

410
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,679
Why do you keep complaining?
Are you disobeying me?

411
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,722
-[♪ dramatic music playing]
-No, Boss.

412
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,432
Good. That's better.

413
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,310
Now, get to work, everyone.

414
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,728
Yes, sir.

415
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,773
[loud footsteps]

416
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,441
[Joongryeok] What's with him?

417
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,152
-[Tansik] The way Captain walks...
-[Minseo] The boss, not the captain.

418
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,696
The way Boss walks...

419
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
-[Junghwan] Is he the captain now...
-I think the boss.

420
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,284
[Tansik] He is, judging by the way
he's walking.

421
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,119
I think he's just a weirdo.

422
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,415
Let's finish up.

423
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,250
It's time to switch.

424
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,334
Yes, Boss.

425
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,129
That came out wrong. Yes, Captain.

426
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,673
[both laugh]

427
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,260
[threatening] What are you staring at,
woman?

428
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,389
-[shocked exclaim] Sorry.
-What a mess.

429
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,601
[Yubin] Mom! Mom!

430
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,525
[groaning] Gosh, time flies.

431
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,694
Let's call it a day.

432
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,029
Yes, Captain.

433
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,282
That came out wrong.

434
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,329
Sounds good, Boss. [cackles]

435
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,292
What?

436
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,962
Jeez.

437
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,756
Hey, wake up.

-[Minseo] No, it isn't.

441
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,109
[man] Is this the Dongbang Group office?

442
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,904
[Junghwan] We're having our lunch break.
Please come back later.

443
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,198
Better yet, don't come back.

I'm here to talk business.

00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,331
[Minseo] Who are you anyway?

00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,749

00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,675
-[Yoon] Thank you for your message.
-[Yubin] Sure.

450
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,262
Put your trust in us,
and you won't be disappointed.

451
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,889
[Yoon] This isn't about trust.

452
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,933
You seem to have a good reputation though.

453
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,769
Is this everyone?

454
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes, it's just us,
but we can get a lot done.

455
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,732
Introduce yourselves.

456
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,986
[Junghwan] Nice to meet you, sir.

457
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,906
I'm Sharpie, and I'm in charge of sales.

458
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,075
As in the pen?

459
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,702
[Yubin] As in "sharpshooter."

460
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,121
[Minseo] Nice to meet you.

461
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,165
They call me a lot of things,
but most know me as "Nigerian Prince."

462
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,044
That rings a bell.
I think I've heard of you.

463
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,796
[Minseo] I don't mean to brag,

464
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,800
but I'm sure that most people have gotten
an email from me at least once.

465
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,218
[Yubin] She's a legend.

466
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,721
She was a true pioneer in the field.

467
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,477
Sup dawg, I'm the money mule, Wang Tansik.

468
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,729
[Yoon] "Sup dawg"? Where are you from?

469
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,482
-[Yubin] It's a Chuncheon dialect?
-[Tansik] That's where I'm from, dawg.

470
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,819
My mom's side of the family is from there,
and that's not the Chuncheon dialect.

471
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,821
Was it Suncheon then?

472
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,032
I've never set foot in Chuncheon.
I'm from Suncheon, dawg.

473
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,120
[Joongryeok] Don't mind him.
Who cares where he's from?

474
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,038
I'm One Punch from Bongcheon-dong.

475
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,249
-Let me tell you a bit about myself--
-Later.

476
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,042
Yep.

477
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,214
You all seem full of energy
and pretty sharp. I like it.

478
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,508
We're just doing our best.

479
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,845
We might end up working together,
so I'll keep things informal.

480
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,932
Do you mean
we might start working for Mastar?

481
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:40,395
Hey, you shouldn't mention
his name so casually.

482
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,898
He must be a big deal.

483
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,609
I've only heard his name a few times.

484
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,446
I'm his closest aide,
but even I hardly ever get to see him.

485
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,617
[Yoon] He completely took over the field
within three years

486
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,369
and now handles

487
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:01,708
tens, no, hundreds
of billions of won daily.

488
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,504
In short, he's a living legend.

489
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,341
And he's giving you a task.

490
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,887
Ah. What kind of task is
such an important person giving us?

491
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,514
Is this an IOU?

492
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,849
[Yoon] The borrower has defaulted
on a substantial loan.

493
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,185
-[Yoon] But it's not about the money.
-A billion won?

494
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,395
We need to keep this under wraps

495
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,189
because our business
relies on word of mouth.

496
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,609
So we'd like to set an example.

497
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,278
What do you mean by that?

498
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,697
We'd appreciate it
if you could get it sorted out.

499
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,325
Think of it as a test.

[Joongryeok] How could you accept
a job like this on your own?

508
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,896
What if things go wrong?

509

stay in the car.

00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,995
One after another, huh?

525
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,124
-Who are you?
-Ever heard of the Dongbang Group?

526
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,252
What a corny name.
Are you YouTubers or something?

527
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,795
I hear you have some debt.

528
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,714
We're here to collect it.

529
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,675
You're not only rude but also reckless.

530
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,136
Guys, get rid of them!

531
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,180
[all] Yes, sir!

532
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,015
Get started.

[Junghwan] Are you okay, Minseo?

-[Minseo] Sorry!
-It's me!

-I'm sorry. Please forgive me this once.

563
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,890
It was a mistake.

564
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,184
Please forgive me this once.

565
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,437
We're the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

566
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,481
Are you police officers?

567
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,649
We're in the middle of an operation.

568
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,903
Anyway, please keep
this arrest confidential.

569
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,447
Don't inform the higher-ups yet.

570
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,240
Also, make sure
it doesn't leak to the press.

571
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,450
Promise?

572
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,368
I promise.

573
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,287
Are you really a police officer?

574
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,080
See for yourself.

00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,878
You got it done?

577
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,755
We collected the debt as you requested,

578
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,383
down to the last cent.

579
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,262
Okay, I'll come over later today.

580
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,473
I have a better idea.

581
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,642
Let us come over this time.

582
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,686
We'll have to purchase
the program and website,

583
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,106
and it's a big investment.
We need a demonstration too.

584
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,691
You want to come over?

585
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,736
It only makes sense to visit headquarters
before opening a branch.

586
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,112
I'm afraid you can't do that.

587
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,117
I thought we were family.
I'm disappointed.

588
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,538
[smacks lips]

589
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,331
[laughs] Fine.

590
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,208
I'm not supposed to do this though.

591
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,127
Okay, come over this afternoon.

592
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,797
I'll send you the address.
See you in a bit.

593
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,301
All right.
Please text me the time and place.

594
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,386
[Yoon] Will do.

595
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,720
Thank you, sir.

Round One
Welcome to our place

599
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,192
Is this the right place?

600
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,778
[Tansik] It's the right address.

601
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,657
[Junghwan] Their office is in
such a crowded area.

602
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,325
The business actually
seems to be operating.

603
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,704
[Minseo] So this is their cover
for operating dozens of gambling sites?

604
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:17,292
They're a national gang after all.
Why don't we request backup?

605
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,418
There won't be any backup.

606
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,714
The Cyber Bureau seems to suspect
that our information isn't reliable.

607
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,216
Whether there are a hundred
or a thousand of them inside,

608
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,843
we'll have to handle them ourselves.

609
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,721
Is anyone backing out now?

610
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,687
Be confident.

611
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,439
[Yubin] Who are we?

612
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,399
-The Dongbang Group.
-The Dongbang Group.

613
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,734

-The Dongbang Group.
-The Dongbang Group.

615
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,195
Who are we?

616
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,655
[all] The Dongbang Group!

617
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,198
We're the Dongbang Group!

618
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,283
Let's go.

619
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,452
-[Tansik] Yes, Boss!
-[Minseo] Yes, Boss!

620
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,164
We're not the Dongbang Group.

621
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,291
We're the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

-Bring it on!

624
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,546
Just how many are there?

625
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,258
[Yubin] It really is the right address.

626
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,843
What is this, a library?

627
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,261
[man] How can I help you?

628
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,391
-You're the Dongbang Group, right?
-Yes.

629
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,186
Please wait over there.
Lawyer Yoon will be here soon.

630
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,437
[Yubin] Okay.

631
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,731
[man] Help yourselves to some coffee.

632
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,650
-[mouthing] Coffee?
-[Yubin] Sure.

633
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,653
[Yubin] Let's have a seat.
He told us to wait over there.

634
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,907
Goodness.

638
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,460
[Yoon] There was bad traffic. [chuckles]

639
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,840
[Yoon] I bet those guys
were difficult to handle.

640
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,175
I'm impressed.

641
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,928
We were just doing our job.

642
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,304
So this is headquarters?

643
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,889
[Yoon] What? Yes.

644
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,225
It's different
from what you expected, right?

645
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,977
While you guys handle the legwork,

646
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,270
these guys use their brains
to bring in the money.

647
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,856
I see. Is our program ready?

648
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,569
I have the latest version ready for you.

-With just a few clicks,

650
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,033
you can manipulate the odds of winning.

651
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,497
[Yoon] Mr. Jung, please demonstrate.

652
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,088
[Yubin] Are you feeling under the weather?
You don't look well.

653
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,884
[Jung] You can log in as an administrator.

654
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,512
I'll send you the username and password.

655
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,224
The current odds of winning are 51 to 49.
Do you see that?

656
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,478
-Yes.
-You can adjust the odds here.

657
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,564
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

658
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,648
[Yubin] Okay.

659
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,236
Is Mastar not here?

660
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,614
I told you that he rarely shows up.

661
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,826
He gives me orders online, and that's it.

662
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,706
You don't know what he looks like?
That's a shame.

663
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,292
I've checked the program.

664
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,753
Go ahead and arrest all of them.

665
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,629
-[Minseo] Yes, sir.
-[♪ theme music playing]

666
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,382
[Minseo] You're all under arrest.
Please cooperate.

667
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,217
[Minseo] It's over now.

668
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,386
[Yoon] Who are you?
What do you think you're doing?

669
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,680
-[Tansik] Stay still, please.
-[Yoon yelps]

670
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,599
[Junghwan] You have the right
to remain silent.

671
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,226
-You're a lawyer, you know how this goes.
-I'm not a lawyer.

672
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,936
[Minseo] Put your hands on your head!

673
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,023
[Joongryeok] Hands on top of your head!
Stand up!

674
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,777
Follow me!

675
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,403
-What the...
-Hurry up.

676
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,116
[Tansik] Let's go.

677
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,036
[Junghwan] I'll carry your bag, Captain.

00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,581
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

680
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,501
[Junghwan] I looked
into Mastar's identity,

681
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,961
but he hasn't shown any signs of activity
since last year.

682
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,379
He hasn't left the country either.

683
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,965
Could he have stowed away?

684
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,592
That's a possibility.

685
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,178
[Minseo] Many criminals
have their offices overseas.

686
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,931
[Tansik] If he's abroad,
there's no way we can find him.

687
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,851
Should we go talk to
some stowaway brokers?

688
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,438
Can I take another look at the texts
between him and Lawyer Yoon?

689
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,273
-I'll bring it to you.
-Thank you.

-Date, Time, Name
-[♪ suspenseful music playing]

692
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,253
[Yubin] They communicated mostly
in the evenings.

693
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,970
[Yubin] The only times they communicated
during the day

694
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,429
were on weekends.

695
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,933
On weekdays,

696
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,937
their communications
always ended before 9 p.m..

697
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,150
There must've been a reason
they only communicated

698
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,818
in the evenings on weekdays.

699
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,781
Come in.

700
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,579
[Joongryeok] Det. Jung is investigating
some stowaway brokers who work with China,

701
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,624
and Mastar allegedly stowed away
to China last winter.

702
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,419
-Is that right?
-The broker's still in touch with him.

703
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,005
Should we search for him in China?

704
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,550
[Joongryeok] Captain, about the branches,

705
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,010
it seems they've caught wind

706
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,512
that their headquarters has been busted.

707
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,599
Even if we conduct a raid now,
we might not be able to round them up.

708
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,683
What do you think?

709
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,312
-[Yubin] Park Seongun, known as Mastar.
-Yes.

710
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,939
I think I know where he is.

711
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,317
You know where Mastar is?

712
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,488
-[Yubin] I found a pattern in his texts.
-[♪ male choral music playing]

713
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,993
On weekdays,
he only texts between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m..

714
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,872
On weekends,
he texts from morning until 9 p.m..

715
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,166
But since July of last year,

716
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,003
he's been texting
from morning until 9 p.m. on weekdays too.

717
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,880
-[Joongryeok] Since July of last year?
-Yes.

718
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,635
[Yubin] I looked into it,
and I found a clue.

719
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,512
Starting in July of last year,

720
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,557
some troops were allowed
to extend their mobile phone use.

721
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,226
July, 2023, Extended phone
use is permitted

722
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,269
They can now use their phones
during work hours.

723
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,896
Military Police

724
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,980
[Joongryeok] So that means...

725
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,942
-[Yubin] Mastar's in the military.
-"We are the Korean army."

726
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,654
He must be in a troop where
this extended phone use is permitted.

727
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,032

Who are you?

738
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,989
I'm from the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team.

739
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,825
Should I call you Mastar?

740

You know Lawyer Yoon, right?

741
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
I've handed Park Seongun over

It seems like
you haven't come to your senses yet.

Your charges may vary,

but there's one crime
you've all committed.

Organization of criminal groups.

for various offenses, such as threat,
bodily harm, and intimidation,
