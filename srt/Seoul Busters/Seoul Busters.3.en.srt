That's what makes him

You know what, Detective Seo?

In English, you "ask someone out,"

He thought he'd find
more opportunities abroad,

with streaming platforms and stuff.

273
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,476

he could start working overseas right away

before the incident.

To avoid this,
he was digging up dirt on Mr. Jang.

of embezzlement or dual contracts

00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,649
A piece of paper?

357
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,988
[Eunkyung] It could be a person's name.

358
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
What could "29" and "02" mean?

359
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,119
Could it be a phone number?

00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,165
[soft chuckle] Oh…

361
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,000

479
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,361

[Yubin] As for the puffer fish poison,

486
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,255

"I put a ton of puffer fish blood,

00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:34,194
2 hours and 25 minutes passed

534
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,032
I've secured the dashcam footage
from the taxi you were in

535
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,284
as well as the driver's testimony.

536
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,496
I even got hold of the stand-in
who watched the movie instead of you.

537
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,289
Cut the bullshit.

538
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,708
That one was easy to solve, ah…

539
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,627
but not the Kang Minjae case.

540
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,546
Kang Minjae would've faced a hefty penalty

541
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,131
if he breached his contract with JMT.

542
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,217
[Junghwan] To avoid this,

543
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,219
he was digging up dirt on Mr. Jang.

544
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,308
[Yujin] Kang Minjae
would've snuck into your office

545
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,769
to find dirt on you
in order to nullify his contract.

546
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,689
This bastard's been pocketing bribes
left and right.

[Minjae groans] What the hell?

551
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,201
[Yubin] That's when he stumbled upon
some evidence related to the murder.

552
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,414
And he found out
you were involved in Lim Dongil's death.

Calm down. What are you talking about?

555
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,798
Why would I do that? Am I crazy?

556
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,675
Also, I haven't taken any bribes!

557
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,885
Forget it.

558
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,596
I'll come over right now, so hang tight.

559
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,641
If I did go to Kang Minjae's place,
how come I wasn't caught on CCTVs?

560
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,185
Do you know
how many cameras are around there?

No one recognized you
because you were wearing a helmet,

I was feeling nostalgic.

570
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,512
So I hopped on my motorbike,
but it started raining.

How could you
even think of killing Dongil?

I can't believe
I considered you a brother.

580
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,750
Look, this is Dongil's home address.

581
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,461
I found it in your office
on the day of the incident.

582
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,672
Why would you hold on
to a roadie's home address?

583
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,635
Did you think
I wouldn't figure out your tricks?

584
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,891
Were you trying to get me canceled?

585
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,769
You're the one who told the press, right?

Do you have any idea

00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,086

Luckily, Mr. Kang didn't digest all of it.

I'm sorry. I'm not that into boxing.

-[Joongryeok] Enough about boxing.

Who watches boxing these days anyway?

00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,147
Everyone watches soccer
and roots for Son Heungmin and Lee Kangin.

745

How ironic.

799
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:20,704
How did you know
Dongil liked coffee-flavored milk?

800
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,124
I went through his credit card statements,

801
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,126
and he spent
less than 10,000 won on food a day.

802
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,798
He lived on lunch boxes and noodles
from the convenience store.

803
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,759
But he would enjoy
a small carton of coffee milk every day.

Did you know coffee milk contains
more caffeine than coffee?

Actually, coffee milk

806
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,812
has about 20% more caffeine
than an Americano…

807
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,648
