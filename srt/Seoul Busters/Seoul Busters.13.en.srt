00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,888
EXCAVATED ANTIQUES ARE
UNEARTHED ARTIFACTS

696
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
THAT PROVIDE INSIGHTS
INTO ANCIENT HUMAN CULTURE

697
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,269
Unearthed porcelains don't usually display
that sort of black grime.

698
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,353
Oh.

699
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,646
Has the fur been analyzed?

700
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,566
It's dog fur, as you guessed.

701
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,110
[Joongryeok] Professor Kim
doesn't have a dog.

702
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,071
But his daughter does.

703
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,240
-What?
-A Bichon Frisé.

704
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,408
The fur color matches too.

705
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,160
How did you find that out?

706
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,912
[Minseo] I saw pictures
on her social media account.

707
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,706
The dog's name is Fanny.

708
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,499
Whoa, this Bichon Frisé...

709
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,043
-What about it?
-It's adorable.

710
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,711
[Joongryeok sighs]

711
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,797
I would've adored you
if you didn't talk nonsense all the time.

712
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,384
Professor Kim's son-in-law
stopped by the day before the incident.

713
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,636
He's our prime suspect so far, right?

714
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,388
There you have it.

715
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,681
Let's not jump to conclusions.

716
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,517
We shouldn't. Nothing's for sure yet.

717
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,227
[Yubin] We'll have to check

718
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,606
whether the fur found in the porcelain
matches his daughter's dog fur.

719
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,900
-[Minseo] Yes, sir.
-[Tansik] Whoa!

720
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,277
His son-in-law's name is Joo Hyeonguk.

721
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,612
-So?
-What about it?

722
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,864
His last name is "Joo,"

723
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,741
and he's a son-in-law,
which is pronounced "sawi."

724
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,328
That makes him "Joosawi,"
as in the word for dice.

725
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,330
[laughing playfully]

726
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,290
Ah...

727
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,044
Want me to dice you up into pieces?

728
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,880
Junghwan, can you and Tansik
go and get some fur from that dog?

729
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,131
-Why should I?
-Do it.

730
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,758
-Just do it.
-Go ahead.

731
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,635
Yes, sir.

732
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,719
[chuckles]

733
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,681
[♪ sneaky music playing]

734
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,767
Joo Hyeonguk is approaching. Stand by.

735
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,064
[Junghwan] Hey, don't look at me.
[disgruntled grunt]

736
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,149
Get as much fur as you can.

737
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,279
My gosh! [whooping]

738
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,031
Aren't you just adorable?

739
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,741
-What's your dog's name?
-It's Fanny.

740
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,992
Fanny?

741
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,828
As in Tiffany? [guffaws]

742
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,371
[chuckles awkwardly]

743
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,956
-May I pet your dog?
-[Hyeonguk] Sure.

744
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,374
[Tansik] Are you a boy or a girl?

745
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,917
Fanny! [laughing]

746
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,794
-You feel so nice, Fanny.
-[Fanny squealing]

747
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,671
Mmm, you smell so good.

748
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,174
-Hi, honey.
-I'm buying some meat for dinner.

749
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,300
Will two portions be enough?

750
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,594
That's way too little. Get more.

751
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,720
[over radio] Get more.

752
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,848
[Tansik] More? More.

753
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,099
[chuckles]

754
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,308
Fanny!

755
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,643
Why do you smell so good?

756
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,895
I was born in the Year of the Dog.

757
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,522
Excuse me. We have to get going.

758
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,149
[chuckles]

759
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,609
[Hyeonguk] Did he scare you?
It's okay. Let's go.

760
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,028
-Two portions should be enough.
-No way. It's way too little.

761
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,530
Get more. Way more.

762
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,991
-[Tansik] Way more?
-[Hyeonguk] Stay away from that weird guy.

763
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,534
-Fanny!
-What the...

764
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,202
-What's with you?
-[laughing maniacally]

765
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,954
I love this. Are you happy? I'm happy too.

766
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,038
[squealing] Good girl.

767
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,248
What are you doing?

768
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,125
Stop it. Let's go.

769
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,585
Fanny seems happy.

770
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,795
No way. She seems uncomfortable.

771
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,297
Were you scared, Fanny?

772
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,966
I'm sorry.
I lose control whenever I see a dog.

773
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,886
-They're handing out free trash bags.
-Bags?

774
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,221
-But I can't be bothered.
-What? You should get them.

775
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,764
Don't forget to get the bags.

776
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,434
[Junghwan echoing]
Don't forget the bags.

777
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,520
[♪ frantic music playing]

778
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,486
[bypasser] What happened?

779
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,071
Should I call the police?

780
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,449
-Sorry?
-He stole something.

781
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,909
Yes, he stole the poop.

782
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,118
What? Poop?

783
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,748
-Detective Jung!
-How did it go, Tansik? Everything good?

784
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,792
Ta-da. Will this be enough?

785
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,420
Is that dog shedding? This is a lot.

786
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,006
You kept telling me to get more,
so I rolled around with the dog.

787
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,633
-Did I?
-Yes.

788
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,927
Also, the most important thing.

789
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,179
[startled shout]
Hey, why did you bring this?

790
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,681
You told me to make sure to get the bag.

791
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
-Did I?
-Yes.

792
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,768
-I told you to get the dog poop?
-Yes, you did.

793
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,478
-[startled scream]
-[awkward laugh]

794
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,854
The bag ripped!

795
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,900
Joo Hyeonguk runs Shim Interior.

796
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,904
One of his clients recently defaulted,
causing financial strain for his company.

797
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,156
[Joongryeok] He also entered
into the condo business

798
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,283
and suffered a big loss recently.

799
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,160
He's clearly been pressed for money.

800
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,997
He's the one
who renovated Professor Kim's vault.

801
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,251
He would've been able
to get the passcode if he tried to.

802
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,128
He must've swapped artworks with knockoffs
whenever he needed money,

803
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,338
including the painting.

804
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,547
Oh...

805
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,758
Everything seems to be falling
into place for once.

806
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,219
-[sighs]
-[Tansik] Captain.

807
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,804
The National Forensic Service confirmed

808
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,432
that the fur found in the porcelain
matched that of Joo Hyeonguk's dog.

809
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,017
[Minseo sighs in relief]

810
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,645
-Let's interview Mr. Joo first.
-[Minseo] Yes, sir.

811

SONGWON POLICE STATION
HAS MOVED TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION

812
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,276
I was pressed for money
because I was out of funds,

813
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,779
but I couldn't expect my father-in-law
to lend me any money.

814
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,408
But I stayed away
from the most valuable ones.

815
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,742
Where did you get the counterfeits?

816
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,247
Uh, I have a friend
who does business in China,

817
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,041
and I asked one of his clients for help.

818
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,418
-What about the painting?
-[sighs]

819
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,754
As I said, I'm not the one who stole it.

[knocking on door]

821
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,636
[Tansik in deeper voice]
Here's Joo Hyeonguk's call history.

822
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,557
-You may come in.
-I can't, sir.

823
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,309
-Come on in.
-No, sir.

824
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,560
I insist.

825
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,026
Whoa.

826
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,486
A-Aren't you the poop thief?

827
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,946
Yes, you are!

828
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,365
It's you, the dog poop thief!

829
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,410

-[Joongryeok sighs]
-[Tansik slurping]

831
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,331
[Joongryeok] Have you contacted him?

832
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,875
[Minseo] He's in China now.
He'll cooperate once he gets back.

833
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,001
What about the painting?

834
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,544
He knew nothing about it.

835
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,546
I've been a detective for over a decade,

836
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,507
but no one has ever admitted
to their charges voluntarily.

837
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,968
-[Yubin] Excuse me.
-What is it?

838
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,306
Do you need anything?

839
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,767
I think I got less meat than the others.

840
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,894
Could I have more?

841
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,730
[elder] You must love meat
because you're from the US.

842
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,273
-Right?
-I guess.

843
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,150
I want more soup, Mom.

844
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,361
Why would you need so much soup?

845
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,030
-Goodness.
-[Joongryeok] What did I do?

846
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,448
[elder groans]

847
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,453
-Hey, listen.
-[Joongryeok] Do you need more soup?

848
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,747
No, can I have everyone's attention
for a second?

849
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,998
[inhales sharply]

850
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,793
Well... I've given it some thought,

851
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,837
and I don't think
Joo Hyeonguk stole the painting.

852
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,963
Sorry?

853
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,467
He usually swaps artworks
with counterfeits.

854
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,843
But this case is different.

855
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,639
He would've known that someone
would notice the painting was missing.

856
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,890
That's what's off.

857
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,685
Did anyone else visit
Professor Kim's place around then?

858
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,938
-[Joongryeok] Uh...
-[Junghwan inhaling sharply]

859
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,649
-He didn't have any other guests.
-[Yubin] Hmm...

860
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,029
There may still have been people
who visited his place for other reasons.

861
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,406
Let's look more into it.

862
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,740
[all] Yes, sir.

863
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,367
-[Yubin] Eat up.
-Okay.

864
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,451
Oh!

865
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,286
Excuse me. Can I have more meat?

866
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,542
They had a housekeeper,

867
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,085
but she didn't live with them.

868
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,129
I'll find out more
as soon as she's identified.

869
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,006
An HVAC repairman also visited them

870
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,217
about a week before the incident.

871
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,845
Yes. That's about it.

872
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,972
-There's one more thing. Can I?
-Hold on.

873
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,560
Captain, one of his neighbors
called emergency services.

874
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,853
[whispering] What are you doing?

875
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,813
It's no big deal,

876
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,107
but the old man living downstairs
has Alzheimer's,

877
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,151
and he reported wasps.

878
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,528
But emergency services found nothing

879
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,488
since it's the middle of the winter.

SONGWON POLICE STATION

881
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,286
[Junghwan] The housekeeping agency
seems to do a thorough background check.

882
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,247
Also, Professor Kim's family
handpicked their housekeeper.

883
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,374
She's been a housekeeper for a decade,

884
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,376
and she doesn't seem suspicious.

885
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,003
What about the HVAC repairman?

886
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,255
His name is Ha Minyong.

887
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,090
He's been employed for barely half a year,

888
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,009
and he has a criminal record.

889
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,804
[Yubin] Convicted of larceny.

890
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,098
He served three years for special larceny.

891
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,726
I think we should look into him.

892
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,061
Detectives Moo and Seo are already on it.

-Mr. Ha Minyong,

896
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,240
we're from the Songwon Police.

897
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,700
Do you have a minute?

898
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,869
The Songwon Police?

899
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,121
Hold on!

900
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,375
I left as soon as I was finished
with my job that day.

901
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,253
Are you suspecting me
because of my criminal record?

902
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,255
[Minseo] This is just
a routine investigation.

903
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,592
Then why are two detectives
here to see me?

904
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,554
About my criminal record,
I fell in with the wrong crowd,

905
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,098
and all I did was keep watch.

906
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,434
To think I served three years for that.

907
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,269
[Yubin] But this case is different.

908
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,773
He would've known that someone
would notice the painting was missing.

909
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,982
That's what's off.

VIOLATION OF THE AVIATION SAFETY ACT

911
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,778
Why are you so worked up, huh?

912
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,030
It makes you seem suspicious.

913
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,114
[exasperated sigh]

914
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,033
I just feel wronged.

915
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,203
Also, his vault was passcode-protected.

[♪ mysterious music playing]

917
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,666
He has a dedicated room for artwork
in his house.

918
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,795
You need to enter a passcode to access it.

919
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,880
There was no sign of forced entry,

920
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,549
but only the painting disappeared.

921
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,968
How could I have stolen the painting,
even if I wanted to,

922
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,803
without knowing the passcode?

00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,108
How would he have known the passcode?

927
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,360
[Yubin] He must've seen it
while taking the stairs.

928
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,987
Maybe he recorded it with his phone.
