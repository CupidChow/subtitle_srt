Seoul Busters

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,963
22 years ago

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,175
By the way,
wasn't math super hard on the midterms?

4
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,844
I had to guess on a few questions,

5
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,888
but I managed to get everything right.

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,223
You got everything right?

7
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,225
It was so hard.

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,229
Who cares? Midterms are over.

9
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,256
Final Episode

10
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,019
Don't resent me too much.

11
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,358
We all die…

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,028
one day.

13
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,244
How…

14
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,371
Where am I?

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,832
Why am I here?

16
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,591
You really scared me there, Detective Seo.

17
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,095
This isn't personal.

18
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,559
It's just that you have something
that you shouldn't.

19
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,643
What?

20
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,857
Why the hell did you have to get involved
with Detective Jung?

21
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,317
Didn't you see what happened to him?

22
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,403
So you stabbed Detective Jung?

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,490
I had no choice.

24
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,576
It's not that I wanted to.

25
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,287
It was strictly business.

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,832
I'll do you one last favor

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,711
and make this as painless as possible.

28
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,136
What are you, an anesthesiologist?

29
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,762
I'm not going anywhere.

30
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,557
ENERGY MAX

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,975
Do you want to drink this?

32
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,477
Oh, I was actually craving this.

33
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,062
Thank you.

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,320
I didn't drink it.

35
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,447
Everyone, I have something
to tell you.

36
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,365
"48 hours ago"

37
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,826
Jung Hyunjoo's killer
and Detective Jung's attacker

38
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,162
appear to be the same person.

39
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,956
- What?
- They're the same person?

40
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,460
I was in love with a woman in the US.

41
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,963
I imagined I'd live a normal life
like anyone else.

42
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,758
Falling in love, finding a job,
getting married…

43
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,053
That was the future
I imagined with her.

44
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,971
But?

45
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,474
She was murdered.

46
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,310
Ketaflurane was detected
in her system,

47
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,103
and the cause of death was suffocation.

48
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,731
She was knocked unconscious,
and then killed by asphyxiation.

49
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,359
The MO and the scene were quite similar

50
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,819
to those of the Songnae Mountain case.

51
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,573
In both cases, a piece of jewelry
the victim was wearing disappeared.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,209
In the first case,
Jaein left a dying message.

53
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,962
"Friend."

54
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,131
So the killer was…

55
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,800
Sim Hyunwoo?

56
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,511
What about Han Junho?

57
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,221
He's definitely not the culprit.

58
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,016
You say he's not the culprit,

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,103
but the footprints found at the scene
clearly point to him.

60
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,146
The soil found on his sneakers
was from the scene too.

61
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,982
It's true, soil was found
on his sneakers.

62
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,151
But another crucial element was missing.

63
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,445
On the day of the incident,

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,824
they were repaving the entrance
to his apartment.

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,870
I thought this case was closed.

66
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,706
There's something I need to check.

67
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,919
As you can see, not a trace
of construction debris was found.

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,839
If he had been wearing
those sneakers on his way to the scene,

69
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,591
we would've also detected traces
from the construction work.

70
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,262
They found a burner phone in his home
that he used to call the victim.

71
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,557
Would a burner phone user answer a call
from an unknown number?

72
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,684
I tried calling the number.

73
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,978
Hello? Hello?

74
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,147
What do you think?
Do you recognize the voice?

75
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,815
I did right away.

76
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,526
Han Junho likely didn't even know
the phone was in his home.

77
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,696
He probably answered it
without realizing what it was.

78
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,573
Also, the culprit

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,868
prefers using his left hand

80
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,745
but trained himself to use his right hand.

81
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,912
"Suspect
Right-handed?"

82
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,497
Han Jun-ho isn't left-handed.

83
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,207
- I said I didn't do it!

84
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,048
What about Sim Hyunwoo?

85
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,424
I've confirmed it.

86
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,592
This is for you.

87
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,554
What's this for?

88
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,559
So he was the one who stabbed Junghwan?

89
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,436
The temple Detective Jung visited

90
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,397
is located on the only road
to the Songnae Mountain parking lot.

91
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,607
Is that the plate number?

92
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,109
Okay, thanks.

93
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,281
The temple's CCTV must've captured
something related to Hyunwoo.

94
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,075
Hello, Professor Sim.

95
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,910
This is Jung Junghwan
from the Songwon Police.

96
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,704
And Hyunwoo found out
Detective Jung secured the footage.

97
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,584
Were you around
Songnae Mountain on the day of the murder?

98
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,669
We've obtained a witness statement

99
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,380
saying that Detective Jung
was on the phone

100
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,507
with someone he addressed as "Professor."

101
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,884
What? You're near
the scene right now?

102
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,010
Me too.

103
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,054
Sounds good. I'll meet you there.

104
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,264
Captain.

105
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,143
I don't care if it's Professor Sim
we're talking about. Let's do this.

106
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,562
Let's catch the bastard
who stabbed Junghwan.

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,855
I'm in.

108
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,690
I trust your judgment, Captain.

109
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,942
I'm in too.

110
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,820
-Then let's take action.
-Okay.

111
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,864
I found bloodstains on
the cat tree in Jung Hyunjoo's home,

112
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,991
but no DNA has been detected.

113
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,577
If Hyunwoo is really the culprit,

114
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,081
he must have a cat scratch
somewhere on his body.

115
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,458
-Please look for it, Detective Jang.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,294
-Detective Moo will visit Hyunwoo's home.
-His home?

117
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,631
I'm sure he keeps a collection
of his victims' belongings at home.

118
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,842
-Got it.
-What should I do?

119
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,180
I'll have to give you
the most difficult task.

120
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,020
You can say no if it's too much.

121
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,738
Seoul Busters

122
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,214
I've never seen you here before.

123
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,590
Do you work out here?

124
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,760
Ah, yes, I signed up today.

125
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,649
By the way, you're so muscular.

126
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,776
Your chest and arms…

127
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,129
-Hello, Captain.
-Hyunwoo does have a cat scratch.

128
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,967
We need to compare his DNA
with the DNA found in the cat's claws.

129
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,970
Try to find something
that would have his DNA.

130
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,763
Yes, sir.

131
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,060
Hauling packages sure is exhausting.

133
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,770
- You got this.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,153
I've come up with some guesses
based on my data.

135
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,823
I know Hyunwoo very well.

136
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,741
One of those is likely to be his passcode.

137
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,952
They're still just guesses.
What if they're all wrong?

138
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,996
Then use your hunch.

139
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,040
Data, my foot.

140
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,500
Fine, let's do this.

141
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,768
Focus, focus.

142
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,486
I can't believe it worked.

143
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,883
DNA.

144
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,136
DNA, DNA.

145
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,309
DNA.

146
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,730
No.

147
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,525
That bastard would easily notice
if his toothbrush went missing.

148
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,235
His hair.

149
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,112
His hair.

150
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,034
There it is.

151
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm sure he keeps a collection
of his victims' belongings at home.

152
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,993
I need evidence.
Something concrete.

153
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,956
You can do this, Joongryeok.

154
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,503
You've got this.

155
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,343
I trust your hunch, Detective Moo.

156
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,470
Let's do this.

157
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,650
"It's all about the hunch"

158
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,901
Damn it!

159
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,279
Our hunch isn't working!

160
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,613
"Rash, Behavior"

161
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,781
Let's trust our hunch!

162
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,241
Hunch, my foot.

163
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,868
Also, we can't stay here.

164
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,494
Someone might come in any minute.

165
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,620
We're in danger.

166
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,164
We're done here, so let's go.

167
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,290
That's probably best.

168
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,000
Stay out of it!

169
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,293
"Reason"

170
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,502
You always pick on me.

171
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,588
-Go away!
-Stay in the back!

172
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,214
"Simplicity"

173
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,550
-Check the fridge.
-Fridge, my foot.

174
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,885
That doesn't make any sense.

175
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,969
"Common Sense"

176
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,388
Me? Since when do you need me?

177
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,724
If someone shows up, we'll be in trouble.

178
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,809
-I suggest a strategic retreat.
-Retreat? No way!

179
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,644
We can't! We must find something.

180
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,771
Hold on!

181
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,400
Boom.

182
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,527
"Hunch"

183
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,738
Hunch, is that you?

184
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,615
Hunch, you're back.

185
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,741
How long has it been?

186
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,950
Long time no see.

187
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,161
- How have you all been?
- Welcome back.

188
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,247
What are you looking for?
Do you need help?

189
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,832
Boom.

190
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,051
The Virtue of Modesty

191
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,845
That arrogant jerk reads
The Virtue of Modesty?

192
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,019
It really worked.

193
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,486
Okay, you're busted.

194
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,704
ENERGY MAX

195
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,498
What are you waiting for? Leave right now!

196
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,458
Something's fishy.

197
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,378
Why keep so many
vitamin drinks at home?

198
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,755
They aren't even in the fridge.

199
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,465
We should look into it.

200
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,929
That bastard.

201
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,524
Are you looking for something?

202
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,901
I've lost my bracelet.

203
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,697
My mom gave it to me
when I moved to the US.

204
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,907
-Oh no. It must mean a lot to you.
-It does.

205
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,242
Are you sure you lost it here?

206
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,577
Yeah, I am.

207
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
Where is it?

208
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,085
-I found it.
-Where?

209
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,173
Here you go.

210
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,313
Detective Seo.

211
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,232
Captain.

212
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,818
The operation
you talked about earlier?

213
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm in.

214
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,031
No. I was being selfish.

215
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,742
Let's change the plan. It's too dangerous.

216
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,369
No, let's stick to the plan.

217
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,665
We need to catch the culprit.
As you once said,

218
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,084
Heaven's net…

219
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,841
Heaven's gnat…

220
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,929
That's not it.

221
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,680
Heaven's newt?

222
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,558
Heaven's… nest…

223
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,270
The net of heaven may seem vast and wide,

224
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,273
but nothing escapes it.

225
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,984
Exactly. That's what I meant.

226
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,821
If someone does something wrong,
they'll eventually get caught.

227
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,949
That's what I was trying to say.

228
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,284
Let's catch that bastard with a net.

229
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,623
-With a net?
-Yes.

230
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,127
Where are you going?

231
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,005
Could you drop me off
at the subway station?

232
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,924
-Sure, get in.
-Thank you.

233
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,136
Minseo just got into Professor Sim's car.

234
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,431
They'll be heading to Songnae Mountain.

235
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,476
I'll head there right away.
Follow the plan.

236
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,773
Analysis Request Form
Suspect: Sim Hyunwoo

237
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,194
You've got to be kidding me.

238
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,155
Who do you think you are?

239
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,826
We're the Songwon Violent Crimes Team!

240
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,831
Damn it! I'll fucking kill you!

241
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,284
So it's you again?

242
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,620
Fuck you. Don't think that you've won.

243
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,831
Take one more step,

244
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,292
and I'll blow your captain's brains out.

245
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,130
Fuck, I should've gotten rid of you first.

246
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,467
I agree. You should have.

247
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,302
But it was so much fun

248
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,264
keeping you around and toying with you.

249
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,601
It's over. Drop the gun.

250
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,394
What the hell are you talking about?

251
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,855
I could kill you any second.

252
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,775
If you don't cooperate,
we'll have to use force.

253
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,695
Be my guest.

254
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,366
See if you can arrest me
before this bullet hits you.

255
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,329
Of course I can.

256
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,986
You bastard!

257
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,072
Let me down!

258
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,116
How dare you?

259
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,992
Let me down!

260
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,869
I'll kill you all!

261
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,131
Hey! Let me down!

262
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,300
- Hey!
- Shut your mouth!

263
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,135
I've heard enough out of you!

264
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,511
-Let me go!
-You asshole!

265
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,724
Detective Seo.

266
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,810
-Detective Seo.
-What?

267
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,856
Captain.

268
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,818
Are you okay?

269
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,740
The pepper spray got into my eyes.

270
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,076
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,874
We caught a big one in our net, didn't we?

272
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,542
He's too heavy!

273
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,211
Lower him down and arrest him.

274
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,337
Yes, sir!

275
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,308
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

276
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,561
Captain.

277
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,065
We'll compile everything on Sim Hyunwoo
and send it up this week.

278
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,484
We've got some hard evidence against him.

279
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,988
The video you filmed
was especially helpful.

280
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,207
I thought we were
finally closing the case.

281
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,919
I even covered it on my show.
What should I do?

282
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,008
This isn't personal.

283
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,388
It's just that you have
something that you shouldn't.

284
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,139
So you stabbed Detective Jung?

285
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,185
I had no choice.

286
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,979
Way to go!

287
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,690
Detective Jung!

288
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,821
-Detective Jung!
-You're back?

289
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,947
Detective Jung!

290
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,409
Hey, man, is it okay for you
to be out like this?

291
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,953
"Hey, man"?
Don't you know that I got promoted?

292
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,832
Come on, buddy. Learn to be respectful!

293
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,959
Want me to send you back to the hospital?

294
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm just joking.

295
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,212
You seem a lot better.

296
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,380
I am, sir.

297
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,383
I think I can get back to work next week.

298
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,719
I don't think I ever told
you guys.

299
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,681
But when I was an athlete,
I went through extremely intense training.

300
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,143
I'm practically made of steel.
My body is incapable of feeling pain.

301
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,103
-I'm that strong--
-Welcome back, Detective Jung!

302
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,521
Hold on! Put me down!

303
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,273
-Hey, you're hurting him.
-Detective Jang.

304
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,275
-Detective Jung!
-Ow, that's the wound.

305
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,570
Seems like the man of steel
has gotten pretty rusty.

306
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,447
Sorry.

307
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,950
Now that Detective Jung
is feeling better and the case is closed,

308
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,535
let me buy everyone dinner.

309
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,830
That sounds great.
I'm actually craving something.

310
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,790
Whatever you want.

311
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,500
Beef!

312
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,086
Beef? Okay, I'll treat everyone to beef.

313
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,171
Let's go!

314
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,756
- Yay, beef!
- Yes!

315
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,383
-Are you really buying us beef?
-As much as you want!

316
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,594
- I'm in!
- I'm going to eat so much!

317
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,561
Wait for me, Captain!

318
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,277
Captain said
we could have anything we wanted,

319
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,404
we're eating together
for the first time in forever.

320
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,573
Exactly.
We could've eaten something nicer.

321
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,368
I've been craving this soup so much.

322
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,703
Hey, this is beef too.

323
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,205
I don't like boiled meat.

324
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,499
We ordered extra beef for you.

325
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,251
Wow, I'm moved to tears.

326
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:05,008
Why'd you have to go
and get hurt like that, huh? Idiot.

327
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,510
Eat all of it.

328
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,679
Do you know how good this broth is
for your bones?

329
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,224
I'll drink every last drop, ma'am.

330
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,725
-Dig in.
-Will do.

331
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,311
Ma'am, I'm the one who ordered extra beef.

332
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,314
You said you didn't like boiled meat.

333
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,902
I just meant that I like
grilled meat a tiny bit more.

334
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,489
Thank you.

335
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,077
I heard Professor Sim
is pleading the Fifth.

336
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,912
He refused to say anything to us too.

337
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,498
It's true.
The only time he spoke during questioning

338
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,833
was when he asked for water.

339
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,376
As if that'll make him walk free.

340
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,755
Bastards like him
need to be separated from society.

341
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,049
Totally. We need to make sure
he pays for what he's done.

342
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,969
But it won't be easy.
You know how clever those crooks are.

343
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,971
He won't be able
to get out of this so easily.

344
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:59,479
Anyway, how did you become friends
with a piece of shit like him, Captain?

345
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,482
- You might have bad taste in people.
- Stop it.

346
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,152
You need to work on your hunch
for that sort of thing.

347
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,570
Ah.

348
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,615
But he did look just fine
on the outside.

349
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,035
And you need better taste in men.

350
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,663
He was likely
a high-functioning sociopath.

351
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:20,542
They appear to be very socially adept.

352
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,877
But they're actually calculative

353
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,004
and only view other people
as a means to an end.

354
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,466
Professor Sim really is a lowly bastar…

355
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,473
Whoa, Tansik!
You're all grown up!

356
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,684
You're a real man.

357
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,868
How did you know

358
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,078
I would take Detective Seo
to Songnae Mountain?

359
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,415
You wouldn't have had the time
to find a new location.

360
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,877
Also, you were well aware
that the trail was sealed off

361
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,962
due to the investigation.

362
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,964
It was a matter of odds.

363
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,010
You read me like a book.

364
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,763
Why did you do it?

365
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,768
I needed to tie up loose ends.

366
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,522
- Hey, Dongbang!
- Hi.

367
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,940
I'll catch up.

368
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,568
Is this about what happened in the States?

369
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,861
Is that why you prefer fieldwork?

370
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,698
It's time to let go.
It's been a long time.

371
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,866
Jaein…

372
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,577
left a dying message.

373
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,584
Yubin? Is that you?

374
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,843
What brings you here?

375
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,303
Can I come in?

376
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,390
Sure.

377
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,901
I hate to admit this,
but if you think about it,

378
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,862
you always had more than I did.

379
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,115
You were better than me in every way.

380
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,538
Since I couldn't have
more than you,

381
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,457
I decided…

382
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,545
to take something away from you.

383
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,717
Something that meant the world to you.

384
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:45,103
Relax, it's okay.
It'll be over soon.

385
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,356
It's okay.

386
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,872
Damn it.

387
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,573
I'll make it quick.

388
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,246
Shh…

389
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,351
After what happened to Jaein,

390
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,145
I was able to get the professor position
instead of you,

391
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,566
and I have what would've been
your job at headquarters.

392
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,707
A dying message?

393
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,460
What was it?

394
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,213
"Friend."

395
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,425
Suspect List, Jaein's Friends

396
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,219
Han Junho

397
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,061
Please assign me
to the Violent Crimes Team.

398
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,442
"Friend"?

399
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,654
I'm off.

400
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,620
Until then, I didn't know
there was a dying message.

401
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,664
It took me by surprise.

402
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,417
High-Priority Monitoring Suspects
for Stalking

403
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,753
I could've
gotten away with it.

404
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,255
He fit the bill perfectly.

405
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:07,013
One of the cases
involves stalking and kidnapping.

406
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,765
Remind you of anybody?

407
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,268
It makes me think
of Han Junho.

408
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,109
Are you sure it's Han Junho?

409
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,694
Why wouldn't I be?

410
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,906
We also found sneakers
that matched the footprints at the scene.

411
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,704
It seems the culprit had
no intention of hiding the body.

412
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,289
The culprit wanted the body to be found.

413
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,376
The body was found
right along the border.

414
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,545
The jurisdiction
is a bit unclear,

415
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,464
so I'll have Professor Sim
oversee the profiling

416
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,258
and lead the case.

417
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,719
Everything was set up perfectly.

418
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,763
If you think about it,

419
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,600
Detective Jung messed everything up.

420
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,561
Detective Jung.
What's the matter?

421
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,438
- Is this a good time?
- Yes.

422
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,276
Were you around Songnae Mountain
on the day of the murder?

423
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,654
-Why do you ask?
-The thing is,

424
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,950
your car was caught on the CCTV.

425
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,662
Let's talk in person.

426
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,747
I'm nearby.

427
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,460
Investigation in progress
Do not enter

428
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,841
Professor Sim, I'm over here.

429
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,468
-There you are.
-Yes.

430
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,304
Ah…

431
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,390
I like to dress comfortably
in the field.

432
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,059
So you received a tip?

433
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,728
Let's go up first.

434
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,313
I'll explain at the scene.

435
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,564
-Shall we?
-Yes.

436
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,657
Investigation in progress
Do not enter

437
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,580
Professor Sim.

438
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,625
Was there anything else
found at the scene?

439
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,877
Huh?

440
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,695
As I'm sure you're aware,

441
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,114
I'm claiming temporary insanity.

442
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,117
I've received psychiatric treatment
since I was young.

443
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,247
If I'm lucky, I'll serve
no more than five years in prison.

444
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:42,085
It's nothing more than a little break.
It'll go by in a flash.

445
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,465
I've thought about what to do with you.

446
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,303
I even thought about killing you
just like you did to Jaein.

447
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,554
That's what I want.

448
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,391
I'd fucking love to see you fall apart.

449
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,227
And here's my decision.

450
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,486
Defendant Sim Hyunwoo
Report of Additional Charges

451
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,904
What's this?

452
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,115
Adding crimes to cold cases.

453
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:16,661
It seems the culprit
carefully orchestrated his crime

454
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,247
to make it appear
as part of the notorious cold case.

455
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,749
You were talking about yourself.

456
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,545
I know that's how you were able
to avoid suspicion for so long.

457
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,301
These are just the cases
that I suspect you of so far.

458
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,514
I'm going to uncover every single crime
you've ever committed

459
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,182
and make sure that you pay.

460
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,329
I was genuinely hoping it wasn't you.

461
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,499
I have a question.

462
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
When did you start suspecting me?

463
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,339
When I saw Jaein's dying message.

464
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,259
"Friend"?

465
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,929
Does that even count as a dying message?

466
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,098
It was quite clear to me.

467
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,811
You were my only friend.

468
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,105
Too bad.

469
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,692
Looks like you lost your only friend.

470
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,695
No. Thanks to you, I found new ones.

471
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,032
Four, at that.

472
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:58,262
Special Award Ceremony
for Songwon Police Violent Crimes Team 2

473
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,518
Senior Inspector Dongbang Yubin.

474
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,602
Good work.

475
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,024
Lieutenant Moo Joongryeok.

476
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,110
Good work.

477
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,949
Sergeant Jung Junghwan.

478
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,075
Good work.

479
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,538
Corporal Seo Minseo.

480
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,918
Officer Jang Tansik.

481
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,170
Good work.

482
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,050
Attention.

483
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,720
Salute the Commissioner.

484
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,810
At ease.

485
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,648
Here we go.
One, two, three.

486
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,360
One more time. One, two, three.

487
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,279
Thank you.

488
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,197
Good work, everyone.

489
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:02,660
I can't say that this hasn't hurt
the police's reputation a bit,

490
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,371
but still, we took care of it in the end.

491
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,876
This is all thanks to the Seongwon Police.

492
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,920
It's Songwon, not Seongwon.

493
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,923
Anyway, well done. You're dismissed.

494
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,892
Some money to take your team out
for a job well done.

495
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:34,275
By the way, haven't you shared the news
with your team yet?

496
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,112
Not yet. In due time.

497
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,750
Eat up, everyone.

498
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,212
It's so good. Wow.

499
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,715
Minseo, I'm getting full
just from watching you eat.

500
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,301
All I talked about
was wanting to eat beef,

501
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,387
but now we're finally eating it.
Thank you so, so, so much!

502
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,141
I have no idea what you just said,
but keep on eating!

503
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,143
I think we need more meat.

504
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,062
Hey, bring some more.

505
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,313
Bring the most expensive cuts.

506
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,648
Yes, sir.

507
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,192
Bring a fatty cut, got it? A fatty one!

508
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,401
-Fatty?
-You?

509
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,404
She wants a fatty cut.
She's not calling him a fatty.

510
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,784
It's the Commissioner's treat,
so eat as much as you want.

511
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,952
Yes, sir!

512
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,289
Can we take some of this to go?
My kids love beef.

513
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,124
-Are you kidding me?
-Jeez.

514
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,710
Did you hear the news?

515
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,964
Someone's getting reassigned.
Although it doesn't apply to any of us.

516
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,342
The fatty cuts are here.

517
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,426
Great.

518
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,637
Okay.

519
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,555
Wow, how much does that cost?

520
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,812
They've located the golden Buddha statue.

521
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,022
-Let's get moving.
-Yes, sir!

522
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,107
Are we leaving?

523
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,692
Let's go.

524
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,818
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

525
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,501
The package
should be here soon.

526
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,586
Stay in position, everyone.

527
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,261
Well, would you look at that.

528
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,264
Your handwriting looks funny, babe.

529
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,522
Package spotted. Do we move in now?

530
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,815
Hold off for now.

531
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,818
Make the move
as soon as he makes the handoff.

532
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,194
Not yet.

533
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,205
Detective Jang, you're getting too close.

534
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,166
Got it.

535
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,881
He can't do a single thing right.

536
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,098
Oh, I've lost sight of the package!

537
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,600
-Behind you.
-What?

538
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,518
-He's behind you!
-Behind me?

539
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,820
You again!

540
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,035
Damn it!

541
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,663
Stop right there!

542
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,047
That idiot.

543
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,924
Where do you think you're going?

544
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,133
You just lost!

545
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,970
-That way? Okay.
-Sure.

546
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,431
That way?

547
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,266
-Jeez.
-Damn it.

548
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,434
Let's go that way.

549
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,812
Stop!

550
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,065
Sorry.

551
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,525
We're sorry!

552
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,111
Where are you running off to?
Give me 10,000 won.

553
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,821
10,000 won? There's your 10,000 won.

554
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,576
That's good. Very good!

555
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,331
Let's spread out
and search for him.

556
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,961
Namsan cable cars

557
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,423
Where's our guy in the hoodie?

558
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,757
-He's gone.
-Is he?

559
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,344
He's over there!

560
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,305
Hawkeye! Hawkeye!

561
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,475
-It's locked!
-Hawkeye!

562
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,812
Sorry, excuse us.

563
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,231
-Sorry.
-Excuse us.

564
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,029
-Excuse us, everyone.
-Sorry.

565
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,823
We're sorry.

566
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,536
What do you want?

567
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,955
I'm sorry.

568
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,707
-Excuse me.
-Hold on…

569
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,584
No, no, wait!

570
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,128
Wait, we weren't trying to…

571
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,380
-Wait…
-No!

572
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,507
We…

573
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,302
Crap-eye.

574
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,930
In shooting, you rely on a lot more
than just your vision.

575
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,100
The view is really nice though.

576
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,734
Okay, I'll be right there.

577
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,989
There you go.

578
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,596
What are you looking at?
Come here.

579
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,642
We finally caught these punks.

580
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,018
I was afraid we'd lose them again.

581
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,811
We got the item
and have photos for evidence.

582
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,522
Hey, where are Junghwan and Minseo?

583
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,483
Detectives, we've busted the perps
and secured the item.

584
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,860
- Where are you?
- What should we say?

585
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,572
Just tell them
we'll meet them down the mountain.

586
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,867
We'll meet you down the mountain.

587
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,787
You dragged me into this mess.

588
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,040
It's not good to blame others.

589
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,334
Are you saying it's my fault?

590
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,887
Good!

591
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,348
"Moo Joongryeok"

592
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,183
"Junghwan, Youngeun,
Hana, Doona, Sena, Nuri"

593
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,602
- Do you see this?
- We love you, Daddy.

594
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,354
We love you.

595
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,689
I love you too.

596
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,649
"Jung Junghwan"

597
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,319
What's that in your ear?

598
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,488
- Huh?
- Is that the latest design?

599
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,410
Detectives!

600
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,080
Jang Tansik

601
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,382
Hyunseo

602
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,010
The view is beautiful.
Let's come here with Dad next time.

603
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:25,060
Seo Minseo

604
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,521
Digital photos, ready in two minutes

605
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,069
Dongbang Yubin

606
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,964
-[Okay, let's call it a day.
-Okay.

607
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,049
Good work, everyone.

608
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,383
-Good work.
-Thank you.

609
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,593
Junghwan, want to grab a drink?

610
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,678
I have to pick out Hana's outfit
for her school dance.

611
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,055
School dance? Come on.

612
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,432
-Don't look at me. I don't want to!
-Can't I even look at you?

613
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,809
What are you looking at?

614
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,896
-I'm a little hungry.
-Ah.

615
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,814
I'm hungry, Detective Moo.

616
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,274
Eat by yourself.

617
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,735
I have an announcement.

618
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,237
Construction is finished,

619
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,157
so you can report
to the new building from now on.

620
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,450
Oh!

621
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,160
Are we finally getting out of here?

622
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,789
Wow, those bathrooms
were so uncomfortable to use.

623
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,166
There was no privacy at all.

624
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,503
But it feels a little bittersweet.

625
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,546
I've grown attached to this place.

626
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,049
Then you can keep working here!

627
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,219
Given your level of maturity,
you're better off staying here.

628
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,012
How old is our little Joongryeok?

629
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,263
I'm 41!

630
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,475
- That was good.
- And one more thing.

631
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,855
I'll be transferring to headquarters.

632
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,693
- What?
- But…

633
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,988
I'll be working there
starting tomorrow.

634
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,241
I understand that
you're leaving,

635
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,578
but why didn't you give us any warning?

636
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,581
I know.
We didn't prepare anything.

637
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,083
If you had told us sooner,

638
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,836
we would've prepared
a plaque for you or something.

639
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,003
I mean…

640
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,716
it's good news, isn't it?

641
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:26,932
Come in.

642
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,352
Detective Seo.

643
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,898
Are you done packing?

644
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,364
How will we manage without you?

645
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,034
The Violent Crimes Team…

646
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,414
will become the Violently Crying Team
without me.

647
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,376
Gosh. That was so FNF.

648
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,336
"FNF"?

649
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,589
Funny, but not funny at all.

650
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,175
Is now really the time for jokes?

651
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,304
Everyone's really upset,
although they're trying not to show it.

652
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,729
Remember what I once said?

653
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,858
Our team

654
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,612
isn't exactly invincible,

655
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,197
but it's quite charming.

656
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,450
Yes.

657
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:31,455
I think that charm has grown
even stronger.

658
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,923
This is the only thing
we can give you.

659
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,760
I know you're not a fan of these things,

660
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,387
but consider it a goodbye present.

661
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,854
I'll take good care of it.

662
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,858
Come on.

663
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,902
Stop it.

664
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,738
What's with you?

665
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,088
Why are you still here?

666
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,590
That was all a joke, right?

667
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,139
Captain.

668
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,560
We're ready for a farewell party.

669
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,064
Should we just have one drink then?

670
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,899
I'm disappointed.

671
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,277
-Two drinks…
-Two?

672
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,404
Two becomes three.

673
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:49,116
Three becomes four.

674
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,160
Four becomes five.

675
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,246
Five becomes six.

676
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,164
Six becomes seven.

677
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,125
Seven becomes eight!

678
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,482
Detective Jang Tansik

679
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,526
How to Become a Strong Detective

"Catch those voice phishing scammers!
Check CCTV footage!!"

Detective Jung Junghwan

686
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,346
Bust all the bad guys!
You've got this, Daddy! I love you!

687
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,732
We're the Songwon Police
Violent Crimes Team 2!

688
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,082
One year later

689
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,507
Financial Crime Investigation Team
Team Leader Dongbang Yubin

690
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,263
I have a meeting
with the Commissioner.

691
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,349
Finish up and go home.

692
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,185
-Goodbye, sir.
-See you tomorrow.

693
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,608
Our team leader seems so cold.

694
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:50,070
We keep asking for a team dinner,
but we still haven't had one.

695
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,823
Totally. He's a workaholic.

696
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,866
It's like working with a robot sometimes.

697
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,868
I'm loving Sergeant Jung's energy.

698
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,161
Dinner's on me, everyone.

699
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,122
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

700
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,498
Bring the company card.

701
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,716
They're making a special
team for the Gongneung-dong case.

702
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,510
I'd like you to be in charge.

703
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,594
Me?

704
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,849
You already dragged me to headquarters
when I said I wasn't interested.

705
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,393
Hey, it wasn't me.

706
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,354
HR was the one who made the call.
What was I to do?

707
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,567
Anyway, this case is
the top priority at the moment.

708
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,527
Hand over everything else

709
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,696
and make a new team
to handle the investigation.

710
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,781
Yes, sir.

711
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,534
Here.

712
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,662
I've compiled some good candidates,
so take your pick.

713
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,998
Where do you want your office?

714
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,958
We can make one here if you'd like.

715
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,126
I'll pass on the special team.

716
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,129
