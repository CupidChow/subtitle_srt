[alumnus 2] Give it a try, Jiyeong.

178
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,633
-Hurry up. Go, Jiyeong!
-[alumni in unison] Go, Jiyeong!

179
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,093
-I don't think so.
-Go, Jiyeong!

180
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,387
-Go, Jiyeong!
-[Minseo] Stop it.

181
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,806
-Those guys are no match for you.
-I think I'll pass.

182
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,100
-I'm the dancing queen?
-[alumnus 2] Come on.

183
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,602
[MC] They may be older now,

184
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,815
but these dancers
are still teenagers at heart!

185
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,985
Now, let's get started.

186
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,237

[Minseo screeching]

193
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,194
-[alumnus 5 shrieks]
-[alumnus 6 grunts]

194
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,404
Oh no!

195
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,990
[alumni murmuring]

196
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,826
[♪ music stops]

197
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,579
That's hilarious.

198
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,331
[Yubin] About Changsu.

199
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,041
What happened
between him and Yongjin?

200
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,419
Uh, did you say you were in Class 1?

201
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,755
-Yes.
-Then maybe you don't know.

202
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,424
The thing is…

203
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,593
The Awkward but Awesome Dancer Award
Prize: Massager

204
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,305
[Yubin] Your dance moves were so unique.

205
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,141
Clumsy but full of potential. [chuckles]

206
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,144
Are you teasing me? [scoffs]

207
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,605
Did you get any leads?

208
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,065
Yes, thanks to you.

209
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,316
[Minseo] Ugh, stop it.

210
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,403
I heard the name Changsu mentioned.

211
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,614
The two of them used to be quite close.

212
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,368
Then they fell out
over a minor misunderstanding.

213
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,746
After that,
Yongjin harassed Changsu persistently.

214
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,498
[Changsu groans]

215
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,291
[bully 1] Get up, you piece of shit.

216
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,127
Does that hurt? Get it together.

217
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,837
[Changsu whimpering]

218
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,714
Yongjin.

219
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,633
[Changsu] Please stop.

220
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,884
[smacks on floor]

221
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,263
Look, didn't I tell you
not to say my name again?

222
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,599
-Yongjin.
-[loud slap]

223
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,726
[groans in pain]

224
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,436
[shouting]
Did you not hear what I said?

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,271
[breathing heavily]

226
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,274
[Yubin] In the end,
Changsu dropped out of school.

227
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,319
But the bullying didn't stop.

228
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,404
[breathing shakily]

229
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,406
[♪ menacing music playing]

230
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,658
[Yongjin] Stop right there!

231
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,368
[bully 1] Stop there, Changsu!

232
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,161
[Yongjin] Don't let me catch you!

00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,747

236
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,675
[bullies panting]

237
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,263
[Yubin] Changsu got seriously injured
in an accident.

238
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,766
After that,
his classmates never heard from him again.

239
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,477
Were they not held responsible
for his injury?

240
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,480
They all tried to sweep it under the rug.

241
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,649
It was also difficult to prove

242
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,402
that his classmates were
directly responsible for the accident.

243
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,822
They were transferred to another school,
and that was it.

244
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,366
Choo Yongjin didn't strike me
as that kind of person.

245
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,579
I guess we'll have to inform
the Special Investigation Team of this.

246
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,123
Should I write up a report?

247
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,041
There's no need.

248
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,836
Why not?
We're off the kidnapping case now.

249
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
Yes, we are.

250
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,718
-Then why not?
-I'm a member of a research group.

251
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,637
It's called School Violence Prevention
by Improving the School Police System

252
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,806
through Legislative Measures.

253
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,601
-This will be a good case study.
-[Minseo] Mm.

254
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,562
There's a research group like that?

255
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,982
You just made that up, didn't you?

256
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,525
What are you talking about?

257
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,695
It really is called
School Violence Prevention

258
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,239
by Improving the School Police System
through Legislative Measures.

259
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,993

260

269
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,813
[Youngeun] Stop running.

270
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
The neighbors downstairs
will complain again.

271
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,608
Have they been complaining?

272
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,694
Then again, how would you know
what goes on at home?

273
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,071
You're never around.

274
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,657
It's been busy at work.

275
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,201
Why do you always work overtime
for nothing in return?

276
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,287
[sighs]
It's work. What can I do?

277
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,706
What are you up to anyway?

278
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm writing a script.

279
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,294
A script? What is it for?

280
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,672
[typing]

281
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,466
Remember that video I uploaded on YouTube?

282
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,885
[Youngeun] It got more views
than I expected,

283
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,846
so I'm thinking of adding
a voice-over this time.

284
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,265
That sounds like a hassle.

285
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,351
[irritated]
Who cares if it's a hassle?

286
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,895
Every penny counts.

287
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,440
[typing continues]

288
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,569
I'll work harder.

289
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,239
[Youngeun] What's the point?

290
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,368
Remember my friend Jieun?

291
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,996
The one who works
at the credit card company?

292
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,582
Her husband just got another promotion.

293
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,002
[Youngeun] She won't stop bragging
that he's now head of the team.

294
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,087
Any chance you'll get a promotion soon?

295
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,425
Promotions are rare in our force.

296
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
Honey.

297
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,556
Didn't you say headquarters
sent a team to your precinct?

298
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,058
How do you know about that?

299
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,311
You get more opportunities
at headquarters, don't you?

300
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,980
[Youngeun] We need to find
a daycare center for Sena next year.

301
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,692
Wasn't there a good one at headquarters?

302
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,861
There is, but…
[sighs]

303
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Yeah, you're right.

304
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,823
Exactly. You need to make them notice you.

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,368
[Youngeun] This could be your chance.
Grab it while you can.

306
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,499
Buttering people up isn't really my thing.

307
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,668
Do you think this is my thing too?

308
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,048
Do you think I'm doing YouTube
because I enjoy it?

309
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,758
[Youngeun] Ugh.

310
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,343
[tuts, groans]

311
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,429
I don't know why I bother talking to you.
This is going nowhere.

312
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,141
Have you ever seized an opportunity
in your life?

313
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,728
You missed out on the Olympics
at the last minute too.

314
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,896
Hey, Nam Youngeun.

315
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,273
Let's just drop it.

316
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,691
Drop what?

317
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,902
Did I say something wrong?

318
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,950
You blame me and Hana
for not making it to the Olympics.

319
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,914
Did you think I didn't know?

320

[leader] Hey.

329
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,037
Oh, actually, can I ask you a question?

330
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,914
You can ask two if you want.

331
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,750
It's nothing important,
but I'm looking for a place

332
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,460
that serves good hangover soup.

333
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,379
-Hangover soup?
-[Joongryeok] We don't do hangover soup.

334
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,673
-You don't? That's unexpected.
-Never touched it.

335
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,968
I see. All right, never mind then.

336
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,933
Why did you do that?
He's a big shot at headquarters.

337
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,228
Hey, that doesn't mean
he can be an asshole.

338
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,981
Be careful.

339
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,692
If you so much as talk to them,
you're a traitor.

340
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,570
What are you talking about?
Why would I talk to them?

341
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,365
-Come on.
-[Joongryeok] I'm warning you.

342
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,661
As you know, I'm in a tight spot,
and I was wondering if you could…

343
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,412
You can't?

344
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,374
Is there really no way?

345
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,210
All right.

346
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,419
No, don't apologize.

347
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,547
Hmm?

348
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,007
What do you mean?

349
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,844
[alumnus 2] Someone asked me
about Changsu at the reunion,

350

00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,186
[Junghwan] But to get a compliment,

528
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,231
you have to betray your friends.

529
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,359
What would you do?

530
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,860
What kind of compliment?

531
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,155
It's just a figure of speech,
so it doesn't matter.

532
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,782
What do you mean by "betray"?

533
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,371
Again, it's just a figure of speech,
so it doesn't matter.

534
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,915
Mister.

535
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,212
I've decided to look up to you.

536
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,299
Me? You look up to me?

537
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,301
So please don't disappoint me.

538
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,846
[Donggoo] By turning your back
on your friends,

539
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,389
you're not just betraying them.

540
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,891
You're also betraying yourself
and even me.

541
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,976
Got it?

542
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,159
[both continue sipping]

543
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,123
Captain, Lee Changsu isn't the kidnapper.

544
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,083
He died three years ago.

545
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,296
-Does he have any family?
-He has an older sister named Lee Mijeong.

546
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,133
We're at Ms. Lee Mijeong's place
right now, sir.

547
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,304
The landlord says
she's been away for a long time.

548
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,181
Yes.

549
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,975
[Junghwan] Other than that,
she used to work at a nearby restaurant,

550
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,853
so we'll drop by on our way back.

552
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,232
Hey, Tansik. It's me.

553
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,610
Can you look up some pills for me?
I'll give you the names.

554
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,863
I'm not talking about illegal drugs.
These are prescribed pills.

555

[restaurant owner]
Mijeong was kind-hearted and hardworking.

556
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,078
She sacrificed her entire youth
for her little brother.

557
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,289
It seems like she was on medication.

558

[restaurant owner groans]

559
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,835
She struggled a lot
after her brother's death.

560

[restaurant owner]
She couldn't do anything,

561
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,421
and she even started hallucinating.

562
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,758
I heard she was hospitalized
for a few months.

563
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,676
[restaurant owner]
When she started feeling better,

564
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,762
I told her to come back to work.

565
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,555
When did she quit?

566
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,143
[inhales deeply]
Was it three months ago?

567
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,981
She said she was unwell.
That was the last I heard from her.

568
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,149
[Joongryeok] Ma'am.

569
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,611
How long do those cameras
store the footage for?

570
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,571
For three months, I think.

571
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,658
Oh, it's a hassle to check it though.

572
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,660
You have to call someone in
and everything.

573
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
Too bad.

Ma'am?

578
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,808
[Minseo] Lee Changsu fell into a coma

00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,894
after the car accident in high school.

580
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,564
And Lee Mijeong
was the one who took care of him.

581
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,816
[Minseo] The hospital confirmed

582
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,110
that he passed away three years ago.

583
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,446
After his death, Lee Mijeong
suffered from anxiety, depression,

584
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,158
panic attacks, and hallucinations
and was hospitalized for a while.

585
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,953
She doesn't seem suspicious.
Everyone says she was nice.

586
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,998
Yes, she does have a good reputation.

587

Also, she hasn't been prescribed
any pills in a year.

Did you check the CCTV footage
from the restaurant?

Stay back.

892
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,235
I have something to tell her.

893
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,362
I just need a second.

894
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,258

I'm really sorry.

899
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,946
[Yongjin] I shouldn't have done that…

900
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,492
-[breaking into tears]
-…to Changsu.

901
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,578
Changsu…

902
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,416
didn't deserve it.

903
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,002
[wailing]

904
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,269

911
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,140
And load this up in the car in advance.

912
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,432

What's this?

922
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,719
It's from Jung Junghwan, Jang Junghwan,
or whatever his name is,

923
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,637
from the Violent Crimes Team.

Jang Janghwan?

Who's that?

926
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,101
Or was his name Wang Joongwang?

927
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,145
Anyway, he said you'd know who he is.

928

[Junghwan] Dear Mr. Choi Hyeonseong.

932
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:25,368
It's been an honor serving you,

even if it was brief.

934
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,584
I've learned invaluable lessons

935
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,961
while serving you.

936
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,257
If I get the chance to work with you
at headquarters,

937
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,177
I promise to stick by your side

938

Until you become commissioner,

00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,440
stay healthy with a full head of hair

941
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,275
and be happy.

942
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,361
Hair!

943
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,696
[chuckles meekly] That came out wrong.

From Jung Junghwan,

Is this bastard teasing me?

[♪ music stops abruptly]

949
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,542

Then I'll throw this away, sir.

00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,503
No, wait.

951
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,131
I'm getting a lot of gray hair these days.

952
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,841
-Are you losing hair?
-[Hyeonseong] No.

[narrator] Next time on Seoul Busters.

957
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,614

959
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,868
-What's up with Detective Jang?
-[Minseo] He knew the victim.

960
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,747
I'll catch the killer with my own hands.

[narrator] Tansik is determined
to catch the killer.

962
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,670
[Minseo] There was a fight
right before the incident?

963
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,588
[narrator] Meanwhile,
the Violent Crimes Team

964
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,840
goes into a club undercover.

965
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,049
[Joongryeok] Hold on!

966
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,551
You want to bow to me, don't you?

967
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,886
[narrator] They start looking for leads.

968
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,638
I got you dead to rights.

969
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,308
[narrator] But the investigation
hits a brick wall.

970
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,601
-[all] Whoa!
-[Tansik] Looks like we got a flat tire.

971
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:16,104
[narrator] The team is back at square one.

972
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,857
[Yubin] You should give it a try,
Detective Jang.

973
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,400
Give it a try.

974
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,278
Will the Violent Crimes Team
be able to catch the killer?

975
