about indigestion after eating late.

00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,157
Thanks. You're the best.

187
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,243
Oh! This looks done.

188
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,704
Here you go, Officer Seo Minseo.

189
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,289
It looks delicious.

190
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,043
After you.

191
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,378
Here.

192
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,006
-How is it? Good, right?
-[Jiseok] Mmm!

193
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,011
Let's go for some beef
when I get paid next month.

194
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,264
No. Wait until I pass the exam,
and I'll treat you to beef.

195
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,349

196
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,684
-Prime cuts it is.

The NFS is analyzing the dashcam footage.

204
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,199
They'll send us the enhanced footage
tomorrow at the earliest.

205
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,784
All right. Good work.

206
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,662
-Detective Jung, please see it through.
-Yes, sir.

207
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,956
[Yubin] Dating violence
is on the rise in our jurisdiction.

208
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,041
How are you dealing with that,
Detective Seo?

00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,046
Detective Seo?

00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,175
Uh...

211
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,095
You weren't listening.

00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,361
I have everything under control, sir.

217
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,866
Just because we're in a daycare center
doesn't mean you can act like kids.

218
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,577
Do I really need to remind you
to pay attention during meetings?

219
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,620
[both softly] I'm sorry, sir.

220
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,124
I don't want any half-baked excuses
from either of you.

221
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,168
Sorry?

222
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,003
Wait, since there are two of you,

223
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,672
it must be a fully-baked excuse.

224
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
Oh!

225
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,843
A half-baked excuse from each of you
would add up to a fully-baked excuse,

226
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,429
just like when you double
the cooking time.

It wasn't meant to be funny.

230
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,687
I know. Your joke was hilarious,
but it didn't make me laugh.

231
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,397
[Yubin] Anyway, pay attention, everyone.

232
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,065
Detective Seo,
how many dating violence cases

233
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,151
have there been
in our jurisdiction so far?

Well... Can you hand me

[Minseo] The one on the left down there.

She's a stranger?

250
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
Are you sure?

251
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,979
I've never seen her before.

252
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,647
Did you say you live alone?

253
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,691
Yes, I live alone.

254
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,279
[tearfully] I found out that
she was living with my boyfriend.

255
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,866
We're engaged.

256
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,661
[sobbing] I visited his place
because I couldn't reach him,

257
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,082
and I found her there.

258
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,669
[Tansik] This doesn't add up.

259
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,588
She claims her boyfriend lives there,

260
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,464
but the victim lives alone,

261
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,341
and the guy was nowhere to be found.

262
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,469
Maybe she got
the wrong address or apartment.

263
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,430
That can't be it.

264
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,765
She even brought tools
to break open the door.

265
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,268
That means it wasn't impulsive.

266
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,353
She must've been
monitoring the victim for a while.

267
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,398
Then what should we do, sir?

268
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,775
[Joongryeok] What else?
There's nothing more to it.

269
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,112
She was caught in the act of
breaking and entering, so it's game over.

270
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,447
Should we hand her over right away?

271
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,867
Hmm...

What made you believe
your boyfriend lived in that apartment?

277
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,645
He said it was provided

278
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,230
by the National Intelligence Service.

279
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,649
The National Intelligence Service?

280
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735

[♪ mellow music playing]

282
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,241
[suspect] He explained that's why
I couldn't meet him even if I came over.

283
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,118
He just asked me to bring some items

284
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,455
and leave them at the door.

285
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,876
How did you two first meet?

286
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,381
We met on MyHeart.

[Yubin] MyHeart? What's that?

288
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,218
[Tansik] It's a dating app.

289
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,553
It's popular with young people.

290
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,641
[Yubin] So they met on the app?
Is that where she got his address?

291
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,476
She believed he lived in a safe house

292
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,561
-provided by the NIS.
-A safe house?

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,981
The Intelligence Service
isn't your neighborhood car service.

294
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,149
That's just too far-fetched.

295
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,944
She lives in a student apartment.
Is she looking for a job?

296
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,904
She's studying for the civil servant exam.

[Minseo] After dating online
for about a month,

311
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,431
they agreed to get married.

312
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,686
[Junghwan] She got engaged without
seeing his face or knowing his name?

313
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,813
Does she think marriage is a joke?

314
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,023
You can do that...

315
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,026
when you're in love.

316
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,321
How much money did she lose?

317
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,739
[Minseo] Around 400 million won.

318
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,199
[gasps]
400 million won?

319
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,326
Where did she get all that money?

320
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,787
She borrowed money from people
by making up excuses,

321
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,331
-[flustered sigh]
-and she even took out private loans.

322
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,041
[Junghwan sighs]
How is that even possible?

323
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,584
You can do that when you're in love.

324
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,128
[loudly]
Why are you going on about love?

325
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,839
[Junghwan]
Anyway, how did he ask her for money?

326
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,674
He told her that he was a secret agent

327
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,928
and that he lost some funds
for his operation.

328
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,763
He said he was going to inherit a fortune,

329
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,308
and they could move abroad together
once everything was settled.

330
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,476
Something like that.

331
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,061
[Junghwan] I'm baffled.

332
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,813
How could she believe that?

333
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,356
Because she loved him!

00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,572
Because she loved him.

336
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,994
[Yubin] As soon as she sent the money,
he ghosted her.

337
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,704
And when she visited his address,

338
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,457
she found another woman living there.
Is that it?

339
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,251
I hear a sound.

340
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,002
The sound of her world
crumbling around her.

341
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,963
[Yubin] It's a typical romance scam.

342
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,422

Since you're an expert in love.

349
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,232
Do we know anything else?

350
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,693
[Minseo] They video chatted once.

351
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,489
Things will settle down soon.

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,491

00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,870
Oh.

354
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,747
I have to go. My boss needs me right away.

355
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,291
[Eunkyung] This is a deepfake.

356
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,627
Non-experts may have trouble
discerning it,

357
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,048
but I actually have a degree
in AI. [chuckles]

358
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:40,262
So I ran an analysis on the video,

359
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,142
and this one frame had an error,

715
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,307
Sweet and sour pork! Sweet and sour pork!

[Joongryeok] What's that over there?

717

[police chief]
You know Professor Sim, right?

724
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,042
This is a producer
from the broadcasting station.

725
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,585

I'm Kim Jimin, the producer
of Remaking of Crime.

It's a pleasure.

728
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,633
Let's have a seat and chat.

729
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,804

[Junghwan] Any progress?

733
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,441
[Joongryeok] Progress, my foot.

734
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,234
Such a waste of time and energy.

735
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,030
Jeez. Donggoo, that little brat
won't give me a break.

736
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,239
What about him?

737
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,950
Hey, I heard your ATM is out of order.
That's great.

738
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,410
Team up with him from tomorrow.

739
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,537
-Sorry?
-What are you talking about?

740
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,914
I have a ton of cases to work on.

741
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,292
Hey, since when did our team
become so lax?

742
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,668
[loudly] Don't you worry!

743
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,920
I'll take up the slack.

744
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,340
If Detective Jung is busy,
I'll go out alone starting tomorrow.

745
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,508
I can't trust you.

746
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,301
-Just sit back down.
-Okay.

747
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,637
[Joongryeok] Jeez. What is it now?

748
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,223
You can't barge in here like this, ma'am!

749
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,058
Who said you could come in?

750
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,352
-Thank you.
-That's Detective Seo.

751

Minseo?

752
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,981
Ta-da.

753
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,525
Wow!

754
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,985
-Are you kidding me?
-I want one with pills.

755
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,112
Come on.
