I heard you're working on
a romance scam case.

00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,925
We're planning to cover
that topic on our show,

and we were wondering
if you could help us gather information.

8
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,016
Of course.
It's a perfect topic for a TV show.

00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,642
Right, Captain Dongbang?

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,479
I don't think it's appropriate
to cover an ongoing case on TV.

is the secret to your high-quality show.

I think this case could benefit
from data mining.

76
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,201
Most scam cases follow the same method.

77
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,745
No matter how much data you collect,
it won't help identify the perp.

78
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,081
Often, the MO remains consistent.

79
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,583
It'd be faster to narrow down suspects
using personation.

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,835
That approach requires substantial input,

81
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,422

can hinder the investigation.

into the communication investigation?

85
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,681
Romance scams primarily occur online,

86
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,140

You might be influenced

89
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,647
That's also known as inference.

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,649
It's a classic investigative method.

91
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,360
[Yubin] To me, it sounds more progressive
than classic.

92
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,029
[Prof. Sim] You can't have progressiveness
without conservatism.

93
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,739
[Yubin] That depends on the perspective.

94
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,492
Don't overlook that the nearness principle
and the circle hypothesis,

95
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,286
which form the basis
of geographic profiling,

96
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,496

Relying solely on origins

[Yubin] I don't know
what you're talking about.

Has Jiseok played tennis for long?

772

[Minseo] It's been his long-time hobby.

How did you know that?

774
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,533
He got a wreath from a tennis club.

"CONGRATS, FROM LET'S TENNIS"

776
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,162
Plus, he keeps rubbing his elbow,
as if he's developing tennis elbow.

777
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,916
By the way,
his watch has a lot of scratches

778
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,836
despite it being new.

779
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,673
It shows that he's often lost control
over his body.

780
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,634
Also, it looks like he bites his nails,

781
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,262
which is common for addicts.

782
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,723

No matter how busy he is,

it's strange for a groom

00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,857
