00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,543
Seoul Busters

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,920
Guys, this is the interrogation room.

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,380
It's used for interrogation.

4
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,050
I see.

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,176
We interrogate people here…

6
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,260
Minseo.

7
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,471
You left this out of the reimbursement.

8
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,097
Thank you, thank you.

9
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,017
Anyway,
how much longer will that tour take?

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,310
It's almost over.

11
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,812
A daycare center full of high schoolers?

12
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,192
I can't tell if I'm at school or at work.

13
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,237
Hey, stop scratching your head
and just wash your hair already.

14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,990
It doesn't itch that badly yet.

15
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,661
Seriously, people shouldn't
wash their hair every day.

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,497
-We live in a water-stressed country.
-Listen.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,250
I bet camels in the desert
wash up more often than you.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,460
Hmph.

19
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,296
By the way,
does that boy know Detective Jang?

20
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,756
He's sticking so close to him.

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,508
He looks up to our rookie.

22
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,967
He looks up to Jang Tansik?

23
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,094
-Yes.
-Why?

24
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,181
The boy's father once got involved
in a road debris accident,

25
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,100
and Detective Jang tracked down the perp.

26
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,810
-Is everything clear?
-Yes.

27
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,645
What's this?
300 won for craft sticks?

28
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,980
Remember when we captured that wanted man

29
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,482
-outside the stationery store?
-Yes.

30
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,151
We accidentally damaged
some craft sticks in the process.

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,529
And the store owner demanded 300 won.

32
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,656
For the damages?

33
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,491
Yeah, can you believe it?

34
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,326
Please make sure I get reimbursed.

35
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,994
I paid for it out of my own pocket.

36
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,663
Junghwan.

37
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,963
This is 100 won short.

38
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,925
Anyway, please reimburse me.

39
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,426
I'll reimburse you 100 won.

40
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,220
You've already been paid 200 won.

41
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,222
-But still--
-Go away.

42
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,686
-Bye.
-See you.

43
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,479
You're so handsome.

44
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,814
-Bye.
-Take care.

45
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,399
-See you.
-Bye.

46
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,487
-Tansik, take this.
-What's this?

47
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,074
I told my dad I was coming here,
and he wanted me to give this to you.

48
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,118
He didn't have to.

49
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,707
What bold colors.

50
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,584
-Right?
-Yeah.

51
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,918
Thanks. I appreciate it.

52
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,172
Beomjoon, don't eat
instant noodles too often.

53
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,464
You should eat well.

54
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,134
How did you know
I had instant noodles for lunch?

55
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,471
I have a really good sense of smell.

56
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,433
Oh, you're like Sherlock Holmes.

57
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,310
-You should get going.
-Okay, see you.

58
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,103
-Say hi to your father for me.
-Will do.

59
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,814
-Bye.
-Bye.

60
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,653
Why are you just standing there, sir?

61
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,280
You guys were blocking the way.

62
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,324
Oh. Sorry about that.

63
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,160
Ah.

64
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,663
-How did you know he had instant noodles?
-Instant noodles?

65
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,498
Ah.

66
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,083
I just smelled them.

67
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,711
If you ask me how I did that…

68
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,591
All I can say is that I smelled them,
so I said he smelled like them.

69
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,552
Then can you figure out
what I had for lunch?

70
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,056
Let me give it a try.

71
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,310
Please excuse me.

72
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,090
I'm not sure.

73
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,174
I don't smell anything.

74
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,384
That's incredible.

75
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,885
I haven't had lunch yet!

76
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,303
Ah.

77
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,223
You must have extremely well-developed
olfactory neurons.

78
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,475
The human nose is
one of the oldest sensory organs,

79
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,813
yet its exact method of detecting smells
remains to be fully understood.

80
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,399
In short,
it's an incredibly mysterious organ.

81
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,401
You must be…

82
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,153
…a natural-born…

83
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,572
…bloodhound.

84
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,034
Oh, I'm no match for a dog.

85
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,661
Dogs are amazing.

86
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,870
Don't say that.

87
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,000
I think you might be
even better than a dog.

88
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,628
You really have the nose of a dog.

89
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,588
Are you calling me a dog?

90
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm flattered.

91
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,891
Would you like to try these on, sir?

92
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,478
-What are these?
-They're top-quality socks.

93
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,732
Wow. "Nice."

94
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,985
Guess this brand is popular
with young people these days.

95
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,298
Is that a person?

96
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,633
Excuse me.

97
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,427
Hello?

98
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,363
Seoul Busters

99
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:08,284
Episode 9

100
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,454
Keep up the good work.

101
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,830
Captain.

102
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,250
A resident found the body
on his way to church this morning

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,796
and called the police right away,
around 4:05 a.m.

104
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,214
I see.

105
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,965
What's up with Detective Jang?

106
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,843
He knew the victim.
You see, the other day--

107
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,929
-"Nice."
-What do you mean, nice?

108
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,474
The victim is the father of the boy
from the recent tour.

109
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,226
How do you know that?

110
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,310
His socks.

111
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,938
And the weapon?

112
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,942
They didn't find it at the scene,
so they're searching the area.

113
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,653
But they haven't found anything yet.
We're still looking.

114
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,281
-Check the CCTVs and dashcams first.
-Yes, sir.

115
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,163
The body is badly mangled.

116
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,499
Judging by the wounds,

117
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,960
he must've been struck
with a blunt weapon.

118
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,213
Not just once but multiple times.

119
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,632
It doesn't seem premeditated though.

120
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:09,178
I'm not so sure.
It might not have been a chance event.

121
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,186
That's hot!

122
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,230
Are you okay, sir?

123
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,441
Here, it's piping hot.

124
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,900
Okay, thanks.

125
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,235
Sure. Here.

126
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,692
CCTV facing another direction

127
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,364
A dead end

128
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,618
Red bricks

129
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,012
Hold on a second.

130
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,060
This is like looking for a needle in…
What was it?

131
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,854
-A haystack?
-Exactly.

132
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,065
Hey, have you found anything?

133
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,691
No, nothing yet.

134
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,109
Oh! I found it!

135
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,819
-Under your right foot.
-Where?

136
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,530
That's it, right? Captain!

137
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,114
We found it.

138
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,201
The victim is Mr. Yoon Haesik.

139
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,079
He sold items like socks from a truck.

140
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,249
The weapon, a brick,
was found at a nearby construction site,

141
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,710
with blood matching that of the victim.

142
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,088
I knew something was off.

143
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,006
I had a hunch.

144
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,176
Since the weapon was found on the street,
we can assume it was manslaughter.

145
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
Everything's falling into place.

146
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,389
It's the work of a mugger.

147
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,767
Considering the method and the scene,
it's 100% a mug--

148
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,851
It wasn't a mugger.

149
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,728
No, it wasn't.

150
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,566
A mugger wouldn't have been this cruel.

151
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,901
So the killer's too cruel to be a mugger?

152
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,071
Most wounds were inflicted
after the victim lost consciousness,

153
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,323
and they were focused on his face.

154
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,741
There were emotions involved.

155
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,953
Should I remind you
how cruel muggers can be?

156
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,831
In the mugging case in 2009
at the Mullae-dong Intersection,

157
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,915
the victim--

158
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,084
Nothing was stolen,
so it couldn't have been a mugger.

159
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,210
Nothing was stolen?

160
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,337
Nothing at all.

161
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,506
I don't know what exactly happened,

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,342
but how could someone
murder another person so brutally?

163
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,139
I'll…

164
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,934
catch the killer with my own hands.

165
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,686
Are you okay, Tansik?

166
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,480
Tansik!

167
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,774
What's up with him?

168
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,026
He knew the victim.

169
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,908
Why are you back?

170
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,704
I realized the meeting wasn't over yet.

171
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,998
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
Don't worry about it.

173
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,337
It's likely that the murder
was motivated by a grudge.

174
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,882
Let's find those
who held a grudge against the victim.

175
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,092
Mr. Yoon was a really nice person.

176
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,303
I doubt anyone held a grudge against him.

177
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,929
We'll see about that.

178
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,431
We'll catch the killer.

179
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,141
This is so unlike you.

180
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,726
Let's catch the bastard.

181
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,354
Do you recognize him?

182
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,064
He lived around here for a long time.

183
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,398
Don't get me started.

184
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,443
-Yoon, the socks seller, was notorious.
-Also known as Mad Dog.

185
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,569
Right, right?

186
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,737
"Mad Dog"?

187
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,946
Right, right.

188
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,741
Did he often clash with his neighbors?

189
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,825
Right, right.

190
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,952
And a lot of people
held grudges against him?

191
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,037
Right, right.

192
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,622
Including you two?

193
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,374
Nuh-uh.

194
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,458
Nuh-uh?

195
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,086
You mean no.

196
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,545
Right, right.

197
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,422
Right, right. Of course not.

198
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,928
I'm sorry, but may I use your restroom?

199
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,806
It's being repaired. Right?

200
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,767
You'll have to use the one
at the cell phone store nearby. Right?

201
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,645
I can't hold it much longer.
Where did you say the restroom was?

202
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,524
Just go out and turn at the toast shop.
You'll see the phone store there.

203
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,192
Sorry, I have to run.

204
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,861
She really needed to go.

205
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,321
Right, right?

206
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,282
-Here you go, sir.
-Thanks.

207
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,703
He was involved in many incidents.

208
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,121
Like what?

209
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,289
He was reported every other day.

210
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,710
I need a copy of this,
so grab me a pen and paper.

211
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,628
Sorry?

212
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,589
It'll take forever to copy this by hand.

213
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,841
Why not just take a picture?

214
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,427
Officer Jang, was it?

215
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,805
Are you one to give advice?

216
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,559
I obviously don't carry a camera around.

217
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,352
You could use your phone--

218
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,062
I don't have it on me.

219
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,609
Oh, that's my alarm.
I carry around my alarm clock.

220
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,320
Should I take a picture
and send it to you?

221
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,322
-I have my reasons for what I do.
-Of course.

222
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,871
Yunpyeong Precinct Report Log

223
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,122
Here you go, sir.

224
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,670
-Grab me a pen in a different color.
-Yes, sir.

225
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,598
NEULBIT FUNERAL HALL

226
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,518
Beomjoon.

227
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,981
Was there anyone
who was on bad terms with your father?

228
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:58,068
Not that I know of.

229
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,322
I figured.

230
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,327
But does anyone come to mind?

231
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,038
Did he ever argue with anyone?

232
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,706
People he argued with?

233
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,876
There's Mr. Jang next door,

234
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,463
and then there's the supermarket lady,
the chicken joint guy,

235
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,466
the produce vendor, and the wallpaper guy.

236
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,135
Oh, and Pastor Yoon too.

237
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,930
-Even a pastor?
-Yes.

238
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,808
They even grabbed each other
by the collar.

239
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,603
But they made up soon after.

240
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,237
In a word,

241
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,113
he was our neighborhood's…

242
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,200
public enemy.

243
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,410
Public enemy?

244
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,997
He clashed with every single person
in the neighborhood.

245
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,833
When my house was being renovated,

246
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,378
he threatened to sue me
over the dust and noise.

247
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,713
But you managed to put up with him.

248
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,509
Was there anyone
who was on especially bad terms with him?

249
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,636
The one who was
on the worst terms with him?

250
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,056
I think he was equally on bad terms…

251
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,350
with everyone.

252
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,188
He may have been a bit of a hothead,

253
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,982
but his socks were excellent.

254
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,734
I know. I only wore his socks.

255
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,986
Me too.

256
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,154
His socks were so nice and sturdy.

257
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,406
They were the best.

258
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,157
They came in various colors too.

259
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
What a shame.

260
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,675
This is bad.

261
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,510
I've run out of chocolate.

262
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,017
Victim Yoon Haesik

263
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,521
There are way too many people
who held a grudge against him.

264
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,940
He was more of a brawler
than a socks seller.

265
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,025
"Enigma chocolate"

266
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,610
Still, his socks were amazing.

267
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,820
We have way too many suspects.

268
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,616
Start by checking their alibis.

269
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,118
Huh? All of them?

270
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,202
Sorry?

271
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,372
Yes, what else can we do?

272
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,751
"What else can we do?"
You must be kidding me!

273
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,544
That's going to take forever!

274
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,879
I'll work twice as hard.

275
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,381
Don't be absurd!
You'll only cause twice as much trouble.

276
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,300
-This time, I'll--
-Be quiet! Argh!

277
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,635
-Hey, hey!
-I'm sorry.

278
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,845
-Come on.
-You should've been more careful.

279
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,930
Purchase

280
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,975
-Hey! What do we do?
-I'm sorry.

281
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,144
Hey, watch out.
You'll get shocked.

282
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,197
You're still here.

283
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,783
Oh, Captain.

284
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,076
I'm off.

285
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,833
Something's bothering me.

286
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,837
But don't worry about it.

287
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,223
Captain.

288
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,978
I don't think
I'm cut out to be a detective.

289
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,066
I'm doing my best though.

290
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,150
"Chief Jung Jingyu"

291
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,735
I worked my butt off

292
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,571
to transfer from the traffic division
to the Violent Crimes Team.

293
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,656
Yes?

294
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,786
I dreamed of becoming a police officer
working in the field

295
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,122
and busting criminals.

296
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,373
Is that right?

297
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,291
This time,

298
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,878
I'm determined to catch the culprit
with my own hands.

299
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,463
Oh.

300
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,552
But I keep making mistakes
and causing others trouble.

301
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,348
I'm not sure
if I should even remain in the force.

302
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,733
Do you have any advice for me, sir?

303
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,402
-I have to go.
-You…

304
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,488
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

305
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,532
-What?
-What?

306
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,453
Oh.

307
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,621
I see.

308
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,709
What do you think we are?

309
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,587
We're…

310
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,297
the Violent Crimes Team.

311
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,843
I really think of us as a team.

312
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,141
Not everyone has to be a cleanup hitter.

313
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,269
That's not what makes a team strong.

314
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,271
You have a good nose.

315
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,273
-For cases?
-For instant noodles.

316
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,441
Instant noodles?

317
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,781
I'm sure there's a role for you
on our team.

318
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,459
Thank you, sir.

319
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,896
I ordered the classic flavor,

320
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,524
but I received the mint flavor.

321
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,153
No, I only eat the classic flavor.

322
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,365
You might not understand,
but this is an important matter to me.

323
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,991
I can't function without…

324
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,538
Sure. My username is Chocoholic.

325
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,152
Secondhand Marketplace

326
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:24,872
Swiss chocolate Enigma for sale

327
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,042
I'd like to buy all of them.

328
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,795
Sorry, I'm out of stock.

329
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,096
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

330
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,850
Manchester United
is winning four to zero.

331
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,314
Good morning, detectives!

332
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,775
You're full of energy this morning.
I'm scared.

333
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,695
We're in for trouble. My goodness.

334
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,323
At least he's not feeling down anymore.

335
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,491
Yeah, I'm glad you're feeling better.

336
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,368
-Thank you, sir!
-Sit down.

337
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,955
Good morning, sir.

338
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,582
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir!

339
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,461
Good morning, everyone.

340
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,797
Do we know
what Mr. Yoon was up to earlier that day?

341
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,551
We're struggling to track
his last location via CCTV footage.

342
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,845
By the way,
did you not sleep well last night?

343
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,971
I'm fine.

344
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,307
Did you try tracking his phone?

345
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,519
His phone is so old
that the GPS doesn't work.

346
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,105
His phone was turned off
before the incident,

347
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,691
so we can't really track it.

348
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,529
Check out this guy, Seo Mincheol.

349
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,281
He runs a hardware store.

350
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,117
He often clashed
with the victim over parking,

351
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,578
and he has multiple assault charges
on his record.

352
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,373
I have a feeling he's the culprit.

353
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,707
When did they clash?

354
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,543
About three months ago, I think.

355
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,762
So three months
after clashing over parking,

356
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,390
this guy suddenly murders the victim?

357
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,310
Sometimes,
people bottle things up,

358
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,688
and then they just snap.

359
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,314
Does that never happen to you?

360
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,733
Losing your temper
over something in the past?

361
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,069
No, that's never happened to me, ever.

362
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,320
Uh…

363
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,863
-Detective Moo.
-Yes?

364
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,241
Detectives Jung and Jang.

365
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,952
I told you ages ago
to renew your firearm permits,

366
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,205
and I just got a notification
that you still haven't.

367
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,875
Do I really have to stay
on top of every little thing?

368
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,502
It slipped my mind.

369
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
I'll take care of it right away.

370
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,630
All right.

371
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
He's acting weird today.

372
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,350
Is he dozing off?

373
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,687
Whoa! He's up, he's up.

374
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,771
Tansik, sit down.

375
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,817
Safe Songwon, Trustworthy Police

376
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,569
Oh my. Hey!

377
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,239
Who are you talking to? Me?

378
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,657
Just a second.

379
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,578
You haven't changed a bit.

380
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,955
You're as attractive as ever.

381
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,251
I knew I smelled testosterone in the air.

382
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,503
-How have you been?
-Who are you?

383
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,799
I only smell his sweat.

384
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,135
-Don't tell me…
-Do you know her?

385
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,262
She once got caught
cashing in forged gift vouchers.

386
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,430
What's she in for this time?

387
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,766
She smuggled knockoffs
and sold them on social media.

388
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,685
Knockoffs? I didn't realize
people still sold those.

389
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,522
Detective, they're hotter than ever.

390
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,940
Then again…

391
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,986
…you're clearly not into fashion.

392
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,114
Huh? What?

393
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,658
-Anyway, that's clever of you.
-What do you mean?

394
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,119
You're sticking with him
to make yourself look good.

395
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,789
You sly little fox.

396
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,956
You're being ridiculous.

397
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,875
-You sly fox.
-I look 1,000 times better than him!

398
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,668
My wife picked out these clothes for me.

399
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,671
-Huh? Whoa! Is that a Patel Flip?
-What?

400
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,465
I mean his watch.

401
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,549
It is, right?

402
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,969
I didn't expect to see one here.

403
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,055
Patel what? Is this expensive?

404
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,765
Totally. It costs more than 50.

405
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,644
50 won? Hey, is this a toy?

406
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,480
I mean 50 million won,
not 50 won.

407
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,274
-50 million won?
-Yeah!

408
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,110
It costs 50 million won.

409
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,654
Jeez.

410
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,531
-Wow…
-I can't believe this guy.

411
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,907
So this was a knockoff?

412
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,451
-No, it's…
-Have you no shame?

413
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,911
You're wearing a knockoff watch?

414
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,163
-Good grief.
-A knockoff?

415
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,915
-Go in.
-Bye!

416
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:37,999
Tansik.

417
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,087
How embarrassing.
You should know better than that. Tsk.

418
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,422
But this…

419
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,174
It's important to be humbled sometimes.

420
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,718
You're a detective,
for crying out loud. Tsk.

421
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,470
It was a gift.

422
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,268
Hey, your watch is blinding me.

423
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,394
I won't wear it again, sir.

424
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,770
I just grabbed a random watch.

425
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,564
So that's not the only knockoff you have?

426
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,525
I'm just curious.

427
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,026
Why did you buy a knockoff?

428
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,820
It was a gift.

429
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:10,615
Who had the nerve to give you
such an obvious knockoff as a gift?

430
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,368
I'm sure their whole life is fake!

431
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,786
My grandma gave it to me.

432
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,496
She has good taste.

433
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,581
You think so?

434
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,250
Yeah, that watch is really stylish
for a knockoff.

435
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,422
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

436
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,091
-Detective Jung.
-Yeah?

437
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,970
Beomjoon says
Mr. Yoon wasn't a bad person.

438
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,054
Beomjoon is his son.

439
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,223
Even Lee Wanyong,
who sold out our country,

440
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,850
was a loving dad to his son.

441
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,020
When it comes to people,
there's always more than meets the eye.

442
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,651
Bestsellers!

443
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,115
Made-in-Korea Socks, Wholesale and Retail

444
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,200
Hi there.

445
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,498
Hello?

446
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,708
Ah.

447
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,463
Hey, who are you?

448
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,298
You're so cute.

449
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,466
Are you cold?

450
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,637
Is this yours?

451
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,972
This will keep you warm.

452
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,894
Nice and warm, right?

453
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,521
So warm.

454
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,107
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

455
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,567
Bang!

456
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,278
Who are you?

457
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,198
Why did you put my scarf on the dog?

458
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,742
Who the hell are you? A dog seller?

459
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,161
No, I'm not.

460
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,625
Mr. Yoon was kind of short-fused,

461
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,669
but he was incredibly hard-working.

462
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,672
I feel so sorry for him.

463
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,967
Do you know where he usually did business?

464
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,304
Socks sellers don't stay in one place
as produce vendors do.

465
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,473
They travel from place to place.

466
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,766
I see.

467
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,852
Look at you.
My scarf looks better on you than on me.

468
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,937
You can keep it.

469
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,652
Shit Well Daycare Center

471
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,071
Songwon Police Station
has moved to a temporary location

472
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,825
None of the neighbors
seem suspicious. Don't you think?

473
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,327
Captain.

474
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,163
We may have gotten the wrong idea.

475
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,541
Many people described Mr. Yoon
as a bad person,

476
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,835
but from his point of view,
the situation was different.

477
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,420
He had his reasons.

478
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,671
He had his reasons?

479
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,007
It all depends on perspective.

480
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,843
Look.

481
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,179
The lady from the supermarket
referred to Mr. Yoon as "Mad Dog."

482
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,389
But it turns out…

483
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,934
she built an illegal structure
in her backyard for storage

484
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,894
and clashed with Mr. Yoon over it.

485
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,022
The assault case is the same.

486
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,900
The victim had been scamming
elderly neighbors.

487
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,946
"Mr. Yoon persistently harassed
a civil servant."

488
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,867
In reality, he was simply asking them
to fix a pothole.

489
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,494
It had been neglected since last summer.

490
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,579
What's your point?

491
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,041
Mr. Yoon wasn't harassing people.

492
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,959
-His sense of justice--
-Detective Jang.

493
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,379
What we're looking for
is cause and effect,

494
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,464
not good versus evil.

495
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,759
-Sorry?
-Whether you personally think

496
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,428
Yoon Haesik was a good or bad person

497
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,139
has nothing to do with the case.

498
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,433
I suppose you're right, sir.

499
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,270
Has anyone found out more
about what Mr. Yoon was up to that day?

500
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,231
I'm finding out
where he usually did his business

501
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,276
and securing dashcam footage
from the buses in those areas.

502
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,653
All right.

503
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,363
Let's keep searching.

504
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,955
You did well.

505
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,249
You know how Captain can be.

506
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,973
Beomjoon

507
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,810
My dad sent me this picture
on the day of the incident.

508
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,770
Just in case it helps.

509
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,022
Detective Seo,
take a look at this.

510
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,819
Beomjoon sent me a picture of Mr. Yoon
taken on the day of the incident.

511
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,698
It's just a selfie.
All you see is his face.

512
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,867
Did he say anything else?

513
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,536
He just sent me this picture.

514
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,578
-Mr. Yoon!
-Hey, Officer Jang!

515
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,332
Did you eat?

516
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,667
Yes.

517
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,295
Seems like you had fermented soybean stew.

518
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,010
Anyway, what brings you here?

519
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,345
Did you get in trouble again?

520
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,639
No, that's not it.

521
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,393
I brought something for you. Here.

522
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,231
They're new designs.

523
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,734
Considering how well-built you are,

524
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,028
I thought they'd look great on you.

525
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,404
Thank you.

526
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,114
I hope you like them.

527
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,699
And you should eat well.

528
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,618
-I will.
-I'll get going.

529
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,286
Thank you.

530
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,704
Mr. Yoon…

531
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,665
Thank you, sir!

532
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,811
Captain, I think I found
where Mr. Yoon did business that day.

533
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,650
I started by investigating the areas
where he usually conducted business.

534
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,403
Pay attention to the trash bag behind him.

535
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,239
It's from Gangnam-gu.

536
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,574
Considering the color scheme of the sign,

537
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,034
this appears to be All Day Mart.

538
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,119
Once I brightened the image,

539
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,288
I noticed an apartment building
marked "Building 304."

540
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,958
In this vicinity, there are
a total of eight apartment complexes

541
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,167
with a Building 304.

542
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,878
Judging by the typeface, this appears
to be Cheongdam LH Apartment Complex 3.

543
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,923
You can see the sun setting
to the left of the building,

544
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,925
indicating it faces south.

545
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,512
The convenience store
is on the left side of the building.

546
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,683
I identified
three convenience stores in that area.

547
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,894
Street View confirmed
that the picture was taken…

548
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,024
in front of the second branch
of All Day Mart on Cheongdam Intersection.

549
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,654
How… did you do all that?

550
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,408
I analyzed a lot of CCTV footage
in the traffic division.

551
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,578
Mm. Great job, Detective Jang.
You did well.

552
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,914
Now that the location has been identified,
let's start from there.

553
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,208
Secure the CCTV footage.

554
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,501
Yes, sir.

555
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,095
-Hey.
-Well done. You nailed it.

556
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,696
No.

557
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,160
No.

558
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,127
No.

559
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,131
No.

560
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,303
Here's the CCTV footage.

561
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,308
That really is Mr. Yoon.

562
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,352
There was a fight
right before the incident?

563
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,271
That can't be a coincidence.

564
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,190
Of course not.
That guy's the culprit.

565
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,817
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

566
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,819
We can't really see the guy's face.

567
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,155
-Can you go back three seconds?
-Sorry?

568
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,907
Go back three seconds.

569
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,039
His face is completely hidden.

570
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,999
It's difficult to see.

571
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,210
Difficult to see? There's nothing to see.

572
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,796
Ask the National Forensic Service

573
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,923
-to enhance the video quality.
-Yes, sir.

574
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,676
What can they possibly do
with this useless footage?

575
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,928
What about the banner?

576
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,139
I put one up in front of the store
where everyone can see it.

577
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,224
All right.

578
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,351
Witnesses Needed

579
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,853
Looking for witnesses who saw
an altercation with a sock seller

580
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,021
10 p.m. on December 21, 2023

581
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,065
I wasn't sure when I saw the news,

582
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,568
but then I realized it was the same date.

583
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,613
It was my friend's birthday that day.

584
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,323
Happy birthday!

585
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,200
Thanks, guys!

586
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,838
-This guy kept hitting on me.
-Come with me.

587
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,256
I'm with my friends!

588
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,301
I was about to take a taxi,
but he followed me out

589
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,886
and insisted on giving me a ride.

590
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,599
That's when a man selling things
from a truck stepped in.

591
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,686
In the end,
they got into a fight.

592
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,312
Did you call the police?

593
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,275
I thought it was just a minor scuffle.

594
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,992
You might have to come back
a few more times.

595
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,994
I'm prepared for that.

596
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,371
Detective.

597
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,540
Oh, do you remember something?

598
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,877
It's not related to the case.

599
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,088
It's about the tall detective
from earlier.

600
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,215
A tall detective? That would be me.

601
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,427
No? Then do you mean Detective Jang?

602
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,511
What about him?

603
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,389
He seems to be
the grandson of Ms. Hong Tanbong.

604
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,724
Hong Tanbong?

605
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,851
She's the founder of Tan Restaurant.

606
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,105
Are you talking about the Tan Restaurant?

607
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,275
Yes, the detective looks
just like her grandson.

608
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,943
I think you're mistaken.

609
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,863
I don't think
he has anything to do with Tan Restaurant.

610
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,867
By any chance,
does his name have "Tan" in it?

611
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,495
Actually, it does.

612
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:45,541
Ms. Hong only passes down
the character Tan to those she favors.

613
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,087
Rumor has it that whoever has it
in their name is her successor.

614
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,964
There's no way.

615
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,926
He can't be the only one
with Tan in his name, can he?

616
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,303
But it's not that common either.

617
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,847
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

618
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,433
Hong Tanbong?

619
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,395
Tan Restaurant… Tan Restaurant…

620
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,730
Tan…

621
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,941
Tan Restaurant?

622
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,901
Has Restaurant Mogul Hong Tanbong
Chosen A Successor?

623
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,444
Tan Restaurant

624
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,239
Sold for 300 billion won

625
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,406
300 billion won?

626
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,699
Does she have a successor?

627
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,243
Her grandson's
keen sense of smell and taste…

628
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,329
Sense of smell and taste

629
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,087
He does have a big nose.

630
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,421
Let me see.

631
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,425
You smell like
Ms. Lee Bokja's hangover soup.

632
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,972
Who had the nerve to give you
such an obvious knockoff as a gift?

633
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,723
My grandma gave it to me.

634
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,770
Ms. Hong only passes down
the character Tan to those she favors.

635
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,607
Rumor has it that whoever has it
in their name is her successor.

636
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,861
Grandmother.

637
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,863
A successor?

638
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,866
Tan Restaurant, founded in 1963

639
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,701
In 1963,

640
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:06,122
Tan Restaurant was founded by
Ms. Hong Tanbong with a passion for food.

641
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,748
"Founder Hong Tanbong"

642
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,626
Her warm dishes filled our hearts,

643
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,087
and Tan Restaurant
became deeply rooted in our lives.

644
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,213
"Reached 100 franchise locations"

645
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,132
Through continuous change and improvement,

646
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,551
they enriched our lives with food.

647
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,138
"The Tan Food, Tan Bar, Tanwoo,
Chinese Restaurant Tanrim"

648
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,309
Expanding beyond Korea to the world.

649
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,643
In 2023,

650
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,354
they opened their 1,001st location
in Marseille, France,

651
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,107
establishing themselves
as a global franchise.

652
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,694
The Tan Food,
a legend in the restaurant industry.

653
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,155
Tan, Tan.

654
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,787
Tan, Tan.

655
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,298
Hello,
this is the Songwon Police…

656
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,675
Okay. Thank you.

657
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,512
The National Forensic Service
sent us the enhanced footage.

658
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,977
With the enhanced video quality…

659
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,314
we see the back of his head so clearly.

660
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,399
Maybe we should visit the club.

661
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,817
Tan, Tan.

662
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,945
Excellent. That's a great idea.

663
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,696
-What's with you?
-What are you saying?

664
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,781
Huh?

665
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,659
I just think it's a great idea.

666
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,786
Hold on, pause it.

667
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,914
I think I know who he is.

668
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,959
It's him… Nam Junghyun.

669
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,755
The hospital director's son
from the One Shot Chicken case?

670
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,839
Exactly.

671
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:44,136
How do you know it's him
when you can't even see his face?

672
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,888
Look at the number, not the face.

673
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,307
The plate number behind him.

674
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,643
With the enhanced video quality,
you can see it clearly.

675
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,812
4987.

676
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,106
It's Nam Junghyun's car.

677
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,494
This must be it.

678
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,578
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

679
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,215
Come on.

680
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,218
We just need to check something.

681
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,262
This is obstruction of justice. Got that?

682
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,348
As I said, you need to bring a warrant.

683
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,350
This is urgent.

684
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,227
Just let us check the CCTV.

685
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,395
No need to be so uptight…

686
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,482
with us, do you?

687
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,067
I'm sorry, but we have to follow protocol.

688
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,152
Protocol?

689
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,447
Get out of the way.

690
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,948
Now.

691
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,785
I'll count to three.

692
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,706
One.

693
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,915
Two.

694
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,760
Are you serious?

695
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,886
Fight!

696
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,637
Three for you, three for you.

697
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,182
What are you on about?

698
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,726
Gosh, I'm getting hot!

699
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,771
Four for you.

700
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,608
Just leave, okay?

701
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,193
Okay, fine!

702
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,778
Four for you,
and five for you.

703
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,196
Let's do this, huh?

704
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,032
What's the commotion?

705
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,285
Hmm?

706
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,703
Who are you?

707
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,677
Are we really going to push our way in?

708
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,430
What are we, bulldozers?
We'll need to get a warrant.

709
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,474
The warrant was rejected.

710
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,642
What? Why?

711
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,977
A risk of invasion of privacy,

712
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,107
insufficient relevance to the case,
or something like that.

713
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,195
Tell them we reject their rejection!

714
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,782
Hey! Where are you going
without a warrant?

715
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,117
Where are you going?

716
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,618
How are we supposed to do our job?

717
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,453
But seriously, is this really necessary?

718
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,415
Why won't they let us check
the CCTVs in the club?

719
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,793
I might be overstepping here, but…

720
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,919
Tan, Tan.

721
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,381
No way. Overstepping? Don't be ridiculous.

722
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,717
We're all equals. Go ahead.

723
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,303
I still think it's best
if we check the CCTVs in the club.

724
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,807
Who doesn't know that?
But there's no way to do that.

725
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,309
-How about we go undercover?
-That's easier said than done.

726
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,727
How exactly?

727
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,981
Minseo, hear our rookie out.

728
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,608
How are you planning to sneak in there?

729
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,570
I have a friend who might be able to help.

730
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,115
Let's get dressed up
and meet in front of the club later.

731
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,242
I'll find a way to get us in.

732
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,624
Ayo, Tansik!

733
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,963
-What the heck?
-What a dork.

734
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,340
Why is he dressed like that?

735
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,592
Tansik!

736
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,969
Excuse me.

737
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,679
Thank you.

738
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,181
Thank you.

739
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,184
Knock, knock.

740
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,769
It's me.

741
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,981
I totally went all out.

742
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,567
I bet you'll get bounced.

743
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,822
You look stunning.

744
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,033
So do you.

745
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,951
Really? Thanks.

746
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,204
Let's go in.

747
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,083
She's with me.

748
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,628
Welcome. Welcome.

749
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,338
-Thank you.
-You can't enter.

750
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,590
-I'm with them.
-Sure.

751
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,883
Please leave.

752
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,968
-I'll buy two bottles of liquor.
-Sure.

753
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,058
What if I take these off?

754
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,809
No.

755
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,394
-What about the beanie?
-No.

756
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,498
Are you here alone? Wanna join us?

757
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,211
Unless you want to get your joints broken

758
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,589
and crawl on all fours, get lost.

759
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,758
Okay! I prefer walking.

760
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,926
We love walking.

761
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,639
Detective Seo!

762
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,434
You got it?

763
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,617
-There it is.
-Go ahead.

764
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,703
What did they lose now?

765
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,996
Someone's coming.

766
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,831
What should we do?

767
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,292
-Take that out. Go hide.
-Where?

768
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,876
I don't know. Just hide.

769
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,839
Do we need to respond to every request?

770
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,925
Why are there so many entitled jerks?

771
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,428
It's always been like that.

772
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,560
Why would you hide right there?

773
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,811
Where did they put their bag?

774
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,605
Whatever. Just tell them
we couldn't find it.

775
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,232
How can you be so irresponsible?

776
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,483
Wait for me!

777
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,110
Have they left?

778
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,529
Hey!

779
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,573
Why would you hide there?

780
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,283
That was close.

781
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,081
Try it again.

782
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,459
What is it now?

783
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,336
Hurry up!

784
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,087
-Where do I hide?
-Quick. Hide!

785
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,505
Whatever!

786
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,802
I'm exhausted.

787
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,847
We can't survive on our salaries alone.
We need tips.

788
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,435
-Do we need just one?
-All of them.

789
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,646
You've got to be kidding me.

790
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,273
Jeez.

791
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,150
Stop whining.

792
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,319
You weren't like this before.

793
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,112
Hurry up.

794
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,031
I'm coming!

795
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,243
Wait for me!

796
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,460
That was really close.

797
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,172
Well done.

798
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:42,096
