All we did was wait outside the prison

We looked everywhere for him

How did you figure out he was in prison
just by going through the papers, sir?

206
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,291
He changed his name
and even used aliases,

The soy sauce flavor is overpowering,
and the batter is too thick.

251

They jumped on the cheese bandwagon,
but it doesn't go well with the sauce.

Hi, Jiwoong.

352
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,076
Take this.

353
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,495
-[Jiwoong] This is for the delivery?
-[Coach Yoon] Yes. Drive safe.

354
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,704
Okay.

355
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,541
I saw on Instagram that you're giving out
gifts for your first anniversary.

356
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,168
We're out of stock, so…

357
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,629
[Junghwan] Oh! Then what are these?

358
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,756
Those are samples.

359
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,132
I don't mind.

360
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,968
-Then you can take them.
-[Junghwan] Thanks.

361
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,095
-I'll write down my number for rewards.
-[Hyojoo] Sure.

362
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,640
Can you please stop?
It's embarrassing.

363
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,392
I know. Stop it.

364
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
Minsoo, we'll get going.

365
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,270

We're taking pictures of our customers
to celebrate our anniversary.

367
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,817
Hyojoo, take a picture of them.

368
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,985
Okay. Just a second, please.

369
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,945
You don't have to. Forget it.

370
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,572
-It does seem unnecessary.
-Let's do it. It's free.

371

-Please take a picture of us.
-Let's take a picture.

-Here we go.
-Come closer.

the fire started around 4 a.m.

437
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,927
If it was an accident,
it could've been the power strip

or the air conditioner short-circuiting.

I'll retrieve the footage.

[Minseo] If this was an accident,
a fire must've started for some reason,

00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,466
Why was he there so early?

He works out at the gym every morning.

496
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,472
He saw the fire on his way to the gym
and made a report.

497
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,141
He also found Hyojoo unconscious
and carried her out.

498
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,060
That's incredible.

499
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,687
Not everyone can jump
into a fire like that.

500
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,108
-What about the exits?
-There are two doors.

501
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,484
[Minseo] The main entrance

502
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,819
and the back door connected
to the kitchen.

503
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,153
But here's the thing.

504
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,696
Both doors have keypad locks.

505
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,491
[Minseo] And they're not damaged at all.

506
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,453
If this was arson,
the culprit must've known the passcode.

507
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,247
Maybe they broke in through a window.

508
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,791
All the windows at the scene were broken.

509
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,210
The windows showed
signs of thermal stress.

510
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,880
They broke due to high air pressure,
not by external force.

511
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,925
There must only be a handful of people
who know the passcode,

including the owner's daughter.

WBA featherweight champion. Got it?

Mr. Yoon is one of the suspects for now.

He's a victim, not a suspect.

-[Yubin] I'm sure you know that.
-Whatever.

526
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,130
It's not him.

527
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,466
We must always consider all possibilities.

Where?

533
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,821
Right here.

There's supposed to be a wall here.

538
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,084
I'm sorry.

539
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,253
What do we know about Yoon Hyojoo?

540
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,380
Oh, she's the chicken joint owner's…

541
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,719
She is the daughter
of a former boxing champion.

542
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,430
[Junghwan] She started helping out
at the restaurant two months ago.

543
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,390
She's a sophomore in economics
at Yeonju University,

544
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,850
currently on a leave of absence.

545
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,685
Do we have any CCTV footage?

546
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,063
There were no CCTVs at the entrance,

547
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,982
but I retrieved footage
from the nearest CCTV,

548
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,817
and it captured someone suspicious.

549
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,736
[Tansik] Here's the footage.

550
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,783
A man was heading
toward One Shot Chicken

551
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,785
30 minutes before the fire.

552
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,286
[Yubin] Can we identify him?

553
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,579
I'll look into it.

554
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,414
-Send me the file.
-[Tansik] Okay.

555
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,918
Detectives Jung and Jang,

556
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,253
[Junghwan] Yes, sir.

557
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,172
We'll keep all possibilities open for now.

558
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,966
And Detective Moo.

559
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,136
Please keep your personal feelings
out of the case.

560
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,224
Otherwise, I'll have to remove you
from the case.

561
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,769
That's all for today.

562
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,691
[sighs, tuts]

563
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,615
[Joongryeok] Does Minsoo come here often?

564
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,826
Every once in a while.

565
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,704
Why did he quit coaching anyway?

566
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,414
I thought he wanted to coach for life.

567
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,166
[sighs]
It's a long story.

568
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,378
Basically, he lost a power struggle.
All he knew was sports.

569
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,339
It'd be more accurate to say
he got kicked out.

570
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,300
[Taesung] But you know how he is.

571
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,969
He chips in
to support young boxers in need

572
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,596
and gives them lessons.

573
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,806
[Joongryeok] Hey,
are you trying to hammer a nail?

574
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,850
Pardon?

575
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,643
Instead of hammering,

576
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,520
think of it as
piercing something with an awl.

577
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,066
That's better.

578
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,152
And instead of using
your shoulder to punch,

579
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,945
let your shoulder follow your fist.

580
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,322
Give it a try.

581
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,742
Try again.

582
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,911
Good. Are you a southpaw?

583
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,540
Yes, but the coach told me
to practice orthodox.

584
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,125
-You mean Minsoo?
-Yes.

585
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,878
Well, it is an advantage
to be a switch-hitter.

586
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,510
I heard you reported the fire
and carried Hyojoo out.

587
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,763
Um…

588
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,097
Are you okay?

589
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,058
Yes.

590
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,772
-Thanks.
-It was nothing.

591
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,070
-Keep up the good work.
-[Jiwoong] I will.

592
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,870
[Taesung] He's probably
having a tough time too.

593
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,081
He lives alone with his sick grandma,

594
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,458
and he used to get
into a lot of trouble at school.

595
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,461
Then Coach Yoon turned things around
by teaching him boxing

596
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,129
and allowed him to work at his restaurant.

597
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,340
He even won a gold medal
at the National Sports Festival.

598
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,966
He's got nice form.

599
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,968
Coach Yoon told me

600
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,514
that he reminds him of you
when you were young.

it was a little past 1 a.m.

Oh.

782
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,040
And you stayed there for about an hour?

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,541
Yes.

784
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,960
Did you all go home after that?

785
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,173
They were all going to sleep over
