Episode 19

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,508
We're not exactly
pro mountaineers,

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,843
and it's pouring out here.

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,555
- The rain's going to stop soon.
- I saw a "no entry" sign.

6
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,973
-Hold on.
-What?

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,935
-What's that?
-What do you mean?

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,020
Isn't that a person?

9
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,105
A person?

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,026
What the hell?

00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,656
Emergency Room

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,374
What's his condition?

13
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,751
Stab wound,
heavy abdominal bleeding.

14
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,336
-How are his vitals?
-We can't detect them.

15
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,504
We have a bleeding patient!

16
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,515
- I'm off.
- Just a second.

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,225
Right.

18
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,185
-Open your bag.
-Okay.

19
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,020
Here.

20
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,814
Have a sip before you go.

21
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,898
All right.

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,819
-It's good.
-Is it?

23
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,029
-Thanks.
-Please protect my daddy.

24
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,627
The footprints left at the scene

25
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,798
played a crucial role in solving the case.

26
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,550
"Remaking of Crime"

27
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,220
A pair of worn-out sneakers
found at the home of the suspect, Han,

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,014
tells us more than we think.

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,227
The soil found on the soles matched...

30
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,271
You're getting a call.
It's from Jang Tansik.

31
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,439
-It's the rookie, isn't it?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,900
An analysis of the soil...

33
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,985
What's up?

34
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,946
What?

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,751
Detective Jung.

36
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,716
Detective Jung.

37
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,887
Detective Jung! Detective Jung!

38
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,430
Detective Jung!

39
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,058
No!

40
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,810
Detective Seo.

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,770
-What are you doing?
-Get off me!

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,233
That's not Detective Jung.

43
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,069
-No?
-It's someone else.

44
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,363
What's all this noise?

45
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,365
I'm trying to sleep here.

46
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,535
If you're going to be so noisy,
go over there!

47
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,162
For crying out loud.

48
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,496
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,664
Where's Detective Jung?

50
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,666
He's in surgery right now.

51
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,254
Jung Junghwan. Where's Jung Junghwan?

52
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,215
-Tansik. Minseo.
-Detective Moo.

53
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,716
-Where's Junghwan?
-Let's go outside.

54
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,593
Why the hell are you crying?

55
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,719
-Where is he?
-Let's go.

56
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,152
Operating Room

57
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,586
Mr. Jung's wife?

58
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,797
Where's his wife?

59
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,507
Youngeun.

60
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,052
Ah. I'm his wife.

61
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,971
Thankfully, the surgery went well.

62
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,641
It could've been a lot worse
if the knife had cut deeper

63
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,059
and hit his organs,

64
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,395
-but that didn't happen.
-Okay.

65
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,397
The problem is that he bled a lot.

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,440
He lost so much blood
at the scene

67
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,901
that he's still unconscious.

68
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,821
We'll need to keep an eye on him for now.

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,199
I see.

70
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,275
Hyeju Medical Center

71
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,032
Excuse me.

72
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,534
Could I borrow a cigarette?

73
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,330
Ah. Sorry, this is my last one.

74
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,457
I see.

75
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,129
-Look.
-Yes?

76
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,593
Thank you.

77
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,555
Could I borrow your light too?

78
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,557
Sure. Here.

79
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,528
Come on.

80
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,659
Hey, give that back.
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

81
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,453
You said you'd quit smoking.

82
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,746
Let me have one last cigarette.

83
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,375
That'll just lead to another and another.

84
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,877
For Pete's sake!

85
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,213
So what if he's the chief?

86
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,048
Does he think I'm a pushover?

87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,092
I know. What does he take you for?

88
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,928
I'm sure he means well though.

89
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,304
Don't take it personally.

90
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,306
Forget it. I'm going to quit.

91
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,726
If you're going to quit,
let's learn a new skill and--

92
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,312
I'm never partnering up with you again.
Not in a million years.

93
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,817
Instead of smoking a cigarette,
let's go for some pork belly.

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,027
There's a new place in the neighborhood.

95
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,405
-I got paid too.
-Just give that back.

96
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,365
Come on.

97
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,535
Quit smoking
so we can work together for a long time.

98
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,495
Promise me again.

99
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,517
SONGWON POLICE STATION

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,185
Han Junho's been arrested.

101
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,813
Well done.

102
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,358
It would've been better
if we'd caught him ourselves,

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,110
but that's not important.

104
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,821
The case is closed, so just let it go.

105
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,741
Let's focus on catching
the bastard who attacked Detective Jung.

106
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,370
Whoever he is, catch him no matter what.

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,372
And let me know if you need anything.

108
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,249
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,054
-Detective Jang.
-Captain.

110
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm going to visit the scene
where Det. Jung got attacked.

111
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,102
There are no CCTVs around,
so I'll have to look for witnesses.

112
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,938
I'll go talk to the hikers
who found him.

113
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,901
I want to find out
if they crossed paths with the culprit.

114
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,235
All right. And...

115
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,779
Take this.

116
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,327
- What's this?
- Given Detective Jung's wounds,

117
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,912
the weapon would look like that.

118
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,331
- Look into it.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,041
I know.

120
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,126
It's those bastards.

121
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,544
Who do you mean?

122
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,795
Isn't it obvious?

123
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,548
That voice phishing ring
must've gotten back at Detective Jung.

124
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,511
They've got some nerve
attacking a detective.

125
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,721
I'll beat them all to a pulp.

126
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,557
Don't jump to conclusions.
Let's keep investigating.

127
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,559
There's no need. I have a hunch!

128
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,728
Your hunch might be wrong.

129
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,939
Interview the witnesses
with Detective Jang first.

130
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,148
On it.

131
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,859
Wait for me, Detective Moo!

132
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,045
Detective Jung Junghwan

133
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,478
Seoul Busters

134
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,193
Hey, you're here.

135
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,320
I heard about Detective Jung.

136
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,448
Is he okay?
Will he pull through?

137
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,826
Things don't look good.

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,828
He might not make it.

139
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,998
That's terrible.

140
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,920
About the investigation.

141
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,798
I should've kept you posted,

142
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,925
but things were so hectic.

143
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,427
Sorry about that.

144
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,886
Don't worry about it.

145
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,930
Thanks for understanding.

146
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,559
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

147
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,481
Are you sure it's Han Junho?

148
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,066
Why wouldn't I be?

149
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,612
We checked the call history,
and we found a burner phone in his home.

150
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,324
We also found sneakers
that matched the footprints at the scene.

151
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,451
-Has he admitted to the crime?
-He's denying it,

152
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,785
but it's only a matter of time.

153
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,704
The evidence is rock-solid.

154
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,502
I don't see how they would've met.

155
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,797
Jung Hyunjoo worked at a bar.
He probably met her there.

156
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,884
And then he started stalking her,
called her, got obsessed,

157
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,427
and when things didn't go his way...

158
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,721
You know how it goes.

159
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,974
You won't believe
what we found on his phone.

160
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,852
He was stalking another girl too.

161
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,979
She could've been in danger as well.

162
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,024
I bet he's behind Jaein's case as well.

163
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,152
I'll make sure he confesses.

164
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,947
All right.

165
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,117
I wanted to hear that from you in person.

166
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,454
Thanks for coming.
This is for you.

167
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,375
What's this for?

168
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,668
I have to step out.

169
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,128
You're leaving already?

170
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,547
-Let's grab a meal.
-Some other time.

171
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,924
Where are you going?

172
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,425
I'm going to go talk to Han Junho.

173
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,695
Do you recognize me?

174
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,077
We've met before, haven't we?
I have a few questions for you.

175
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,996
You killed Jung Hyunjoo,
didn't you?

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,790
Why did you do it?

177
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,633
I didn't.

178
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Sure, you didn't.

179
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,471
You always say that.

180
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,932
"I didn't kill her.
I don't know anything."

181
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,267
"I didn't do it."

182
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,936
I didn't even know her.

183
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,897
You stalked a woman you didn't even know?

184
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,691
Just because she was pretty
and you liked her?

185
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,694
Like you did with Jaein?

186
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,036
I didn't do it.

187
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,831
Why won't anyone believe me?

188
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,545
I didn't do it.

189
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,339
You killed both Jaein
and Jung Hyunjoo.

190
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,135
Do you expect me
to believe a scumbag like you?

191
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,682
I said I didn't do it!

192
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,562
I didn't do it.

193
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,147
It wasn't me.

194
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,858
Let go. That bastard won't listen to me!

195
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,318
You son of a bitch!

196
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,280
He's right-handed.

197
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,993
He either trained himself
to be right-handed,

198
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,496
or was pretending to be right-handed.

199
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,864
Don't worry too much, Youngeun.

200
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,033
Junghwan is strong.

201
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,119
-He'll come around soon.
-Thank you.

202
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,543
-Detective Moo.
-Yes?

203
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,838
Do you investigate voice phishing too?

204
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,464
Voice phishing?

205
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,468
It's been so hectic
since Junghwan was attacked,

206
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,846
but on the day of the attack,

207
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,682
I got a call
from the Police Mutual Aid Association.

208
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,726
They offered a loan
at a low interest rate,

209
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,521
so I sent them some money.

210
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,734
I haven't heard back from them since,
and I'm suspecting it was voice phishing.

211
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,027
How much did you send?

212
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,404
All our savings

213
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,157
and the 500 million won
we recently borrowed.

214
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,914
It was stupid of me.
I should've been more careful.

215
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,334
It's okay. Don't worry.

216
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,838
Even judges and prosecutors
fall for their schemes,

217
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,381
so don't be too hard on yourself.

218
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,383
No matter how much money you've lost,

219
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,928
I'll make sure you get it all back,
down to the last cent.

220
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,680
For now,

221
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,310
let's focus on Junghwan's recovery.

222
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,769
Okay.

223
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,071
Recently, some newlyweds
took their own lives

224
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,740
after falling victim to voice phishing.

225
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,742
That's also those bastards' doing.

226
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,118
I thought all of them were arrested.

227
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,455
We only arrested the money mules.
The headquarters is still intact.

228
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,042
Where are they?

229
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,629
I suspect they attacked
Junghwan to get back at him.

230
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,589
-Don't jump to conclusions.
-Where are they?

231
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,509
China? The Philippines? Tell me.

232
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,679
This is confidential information,

233
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,308
but their office is in China,
and their leader is in Korea.

234
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,559
He's in Korea?

235
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,144
Where?

236
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,898
I brought the address
because you were pestering so much,

237
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,609
but wait for us
to come up with a strategy, okay?

238
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,277
There's no time to lose!

239
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,655
Don't be so unreasonable.

240
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,239
Can we recover the money?

241
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,409
That might be hard.

242
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,328
Why do you keep saying that?

243
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,276
Hello, this is the Songwon Police.

244
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,654
I need you to check some bloodstains.

245
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,411
- Please try again, Grandma.
- Do my hair too, Grandma.

246
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,329
-Please, Grandma.
-Nuri.

247
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,289
-Grandma.
-Girls.

248
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,834
-It's Sena's turn now. Wait for your turn.
-Please, Grandma.

249
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,253
-This is too much for me.
-Do my hair too, Grandma.

250
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,629
Stay still so I can do your hair.

251
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,215
"Front door"

252
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,884
Who is it?

253
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,469
Hello...

254
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,099
Hello, I'm Junghwan's colleague,
Seo Minseo.

255
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,726
Nice to meet you.

256
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,312
I'll make sure you look cute.

257
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,024
- Done!
- Wow!

258
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,108
It's so pretty.

259
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,818
I look like a ballerina.

260
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,236
You think so?

261
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,031
You all look so pretty.

262
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,115
-So pretty.
-I love my hair.

263
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,491
Thank you so much.

264
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,368
Don't mention it.

265
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,996
I'll stop by and help you out
whenever I can.

266
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,247
Would that be all right?

267
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,665
Of course.

268
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,501
-Are you ready to go?
-Yes!

269
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,878
Off to school!

270
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,046
-Follow me.
-Off to school.

271
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,756
Line up and get ready.

272
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,507
Ready!

273
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,633
Say bye to Nuri.

274
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,178
-Bye, Nuri.
-Bye, Grandma.

275
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,512
-See you.
-See you.

276
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,639
-Let's go. We're off.
-Let's go!

277
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,975
-Off to daycare!
-That's right.

278
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,064
- You're late.
- Yeah.

279
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,442
-I helped out with Detective Jung's kids.
-Ah.

280
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,944
Have you heard anything from the hospital?

281
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,029
Not yet.

282
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,740
-Where's Captain?
-He's in his office.

283
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,910
He seems pretty down these days.

284
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,453
That's not surprising.

285
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,501
-Where's Detective Moo?
-I haven't seen him all morning.

286
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,503
I don't think
he's come to work yet.

287
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,590
Why is he so irresponsible?
We're shorthanded as it is.

288
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,052
He's here.

289
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,516
You're late.

290
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,604
Captain, I'd like to take the day off.

291
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,273
-You are?
-Detective Moo.

292
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,818
Why would you do that in this situation?

293
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,947
With Det. Jung in the hospital,
it's not like I feel motivated to work.

294
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,574
-Aren't you going to catch the culprit?
-I am.

295
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,621
I'm going to catch the bastard
with my own hands.

296
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,666
But there's an emergency.

297
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,461
- An emergency?
- It's a personal one.

298
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,922
I insist on taking the day off.

299
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,299
-Go ahead.
-Captain.

300
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,635
I'll do the paperwork when I'm back.

301
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,221
Detective Moo.

302
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,309
Stay safe.

303
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,443
Captain.

304
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,071
How could you let him take the day off
in this situation?

305
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,906
I'm stepping out too.

306
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,618
I'm not taking the day off though.

307
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,125
Let's get ready.

308
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:34,339
Ah, I've never seen your team
this quiet before.

309
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,510
This is for your captain.

310
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,013
-He wants it delivered to his office.
-Okay.

311
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,931
Here are some security guidelines.

312
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,641
Organize and Upload them.

313
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,726
Okay.

314
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,355
Ah, how's it going
with Detective Jung's voice phishing case?

315
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,399
Sorry?

316
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,609
You didn't know about it?

317
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,740
We're back.

318
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,827
The captain of the Violent Crimes Team
from Songwon is here.

319
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,665
Hello, are you here to see me?

320
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,667
-Yes. Please have a seat.
-Okay.

321
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,671
-I need to ask you some questions.
-Sure.

322
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,882
On the day
of the gambling joint crackdown,

323
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,843
you shared a vehicle
with Detective Jung Junghwan, right?

324
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,137
Yes, he gave me a ride here.

325
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,598
Do you remember what you talked about?

326
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,433
Well...

327
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,771
It was a short ride,
so I don't remember much.

328
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,941
It doesn't have to be anything remarkable.
Whatever you can recall.

329
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,318
Let me think.

330
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,614
Ah, right. He asked me about the temple.

331
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,033
The temple?

332
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,869
The detective showed up here

333
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,455
and asked to check our CCTV footage.

334
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,420
Is the camera facing the road?

335
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,256
Yes.

336
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,548
Is that the plate number?

337
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,051
Okay, thanks.

338
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,057
Luckily, he found
what he was looking for.

339
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,309
And that was all.

340
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,605
Do you still have that CCTV footage?

341
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,483
This temple was robbed shortly afterward.

342
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,402
Goodness.

343
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,080
Severed wire

344
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,128
Detective Jung Junghwan

345
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,882
Are you okay?
That must've scared you.

346
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,176
All kinds of things happen while on duty.

347
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,386
Worst case,
I'll face disciplinary action.

348
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,471
Still...

349
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,348
I was supposed to be promoted anyway,

350
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,266
so it'll balance out.

351
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,023
-Detective Seo.
-Yeah?

352
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,777
I need to take the afternoon off.

353
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,197
Not you too.

354
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,574
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,838
THE TAN FOOD

356
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,344
- Mr. Jang is here.
- Got it.

357
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,230
The Intelligence Chief said

358
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,775
Detective Jung won't be able to
recover his money, right?

359
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,238
This is terrible.

360
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,826
He might end up
losing his apartment.

361
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,299
CEO Hong Tanbong

362
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,385
Get this ungrateful brat
out of here!

363
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,387
After leaving here all high and mighty,

364
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,098
why are you back here on your knees?

365
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,192
I'll quit the force.

366
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,778
You must be kidding me.

367
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,032
I don't care
whether you become a cop or a thief.

368
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,786
I stopped considering you family
the day you left.

369
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,955
-Grandma.
-Why, you...

370
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,958
I'm not your grandma anymore.
Stop calling me that!

371
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,918
You thankless little brat.

372
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,590
This is the newly developed anchovy broth.

373
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,092
It'll be included in our meal kit.

374
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,931
It's a little fishy.

375
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,977
You think so?

376
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,062
Why is that?

377
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,301
The ingredients are top quality,

378
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,637
but they were cooked
at the wrong temperature.

379
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,555
They were cooked
below boiling point,

380
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,224
which resulted in a fishy smell.

381
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,188
Did you hear that?

382
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,857
-Try again.
-Yes, ma'am.

383
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,658
-So you're quitting the force?
-Yes.

384
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,701
After stubbornly refusing to quit

385
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,953
all this time?

386
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,497
I'm about to submit
my letter of resignation.

387
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,500
-Are you sure?
-I wouldn't lie about this.

388
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,172
Fine. I don't know
what happened,

389
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,675
but you made the right choice.

390
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,427
You should've listened to me
sooner.

391
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,556
Get some fresh air,

392
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,475
and start working here next month.

393
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,104
Why waste your keen sense
of smell?

394
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,606
Don't you feel sorry for your nose?

395
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,109
On one condition though.

396
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,944
A condition? What is it?

397
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,530
I need some money.

398
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,906
Money?

399
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,700
Sure.

400
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,287
I need a lot of it.

401
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,833
I don't know what this is about,

402
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,751
but submit
your letter of resignation first.

403
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,170
We'll discuss money afterward.

404
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,549
I never pay in advance.

405
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,470
Okay, Grandma.

406
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,516
Now, stand up
and make yourself comfortable.

407
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,357
Didn't you hear me?
Why won't you do as I say?

408
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,109
I said stand up!

409
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,653
My legs fell asleep.

410
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,330
My goodness, you.

411
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,184
There's no time to lose!

412
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,395
They're probably laundering the money
as we speak. We can't wait any longer.

413
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,606
There's an order to everything.

414
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,733
I don't care. Just give me the address.

415
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,653
Give it to me right now!

416
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,202
Hongmyo Chinese Restaurant

417
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,497
So this is where the boss is?
Thanks.

418
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,040
Detective Moo.

419
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,460
They're the most vicious
voice phishing ring out there.

420
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,545
-You should wait for backup--
-I'll show them

421
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,298
what vicious looks like.

422
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,301
Hey!

423
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,396
That's another coworker
of the patient in Room 601.

424
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,649
I heard he's a police officer.
They must be tight-knit.

425
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,277
Now, that's loyalty.

426
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,338
That's also a coworker
of the patient in Room 601, right?

427
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,721
They must be like family.

428
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,403
There's another coworker
of the patient in Room 601.

429
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,534
Hold on. If they're so tight,

430
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,828
why are they all
visiting separately?

431
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,247
You're right.
Maybe they're not close after all.

432
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,543
I can't tell whether they're close or not.

433
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,044
How strange.

434
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,018
Prayer Room

435
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,027
Captain?

436
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,112
Detective Seo.

437
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,739
What are you doing here?

438
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,867
Ah, I didn't want to be a bother
by going to his room.

439
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,287
Have a seat.

440
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,461
But...

441
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,048
didn't you say you weren't religious?

442
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,926
You said you weren't either.

443
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,929
I'm not.

444
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:14,270
There's the saying,
"God does not play dice."

445
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,314
It's a quote from Einstein.

446
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,778
Einstein didn't believe
that chance played a role in science.

447
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,406
That's why he rejected
quantum mechanics.

448
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:31,871
That sounds similar to your view.

449
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,668
But he was wrong.

450
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:43,049
Not everything in this world
is able to be explained by logic.

451
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,012
Perhaps chance is what governs it all.

452
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:55,395
We don't know where our prayers go
or who they reach,

453
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,524
but all we can do now is pray.

454
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,738
Plus,

455
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,074
it's nice and quiet here.

456
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,660
The pews are comfortable as well.

457
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,330
This is so typical of you.

458
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,916
Am I being a know-it-all again?

459
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,961
What can I do?

460
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,380
Since I'm nice, I'll put up with you.

461
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,162
Hey, buddy.

462
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,708
You can't go in here. You'll get hurt.

463
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,752
You got two things wrong.

464
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,713
-What?
-One, I'm not your buddy.

465
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,466
What's your problem?

466
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,801
Two, you're the one who'll get hurt.

467
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,763
Go home if you're drunk.

468
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,058
Don't test my patience.

469
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,480
What the hell was that?

470
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,441
-Damn it.
-Get out of the way.

471
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,070
Did you do that to him?

472
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,238
-Hey.
-What did you do?

473
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,615
I'll show you.

474
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,325
What? Show us what?

475
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,619
You want to know what I did to him?
I'll show you.

476
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,205
Is this idiot out of his mind?

477
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,756
Guys!

478
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,257
"One"

479
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,218
Everyone come out! Hurry!

480
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,887
For crying out loud--

481
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,314
"Two"

482
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,197
Wait, wait, wait!

483
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,537
PUNCH

484
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,707
Okay, bring it on.

485
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,792
Beat him up!

486
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,876
Come here!

487
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,969
Come on!
- You bastard!

488
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,685
"Three"

489
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,153
Hongmyo Chinese Restaurant

490
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,295
Who is it?

491
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,424
Who else? It's me.

492
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,222
Ah. It's you.

493
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,642
Do you even know what this place is?

494
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,062
Watch yourself.
You might end up on the ground.

495
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,482
I doubt you even could--

496
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,201
Are you the boss here?

497
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,414
So what if I am?

498
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,541
Who said you could
barge in here like this?

499
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,751
-Are you a cop?
-Cut it out.

500
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,254
Just answer my questions.

501
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,548
You know Detective Jung, right?

502
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,176
How could I not?

503
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,054
Did you order

504
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,599
the attack on him?

505
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,101
-What are you talking about?
-Answer me honestly.

506
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,729
Are you the one

507
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,148
who stabbed him?

508
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,028
I don't know what you're talking about.

509
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,779
You don't?

510
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,700
Then I'll beat you up until you remember.

511
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,119
You're out of line, officer.

512
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,288
Were you an athlete?

513
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,000
You don't know who you're up against.

514
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,510
-Were you an athlete?
-I was a boxer.

515
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,099
A boxer, huh?

516
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,268
Come here.

517
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,420
You bastard.

518
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,691
This is the problem
with ex-boxers.

519
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,651
Most people know when to surrender,

520
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,528
but they just don't know when to give up.

521
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,196
Let me beat you up a bit more.

522
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,318
Hey, Joongryeok!

523
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,194
Joongryeok!

524
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,863
Where are you going?

525
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,407
I quit! This is just ridiculous!

526
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,908
What are you going to do then?

527
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,870
Who cares if someone lost a ring
while we were catching a criminal?

528
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,705
It's a diamond ring.

529
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,416
So what? Is it my fault? Did I lose it?

530
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,918
They said they lost it
because you pushed them.

531
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,670
Why are they blaming me?

532
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,257
I think the higher-ups
just want me to quit.

533
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,550
There you go again.

534
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,634
I mean it.

535
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,887
I work my butt off,
but I never get any credit.

536
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,847
They said I should quit
if I don't find the ring,

537
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,057
so I'll just quit.

538
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,641
Come to your senses!

539
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,643
I'm saying this
because I've come to my senses!

540
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,563
-I'm going to quit tomorrow.
-Don't be ridiculous.

541
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,483
Hey! Wait!

542
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,122
Hi, Youngeun. What's up?

543
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,750
Are you with my husband?

544
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,836
Ah, I thought he went home.

545
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,339
It's late,
and I can't reach him.

546
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,299
I have no idea where he is.

547
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,476
Damn it.

548
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,814
Hey!

549
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,275
What are you doing,
you moron?

550
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,112
Hey! I found it!

551
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,661
I found it! Look!

552
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,080
I found it!

553
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,915
Look!

554
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,126
Hey, I found it!

555
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,295
I found it! I did it!

556
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,506
Gosh.

557
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,718
Joongryeok,
we can keep working together now.

558
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,054
Fine.

559
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,058
Let's work together
until we're both old and gray.

560
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,650
I haven't eaten anything all day.

561
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,068
I'm starving.

562
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,571
Let's go have some pork belly.

563
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,739
Pork belly? Is it your treat?

564
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,617
-Yeah.
-Okay.

565
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,079
You little...

566
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,648
I haven't eaten anything
all day.

567
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,317
I'm starving.

568
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,944
Food gives you energy, right?

569
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,039
Finally giving up?

570
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,791
Give me just a second.

571
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,509
What the hell are you doing?

572
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,597
Huh?

573
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,807
I just...

574
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,687
remembered something.

575
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,316
I haven't eaten anything all day.

576
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,042
What the...

577
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,671
I feel better now.

578
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,755
Are you trying to be funny?

579
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,883
Why you little...

580
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,556
Listen.

581
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,977
I'm going to punch you
just five times.

582
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,396
Come here.

583
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,357
Hana!

584
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,694
Doona!

585
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,488
Sena!

586
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,872
Nuri!

587
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,675
You count in a funny way.

588
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,343
Those are

589
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,512
the names

590
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,140
of Junghwan's kids.

591
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,144
Let me ask you one last time.

592
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,146
Are you the one

593
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:29,940
who stabbed Junghwan?

594
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,900
I'm not.

595
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,154
We conned him out of money,

596
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,240
but we never

597
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,619
physically attacked him or anything.

598
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,455
Sir.

599
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,664
I mean it.

600
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,791
Give him back his money,

601
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,129
or I'll kill you.

602
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,632
Yes, sir.
I'll give it back to him.

603
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,322
Five.

604
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,016
Hello. My goodness.

605
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,895
Thank you for coming all
the way here, but you can't see him yet.

606
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,647
I just stopped by on my way to work.

607
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,191
I heard you eat at the hospital
all the time,

608
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,819
so I brought some food.

609
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,114
Thank you so much.
You didn't have to do this.

610
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,740
How's Detective Jung doing?

611
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,117
He's a lot better.

612
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,496
Yesterday, you sent me

613
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,332
a picture of a toy gun, right?

614
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,376
Yes, I was wondering if you recognized it.

615
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,212
-I do. It's my kid's.
-Is it?

616
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,465
She puts those stickers
on her favorite toys.

617
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,510
I shouldn't leave
my husband alone,

618
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,887
- so I need to get back inside.
- Sure, go ahead.

619
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,828
Prevent forest fires

620
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:57,254
Hyun

621
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,844
Hyun

622
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,068
Please.

623
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,830
"Hyun"

624
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,836
Hana...

625
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,348
Songwon Police Station
has moved temporary

626
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,017
What happened to your face?
Did someone beat you up?

627
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,895
As if I'd let anyone beat me up!

628
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,021
Then what is it?

629
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,065
I got drunk and fell.

630
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,277
You can't fool me!

631
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,028
-Someone beat me up. Happy?
-Who?

632
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,488
A stranger.

633
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,032
Shouldn't you ask if I'm okay first?

634
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,495
You look okay though.

635
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,374
Ah. The Intelligence Chief told me

636
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,586
Detective Jung will be able
to get all his money back!

637
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,254
They rounded up the whole ring

638
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,172
and found all their secret accounts.

639
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,257
That's great.

640
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,593
What? You don't look happy.

641
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,469
I am.

642
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,349
Hey, Tan! Why are you late? Be on time!

643
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,018
I see Captain isn't in.

644
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,855
Did you just ignore me?

645
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,398
What happened to your face?

646
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,111
Be more careful.

647
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,404
Detective Moo.

648
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,324
Thanks for everything.

649
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,868
What's up with you?

650
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,287
Why are you being so informal?

651
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,123
Thanks for everything, Detective Seo.

652
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,918
What's with you? Cut it out.

653
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,837
I was going to wait
until Captain arrived, but...

654
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,051
I'm quitting.

655
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,598
You're quitting what? Fooling around?

656
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,643
I'm quitting the force.

657
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,689
Here's my letter of resignation.

658
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,108
I've learned so much from you two.

659
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,612
- What?
- I'll never forget you.

660
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,072
Hey.

661
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,658
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

662
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,825
What is it?

663
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,786
I see everyone's here.

664
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,496
- Hello, Captain.
- Captain.

665
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,580
Captain.

666
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,165
Did you hear?

667
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,334
Detective Jung can get his money back.

668
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,378
The whole ring got rounded up.

669
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,088
He can get his money back?

670
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,591
Captain, Tansik is submitting
his letter of resignation.

671
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,593
Never mind.

672
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,303
What's with you, you idiot?

673
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,681
Everyone, I have something to tell you.

674
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,849
Sure, go ahead.

675
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,602
Jung Hyunjoo's killer
and Detective Jung's attacker

676
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,854
appear to be the same person.

677
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,898
-What?
-They're the same person?

678
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,193
There's no direct evidence yet,
but that's my hunch.

679
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,320
Hunch? That's my thing.

680
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,614
-Hunch?
-Please trust me.

681
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,167
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

682
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,262
- Detective Seo.
- Hello.

683
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,346
Where are you going?

684
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,889
Well...

685
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,019
Could you drop me off
at the subway station?

686
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,229
- Sure, get in.
- Thank you.

687
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,528
Hello, this is Dongbang Yubin.

688
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,072
We managed to detect DNA,
and the results are out.

689
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,992
It matches the person you mentioned.

690
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,371
But why him?

691
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,000
Anyway, I've sent you the report.

692
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,460
All right. Thank you.

693
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,095
What were you doing
at headquarters?

694
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,347
To get forensic results.

695
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,017
A forensic analysis? Of what?

696
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,187
Regarding the Jung Hyunjoo case.

697
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,940
The captain seems to suspect
the culprit is someone else.

698
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,153
He thinks it's the same person
who attacked Detective Jung.

699
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,946
I see.

700
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,617
He said it was just a hunch though.

701
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,662
But his hunches are usually right.

702
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,747
Right?

703
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,041
That's why I was hoping

704
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,002
this could give us a lead.

705
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,504
What's that?

706
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,672
A flash drive
found in Detective Jung's pocket.

707
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,176
It was damaged by the heavy rain.

708
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,637
That's why I requested
a forensic analysis.

709
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,682
There's supposed to be CCTV footage on it.

710
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,145
It might give us a clue
about the Songnae Mountain case.

711
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,522
Did you review the footage?

712
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,066
No, I wanted Captain to see it first.

713
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,445
I thought we were
finally closing the case.

714
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,158
I even covered it on my show.
What should I do?

715
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,410
Anyway, you're working so hard.

716
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,788
Do you want to drink this?

717
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,792
Oh, I was actually craving this.
Thank you.

720
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,906
Why am I so sleepy?

721
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,036
