00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,803
She must've closed early today.
All the lights are out.

00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,513
But it's still early.

00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,598
Did something come up?

13
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,894
I told you to hurry up.
What took you so long?

Captain wanted the report

and I couldn't tell him
I had to leave for rice soup.

There's a new noodle place
that's open 24 hours near here.

00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,154
I'd rather have rice than noodles.

I've changed the fuse, but you'll need
an electrician for the rest.

Hey, Minsik.

00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,670

You don't know anything about this.

When a kids' food show like that blows up,

110
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,737
you can become a celebrity overnight.

111
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,405
I don't care.

112
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,325

You're so good at crawling.

The website has been reported many times.

Junghwan and I helped a victim

179
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,155
Before he knew it,
he had lost five million won.

180
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,700
To recover his losses,

181
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,953
he ended up betting
another five million won.

182
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,081
[Minsik] Please, please, please! [yells]

183
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,918
[Joongryeok] Soon, he ended up
taking out loans,

184
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,462
only to lose the money all at once.

185
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,216
He even lost his security deposit
for his apartment.

186
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,468
-Exactly.
-[Junghwan] It doesn't end there.

187
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,678
What's worse is

188
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,264
even after the victim lost
all the money he had,

189
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,101
they led him
into taking out expensive loans.

190
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,686
When he failed to pay back in time,

191
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,938
they even showed up at his workplace
and intimidated him.

192
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,732
[thug] There you are, you scumbag.

193
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,819
[Junghwan] It seems those little brats
were ruthless with him.

194
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,903
[Minsik] Hold on!

195
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,031
-Why are you taking off your clothes?
-Come on.

196
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,074
[thug] You fucking bastard.

197
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,659
-You think this is a joke?
-[Minsik] No.

198
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,453
-Cut it out, you moron.
-I'm sorry.

199
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,204
-Pay us back, you asshole.
-I will. Please.

200
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,831
-You piece of shit.
-I promise.

201
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,999
Shut up.

202
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,002
[thug 1] Make sure we look good.

203
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,004
-[thug 1] Smile.
-[thug 2] One, two, three.

204
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,298
-Smile.
-You look so cute. Give us a smile.

205
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,343
One, two, three. Keep smiling.

206
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,261
That's illegal.

207
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,555
So there are gangsters involved?

208
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,557
[Junghwan] It seems so.

209
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,227
If this involves a gang,
it is within our jurisdiction,

210
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,148
but online gambling falls under
the Cyber Bureau's jurisdiction.

211
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,942
-Hey.
-[Minseo] Since the report was made to us,

212
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,319
we should handle it.

213
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,904
Still, jurisdictions should be respected.

214
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,822
Any cases reported to us
are our responsibility.

215
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,201
That's exactly my point.
It's within our jurisdiction.

216
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,369
There he goes again.

217
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,914
We need to track the bank accounts first,

218
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,958
so you'll need to sign up for the site,
place bets, and play.

219
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,960
Find out where the money is going.

220
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,045
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,345
[all] Odd! Odd! Odd! Odd! Odd!

222
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,602
-[Minseo] Even! Even! Even!
-[Joongryeok] No! No! No!

223
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,480
We've gotten an odd number
four times in a row!

224
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,731
We have to go with even!

225
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,817
I'm your senior. Show some respect!

226
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,069
-Let's go with even!
-This isn't about seniority.

227
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,905
We should go with the flow
and stick to odd!

228
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,158
-We have to go with even this time!
-[Junghwan] Double the wager!

229
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,785
[Joongryeok] I'm going with odd!

230
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,163
[Joongryeok] I feel a shiver.

231
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,541
[whispering] One from the bottom
for Minseo.

232
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,835
One from the top for Tansik.

233
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,045
One from the bottom for Junghwan.

234
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,548
One from the top for me.

235
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,299
One from the top for Captain.

236
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,677
[shouting] Get off,
I'll cut your hand off!

237
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,886
[mocking gasp]

238
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,473
[stuttering] Ah... Captain.

239
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,683
What are you up to?

240
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,769
We were investigating together.

241
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,693
As you mentioned,
in an attempt to track the accounts

242
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,904
and understand how this whole site works,

243
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,324
I bet 50,000 won out of my own pocket,

244
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,076
and we've been on a winning streak.

245
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,456
The more money I win, the more funds
we'll have for the investigation.

246
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,255
It was all Minseo's idea.

247
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,175
[Minseo] It was your idea!

248
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,551
-You pushed us into doing it!
-You...

249
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,178
Have you tracked the accounts yet?

250
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
[Junghwan] We asked the bank
for cooperation.

251
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,018
Captain, with all due respect,
now that we've actually played,

252
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,146
the game itself doesn't seem rigged.

253
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,732
[Minseo] They even show everyone
the win rate for each game.

254
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,110
They seem to try to make things fair.

255
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,155
Regardless of the win rate,
they're bound to make money.

256
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,073
They only disclose the win rates
to appear fair.

257
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,909
What do you mean,
they're bound to make money?

258
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,828
In online gambling,
you pay a fee for every round.

259
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,082
While your money is supposed to double
if you win, that's not true after fees.

260
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,959
If you lose, you lose all your money.

261
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,879
The more you play, the more money you lose

262
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,714
and the more money the company makes.

263
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,551
[Tansik] Even so, if Jeon Minsik played
like we did...

264
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,762
I mean, if he played like Detective Moo

265
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,097
and made smart moves,

266
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,392
he wouldn't have lost so much money.

267
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,479
Are you blaming the victim
for not playing better?

268
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,980
[Yubin] When you roll a dice,

269
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,442
the odds of rolling an odd or even number
are exactly 50%.

270
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,821
But what if you keep getting odd numbers?

271
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,947
Then you should bet on even.

272
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,741
Or you could bet on odd again.
Maybe that's the vibe for that day.

273
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,868
Both of your arguments are valid.

274
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,287
That's called the gambler's fallacy.

275
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,872
Dongbang Yubin's Encyclopedia

276
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,415
"We'll get an odd after so many evens!"

277
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,460
Gambler's Fallacy
A cognitive error where one believes

278
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,295
that independent events
influence each other

279
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,466
People often believe
that independent events are related,

280
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,260
but with each roll,

281
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,514
the chances of rolling
an odd or even number remain the same,

282
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,392
unless the game is rigged.

283
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,230
In other words,
the only way to win at gambling is...

284

They'll launder the money and
transfer it to their withdrawal account.

I'm sorry to say this,
but to catch their money mule,

293
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,675
we'll have to go on a stakeout.

-Okay.

I can see that.

524
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,907
That's my coffee, by the way.

525
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,451
[scoffs] This is mine.

526
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,622
-"Yubin's"
-[♪ comical stinger]

527
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,873
I'm sorry.

528
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,750
[Yubin] You can drink both.

529
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,879
I'll buy you a new one later.

530
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,882
Can I ask you something?

531
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,759
What is it?

532
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,555
Why did you leave the US?

533
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,350
I heard you never finished your studies.

534
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,019
Why did you choose to come back
and work in the field?

535
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,607
I realized studying wasn't for me.

536
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,733
And I...

537
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,654
...enjoy working in the field.

538
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,823
I see.

540
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,745
Oh. The bank has confirmed a withdrawal.

541
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,872
-[Minseo] What?
-It must be that guy.

[clears throat]

545
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,384
The name of their money mule
is Hwang Younghoon.

546
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,095
He's 21 years old,
and he's a member of the 007 Group.

547
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,805
-007 Group?
-Yes.

548
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,642
All its members were born
between '00 and '07.

549
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,728
They're an MZ gang.

550
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,898
They've been growing fast,
so we've been keeping an eye on them.

551
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,359
They make money through online gambling,

552
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,194
crypto investment scams,
and illegal loans.

553
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,113
If they were born in '07,
they're underage.

554
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,615
[Minseo] That's right.

555
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,952
School bullies are selected and trained
to join the gang.

556
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,164
Wow, really? Talk about early learning.

557
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,207
There were kids like them
at my school too.

558
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,293
Don't tell me you hung out with them.

559
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,711
No way.

560
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,048
[Junghwan] This is what we know
about their organization so far.

561
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,758
Their organization is quite fragmented,

562
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,302
so we'll have to update the chart
as we gather more information.

563
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,972
Mastar at the top is basically
the boss of the MZ Union,

564
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,099
but we know nothing
about his identity yet.

565
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,603
[Joongryeok] What should we do?
We could raid them.

566
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,856
[Yubin] I agree. Let's tail
Hwang Younghoon,

567
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,691
and once we locate their office,

568
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,818
let's round them up all at once.

-So?
-How does it look?

578
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,736
There's only one entrance.
I think we should move in.

579
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,447
-What about the rooftop?
-The door to the rooftop is blocked.

580
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,201
Their office is on the third floor.
Everyone else has left.

581
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,911
This is our chance.

582
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,706
They're trapped. Let's do this.

583
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,834
[Yubin] They might have secured
another exit, so stay alert.

584
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,461
-Detective Jang, block their escape route.
-Yes, sir.

585
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,922
Detective Seo, stay in the car.
We might have to drive.

586
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,175
Detective Moo, Detective Jung,
and I are going into the building.

587
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,094
This might be our last chance for a while.

588
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,345
Let's get them no matter what.

589
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,430
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,605

-Get the tools. I'll break it open.

592
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,650
-[Yubin] Hold on. Let me take a look.
-Okay.

593
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,697
[Yubin] Zero and seven are more worn out
than the others.

594
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,700
Since they're the 007 Group,
could the passcode be 007?

595
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,660
Ah.

596
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,830
The passcode has to be
at least four digits.

597
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,458
Four digits. In that case...

598
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,168
Could it be 0070?

put the cash in a locker
at a subway station,

694
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,418
and then people from headquarters
pick it up.

As Gen MZ emerges as
the new driving force in gang activities,

870
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,638
the police are intensifying
their investigative efforts.

871

00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,591
Let's start a gang.

880
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,011
