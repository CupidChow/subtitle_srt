Episode 14

3
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,845
[Minseo] Ha Minyong doesn't seem
to be the culprit either.

4
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,848
His employer confirmed
that he's hard-working

5
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,933
and well-liked by his clients.

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,020
I also looked into his theft charge,
and he was just an accessory.

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,066
Then should we do some more digging
into the housekeeper?

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,986
[Joongryeok] She's over 60 and worked
for them for over 10 years. Not her.

10
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,495
Captain?

[♪ lighthearted music continues]

12
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,792
-Captain?
-Yes?

13
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,503
[Minseo] What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a briefing.

14
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,587
I'm checking social media.

15
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,631
[Minseo] Social media?

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,383
These days,
there's little need for legwork.

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,969
You can find out most information
on social media.

18
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,888
Why don't you make an account?

19
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,223
It's really fun.

20
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,558
-We could follow each other--
-Hey.

21
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,811
[mouthing] Be quiet.

22
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,854
Whose social media are you looking at?

23
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,147
Ha Minyong's.

24
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,859
-[Joongryeok] Is that a drone?
-Yeah.

25
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,779
-What's the big deal?
-It seems to be his long-time hobby.

26
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,114
He even has a license.

27
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,366
Do we really need to care
about his hobbies?

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,243
Drones are popular these days.

29
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:02,163
He's been fined for violating
the Aviation Safety Act before.

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,208
Specifically for the unauthorized flight
of ultra-light vehicles.

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,378
Did you say Professor Kim's neighbor
recently called emergency services?

32
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,213
Yes, it was about wasps.

33
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,716
Did Ha Min-yong ever pay another visit
to Professor Kim's place?

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,095
He did. He went back to change a filter.

35
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,597
Our culprit is...

36
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,935
[♪ pensive music playing]

37
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,812
Ha Minyong.

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,732
[drill whirring]

39

[♪ lighthearted dramatic music playing]

40
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,616
Drink this.

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,952
-Here.
-Thank you.

42
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,585
-Do you keep anything valuable in there?
-Not at all.

43
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,629
[Yubin] He probably noticed the vault
while repairing the HVAC system.

44
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,631
With just an old couple living there,

45
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,051
he would've thought
he just needed the passcode to rob it.

46
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,471
But how could he have found out
the passcode?

47
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,056
[Junghwan] My goodness.

48
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,516
[Joongryeok] There is a way.

49
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,438
You tie a camera to a pigeon and fly it.

50
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,356
Pretty close.

51
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,359
He would've used a drone.

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,697
[♪ pensive music playing]

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,075
[drone whirring]

54
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,285
Test the HVAC in each room

55
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,329
[Yubin] Using the HVAC test as an excuse,

56
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,459
he must've made Professor Kim's wife
unlock the vault

57
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,171
and filmed it from the outside
using his drone.

58
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,927
It would've been easy for him to zoom in
and get the passcode.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,097
[♪ dramatic music swelling]

60
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,433
I hear wasps.

61
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,768
[Minyong] I'll replace the filters.

62
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,812
I noticed last time that they were
pretty old. It won't take long.

63
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,651
[♪ dramatic music climaxing]

64
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,654
There will be dust everywhere
when I open this.

65
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,406
You can wait in the room
until I'm finished.

66
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,076
-Should I?
-Yes. [chuckles

68
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,509
Let's bring Ha Minyong in.

69
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
[Minseo] Yes, sir.

70
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:25,181

SEOUL BUSTERS

72
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,358
[Yubin] Why did you take
only one painting?

73
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,194
I was short on time,
and I only had two hands.

74
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,905
So I just took the first thing I saw.

75
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,156
What did you do with it?

76
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,367
I hadn't planned the crime.

77
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,411
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

78
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,580
Cut the nonsense and tell us
what you did with the painting!

79
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,416
I mean...

80
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,168
I'm a victim too.

81
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,462
What the hell are you talking about?

82
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,383
I asked the director where I used to work
to take care of the painting, but--

83
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,802
-Do they run a taekwondo studio?
-What are you talking about?

84
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,512
It can't be a hapkido
or kendo studio, can it?

85
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,723
That's not it.

86
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,725
Director Cheon runs a gallery.

87
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,643
You sold the painting
to this Director Cheon?

88
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,646
It was taken away from me.

89
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,897
[Joongryeok] What?

90
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,025
When he found out I stole it,
he took it away from me.

91
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,486
Please catch him.

92
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,655
I didn't realize this
when I was the thief,

93
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,907
but now that I've lost
what belongs to me...

94
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,786
[Minseo] Cheon Ilyong is
the director of Midam Gallery.

95
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,538
And he seems pretty fishy.

96
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,916
Four years ago, he was investigated
for smuggling out cultural assets.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,210
Ha Minyong said
that Cheon Ilyong used his gallery

98
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,921
for the unlawful transfer of assets
and money laundering.

99
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,675
I guess his gallery is just a cover
for all his shady business.

100
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,471
But he's such a big shot.
I'm not sure if we can handle him.

101
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,309
[Yubin] Whether he's a big shot or not,
he's a criminal all the same.

102
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,103
Of course.
He's the perfect size for us to handle.

103
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,813
-Like a custom suit.
-[confused grunt]

104
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,482
Everything seems clear. Let's take action.

105
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,484
[Minseo] There you go again.

106
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,403
If we scare him into hiding,
we'll have to kiss the painting goodbye.

107
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,489
-[softly] Hey.
-[Yubin] I agree.

108
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,533
We'll have to find a way
to casually approach him.

109
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,870
What do you mean, casually approach him?
It's not like we're hitting on him.

110
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,747
-Hey, Junghwan.
-Yeah?

111
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,415
We just have to zoom over and bam,
right?

112
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,667
[stuttering] Zoom and bam?
That's easier said than done.

113
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,961
What if he catches wind
and the painting goes poof?

114
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,381
Come on. If we zoom and bam
and the painting goes poof,

115
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,049
we'll just swoosh and snatch it back.

116
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,510
-[sighs]
-Who's this advisor mentioned here?

117
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,428
[Junghwan] They call him Mr. Jeon.

118
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,640
He often appraises antique art
for the gallery.

119
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,934
Once a fence,

120
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,603
he's become a big shot
in the antique art market.

121
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,066
He has such a keen eye for art
that even scholars seek his advice.

122
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,737
People entrust him with artworks
too valuable to handle themselves.

123
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,741
In short, he's the kingpin
behind the scenes of the art market.

[Minseo] Will he agree to help us
with all his shady business going on?

00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,227
We'll have to face him head-on
with a bang.

-Not you too.

We heard you two are quite close.

I haven't talked to him in ages.

So you're Seo Jangsoo's daughter.

All he ever talked about was his daughter.

He'd go on about
how smart and pretty you were.

[Yubin] Ah.

536

I tracked the buyer's movements
based on his appearance,

he always gets on and off at this station.

I checked his transit history,

around this time of day.
