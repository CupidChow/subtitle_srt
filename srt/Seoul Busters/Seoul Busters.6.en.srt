00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,232
[Junghwan sighs]

357
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,611
-That's so random.
-It's not at all.

358
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,614
She's been severely depressed.

359
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,699
So when she found out
about their financial loss,

360
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,493
she set the restaurant on fire.

361
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,412
Depression can lead to impulsive behavior.

362
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,081
Why would she go that far?

363
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,540
Because she was severely depressed.

364
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,167
Her daughter was inside the restaurant.

365
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,960
[in dramatic voice]
She was severely depressed.

366
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,254
She's unwell, and she would've had
to climb down the wall!

367
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,298
[squealing] She was severely…

[♪ downbeat music playing]

369
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,887
[in normal voice] …depressed.

370
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,181
I'm getting depressed.

371
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,849
I'm sorry, sir.

372
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,436
[Joongryeok] Wait, Tansik.

373
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,189
Sit in that chair and think some more.

374
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,273
[Tansik] Okay.

375
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,236
[Yubin] You can go back to your seat.

376
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,114
Yes, sir.

377
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,703
[Yubin sighs]

378
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,959
What are you doing, Captain?

379
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,086
I'm trying to think.

380
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,380
It's a thinking chair, after all.

381
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,465
[♪ downbeat music continues]

382
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,720
Mm…

383
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,728

385
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,527
[Minseo] What are you doing here?

386
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,238
-Thank you.
-Sure.

387
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,701
Nice view of the sunset, isn't it?

388
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,287
Oof.

389
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,039
If this weren't a daycare,
it'd be a great scenic viewpoint.

390
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,127
I found some footage of the restaurant
at the time of the fire.

391
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,045
It matches Jiwoong's statement.

392
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,964
The resolution isn't great,

393
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,466
but I put a copy on your desk
for your review.

394
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,052
-Good work.
-Thank you.

395
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,183
[sharp exhale]

396
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,937
[Minseo] Do you invest in crypto too?

397
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,564
No, it's not my thing.

398
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,107
[Minseo] Hmm.

399
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,319
All my friends were into it for a bit.

400
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,698
You know how quickly news spreads
about who made how much, right?

401
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,533
But no one ever talks about losing money.

402
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,452
What about you? Do you invest in crypto?

403
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,954
I used to think
crypto could turn my life around,

404
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,792
but I couldn't scrape together
any money to invest.

405
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,919
[Yubin] Hmm.

406
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,795
What was that crypto called?

407
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,756
Everyone was saying it'd shoot up tenfold.

408
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,051
But who cares?
I don't have two nickels to rub together.

[Jiwoong] Yes.

424
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Can we talk for a minute?

425
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,080
Sorry?

426
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,666
About what?

[Yubin sighs]

428
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,802
How's boxing going?

429
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,887
Is it fun?

430
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,390
I know nothing about boxing.

431
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,727
Uh, I quite like it.

432
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,563
[Jiwoong] It takes my mind off things.

433
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,731
[Yubin] Mm.

434
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,815
I see.

435
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,403
You were on your way to the gym
when you saw the fire, right?

436
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
What?

437
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,283
Uh, yes.

438
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,914
[Yubin] You made a report right away,

439
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,249
and it was at 4:27 a.m., correct?

440
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,001
There's a fire.

441
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,880
I think so.

Stay with me, Hyojoo.

445
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,645
-Hyojoo!
-[Yubin] Then you carried Hyojoo out.

446
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,485
You went into the restaurant
and carried Hyojoo out

447
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,362

00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,034
How did you know
Hyojoo was lying unconscious inside?

450
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,706
-What?
-The restaurant was filled with smoke,

451
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,085
and no one would've known
Hyojoo was there.

00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,421
And you couldn't have seen her

What did he say?

He's remaining silent.

-[Junghwan] May I try talking to him, sir?

463
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,263
-He's Gen Z.
-What?

464
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,348
He's Gen Z, not a millennial.

465

Since when did that become a thing?

I know you were just trying
to help Mr. Yoon

475
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,783
because you felt indebted to him.

00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,494

477
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,333
I heard Mr. Yoon
has been helping you out a lot.

If you really want to help him,

479
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,258
you should tell the truth.

How did you first meet Mr. Yoon?

485
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,835
I met him at the gym.

486
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,922
[Jiwoong] He used to coach my coach.

Mr. Yoon stepped in.

It's because of his upbringing.

Besides, boxing isn't just about fists.

505

It's about using your eyes.

506
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,218
And from what I can see,
you have sharp eyes.

[Jiwoong] But lately,

516
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,788
he seemed pretty down.

517
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,123
I asked him what was wrong

518
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,709
and said I'd help him in any way I could.

519
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,422
At first, he said everything was fine
and I should focus on boxing.

520

But a few days before the fire…

521
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,974

-[Minsoo] What?

00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,789
No, nothing's wrong.
