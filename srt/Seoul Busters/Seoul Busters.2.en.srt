354
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,652
became a kid like Detective Conan--

weren't you in the office?

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,785
[Yubin] I just went
to the bathroom upstairs.

359
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,620
There's a kid in there.

His mom left him here again.

[Eunkyung] I got the autopsy results.

It was urgent, so I expedited it a bit.

This case was no walk in the park.

Charcoal briquettes

-Yes.
-[Eunkyung] But the cause of death

392
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,335
wasn't carbon monoxide poisoning.

Not lethal.

[Eunkyung] The National Forensic Service

414
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,129

A natural poison.

00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,306
Tetrodotoxin.

422
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,767
[echoing]
It was puffer fish poison.

423
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,938
In this case, even if we don't know
who the criminal is,

424
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,773
they were quite clever.

425
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,693
They used a natural poison
to make it look like a suicide,

426
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
but they probably didn't know
how powerful it was.

Please hurry.

Let's think about why I did that

There's nobody to consider a suspect.

451
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,149
Why are his personal connections
so limited?

452
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,068
[Minseo] There weren't any
insurance payouts, were there?

Not even private health insurance.

00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,196
Only public health insurance.

00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,841
isn't someone he knew--

You're the only one in the dark here.

468
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,891
Do you think a random robber

brought charcoal briquettes
and puffer fish poison?

470
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,272

This is my first meal of the day.

528
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,685
Thinking about Lim Dongil makes me so sad.

529
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,396
He came to Seoul all by himself
at a young age

530
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,773
without any friends
in order to find his path.

531
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,066
Detective Seo.

532
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,151
When dealing with cases,

533
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,237
try to detach your emotions
as much as possible.

534
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,615
Sometimes, bad guys are innocent,
and good guys are guilty.

535
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,535
When a person catches a tiger,
it's called hunting,

536
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,662
but when a tiger catches a person,
it's a disaster.

537
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,164
The perspective changes
the nature of the situation.

538
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,251
Captain, you know what?

539
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,587
-What?
-Never mind.

540
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,046
Go ahead.

541
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,673
Well, it's just…

542
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,385
You sounded a bit like
a know-it-all just now.

543
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,511
A know-it-all?

544
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,514
But you do have a lot of knowledge,

545
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,141
so you probably have a lot to explain.

546
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,809
I completely understand.

547
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,769

548
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,229

Not at all, sir. It just slipped my mind--
