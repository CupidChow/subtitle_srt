Doctor, you said the procedure went well.

[doctor] That's strange.

354
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,581
The procedure really was successful.

355
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:25,586
The chance of pregnancy after a vasectomy
is less than 0.3%.

356

Less than 0.3%?

357
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,341
That means it's nearly impossible.

358
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,511
Then how did I become pregnant?

No way. I could've sworn
it was Seoul National University.

Hello, this is Violent Crimes Team 2.

529
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,295
What?

530
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,589
Listen.

[♪ tense music playing]

532
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,014
She went missing around 3:10 p.m. today

533
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,308
from the apartment complex's
back gate, correct?

534
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,853
Yes, I think it was around then.

535
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:08,608
The teacher said Yoona's uncle
picks her up every Thursday.

536
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,319
Yes, he lives
in the same apartment complex.

537
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,904
But today,

538
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,075
he said he got a call saying
that her class was running late.

539
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,578
[Yoona's father] So he thought
my wife was picking Yoona up.

540
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,914
Has he been picking her up
every Thursday so far?

541
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,418
[Yoona's father]
My wife is in grad school,

542
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,753
so every Thursday,

543
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:34,384
she gets home
around 30 minutes after Yoona.

544
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,303
[sobs] It's all my fault.

545
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,554
What should we do?

546
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,515
When did you receive this name tag?

547

While we were looking everywhere
for our kid,

548
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,856
a neighbor brought it
because someone asked them to.

Do you have their phone number?

550

Ah.

Yes.

I've been one for around ten years.

555
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,370
In kidnapping cases,
the parents' cooperation is crucial.

You said so.

No, it's my room! Right, Daddy?

00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,166
The room belongs to both of you.

We're baffled too.

597
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,654
I could've sworn it was Yoona's uncle.

598
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,198
Was there anything unusual?

599
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,659
No. The man had a similar build.

600
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,662
He looked just like Yoona's uncle.

601
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,873
So you didn't see his face clearly.

602
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,170
This kindergarten is
100 times better than ours.

Don't tell me you followed us.

So why do you keep coming to us?

I go to this kindergarten now,

613
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,650
but I used to go there.

614

Don't come back again, okay?

615
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,030
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

Detective Seo, check out those cars.

-[Minseo] What about them?
-[Tansik] They're all backed in,

631
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,954
but should we take a look
at their dashcams?

-It is!

-[Tansik] It is?

We found footage of Yoona being kidnapped.

[Joongryeok] That's Yoona, right?

643
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,236
The headband and the dress match exactly.

644
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,739
Judging by the build,
the kidnapper can't be a woman.

645
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,284
That means…

646
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,368
[knocks on table]

647
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,494

[soft chuckle] Isn't it obvious?

651

The kidnapper pretended
to be Yoona's uncle!

652
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,216
Her uncle must be a man.

00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,677
Everything's falling into place.

654
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,098
Gosh, I don't know what to do
with that idiot sometimes.

655
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,475
They do share a similar build,

656
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,519
but it still doesn't make sense.

657
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,731
How could Yoona mistake
someone else for her uncle?

658
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,482
It's a common cognitive distortion,

659
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,359
also known as an observational illusion.

660
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,654
Often, we believe
we've seen something clearly,

661
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
but it's actually
a result of careless assumptions.

662
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,993
Is this the only footage we have?

663
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,119
[Tansik] Yes, sir.

664
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,997
This is all we found around the scene.

665
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,335
The kidnapper must've targeted Yoona
from the beginning

666
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,713
and made thorough preparations
for a long time.

667
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,007
Yoona was his target from the get-go?

668
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,218
The neighborhood
is full of dashcams and CCTVs.

669
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,387
The fact that there's hardly
any footage of him

670
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,098
suggests he did his research
on how to avoid them.

671
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,850
He also picked Thursday,

672
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,019
when Yoona is picked up by her uncle,
not her mom.

673
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,272
It shows he'd been keeping an eye
on Yoona for a while.

674
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,316
But why is it so quiet?

675
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,860
The kidnapper hasn't made any demands yet.

676
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,445
We'll find out soon.

677
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,573
[Yoona's father sighs] This is hard.

Are you sure you don't know him?

Since I meet a lot of people at work,

I'm good at recognizing faces.

685
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,341
The kidnapper is likely
holding a grudge against you.

We're convinced
he was keeping an eye on Yoona.

687

So this is a channel you run?

701
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,754
Yes.

702
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,882
I wanted to help the victims

But as you can see,
things often get pretty messy.

705
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,641
That's why I've been keeping it
from my family.

706
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:43,104
Are you suspecting the kidnapper is
one of the bait-and-switch dealers?

707
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,857
Many of them must be
holding a grudge against me.

708
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,111
I've actually been threatened
by a few of them.

709
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,113
They're the only ones I can think of.

710
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,742
This could lead to something.

711
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,661
Do you have a list
of bait-and-switch dealers

712
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,079

I was working, of course.

to call me over without a warrant?

who can confirm your alibi?

721
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,734
You can't do this to me.
I'm a hard-working taxpayer.

722

724

Do you even know how much I get paid?

725
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,535
Do you admit to threatening
Mr. Choo Yongjin over text?

726
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,454
I didn't threaten him.

727
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,498
He came after us first!

728
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,583
But you committed a crime.

729
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,667
A crime?

730
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,712
[sighs] I'll be blunt.

731
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,132
Should he really be stabbing
his fellow dealers in the back like this?

732
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,886
Also, we lost 20 million won
because of him!

733
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,889
20 million isn't some dog's name!

874
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,712
Their Almost Twisted Hero

875
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,381
"Hero."

876
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,800
[Yubin] Hmm.

877
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,345
Let him go. It's not him.

878
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,554
Captain, you should see this.

879
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,680
Just let him go.

880
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,643
He told you to let me go!

881
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,567
This is going to drag on for a while.
Go home for the day.

882
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,569
-Captain.
-[door closes]

883
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,988
Why are you letting him go?
He's our prime suspect.

884
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,615
Yoon Seohun has red-green color blindness.

885
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,536
So what? It's not like we're issuing
his driver's license.

886
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,287
Look at this letter here.

887
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,082
It's orange against a green background.

888
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,543
Yoon Seohun
would've had trouble reading it.

889
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,462
[Yubin] It doesn't make sense
for him to have chosen this letter.

890
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,547
[frustrated sigh]

891
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,675
There goes our prime suspect. [groans]

892
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,219
[Tansik] We're back at square one.

893
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,264
That sketch is our only clue then.

894
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,101
To me, it just looks like an ordinary man.

895
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,270
It may not be…

896
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,355
[♪ mysterious music sting]

897
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,898
…a man.

898
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,820
[Tansik] What do you see in that sketch?

899
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,992
[Yubin] The person looks sad.

900
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,787
Also tired after years of struggle.

901
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,623
I also sense loneliness
stemming from isolation.

902
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:09,044
Most of all,
those eyes seem to belong to a woman.

903
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,881
To me, it looks like a middle-aged man
who loves his drinks.

904
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,759
Maybe you're right.

905
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,429
[sighs] I'm worried about Yoona's parents.

906
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,681
They've become so haggard overnight.

907
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,892
But how could the kidnapper
demand five billion won?

908
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,352
Is that some kind of joke?

909
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,271
-How does that make sense?
-[Yubin] It doesn't.

910
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,480
[Minseo] Right?

911
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,567
How would ordinary people like them
prepare five billion won? [scoffs]

912
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,776
[Yubin] I know.

913
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,778
I wonder why the kidnapper made
such a demand

914
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,739
from ordinary people.

915
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,491
Maybe he's a psychopath
who's lost touch with reality.

916
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,368
[Yubin]
The kidnapper was meticulous enough

917
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,536
to secure an escape route

918
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,414
and planned out the crime well in advance.

919
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,334
They can't just be a psychopath.

920
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,546
[Yoona's mother sniffles]

921
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,424
[door opens]

922
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,388
[Yoona's father] You should eat something.

923
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,142
We need to pull ourselves together
to find Yoona.

924
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,645
You go and eat.

925
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,064
You should eat something too.

926
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,232
[sighs]

927
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,110
Are you planning to starve to death?

928
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,404
[shouts]
Should we just starve to death together?

929

It's been 48 hours
since the disappearance of Choo Yoona,

943
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,574
a chatty and hopeful seven-year-old.

944
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,160
With her parents in torment…

945
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,912
[groans] What the heck?

946
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,288
[Minseo] Who leaked it?

947
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,876
Why are you looking at me?

948
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,128
It's not me this time!

949
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,004
It wasn't me last time either!

950
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,632
There are articles
all over the internet too.

for jeopardizing her safety.

Understood, sir.
