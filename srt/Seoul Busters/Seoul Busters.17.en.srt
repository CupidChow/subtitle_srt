1
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,543
Seoul Busters

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,589
Come with me.

3
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,174
Just one game.

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,967
The other guys will be there too.

5
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,636
I can't.
I have a makeup class at the academy.

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,513
If I miss it,
they'll call my mom right away.

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,937
By the way,
wasn't math super hard on the midterms?

8
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,898
How did you do?

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,358
I had to guess on a few questions,

10
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,319
but I managed to get everything right.

11
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,780
You got everything right?

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,616
It was so hard.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,495
Who cares? Midterms are over.

14
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,247
Are you sure
you don't want to go to the internet café?

15
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,212
I'll never be able
to beat you.

16
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,006
Episode 17

17
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,638
Ah, I have so much to tell you.

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,057
Isn't it unbelievable though?

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,893
That's what he said.

20
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,938
Yeah, exactly.

21
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,190
My address is Suan Apartments,
Building A, Unit 705.

22
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,152
Since you're visiting my place
for the first time,

23
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,320
don't forget to bring a lot of food.

24
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,531
Okay.

25
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,168
Hello?

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,712
I'm busy right now. I'll call you back.

27
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,138
Damn it. Where did he go?

28
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,405
Suan Apartments, Building A, Unit 705

29
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,036
Gobau

30
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,206
Captain!

31
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,835
Did you bring an umbrella?

32
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,837
It's pouring out.

33
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,464
I told you it'd rain.

34
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,593
That's why I wanted to drink
all afternoon.

35
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,303
Those two things are completely unrelated.

36
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,555
- That's just an excuse.
- They are related.

37
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,100
Hearing the rain makes you want to drink.
Am I right?

38
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,145
I crave soda when it rains.

39
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,898
-Soda?
-I've never experienced that.

40
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,274
Scientifically, it makes no sense.

41
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,443
There is actually some science behind it.

42
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,153
Is there?

43
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
When it rains,
there's low atmospheric pressure,

44
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,493
reduced sunshine and high humidity.

45
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,954
This increases melatonin
and decreases serotonin,

46
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,956
causing people to feel down.

47
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,166
To combat that,

48
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,377
your appetite increases,
and you crave alcohol.

49
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,088
That's how it works.

50
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,172
No wonder.

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,925
Whenever it rains,
I crave pancakes and rice wine.

52
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,177
-You said you didn't crave anything.
-I do.

53
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,221
I have to take this.

54
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,639
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

55
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,810
Listen, it's about Captain.

56
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,646
Now that I've gotten to know him,

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,565
it turns out he's a PO.

58
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,442
-A PO?
-What's that?

59
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,820
A peculiar oddball.

60
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,031
-So that's what that means.
-He is a bit strange.

61
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,324
I agree.

62
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,244
Hold on. If he's a "peculiar oddball"
and "strange..."

63
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,538
Then what?

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,666
Does that make him a POS?

65
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,750
Boring.

66
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,628
Still, he grabs drinks with us
after work these days.

67
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,171
He's changed a lot.

68
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,299
I know. He's softened up a bit.

69
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,010
- Exactly.
- He's changed quite a lot.

70
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,928
What's this?

71
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,556
It's a wallet. Is this Captain's?

72
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,349
Open it. Maybe there are pictures inside.

73
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,184
There's nothing inside...

74
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,813
What's wrong?

75
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,318
Why are you making such a fuss?

76
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,154
- What's with you guys?

77
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,578
Listen.

78
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,414
I heard he almost
married a woman in the US.

79
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,374
-It must be her.
-In the US?

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,500
-Yes.
-Almost married?

81
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,710
Who is she?

82
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,920
That's all I know.

83
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,261
As a detective, I have a hunch.

84
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,847
Why do you think
an elite detective from the US

85
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,725
left to join this insignificant
Violent Crimes Team?

86
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,144
- Why?
- I know.

87
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,645
-Why'd he leave?
-You know something?

88
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,482
He once said something in passing.

89
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,359
"Wanted for Fraud"

90
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,403
They're supposed to be a couple,
but I bet that's just for show.

91
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,863
Let's not jump to conclusions.

92
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,492
Criminals can fall in love too.

93
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,874
First-degree
murder. She killed her husband.

94
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,959
Can you just get
some basic information from her?

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,688
Ah, Would you like
something to drink?

96
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,149
Coffee? Do you drink coffee?

97
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,943
You look like you need some caffeine.

98
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,737
How did you know I was thirsty?

99
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,658
Your lips looked a little dry.

100
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,951
How different.

101
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
Different?

102
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,955
What's different from what?

103
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,832
You're different

104
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,708
from the other detectives.

105
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,420
How so?

106
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,796
You have dignity.

107
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,715
Oh, dignity?

108
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,844
Interesting.

109
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,687
We found these at the scene.

110
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,188
"How to Get Away with Murder"

111
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,815
Throw them deep into the ocean

112
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,734
so no one can find them.

113
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,658
Still, we meet again.

114
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,577
Finally.

115
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
It takes a murder

116
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,165
for us to meet.

117
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,624
Let's never meet again.

118
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,211
You've completely destroyed me,

119
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,840
both physically and mentally.

120
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,311
I killed someone again.

121
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,605
It's been a while, Yubin.

122
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,275
Do you think I'm a joke?

123
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,403
I just wanted to see you.

124
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,449
Does that make me a bad person?

125
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,829
After falling in love with
a serial killer and getting hurt,

126
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,248
he returned to Korea.

127
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,295
"Don't go away!
Don't go away, Yubin!"

128
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,631
"Please come back to me!"

129
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,008
I think I've heard
that story before.

130
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,220
Did you watch a movie last night?

131
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,472
- How did you know?
- That's a great movie.

132
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,474
-It was amazing.
-Whatever.

133
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,144
I recently attended a profiling seminar,

134
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,146
and there's something I learned.

135
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,523
Here's what I think.

136
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,983
I actually overheard something.

137
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,778
You and I
will be competing again.

138
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,030
I'm so tired of it.

139
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,324
Most of the time, I won.

140
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,537
You're right.
You even stole my girlfriend.

141
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,748
His girlfriend?

142
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,917
- Hi, Dongbang.
- Hey.

143
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,257
Meet Jaein.
I've talked about her a lot, haven't I?

144
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,218
This is my best friend, Dongbang Yubin.

145
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,930
You're the two people
I trust the most in the world.

146
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,767
I trust Dongbang
as much as I trust you, Jaein.

147
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,395
Should you really be introducing
such a beauty to me?

148
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,438
I don't feel worried at all

149
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,482
about introducing her to you.

150
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,366
After that day,

151
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,369
the three of them
started hanging out together,

152
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,664
and things were going well.

153
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,583
But then,
as often happens in such encounters,

154
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,917
something went wrong.

155
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,089
The two of them ended up becoming
attracted to each other.

156
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,888
"Where did things go wrong?"

157
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,309
Professor Sim started having
a bad feeling about the two.

00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,367
I'm on fire.
I can't stop dancing.

164
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,203
What's with my shoulder?

165
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,413
Stay still.

166
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,458
That reminds me.

167
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,503
What's wrong?

168
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,965
I got involved in a gun accident
in the US, and it still hurts sometimes.

169
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,926
-A gun accident?
-It's no big deal.

170
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,512
A gun?

171
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,349
Considering this was in the US...

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,941
Congratulations.

173
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,869
Captain said

174
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,914
he once investigated a gang in the US.

175
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,254
Those gangsters

176
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,049
must have gotten back at him.

177
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,106
Oh!

178
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,493
They couldn't have fired guns
in broad daylight.

179
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,328
-Don't be ridiculous!
-Hey.

180
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,831
Americans have gun cabinets
in their living rooms.

181
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,501
Even dogs carry guns in the US!

182
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,712
In the end, Captain...

183
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,238
Oh, it was a mistake
that day, okay?

184
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,158
But please, give us just one--

185
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,054
What are you doing here?

186
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,889
This is actually my gang.

187
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,978
I'm sorry, but this is the end for us.

188
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,019
No, don't kill him!

189
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,647
Why would you kill a person?

190
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,191
Right, I shouldn't kill him.
I got a little carried away.

191
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,568
Then how about this?

192
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,528
He crossed the border.

193
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,321
Yes, Mexico!

194
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,740
- Mexico?
- No, Cuba.

195
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,200
Cuba.

196
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,162
Cuba, Cuba, Cuba...

197
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,123
Fidel Castro.

198
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,207
Cuba?

199
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,209
"Fidel Castro:
Cuban politician and revolutionary"

200
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,378
What are you so excited about?

201
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,588
Talking behind your back.

202
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,840
What? No way.

203
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,634
So you were talking behind my back
that enthusiastically?

204
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,386
- No.
- Captain.

205
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,097
- You dropped your wallet.
- Hey, that's mine.

206
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,976
But why are there only 10,000-won bills?
Where did my 50,000-won bill go?

207
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,145
-Detective Jung!
-Did you seriously take that?

208
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,813
It wasn't me.

209
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,608
The 50,000-won bill
wasn't in my wallet to begin with.

210
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,279
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry.

211
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,031
Captain.

212
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,327
I heard you got involved
in a gun accident in the US...

213
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,623
That's right. I got hit in the shoulder.

214
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:25,674
The kid next door
used to carry a gun around.

215
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,176
That's what it's like in the US.

216
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,303
When he fired it, it went bang,

217
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,723
and it shot out these huge bubbles.

218
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,017
Pop, pop, pop.

219
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,436
Bang! And it goes pop, pop, pop.

220
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,314
It created all these bubbles.

221
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,734
But then the kid suddenly
threw the gun at my shoulder,

222
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,486
and it landed right on my collarbone.

223
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,155
It hurts to this very day.

224
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,075
So you just got hit with a gun,
not shot by one?

225
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:55,663
Why would a kid shoot a gun?
He threw it at me.

226
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,090
Seoul Busters

227
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,166
-Gosh.
-Go in.

228
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,131
What are you doing? Jeez.

229
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,257
A hiker...

230
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,094
Good going. Look at you.

231
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,722
What's wrong with you?

232
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,142
A hiker found the body early
this morning and filed a report.

233
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,394
It was around 5 a.m..

234
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
The hiker thought
it was a mannequin at first,

235
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,231
but it turned out to be a human body.

236
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,316
As you can see,
there are footprints,

237
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,987
but none of the victim's belongings
were left at the scene.

238
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,949
The parking lot
doesn't seem to have any CCTVs either.

239
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,702
Captain! Captain! Captain!

240
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,621
Hey, you...

241
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,457
Captain!

242
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,126
This spot...

243
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,212
This spot...

244
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,676
You've got to be kidding me.

245
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,555
-Where were we?
-None of her belongings were found here.

246
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,349
The victim must've been carried here
after death.

247
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,186
It rained until pretty late yesterday.

248
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,104
If she had walked here,

249
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,148
her sneakers wouldn't be this clean.

250
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,108
"Clean sneakers"

251
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,863
The body's clean.
There are no wounds or anything.

252
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,698
Could she have been poisoned?

253
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,492
It's hard to tell.

254
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,702
Forensics will reveal more.

255
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,995
Estimated time of death?

256
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,371
It's been less than 48 hours.

257
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,834
We can't identify the victim
because no items were found.

258
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,170
She must be an art major,
specifically in painting.

259
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,507
-How do you know that?
-Do you know her?

260
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,092
Her cuff has paint stains on it.

261
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,431
You often get those stains
when painting with a palette,

262
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,642
and they don't come out easily
because it's oil paint.

263
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,896
Maybe she paints as a hobby.

264
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,774
Rose gray is only found
in professional paints.

265
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,983
"Rose gray paint on cuff"

266
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,236
The indent on her middle finger indicates

267
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,114
she's been painting regularly
for a long time.

268
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,117
Still, we can't be sure
she's an art major.

269
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,578
Come on.
She's an art major if Captain says so.

270
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,955
-She can't be a PE major.
-You...

271
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,085
Anyway, it seems the culprit had
no intention of hiding the body.

272
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,462
The culprit wanted the body to be found.

273
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,465
This spot is clearly visible
from the trail.

274
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,095
- This was like a stage for the culprit.
- A stage?

275
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,222
Judging by how they controlled the scene,

276
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,057
the culprit must be a pro.

277
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,102
You mean like a hitman?

278
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,186
That's not likely.

279
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,313
Ah, of course not.

280
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,606
What's the deal with you?

281
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,525
This might be a serial killing case,

282
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,026
although I'm just speculating.

283
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,530
Captain,
speaking from experience,

284
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,658
if the culprit left
their footprints everywhere,

285
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
they can't be a pro.

286
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,121
They're more like an idiot.
Just look at the scene.

287
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,039
Captain! Captain.

288
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,043
This is actually quite an awkward spot.

289
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,837
What's so awkward about it?

290
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
This is...

291
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,174
right on the border.

292
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,344
"Songwon-gu, Yeongdeungpo-gu"

293
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,721
"Songwon, Yeongdeungpo"

294
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,805
All right.

295
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,392
Only the left half of Songnae Mountain
is within our jurisdiction,

296
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,311
with the trail marking the border.

297
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,021
And as you can see here,

298
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,024
the body was found right along the border,

299
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,317
which makes it complicated.

300
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,401
Is it really that unclear?

301
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,070
The body was lying perfectly in the middle
of the two jurisdictions.

302
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,906
That's really ambiguous.

303
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,658
Should we hand over the case?

304
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,453
-It's going to be a headache anyway.
-But...

305
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,914
Besides, the victim lived
outside our jurisdiction.

306
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,249
Forget about jurisdictions for now.

307
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,794
- I think that's a great idea.
- Hmm...

308
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,047
- Do we know anything about the victim?
- Yes.

309
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,924
Her name is Jung Hyunjoo,

310
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,218
a third-year in Western Painting
at Yirim Woman's University.

311
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,552
She was on a leave of absence.

312
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,221
Oh, Captain's guess was right.

313
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,848
I knew it too. I had a hunch.

314
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,268
The livor mortis indicates

315
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,521
the body was moved to Songnae Mountain
immediately after death.

316
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,357
Oh, Captain was right again.

317
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,067
What are you, a fanboy?

318
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,070
Why do you keep saying Captain was right?

319
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,822
- Does she have any family?
- I can answer that.

320
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,617
She lived alone in Seoul.

321
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,203
Her father and younger brother
live in Suwon.

322
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,121
They're on welfare.

323
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,832
Her brother is a university student
and is currently in the military.

324
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,626
What about the footprints
found at the scene?

325
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,961
I analyzed them.

326
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,172
I ran the footprints through the database,

327
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,260
and they're from inexpensive sneakers
widely available on the market.

328
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,346
Over 20,000 pairs were sold
last year alone,

329
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,015
and the sole design
changed five years ago.

330
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,559
This isn't enough to identify the culprit.

331
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,981
-Did you say her family was on welfare?
-Yes.

332
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,067
Her apartment is rather expensive.

333
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,112
That doesn't add up.

334
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,782
Rather than "doesn't add up,"
I'd say it doesn't quite fit.

335
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,159
What's the difference?

336
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,912
I mean it's unlikely, but not impossible.

337
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,457
Anyway, let's interview
her acquaintances first.

338
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,795
I've never been
to a women's university before.

339
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,879
Have you?

340
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,756
It's nothing special.

341
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,510
Still, I'm getting excited.

342
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,429
Are you excited
about visiting a women's university?

343
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,723
- Yes!
- Get it together.

344
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,559
Remember, we're on duty.

345
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,145
I'll keep that in mind.

346
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,107
Tansik, stay alert at all times
until you go to bed.

347
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,235
No, stay alert even when you're in bed.

348
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,531
In our line of work,
you never know what might happen next.

349
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,408
Every moment presents a choice

350
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,994
and can be the beginning of a case.
Got that?

351
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,704
-I'll keep that in mind.
-Good.

352
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,206
-Hey, take out some gimbap.
-Sure.

353
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,375
Try some.

354
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,338
I think the spinach has gone bad.

355
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,049
-What?
-You know I have a keen sense of smell.

356
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,258
Let me see.

357
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,260
Is this from a food stall?

358
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,262
It looks so skimpy anyway.

359
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,513
Hey, my mom made that.

360
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,643
It looks skimpy
yet so appetizing at the same time.

361
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,103
Forget it.

362
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,693
Now that I've tried it,
it's really good.

363
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,944
-Let me try.
-Okay.

364
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,743
-Gimbap, gimbap!
-Yes!

365
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,453
-My mom's gimbap!
-Yes!

366
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,506
The place does look quite fancy
for someone on welfare.

367
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,508
Maybe she worked part-time.

368
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,218
Like tutoring and such.

369
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,554
How would you afford a place like this
with a part-time job?

370
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,599
The rent is pretty high.

371
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,435
I know. It's hard to believe
a student lived here alone.

372
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,730
Art supplies cost a lot too.

373
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,029
Over there.

374
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,739
Over there.

375
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,205
Detective Seo.

376
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,289
"Go"

377
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,083
"You go"

378
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,751
-"Come on"
-"No, you go"

379
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,294
-"Do as I say!"
-"I won't!"

380
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,881
"...Jeez"

381
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,057
Nobody's here.

382
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,064
Shh...

383
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,859
"Take a look"

384
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,277
"You do it"

385
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,195
"You go"

386
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,905
"No, YOU go"

387
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,657
"...Jeez"

388
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,910
Hurry up.

389
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,542
She was so cheerful
and talented.

390
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,878
She was an amazing painter.

391
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,422
I'll just ask you some questions.

392
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,468
Did Hyunjoo get along with her friends?

393
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,595
Yes. She was really popular.

394
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,389
She was even the student representative
for her first two years,

395
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,476
although she quit in her third year
to focus on her studies.

396
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,898
She was popular
with the professors and her seniors too.

397
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,026
Was she seeing anyone?

398
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,071
She never mentioned anyone.

399
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,823
She was too busy working

400
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,576
and focused on making it big as an artist.

401
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,745
She was extremely hardworking.

402
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,372
I can't believe what happened.

403
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,879
We were planning
to go on a trip this winter.

404
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,174
I'm so sorry...

405
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,265
Don't mind me.

406
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:22,687
Was Hyunjoo living alone?

407
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,855
Yes.

408
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,317
She lived close to campus,

409
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,487
so we'd sometimes go over
when we finished late.

410
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,531
She took such good care of us.

411
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,449
She was like a big sister.

412
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,537
- Goodness.
- We owe her so much.

413
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,207
If only I had known this would happen...

414
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,461
And Hyunjoo loved the ocean.

415
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,840
We wanted to hear the waves together--

416
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,849
Are you okay?
I hear the waves in your stomach.

417
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,311
My stomach's a little upset.

418
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,025
- Can we...
- Yes?

419
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,902
...take a little break?

420
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,406
Sure.

421
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,919
It's the stool creaking.

422
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,671
I heard it clearly.
When he dragged the stool--

423
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,063
My stomach's been a little upset...

424
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,148
No.

425
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,693
It was me. Right. It was me, everyone.

426
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,069
I'm the one who farted.

427
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,905
-It was me!
-Stop overreacting!

428
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,616
You're making things worse.

429
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,496
Anyway, did Hyunjoo...

430
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,248
Actually, where's the restroom?

431
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,918
There are only ladies' rooms
in this building.

432
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,211
Go to...

433
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,090
Go to the building across from this one.

434
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,099
I'll open the windows.

435
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,063
Are you all okay?

436
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,830
Men's room

437
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,836
Wait. It's under repair.

438
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,963
What? You mean the restroom?

439
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,969
"Out of service, do not use"

440
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,054
No way.

441
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,477
Tansik, it's me.
The restroom's out of service.

442
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,814
We'll lead you to the restroom.
Follow our instructions.

443
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,108
- "We"?
- First, leave the building.

444
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,234
Got it.

445
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,126
I'm outside now.

446
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,253
Do you see the two buildings
in front of you?

447
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,840
Enter the taller one
and take the stairs.

448
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,318
Tansik, I can't hold it
any longer.

449
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,611
You're almost there.

450
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,697
The restroom's on the third floor.
Hang in there.

451
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,491
You're so close! Go to the third floor,
and you'll see it right away.

452
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,255
"Restroom"

453
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,133
"Restroom"

454
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,553
I'm at a crossroads.
Is it to the left or right?

455
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,472
-It's to the left.
-It's to the right.

456
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,599
-Left? Right?
-It's to the right.

457
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,517
-The left?
-No, it's to the right.

458
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,060
Which way do you want me to go?

459
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,563
A majority says it's to the right.

460
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,190
Okay, everybody.

461
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,860
Hey, you're wrong.

462
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,249
In our line of work,
you never know what might happen next.

463
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,046
Every moment presents a choice

464
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,675
and can be the beginning of a case.

465
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,941
Stay put.

466
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,153
Stay put.

467
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,208
Just as I expected.

468
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,417
Come here.

469
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,587
Get back here!

470
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,429
Out of the way!

471
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,142
What's with him?

472
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,771
What the...

473
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,190
Come here.

474
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,584
Who are you?

475
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,460
What are you doing
at a women's university?

476
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,712
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,630
What were you doing in the restroom?

478
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,715
Let me see.

479
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,594
-A camera?
-A camera?

480
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,761
Please forgive me this once.

481
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,096
Dream on!

482
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,808
Everyone, here's a perv!

483
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,884
Mission complete.

484
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,016
Oh!

485
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,225
Hi, kitty.

486
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,519
- Gosh, that scared me.
- Come here.

487
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,272
How long have you
been hiding here?

488
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,651
Can you get me some cat food and water?

489
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,277
Me? I don't know where they are.

490
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,988
Me neither, but we can't let it starve.
Hurry up.

491
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,073
It's not my pet.

492
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,240
"Get to it"

493
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,243
"Yes, ma'am"

494
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,089
Luna Bar

495
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,514
Luna Bar

496
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,860
Remember when I said
the victim must've worked part-time?

497
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,237
You did.

498
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,450
I think I found out where she worked.

499
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,706
"Luna Bar Hyunjoo"

500
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,417
"You're the best!"

501
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,420
"This is just who I am!"

502
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,339
"Heh"

503
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,010
Good work, Detective Moo.

504
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,887
You really moved me.

505
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,557
-What do you mean?
-Even in such a critical moment...

506
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,309
I would've chosen the restroom.

507
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
Tansik.

508
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,688
As a detective,

509
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,316
even when you're eating, sleeping,

510
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,610
or in a crisis like I was today,

511
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,863
you must pursue criminals.

512
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,907
That's the fate of a detective.

513
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,078
They say, "Destiny is an arrow
flying towards you,

514
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,956
while fate is an arrow
coming from behind."

515
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,083
Ah. Is there such a saying?

516
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,962
Sukmyeong, meaning fate,
contains a character meaning "sleep."

517
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,257
This symbolizes how fate influences you
even while you're unaware.

518
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,550
Hey!

519
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,136
Look at you rattling on. Destiny? Fate?

520
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,013
Are you really in a position
to educate us on that?

521
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,890
-We'll talk at the precinct.
-I'm sorry.

522
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,850
It's your lucky day.

523
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,228
If I had soiled my pants,
I would've killed you.

524
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,313
Lucky me.

525
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,358
You little... Tansik, drive.

526
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,902
-We need to talk.
-I'm sorry.

527
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,780
I'm sorry.

528
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,407
I'm sorry!

529
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,842
There's no sign of hesitation.

530
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,846
The culprit was strong enough
to carry an unconscious woman

531
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,349
weighing over 100lbs
without taking a break.

532
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,990
The culprit wears size 8.5 shoes.

533
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,744
The victim was carried
on the right shoulder.

534
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,454
"Right shoulder"

535
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,254
The culprit appears to be right-handed.

536
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,338
Right hand

537
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,133
Considering the stride length,
the estimated height is...

538
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,719
"25 inches, just under 6 feet"

539
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,054
...just under six feet.

540
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,181
Even while carrying the victim,

541
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,559
the stride length didn't decrease much.

542
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,064
"Consistent stride length"

543
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,109
He has rather small feet
but is well-built.

544
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,319
Given his strength,

545
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,072
the perp is likely
a man in his 20s to mid-30s.

546
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,244
He didn't leave any trace

547
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,247
except for his footprints.

548
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,333
Why on earth

549
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,919
is that?

550
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:30,980
He's left-handed.

551
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,900
He either trained himself
to be right-handed

552
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,485
or was pretending to be right-handed.

553
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,363
Left hand...

554
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,244
We'll draft a script based on this.

555
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,704
Please do that.

556
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,039
"Remaking of Crime"

557
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:52,084
Right. Have you seen
the Songnae Mountain case?

558
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,213
You mean the female university student
found dead on a trail?

559
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,798
It might be worth
looking into.

560
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,512
It reminds me of a famous US case
from the early 2000s.

561
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,640
The TTK case. Have you heard of it?

562
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,892
Yes, it's a well-known cold case, right?

563
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,727
The Tea Time Killer case.

564
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,354
What about it?

565
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,981
The cases are quite similar.

566
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,611
Both victims were anesthetized
and then suffocated.

567
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:23,199
Also, in both cases, the scenes were
manipulated as if to make a statement.

568
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,869
But what would an American cold case
have to do with ours?

569
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,749
Since the case was so notorious,
it inspired similar cases.

570
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,751
Three years ago,

571
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,963
a Korean student was murdered
in the US in a similar fashion.

572
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,675
That case remains unsolved too,

573
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,761
but it caused quite a stir back then,
with people suspecting

574
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,514
the TTK might have returned.

575
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,101
The direct cause of death
was smothering.

576
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,354
Yes, it wasn't easy to solve.

577
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,607
But you know me.

578
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,694
I get a kick out of solving
these kinds of mysteries.

579
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,990
Whoever the culprit is,
they got rid of most of the evidence,

580
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,491
but check this out.

581
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,787
Are these fibers?

582
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,457
A microscopic examination of
the nasal mucous membrane revealed them.

583
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,752
This is some solid evidence

584
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,212
confirming the cause of death.

585
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,548
Any substances
found in the system?

586
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,592
Ketaflurane.
It's a general anesthetic.

587
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,013
It's not readily available to the public.

588
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,057
As a psychoactive drug,

589
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,059
it's even harder to obtain.

590
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,563
Did you analyze
the marks on the victim's face?

591
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,358
Your guess was right.

592
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,861
The marks appear to be from a cloth

593
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,612
used to cover the victim's face.

594
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,615
The culprit covered her face
with their left hand

595
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,368
and pressed down with the thumb,

596
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,037
leaving a mark.

597
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,997
Are you sure it was the left hand?

598
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,625
The mark clearly indicates
it was the left hand.

599
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,712
And the drug was injected
into the neck with a needle?

600
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,214
Yes, a needle mark was found
on her neck.

601
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,135
Thank you.

602
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,480
Ketaflurane.
It's a general anesthetic.

603
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,525
The marks appear to be from a cloth
used to cover the victim's face.

604
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,843
Ah!

605
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,848
Excuse me.

606
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,561
Was that the last bus?

607
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,022
Yes, it just left.

608
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,401
If I take a taxi to Seoul,

609
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,861
it'll cost a fortune.

610
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,623
Look.

611
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,501
Should we share a taxi?

612
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,254
It's expensive to take one
all the way to Seoul.

613
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,132
Ah...

614
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,886
You're not dangerous, are you?

615
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,976
Why aren't you answering me?

616
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,854
Are you dangerous?

617
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,815
Probably not.

618
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
Hey.

619
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,289
Since we're sharing a taxi
all the way to Seoul,

620
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
should we exchange names?

621
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,376
I'm Song Jaein.

622
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,961
And you are?

623
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,796
I'm Dongbang Yubin.

624
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,798
Dongbang?

625
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,095
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

626
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,014
It's just that your last name
is quite unique.

627
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,849
Well...

628
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,644
Are you coming
from the Blue Note concert too?

629
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,063
All the Seoul concerts were sold out,

630
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,065
but I didn't want to miss
the chance to see them.

631
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,776
The concert was amazing.

632
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,070
Too bad it ended so late though.

633
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,913
You were at the concert, right?

634
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,831
-No.
-No?

635
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,208
I attended a seminar.

636
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,586
A seminar.

637
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,840
-What was it about?
-Murder weapons and murder scenes...

638
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,096
So you study murders?

639
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,434
Sort of.

640
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,522
I see.

641
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,073
Excuse me.

642
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,826
We're here.

643
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,995
This is where I live.

644
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,290
How much is the fare?

645
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,127
It'll probably be around 50,000 won,

646
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,129
so I'll give you 25,000 won.

647
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,885
I lost my wallet, so...

648
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,845
I see.

649
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,933
You're a lifesaver. I hope we meet again.

650
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,749
One year later in the US

651
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,452
It's you, isn't it?

652
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,621
From the taxi.

653
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,498
What a coincidence.

654
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,836
I'm so happy to see you again.

655
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,546
This calls for another introduction.

656
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,591
Nice to meet you.

657
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,094
Likewise.

658
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,449
Move in with me.

659
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,035
I'd love that.

662
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,187
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

663
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,022
I love it.

664
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,985
Hold on. Do you know what this means?

665
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,613
Does it mean something?

666
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,241
Never mind. It's so pretty.

667
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,452
Thanks, Yubin.

668
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,121
Cheers.

669
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,782
Can you really not make it today?

670
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,951
Those tickets were hard to come by.

671
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,578
Sorry, but my seminar
suddenly got moved up.

672
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,248
It's the band I went to see
on the day we first met,

673
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,208
so I was looking forward
to seeing them with you.

674
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,419
I'll call you immediately
if I finish early.

675
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,963
Really?

676
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,632
You better, or you'll regret it later.

677
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,716
Okay.

678
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,054
-I'm off.
-Okay. See you later.

679
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,890
Bye.

681
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,819
Ketaflurane
was detected in the victim's body.

682
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,154
It's an anesthetic.

683
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,490
It seems that the assailant injected it

684
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,825
and suffocated her
by covering her nose and mouth.

685
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,203
And I think this belongs to you.

686
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,122
The victim was holding it in her hand
to the last.

687
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,421
The culprit covered her face
with his left hand.

688
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,842
But evidence shows he's right-handed.

689
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,556
He either pretended to be right-handed

690
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,185
or trained himself to be right-handed.

00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,552
Hold on. Do you know what this means?

695
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,595
Does it mean something?

696
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,110

was holding it in her hand to the last.
