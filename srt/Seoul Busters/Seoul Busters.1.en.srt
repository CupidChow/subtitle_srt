00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,534
-I did.
-Truly amazing work.

-[rustling]
-[water splashing]

182
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,204
-What do you have there?
-Nothing, sir.

183
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,706
-[captain] What's that noise?
-It's nothing.

184
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,165
-[captain] Come on, what is it?
-[detective] Nothing.

185
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,375
Let me see. What is it?

186
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,460
Earlier, the fisherman said
it was a big catch,

187
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,796
-and he caught it for me.
-[♪ comical music playing]

188
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,007
-We can make fish stew later--
-What are you doing?

189
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,758
Not catching the criminal
but catching what?

190
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,927
-A big catch?
-[Junghwan] Please calm down.

191
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,888
[chief] What the hell were you thinking?

192
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,349
[shouts in angry voice]
Pack your belongings and leave!

193
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,143
[detective sighs heavily]

194
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,936
This is serious.

195
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,647
[detective sighs heavily]

196
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,484
I can't believe
I had to talk with the Inspection Team.

197
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,946
In my 30 years in the force,
shit has really hit the fan this time.

198
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,700
Captain, I packed all your medicine.

199
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,414
It was not nice knowing you,
and let's never see each other again.

200
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,707
[captain groans annoyedly]

201
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,756
-[detective] He's gone.
-[Junghwan] Okay.

202
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,717
Let's go.

203
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,968
[chief shouts] Come in!

204
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,138
[Minseo whispers] You should go.

205
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,514
-Go.
-Stop it.

206
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,933
-What do you mean, "Stop it"?
-Go.

207
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,101
[knocking on door]

208
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,403
-Attention. Salute.
-[chief] Don't.

209
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,822
Don't even bother
with salutes or greetings.

210
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,866
Yes, sir.

211
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,036
[chuckles] Right, don't bother.

212
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,830
-Yes, sir.
-[chief] It just makes parting harder.

213
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,540
-[whispers] Be quiet.
-[chief groans]

214
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,876
[chief] I ought to fire all of you.
[inhales sharply]

215
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,379
But only the captain suffered.

216
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,048
Do you know where Captain Yoon
has been transferred to?

217
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,550
Somewhere in the South Sea…
Where was it again?

218
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,219
Somewhere far off the coast
of the South Sea…

They said on a clear day,
you can even see Japan.

223
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,853
That's quite far, isn't it?

224
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,107
You all should pack up too.

225
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,817
[in loud, annoyed voice] Why should we?

226
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,239
[in normal voice]
We haven't been told about any transfers.

227
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,951
The department is undergoing construction.

228
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,830
We've arranged a temporary office,
so you'll be there for a while.

229
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,332
But why should we move?

230
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,835
In terms of seniority,
we've been around way longer than Team 3!

231
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,961
You little…

232
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,881
They may not have the experience,

233
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,175
but they have a great track record.

234
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,885

you idiots!

236
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,141
Still, we have way more experience--

237
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,350
I swear I'll kill you.

238
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,853
A temporary office, you said?

239
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,020
Where exactly is it?

240
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,399
Go and pack your things.

241
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,359
-We'll do our best--
-Just don't.

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,737
-Don't. Just go.

This isn't right.

272
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,297
Are we children?
How can we work in a daycare center?

273
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,382
[groans] They said

274
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,717
they sold this place for cheap
after it closed down.

275
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,929
Are they leaving all these behind?

Did you win the lottery?

I mean, most of your peers
have already become captains.

[officer] This is a crime scene.
No photos.

531
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,205
[passerby 1] But I live just right there.

532
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,249
-[passerby 2] Where are you going?
-[passerby 3] Goodness…

533
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,378
-[Junghwan] My goodness. What a mess.
-[camera shutter clicking]

534
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,632
You should have checked the address.

535
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,635
I clearly heard it was Dorim-dong.

536
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,470
How can Daerim-dong be Dorim-dong?

537
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,764
Is this a "hod," not a head?

538
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,266
A "bron," not a brain?

539
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,811
I'm so embarrassed because of you,
I could just…

540
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,229
-[forensic officer] Detective Moo.
-[Joongryeok] Yes.

541
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,689
Did you find anything?

542
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,940
[forensic officer]
We'll look more into it,

543
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,900
but it looks like a suicide.

544
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,944
-We found a note.
-I see.

545
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,279
Should I hold onto it?

546
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,489
No, Detective Jang, you…

547
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,616
Yes, just say the word.

548
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,454
[Joongryeok] Junghwan, come here.

549
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,914
-Minseo, let's wrap up.
-[Minseo] Okay.

550
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,541
The estimated time of death

551
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,376
-is between 10 and 11 last night.
-Yes.

552
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,004
The father came here on the first train
due to a relative's wedding

553
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,297
and found his son dead.

554
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,424
Since the note was found…

555
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,884
No signs of forced entry or struggle,

556
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,469
and with the note found, case closed.

557
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,054
What's that you're holding?

558
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,600
It's nothing.
Someone had thrown these out.

559
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,728
They're in decent condition, aren't they?

560
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,313
Perfect for playing with Hana and Doona.

561
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,189
These are quite expensive to buy new.

562
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,026
-[yelps] What's with you?
-All right. Have fun with that.

563
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,194
Jeez.

564
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,988
[Joongryeok]
And have him write the report.

565
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,072
[soft chuckle]

566
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,908
What did I tell you?
I had a feeling it was suicide.

567
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,535
Just had a hunch.

568
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,580
With a hunch that bad,
you won't be able to stand up straight.

I'm so tired. Goodbye. Sorry, Dad.

575
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,192
A printed note alone isn't enough
to confirm the cause of death.

576
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,985
This is a basic part
of crime scene analysis.

577
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,196
It appears the basics are lacking here.

578
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,280
Wouldn't you agree?

579
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,823
-[crowd murmuring]
-He's right.

580
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,659
[passerby] They do lack the basics.

581
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,410
-Who are you?
-Quick to judge,

582
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,788
slow to act, and careless in speech.

583
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,082
No wonder Songwon Police's
Violent Crimes Team 2

584
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,167
is number one in the nation
in terms of performance.

585
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,585
The number one worst.

-Mister.

588
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,467
Itching for a beating, aren't you?

589
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,179
Come on. If he's itchy, he'll scratch it.

590
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,432
Consider yourself lucky
for not getting punched this time.

591
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,559
-Just back off, okay?
-Okay.

592
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,689
But I guess not having any habits
is better than having bad ones.

593

Hey, who do you think you are, huh?

Oh, chocolate?

614
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,193
Our brain accounts for
about 2% of our body weight

615
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,987
but consumes over 20% of our energy.

616
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,698
The most important thing
for brain function is the supply of sugar.

-[Yubin munching]
-[soft chuckle]

618
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,952
[Yubin] The suicide note being so short
also raises suspicions.

619
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,539
Lies tend to be brief and to the point
to avoid suspicion.

620
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,334
Indeed. You're absolutely correct.

621
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,502
Correct, my foot.

622
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,588
But we can't rule out a suicide
based on that alone.

623
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,756
I'm not ruling it out.

624
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,175
It's just too early
to definitively say it is.

625
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,468
Did you check out the printer?

626
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,345
[Minseo] We did, sir.

627
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,763
Could you bring me
some printer paper, please?

628
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,307
Yes, sir.

629
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,018
Why do we need the paper?

633
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,333
Just as I thought.

634
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,961
This seems like cheaper paper
that weighs less than 3 oz.

635
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,630
It's not like you have scales for hands.

636

Hey, they actually do feel
a bit different.

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,883
What does that matter?

638
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,802
[Joongryeok]
How does that change anything?

639
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,721
There are plenty of internet cafés nearby.
He could've easily gone to one.

640
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,641
Maybe he got super frustrated
while gaming,

641
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,977
felt depressed, and thought,
"I might as well end it all."

642
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,772
Then he saw a printer
and decided to print out a suicide note.

643
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,440
No, that's absolutely not a possibility.

644
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,317
Never rely on coincidence
at a crime scene.

645
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,027
That's a basic principle of investigation.

646
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,989
The possibility of forgery is high.

647

Looks like
he became captain through connections,

I really don't like him.

00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,761
This is why our team is in this situation.

701
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,056
How do you not know the person
at the forefront of Korean content?

702
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,850
The hot and happening Kang Minjae?

703
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,352
-I don't know him either.
-Mm…

704
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,188
It's understandable for you not to know,
as you were in the States.

705
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,482
-[sighs]
-What's the big deal about celebrities?

706
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,526
There are so many of them. [chuckles]

707
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,571
-What about the CCTV?
-The apartment is over 20 years old,

708
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,865
so there were no CCTVs.
We're securing footage from the area.

709
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,367
[exhales sharply]
It's definitely a suicide.

710
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,494
-What? What's this?
-[Junghwan exclaims]

711
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,079
It's a Triceratops.

712
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,040
This is quite popular among kids.

713
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,834
-What is this, Jurassic Park?
-It's a Styracosaurus.

714
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,919
Dongbang Yubin's Encyclopedia

715
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,087
-What?
-Pardon?

716
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,548
The horn shape is different
from that of a Triceratops.

717
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,343
Triceratops: 3 horns
Styracosaurus: 6 horns

718
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,012
A Triceratops is not a Styracosaurus!

719
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,389
[exclaims]

720
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,560
I'll go to the agency
where the victim worked.

721
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,353
It would be nice
if someone could go with me.

[♪ comical music playing]

723
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,527
[Yubin] Uh, well…

724

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

Ah. [nervous chuckle]

727
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,292
[Yubin] If it hollers,

728
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,377
-let it go.
-Gosh, my stomach.

729
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,587
[nervous chuckle]

730
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,881
-[Yubin] Eeny, meeny…
-Oh no, it's coming out.

731
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,007
[nervous chuckle]

732
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,176
-…miny…
-It's coming out.

733
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,804
-…moe--
-I'll go with you, sir.

734
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,933
Then Detective Seo, you're chosen.
Let's go.

735
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,017
Okay.

736
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,896

[Joongryeok] Minseo.

740

Good luck.

Romantic Lawyer

744
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,705
The CEO, Mr. Jang, is quite tall.

745
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,416
[Minseo] Looks about the same height
as Kang Minjae.

746
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,876
No, he isn't that tall.

747
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,504
Have you met him?

748
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,005
No.

749
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,925
Then how do you know his height?

750
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,885
By looking at you.

751
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,470
I'm sorry?

752
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,472
It's by triangulation.

753
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,183
You're probably
about five feet five inches.

754
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,309
Uh…

755
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,853
It's actually five feet six inches.

756
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,396
Okay, sure. [inhales sharply]

757
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,150
People usually hang pictures or paintings
at their own eye level.

758
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,361
And seeing how much you're looking up,

759
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,613
Mr. Jang is probably
about four inches taller than you.

760
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,115
So about five nine.

761
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,534
-It would be five ten.
-Okay, sure.

762
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,869
If they appear similar in the photo,

763
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,496
it could be because
Kang Minjae bent his knees a bit.

764
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,373
And you know that just by looking?

765
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,419
It's not exactly knowing.
Let's just say there's a high probability.

766
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,588
How does that…

767
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,717
[Minseo]
What else do you see probability-wise?

768
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,635

He recently traveled to Southeast Asia,

775
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,242
has poor vision
but prefers not to wear glasses,

776
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,078
and likes to work out,
so he exercises diligently.

777
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,664
You should read fortunes.

778
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,708
Seems like you'd make a lot of money.

779
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,752
I'm not good enough to read fortunes.

780
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,671
[Yubin] Even one's handwriting alone
can reveal a lot.

781
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,673
-It's the realm of the subconscious.

782
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,385
Goodness. Sorry for the long wait.

-And this is Detective Seo Minseo.

-Hello.
-Hello.

788
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,941
Please, have a seat.

789
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,069
[Taesik] I've been so busy these days.

790
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,364
I just got back
from the Philippines this morning.

791
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,490
[Yubin] I see.

792
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,075
[Taesik sighs] I haven't even eaten yet.

793
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,787
I've ordered some food,
so if it's not too much trouble…

794
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,580
-Please go ahead.
-[soft chuckle]

795
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,916
You're quite modest.

796
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,419
With you being a CEO,
I thought you'd only eat the finest foods.

797
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,339
No, I don't do that.
I eat like anyone else.

[♪ percussive music sting]

799
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,306
[Taesik] I heard about the incident.

800
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,600
So the person who committed suicide
was our employee.

801
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,310
-Not exactly.
-I'm sorry?

802
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,146
It hasn't been concluded as suicide yet.

803
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,607
Is that so?

804
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,567
I heard it was suicide.

805
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,195
Were you close with Mr. Lim Dongil
by any chance?

806
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,533
Do I have any reason to be close
with a junior road manager?

807
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,785
Just saw him around, you know?

808
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,579
[Minseo] Mr. Kang Minjae
is aware of the incident, right?

809
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,249
[sighs] Minjae is somewhat shocked.

810
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,960
After all, they'd been working
closely together for over a year.

811
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,670
[Yubin] Mm.

812
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,339
How was the relationship
between Mr. Kang Minjae and Lim Dongil?

813
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:25,845
Well, Minjae is quite nice
to everyone on his staff, and…

814
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,930
he really treats them well.

815
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,057
-[Yubin] Mm.
-[machine beeping]

816
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:37,106
I have weak lungs,
so I use a sensitive air purifier.

817
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,774
It's probably reacting
to the smell of the food.

818
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,151
I see.

819
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,654
It seems you also review scripts
when selecting projects?

820
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,491
[sighs] I have an excellent instinct.

821
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,329
If I find it interesting,
strangely, it tends to do well.

822
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,123
So I review all the scripts first.

823
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,500
It would be good to speak
with Mr. Kang Minjae as well.

824

he's all booked today.

Then, please contact us…

826
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,425
when Mr. Kang is available.

You know, like this. Why won't it do it?

00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,445
Everyone's just leaping over you
without a second thought.

872
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,488
Do they think you're a pushover or what?
[clicks tongue]

873
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,701
There's a saying, after all.
"Even a worm will turn when stepped on."

874
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,785
-You little…
-[exclaims]

875
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,079
-What?
-I really wanted to poke your eyes out.

876
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,747
[Joongryeok clicks tongue]

877
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,668
Wait a second.
Isn't that guy following Lim Dongil?

878
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,545
[Joongryeok] He's following him, right?

879
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,215
Seems like it, but it's too blurry.
I can't see his face properly.

880
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,301
[Tansik] Oh? That's Jeon Minsik.

881
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,679
How do you know this guy?

882
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,557
I got several complaints against him
for online shopping fraud.

883
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,058
You're on his case?

884
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,145
Not officially,
but I've been tracking him on my own.

885
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,605
Why on your own?

886
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,150
I personally got scammed by him
trying to buy a laptop.

887
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,694
[sighs]
I should never have wired him the money.

888
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,572
[exhales deeply] This guy seems fishy.

889
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,117
I've got a hunch again.

890
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,119
[♪ mysterious music sting]

[♪ light suspenseful music playing]

892
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,751
I'm not sure if I should say this.

893
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,295
But the day before the incident,

894
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,632
Dongil was seriously chewed out
by Kang Minjae.

895
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,720
You can't even drive or clean up properly.

896
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,388
What can you even do?

897
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,098
[Minjae] Just what, you punk?

898
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,352
If you're going to drive like that,
just drive by yourself.

899
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,646
I don't want to be
a casualty of your driving.

900
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,856
[shouts] Understand, you idiot?

901
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,901
-Answer me properly.
-Yes.

902
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,153
[Minjae] Louder.

903
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,655
[loudly] Yes, sir!

904
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,496
He's kind of a psycho,

905
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,665
especially toward his staff.

906
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,709
It got really bad after he became famous.

907
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,963
We even call him Dog Minjae
behind his back.

908
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,468
[groans] That bastard.

909
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,844
Are you talking about me?

910
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,557
No, I wasn't calling you a bastard.

911
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,893
Why would I call you a bastard?

912
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,311
You just called someone a bastard.

913
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,438
There's no one else in the car.
I'm the only one here.

914
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,566
It was just me talking to myself.

915
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,696
That Kang Minjae thinks
that just because he's a celebrity,

916
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,614
he can treat people however he wants?

917
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,283
That all counts as assault.

918
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,827
People like him deserve
to be treated the same way.

919
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,037
-Someone should grab him and--
-Detective Seo.

920
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,622
[Minseo] Yes?

921
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,084
Don't get worked up. Focus on the case.

922
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,629
And even if everything said
about Kang Minjae is true,

923
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,965
he is legally innocent,
although he may be morally wrong.

924
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:16,135
Captain, a person died.

925
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,303
And you say he's innocent?

926
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,556
If there's a connection between them,
it's our business.

927
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,100
If not, it's beyond our duty.

928
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,812
And Mr. Jang.
Why lie when it's so obvious?

929
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,188
He's the CEO.

930
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,524
He probably didn't want rumors
to spread about his actor.

931
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,651
It's a natural reaction.

932
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,736
[soft chuckle]

933
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,655
Captain, you know what?

934
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,115
What?

935
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,533
Never mind.

936
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,118
What is it?

937
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,370
It's just…

938
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,748
you seem a bit unlikable.
[nervous chuckle]

939
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,750

Mmm…

943
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,680
Hey, do you really have to eat it
with your hands like that?

944
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,099
Sushi is supposed to be eaten
with your hands.

945
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,519
Would you scoop up curry
with your hands too?

946
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,313
We're here, so we can eat it our way.

947
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,650
But why did the police
come to the company?

948
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,194
Don't worry about it.
It's just a routine investigation.

949
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,946
Routine, my foot.
I heard that detectives were here.

950
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,699
What if this crap
ends up splattering on me?

951
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,202
Why would any crap splatter on you?

952
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,662
I told you not to worry.

953
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,539
But shouldn't you be worrying, at least?

954
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,583
The police are showing up at the company.

955
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,336
And my name seems to be floating around
in the comments already!

956
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,880
If an article breaks linking me to this,

957
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
I'll be in some deep shit!

958
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,218
[shouts] Stop with all the poop talk
while we're eating!

959
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,388
I'm telling you,
there's nothing to worry about.

960
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,889
[worried groan]

961
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,642
You had nothing to do
with Lim Dongil's death, right?

962
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,227
Are you blaming me now?

963
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,646
No. Just since it came up…

964
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,023
Your favorite soy sauce shrimp.

965
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,525
-Open up.
-Not with your hands.

Hey! Did they go home first?

I don't know if they went home,
but they left together earlier.
