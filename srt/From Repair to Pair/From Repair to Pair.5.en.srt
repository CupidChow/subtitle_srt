♫The sandstorm has taken down time and tide for thousands of years♫

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,340
♫My concern in this life is to distinguish true from false♫

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,540
♫But love brought me to her♫

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,660
♫I play dumb and take only one glance under the roof♫

♫Every day and night lasts only a moment♫

[From Repair to Pair]
[This work is adapted from Mao Shangshu's work]

17
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,500
[Episode 5]

18
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,510
How could you say I have no awe for cultural relics repair?

19
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,360
How could you say I think myself smart?

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,230
I'm eager to learn cultural relics repair,

21
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,760
but you don't want to teach me.

22
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,630
You are arrogant and domineering.

23
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,550
You always prevent me

24
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,750
from learning cultural relics repair

25
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,000
by obscure truths.

26
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,910
You are the most annoying person.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,320
[Awakening Lone Wolf]
You ignore your study and repair posters.

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,830
I hope you can protect cultural relics by learning repair skills.

29
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,670
But you actually protect these useless things by them.

30
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,160
Why do you tear my repaired poster?

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,270
I'll tear it into pieces.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,600
What's wrong with you?

33
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,240
Are you alright?

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,960
Qiu Yuan.

35
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,750
What happened to her?

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,110
Shrimp.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,880
Mr. Qin.

38
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,190
Why are you here?

39
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,750
What are you doing?

40
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,080
What happened to her?

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,550
What's wrong with her?

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,750
It's enough. It's enough.

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,910
It's not good to drink too much.

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,390
So the repair master you've adored

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
is Qin Zhiyuan?

46
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,110
Yeah.

47
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,750
Excuse me.

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, I cooked egg noodles.

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,270
Let her have some.

50
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,800
I feel so happy.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,470
Thank you, Bai.

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,830
Oh, chopsticks, chopsticks.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,240
You have a good appetite, so I guess you may not feel a pain in your stomach.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,670
Well,

55
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,880
what's your relationship?

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,110
I forgot to introduce him.

57
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,440
He's Zuo Huairen,

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,390
a tall, rich and handsome man who just returned from his studies abroad.

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,440
He himself improves the average face score

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,960
of the friends around me.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,750
Hello, hello, hello.

62
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,750
He's my childhood friend.

63
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,080
You may call me Zuo or Huairen.

64
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,550
Is he your childhood friend?

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,110
In fact, I'm here

66
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,360
to meet you this time.

67
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,750
Meet me?

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,670
Yeah.

69
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,000
Here is the thing.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,550
I just

71
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,240
returned home.

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,600
I run the Institute of Antiquities,

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,160
so I've kept

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,550
looking for

75
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,880
experts of various fields.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,440
I've long heard

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,880
there's a man of great talent

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,830
in Mount Qingfeng.

79
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,510
Qiu Yuan learns to make paper here.

80
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,040
So I guess

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,350
she must learn from you.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,480
I came here without telling you in advance.

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,550
Please forgive me.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,230
It doesn't matter.

85
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,670
You should have told me

86
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,920
you're here for me.

87
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,230
After the network signals become stable,

88
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,480
could I have your WeChat?

89
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,440
Sure, sure.

90
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,720
Okay, okay.

91
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,440
I didn't plan my time.

92
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,920
So I came here late at night.

93
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,950
Sorry to cause you trouble.

94
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,830
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

95
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,600
When you leave,

96
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,640
I'll tell you the nearest way.

97
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,950
Okay.

98
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,950
Then you can save much time.

99
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,950
Okay.

100
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,640
I'll stay here to take care of Qiu Yuan tonight.

101
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,670
Sorry to bother you.

102
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,670
Won't you leave today?

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,110
Zuo Huairen is indeed a tall, rich and handsome man.

104
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,200
As Qiu Yuan's childhood friend,

105
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,720
he drove from afar and came to the deep mountain to meet her.

106
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,760
After coming here, he carried

107
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,480
the faint girl in his arms.

108
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,230
He fed her medicine

109
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,550
and decided to accompany her late at night.

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,110
His behaviors are so warm.

111
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,390
It's none of your business.

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,070
Yes, indeed.

113
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,320
But it's your business.

114
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,110
Why?

115
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,830
I always thought you're the leading role,

116
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,480
but now I think

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,160
you're a supporting role.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,950
They and I aren't

119
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,720
in the same play, okay?

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,760
No, you're all in a play.

121
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,390
Did you watch the play

122
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,760
"To the Sky Kingdom"?

123
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,830
Su Su used to love her master,

124
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,600
but she became

125
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,160
Ye Hua's wife finally.

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,720
Senior,

127
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,270
you must have watched many idol dramas.

128
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,720
First, I'm not her master.

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,350
Second, I don't care who she likes.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,160
So boring.

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,510
You really worry me a lot.

132
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,230
Mr. Qin.

133
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,480
Qiu Yuan and I grew up together.

134
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,830
She has helped me a lot.

135
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,830
If you really want to teach her,

136
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,880
I want to bear all her tuition.

137
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,110
Please keep it a secret from her.

138
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,160
You've got it wrong.

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,390
I don't accept any students,

140
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,600
nor do I make money by it.

141
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,790
I didn't mean that.

142
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,160
I just know

143
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,270
how eagerly Qiu Yuan wants to become a repairer.

144
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,950
I hope I can help her.

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,070
But since

146
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,880
you don't accept students,

147
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,880
why did you bring her here?

148
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,000
She followed me here.

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
She visited me

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,070
at Yuxin Studio every day.

151
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,550
She also brought me refreshing plum soup

152
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,670
and Flower Shaped Shortbread Cookies.

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,110
I was so touched

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,230
that I gave her this chance.

155
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,200
Since so,

156
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,670
I'll take her to leave here as soon as possible.

157
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry for the trouble and embarrassment

158
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,350
she has brought you.

159
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,600
You can't take her away.

160
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,640
Qiu Yuan is

161
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,040
my assistant this month.

162
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,830
Morning.

163
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,040
What are you talking about?

164
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,350
You must be still sleepy.

165
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,390
Sleep for a bit longer.

166
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,160
Sleep for a bit longer.

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,480
Go ahead.

168
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,720
Won't he drive me away?

169
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,670
Great.

170
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,110
Qiu Yuan,

171
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,510
I'll give you a surprise.

172
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,830
I find both you and Qiu Yuan

173
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,000
are good at waiting at the door.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,760
What do you mean by that?

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,030
Qin Zhiyuan took my sister away,

176
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,590
so I have to come here to look for her.

177
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,400
Take me to find my sister.

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Why should I do that?

179
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,910
Master, please accept my respect.

180
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,910
Sorry.

181
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,230
I already made it clear.

182
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,230
This is a live broadcast.

183
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,230
A girl was cheated into the deep mountain

184
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,520
by this man.

185
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,230
The girl's family member comes to look for her in Yuxin Studio,

186
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,760
but this man treats him

187
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
rudely.

188
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,910
Come on.

189
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,880
It's a pity that you aren't a live streamer.

190
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,640
Let's go.

191
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,670
Is your car here?

192
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,440
Put it in the cauldron.

193
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,350
Smile.

194
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,710
You are too pretentious.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
You don't know.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,150
Bai never laughs

197
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,110
at work.

198
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,960
A person who is working seriously

199
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,710
can reflect the casual beauty.

200
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,590
Bai is an expert.

201
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,230
Come on, stretch your leg in my direction.

202
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,080
Keep this posture.

203
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,550
Have a look.

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
Good job, Shrimp.

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,910
You also know a person's legs look long when being shot at a wide angle.

206
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,280
Sure.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,960
I'll leave soon.

208
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
Won't you go with me?

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,320
No, I won't.

210
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,320
I haven't learned to make paper yet.

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
If I leave now,

212
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
my previous efforts

213
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,790
will be wasted.

214
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,000
Qin Zhiyuan,

215
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,230
take a photo for Shrimp and me.

216
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,110
Quickly.

217
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,440
I'm still busy.

218
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,230
Childish.

219
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Bai.

220
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,520
Come on.

221
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,790
Take a photo for Shrimp and me.

222
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,320
Take a photo for you?

223
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,710
Yes.

224
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,350
Come on.

225
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,520
No problem. No problem.

226
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,030
Come.

227
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,960
Okay, slightly move to the left.

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,790
All right, all right, all right.

229
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,520
Come on.

230
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,880
Three, two.

231
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,030
Come on. One more.

232
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,590
Come. One more. One more.

233
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,230
Smile.

234
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,910
Three.

235
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

236
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,280
Come on.

237
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,030
Have a look. Have a look.

238
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,590
What do you think?

239
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,470
Yuan.

240
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,200
Good.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,030
Who is he?

242
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,280
My cousin.

243
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,470
Zuo,

244
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,400
why are you here?

245
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,080
Youqian.

246
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm here to visit Qiu Yuan.

247
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,440
I miss you. I miss you.

248
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,030
Oh,

249
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,440
he isn't her childhood friend.

250
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,880
Amazing. Amazing.

251
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,760
It looks good.

252
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,150
Why did you bring him here?

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
It's because of

254
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
the bold Qiu Yuan.

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
He forced me to bring him here.

256
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,640
The photo was taken at a wide angle.

257
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,550
Pay attention to the wording.

258
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,590
I didn't force you.

259
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,760
My sister has been here for several days.

260
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
I couldn't get in touch with her,

261
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,150
so I should come to see her.

262
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,150
Um.

263
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,790
If I had known Zuo is here,

264
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,150
I wouldn't have come.

265
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,440
Let me watch your photos.

266
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,670
Look at this one.

267
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,280
It looks good.

268
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Oh,

269
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,910
Zuo came here to see you,

270
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,150
showing his love for you.

271
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,710
Stop that.

272
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
You're dull in love.

273
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,030
If I were you,

274
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,840
I would fasten on him

275
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,200
every day.

276
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,550
Have you finished watching the photos?

277
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,280
Have you?

278
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,350
If you've finished it, you can leave.

279
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,230
He can drive you down the mountain.

280
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,910
Go with him.

281
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
Yes,

282
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm about to leave.

283
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,910
Why do you leave so quickly?

284
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,760
Well,

285
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
leave after having a meal.

286
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Oh,

287
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,320
it's of picturesque scenery here.

288
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,550
I'll show you around for a few days.

289
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,030
Don't look at me.

290
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,080
Well,

291
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,200
as long as you're here,

292
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,790
I'm relieved.

293
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,960
Take good care of Qiu Yuan.

294
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,280
Study carefully.

295
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm leaving.

296
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,230
-Will you leave? -I'll see you out.

297
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,840
I'll see you out. I'll see you out.

298
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,030
Go first. Go first.

299
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,640
Let's go.

300
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,400
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

301
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,880
Yuan,

302
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,000
you look smart in normal times,

303
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,520
but you're dull

304
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,910
at the critical moment.

305
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,030
Qin Zhiyuan neither listens to reason nor bows to force.

306
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,880
You can't win his love

307
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,150
even if you pull off the bark of all the trees in the mountain.

308
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,200
You should try some means.

309
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,230
Stop that.

310
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,080
I can't use a honey-trap.

311
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,350
I'm still a little girl.

312
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,350
You’re indeed too little to use the honey-trap.

313
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,080
Off with you.

314
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,670
Don't think me in that way.

315
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,230
As your cousin, I don't allow you to do that.

316
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,840
I mean you should steal his mind.

317
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,470
Drop that idea.

318
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,960
How do I do that?

319
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,670
Can I steal his mind in the middle of the night?

320
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,230
It sounds terrible.

321
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,400
To steal his mind,

322
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,470
you should

323
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,760
stay with him as long as possible.

324
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,400
The longer, the better.

325
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,200
Do whatever

326
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,840
he does.

327
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,790
With time going,

328
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,080
you can master all his skills.

329
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,550
I tried

330
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,350
this method.

331
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,470
Xixi didn't allow me to see her mom at all.

332
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,440
I grinned and bore it

333
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,400
and kept accompanying her every day.

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,910
I'll go to celebrate

335
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,640
the birthday of Xixi's mom

336
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,710
in a few days.

337
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,320
Really?

338
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,150
Your future mother-in-law

339
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,520
finally agrees to meet you?

340
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,440
You can't visit her empty-handed.

341
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,710
You should prepare some gifts.

342
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,440
I've prepared them.

343
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,400
Don't worry.

344
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,230
Well done.

345
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,470
Have you smelt something burned?

346
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,440
What happened?

347
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,320
My God.

348
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,280
Quickly.

349
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,590
Water.

350
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,520
Take this.

351
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,400
My God.

352
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,200
Why did you pour water at me?

353
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,200
Isn't there a fire?

354
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
Are, are you cooking?

355
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,590
Sure.

356
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,840
I guess

357
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,110
it must be the burnt ginger candy.

358
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,470
Ginger candy water.

359
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,000
Ginger candy water?

360
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Don't laugh.

361
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,710
What happened?

362
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,080
I also don't know.

363
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,840
Don't laugh. Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

364
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,230
Qin Zhiyuan boiled ginger candy water,

365
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,960
amusing Bai a lot.

366
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,230
No one asked you.

367
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,520
Shut up.

368
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,790
There's no fire.

369
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,200
Don't do this.

370
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,110
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

371
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,520
What do you want to do?

372
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,440
Here comes the soup.

373
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,200
Here comes the soup.

374
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
Come on.

375
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,080
It's rare for us to get together,

376
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,840
so I'll treat you to two bottles of liquor I've treasured.

377
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,960
Take some cups.

378
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,030
Come on.

379
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,030
People live in the wilderness,

380
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,000
while we have a party in the wilderness.

381
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,640
Why did you take my liquor?

382
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,760
Can you drink?

383
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,670
Yeah.

384
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,910
She can drink a little bit.

385
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,550
Who said that?

386
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,150
I didn't show you my real strength last time.

387
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,440
And she's a wimpy drinker.

388
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,960
After getting drunk, she regards everyone as her friend.

389
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,350
Luo Youqian, shut up.

390
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,790
So lively.

391
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,320
I think it's right for me to come back.

392
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,150
Shrimp.

393
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,640
Shrimp, you're back.

394
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,230
Let me help you.

395
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,710
Aren't you busy with your work?

396
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,840
I handled my work well.

397
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,400
You bought so much.

398
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,590
I brought some daily necessities

399
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,880
and snacks.

400
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,470
And I know

401
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,760
you have a hard time on the mountain.

402
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,440
Sit there.

403
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,030
I also prepared this for you.

404
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,790
What's it?

405
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,350
I'll go and fetch a cup for you.

406
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,030
Look.

407
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,200
You're so considerate.

408
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,280
I think of a very important question.

409
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,000
I have no enough rooms for all of you.

410
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,110
I expected it,

411
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,110
so I brought a tent.

412
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,400
Youqian and I can sleep in the tent.

413
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,080
Great.

414
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,550
I thought I would have to sleep

415
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,640
with Gao Shuo

416
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,550
in the firewood room tonight.

417
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,110
Get along with you.

418
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,030
I don't want to sleep with you.

419
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,670
Come on.

420
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,550
Everyone,

421
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,350
raise your cup.

422
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,590
Okay.

423
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,030
Come on.

424
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,590
Come on.

425
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,640
Raise your cup.

426
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,470
Open the two bottles of liquor.

427
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,080
Open them.

428
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,550
Come on.

429
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,200
So happy.

430
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,710
You can't drink now.

431
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,520
You two are so annoying.

432
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,400
Bai,

433
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,470
how much can he drink?

434
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,790
Well,

435
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,320
look at my gesture.

436
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,710
One liang?

437
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,590
He never got drunk.

438
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,590
Really?

439
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,590
I don't believe.

440
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
The liquor must be of low alcohol content.

441
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,230
It's so hot.

442
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,790
You were so rash.

443
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,400
Have some dishes. Have some dishes.

444
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,640
I've heard a lot about you.

445
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm flattered.

446
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,960
When I studied abroad,

447
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,470
I watched the repair videos about you.

448
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,000
You are also the person I want to see most after returning home.

449
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,640
As long as you work in my Institute of Antiquities,

450
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,430
you'll get a high pay

451
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,310
and the most advanced devices

452
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,070
and conditions.

453
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,920
Money talks.

454
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,470
I invited you to my institute sincerely last time,

455
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
but you refused me.

456
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,800
It has really

457
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,430
hurt me a lot.

458
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,640
I'll drink this cup to apologize to you.

459
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,560
No.

460
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,920
I'll drink with you.

461
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,880
But I have to say.

462
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,190
The employees in your institute

463
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,590
are unprofessional.

464
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,230
They know little about culture

465
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,400
and significance.

466
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
I'll drink a toast to you for them.

467
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,280
Mr. Qin,

468
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,310
I'd like to have a hearty talk with you.

469
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,640
Like me,

470
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Qiu Yuan's mom

471
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,190
also died early.

472
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,000
As a saying goes in China,

473
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,950
once a teacher,

474
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,800
always

475
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,280
a father.

476
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,000
So you'll be

477
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,520
her dutiful teacher,

478
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,280
right?

479
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,710
What are you looking for?

480
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,110
Wooden barrel, wooden barrel.

481
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,680
Wooden barrel.

482
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,400
I'll go with you.

483
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,710
Be careful.

484
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,560
It's very nice of you.

485
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,190
You know what?

486
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,640
Though you're annoying

487
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,280
most of the time

488
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,640
and you often cause me trouble,

489
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,040
I still like you.

490
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,350
You're drunk.

491
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,800
Promise me that

492
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,040
you'll be happy.

493
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,040
Youqian,

494
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,280
promise me.

495
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,400
Okay, I promise you that

496
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,160
I'll be happy.

497
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,070
Go to seek your happiness too.

498
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,880
Slowly.

499
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm not happy.

500
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,430
I'm a stupid girl,

501
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,000
so they all dislike me.

502
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,040
My dad abandoned me.

503
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,190
My teachers also disliked me.

504
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,310
After graduation, I tried to find a job,

505
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,190
but they all thought I don't have a good educational background.

506
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,280
Youqian, do you know?

507
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,950
Since I saw

508
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,430
Uncle Zuo repaired the "Swing Painting" as well as it had been,

509
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,190
I've been determined

510
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,680
to learn cultural relics repair.

511
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,680
However, after I grew up,

512
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,110
I've begun to understand

513
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,520
it's hard to have a dream,

514
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,280
let alone chasing my dream.

515
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,710
I've tried

516
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,470
so hard

517
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,760
to be an ordinary person.

518
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,470
I've made lots of efforts.

519
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,560
Be careful. Be careful.

520
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,590
And I've kept

521
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,000
begging Qin Zhiyuan

522
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,230
and worked hard to win his approval,

523
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,760
but he still doesn't want to teach me.

524
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,400
Well, you know

525
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,190
I must do badly,

526
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,070
so he dislikes me.

527
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,160
Don't care about his thought.

528
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,280
But do you know?

529
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,560
If the man I like dislikes me,

530
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,710
I'll be so sad.

531
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,230
Do you know?

532
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,880
Before I knew

533
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,710
Qin Zhiyuan is the repair master,

534
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,430
I had fantasized

535
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,230
many love stories between him and me.

536
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,310
Our stories

537
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,280
were beautiful and moving.

538
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,760
They were full of twists and turns

539
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,590
and soul-stirring.

540
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,470
Don't sit on the ground.

541
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,110
Our stories

542
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,000
were more impressive

543
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,560
and romantic

544
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,070
than those of Yang Guo

545
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,230
and Little Dragon Maiden,

546
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,880
a perfect couple.

547
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,470
We're known

548
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,590
as Zhao Mingcheng and Li Qingzhao (a couple)

549
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,680
in the repair world.

550
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,110
Do you love him so much?

551
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,040
It's a pity…

552
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,590
I can't control myself.

553
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,590
It's a pity…

554
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,560
Slowly.

555
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,280
It's a pity…

556
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,430
After meeting him,

557
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,800
I find it has changed.

558
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,830
Do you find he isn't as nice as you imagined?

559
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,710
No.

560
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,160
He is a nice man.

561
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,230
Let me tell you.

562
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,470
He's handsome and tall,

563
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,760
with long eyelashes

564
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,400
and a straight nose.

565
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,950
He always speaks gently.

566
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,830
He meets

567
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,000
all my fantasies of a great master.

568
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,350
But I can't do anything to help it.

569
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,190
He doesn't like me at all.

570
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,710
Um,

571
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,590
he doesn't like me

572
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,280
and even

573
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,160
cold-shoulders

574
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,160
and hates me.

575
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,520
He hates me, do you know?

576
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,640
When he looked at me,

577
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,440
I feel as if he had seen,

578
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,910
had seen

579
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,640
a disgusting moth.

580
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,830
Do you know?

581
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,400
He was very anxious

582
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,760
to drive the moth away.

583
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,480
I feel he just hoped to avoid me and tried to keep away from me.

584
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,480
Did I?

585
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm so sad.

586
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,840
So sad.

587
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,670
I'm sad.

588
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,800
I can't feel a sweet love.

589
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,680
I can't feel a sweet love.

590
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,040
And he even refuses

591
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,800
to accept me as his student.

592
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,680
Though,

593
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,040
though I laugh and joke

594
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,200
with you every day,

595
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,230
I feel sad deep in my heart.

596
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,640
As a girl,

597
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,950
I also have self-respect.

598
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,360
I may also feel embarrassed.

599
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,360
I must do so badly,

600
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,040
so he keeps cold-shouldering me.

601
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,990
I've really worked hard.

602
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,480
But why am I still disappointing?

603
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,110
Why?

604
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,030
I'm disappointing. So disappointing.

605
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,200
So disappointing.

606
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,160
Don't take Qin Zhiyuan's opinions to heart.

607
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,310
It's not you who are disappointing.

608
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,240
He also has weaknesses.

609
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,280
He's unreasonable.

610
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,030
I'm disappointing.

611
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,560
He's a nice man.

612
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,710
He…

613
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Do you know?

614
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,520
He boiled ginger candy water

615
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,030
for me today.

616
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,520
But he almost

617
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,070
caused a fire in the kitchen.

618
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,070
Big fool.

619
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,900
♫I have been walking on my dream♫

620
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,540
♫I look at the memory of departure♫

621
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,540
♫Depicting the joy and sorrow♫

622
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:47,500
♫I'll wait for you to speak what you haven't said♫

623
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,500
♫I stare at you hidden in the picture♫

624
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,820
♫As time goes on♫

625
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,020
♫Love is here♫

626
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,340
♫With you♫

627
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,360
Shrimp.

628
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,910
Morning.

629
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,720
Morning.

630
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,030
Are you taking exercise?

631
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,760
Yes.

632
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
Did you have a good sleep last night?

633
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,520
Yes.

634
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,640
What's wrong?

635
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,120
Nothing.

636
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,190
I'm just afraid you didn't have a good sleep.

637
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,190
I could even drift into sleep

638
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,390
when leaning on the desk during class.

639
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,150
So I have no reason

640
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,430
to sleep badly on bed now.

641
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,840
Yes.

642
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,520
Yuan, Shrimp, it's time for breakfast.

643
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,390
Coming.

644
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,550
Let's go.

645
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,960
Slowly.

646
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,240
I myself had a good life

647
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,190
on the mountain.

648
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,030
You all came here

649
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,790
successively.

650
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,840
The increase mode is like cell fission.

651
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,520
Listen.

652
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,360
You should supplement food in time.

653
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,000
Well.

654
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,790
Why not go to Yuxin Studio with me this time?

655
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,000
You can eat anything you like in my studio.

656
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,790
Eat the yolk.

657
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,270
It's good for your brain. You need it.

658
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,310
What do you mean?

659
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,760
You want to trick me into working for you?

660
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,070
I'm not as adorkable as him.

661
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,360
Am I adorkable?

662
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Oh, don't say "trick"

663
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,520
or "adorkable".

664
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,910
My uncle lives in seclusion in the bustling city.

665
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
If all of you, great masters,

666
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,070
live in seclusion in the mountains,

667
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,760
where can we learn

668
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,840
the amazing skills?

669
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,790
It's also not conducive to the inheritance of repair skills.

670
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,670
Few people

671
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,310
are as firm as Yuan.

672
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,600
She even came here, hoping Mr. Qin can accept her as his student.

673
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,190
Right?

674
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,600
Right, Mr. Qin?

675
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,910
Mr. Qin, do you come here to repair something

676
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,150
this time?

677
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,550
Yes, kind of right.

678
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,670
Yes.

679
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,240
He needs to repair pretty many cultural relics,

680
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,640
such as scripts, paintings and fans.

681
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,790
It's actually like cultivation in seclusion.

682
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,840
After he finishes repairing them,

683
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
he can leave here.

684
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,430
I've really worked hard

685
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,670
But why am I still disappointing?

686
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,070
He's a nice man.

687
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,840
He boiled ginger candy water for me today.

688
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,760
But he almost

689
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,310
caused a fire in the kitchen.

690
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,360
Do you have a cold?

691
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,000
The wind was a bit cold yesterday.

692
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,270
Mr. Qin, do you also have a cold?

693
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm fine.

694
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
I'm to blame. I'm to blame.

695
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,360
I thought to lie on your bed for a while

696
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,760
last night.

697
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
But I fell asleep accidentally.

698
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,390
You didn't sleep in his room.

699
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,960
You accompanied me

700
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,310
to go to the toilet yesterday.

701
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,790
Did I get blackout drunk?

702
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,390
I shouldn't have gone to the toilet under your protection.

703
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,240
If I fell into the pit, you couldn't save me.

704
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,360
Was I dead drunk?

705
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,910
How is the repair

706
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,150
of Linda's grapes-patterned fan going?

707
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,720
Living at ease in the mountain every day,

708
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,600
we don't look like professional repairers.

709
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,240
I don't have the mood

710
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,550
to repair it in such a noisy environment.

711
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,720
You're lagging in work.

712
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,150
Don't pass the buck.

713
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,880
Uncle,

714
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,600
you're hurting my self-esteem.

715
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,720
I slept on your bed for one night.

716
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,270
Do you want to change the sheets?

717
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,520
Yes.

718
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,310
I don't like the smell of others on my bed.

719
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,910
I…

720
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,670
I don't smell bad.

721
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,360
It must be the smell of Luo Youqian.

722
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,910
Wash the bedclothes.

723
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,150
I wash them?

724
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,670
Can I ask your apprentice Qiu Yuan wash them?

725
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,390
You used them.

726
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,880
Why do you ask her to wash them?

727
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,760
Isn't she your apprentice?

728
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,070
She's not my apprentice.

729
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,760
I also don't care about her.

730
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,000
It's fairness, do you know?

731
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,640
Okay. You're the fairest person.

732
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,430
I'll wait and see you eat your words.

733
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,000
What do you mean?

734
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,430
Don't you want to take her as your apprentice?

735
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,550
No, I don't.

736
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,720
Then hurry to let her go down the mountain.

737
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,000
Qiu Yuan is a stubborn girl.

738
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,480
If you ask her to work for you for more than one month

739
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,240
and don't take her as your apprentice,

740
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,270
she'll have your behavior

741
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,550
posted as a Weibo trending topic.

742
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,670
She'd like to stay here.

743
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,390
I can't change her idea.

744
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,760
I should think out another way.

745
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
My Yuxin Studio

746
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,520
can't bear her attacks.

747
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,310
Because of her disclosure,

748
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,600
I already lost more than 5,000 fans last time.

749
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,430
And President Zhang's nephew

750
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,120
wanted to take you

751
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,360
as his master last time,

752
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,910
but you drove him out.

753
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,910
What if he knows about Qiu Yuan's matter

754
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,520
and slanders us later?

755
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,790
Well,

756
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,960
don't worry about Qiu Yuan's matter.

757
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,190
I'll solve it.

758
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,960
Repair Linda's fan

759
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,360
carefully.

760
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,070
Okay?

761
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,720
Okay.

762
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,640
It's settled.

763
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,390
Qiu Yuan,

764
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,670
we discussed about your decision

765
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,720
of taking Qin Zhiyuan as your master.

766
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,030
Did I pass your examination?

767
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,840
Not exactly.

768
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,390
It's because Qin Zhiyuan doesn't

769
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,310
have the right to decide it alone.

770
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,120
If so,

771
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
can you decide it yourself?

772
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,190
Sure.

773
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,310
First,

774
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,600
if she becomes his apprentice,

775
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
she'll learn skills and work

776
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,550
in my Yuxin Studio.

777
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,120
As the boss of Yuxin Studio,

778
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,960
should I have the right to vote?

779
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,190
Second,

780
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,520
it's the first time for my uncle to accept an apprentice.

781
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,000
Should I test her seriously for him?

782
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,190
I should prevent him from being hurt

783
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,430
and learn a lesson from the failure of Bai.

784
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,390
Bai, what're the stories

785
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,760
behind?

786
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,600
Stop guessing blindly.

787
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,790
My two apprentices left for no reason.

788
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,150
You make light of your pain.

789
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,790
You must have spent painstaking efforts

790
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,310
in cultivating them.

791
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,960
You should spend time,

792
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,000
money and emotions

793
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,760
on them.

794
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,070
But they left directly.

795
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,070
Bai,

796
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,550
will you feel painful

797
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,360
and sad

798
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,480
every time you think of them?

799
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,550
Can you stop talking about me?

800
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,960
What do you actually mean?

801
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,120
Qiu Yuan isn't this kind of person.

802
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,190
Even so,

803
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,480
if she wants to work in my Yuxin Studio,

804
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,190
she must pass three tests.

805
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,600
I'll give you a test.

806
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,640
Can you bear my beating?

807
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,000
No.

808
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,520
Bai, calm down first.

809
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,390
Think about it.

810
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,790
We should test her.

811
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,030
If she's

812
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,960
a disqualified apprentice,

813
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,240
she'll waste our efforts.

814
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,070
And she may learn

815
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,240
cooking and  digger driving

816
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
with her time.

817
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,270
She doesn't need to waste her youth here.

818
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,030
Tell me what tests

819
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,550
I should take.

820
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,390
Wait a minute.

821
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,880
We should also talk about the conditions

822
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,760
before she takes your tests.

823
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,790
What conditions?

824
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,960
As you just said,

825
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,960
after my cousin Qiu Yuan passes your tests

826
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
and becomes Mr. Qin's apprentice,

827
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
she'll work in your Yuxin Studio,

828
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,240
right?

829
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,270
Yes.

830
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,390
Should we talk

831
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,600
about her salary?

832
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,390
And her social insurance and housing fund.

833
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,670
I'm afraid they dare not hire me.

834
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,190
She'll get paid.

835
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,360
Let's first see

836
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,910
whether she can pass the tests.

837
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,910
No.

838
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,150
You should first tell us how much the object is.

839
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,120
Then we can know

840
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,000
how much hard we'll try to bid for it.

841
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,720
We try hard to pass the tests

842
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,310
and enter your studio,

843
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,240
but you tell us

844
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,310
she can just earn 500 yuan a month.

845
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,190
It's not as much as the amount

846
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,120
of red envelopes

847
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,270
we grabbed in the WeChat groups.

848
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,670
I don't care about the salary.

849
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,960
If I learn true skills,

850
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,720
I can support myself easily.

851
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,520
What tests should I take?

852
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,390
Don't overdo it.

853
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,760
Don't worry. I have discretion.

854
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,240
Then let's wrap it up quickly.

855
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,960
5,000 yuan.

856
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,390
She enjoys social insurance and housing fund, right?

857
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,120
Cut the cackle!

858
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,480
I must follow the state regulations.

859
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,520
Okay.

860
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Please start your tests.

861
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,270
Okay.

862
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,150
Then let's begin.

863
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,720
First, test on her talent.

864
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,550
A qualified repairer

865
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,000
must be highly sensitive

866
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,790
to colors

867
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,670
and materials.

868
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,000
Shuo, where did you

869
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,080
get so many  lipsticks?

870
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,390
Girls left them in my car.

871
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,960
Off with you.

872
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
Don't talk nonsense. Don't be so curious.

873
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,870
Listen to my question.

874
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,240
Which lipstick do I wear?

875
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,520
Answer in three seconds.

876
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,350
Three, two, one.

877
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,240
The one on the far right.

878
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,320
Wait a minute. Let me check.

879
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,430
I forgot.

880
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,560
You girls can tell

881
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
the colors of lipsticks easily.

882
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,150
Let's move on to the next question.

883
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,480
This is Bai's unsalable rice paper.

884
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,960
Some of it was produced this year

885
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,590
and some two years ago.

886
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,240
Please differentiate them

887
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,670
within five minutes.

888
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,560
Timing starts.

889
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,430
Are you serious?

890
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,040
How can she differentiate them?

891
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,870
The RMB notes

892
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,040
are printed with the marks of different years.

893
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,390
Without doubt, she can't identify

894
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,280
the age of rice paper.

895
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,590
But the rice paper produced this year

896
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,110
and that two years ago

897
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,480
look different in texture.

898
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,800
People with unusual talent can tell.

899
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,280
Unusual talent?

900
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,630
You're talking about supernatural powers.

901
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,190
I have no time to argue with you.

902
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,630
I finished it.

903
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,320
Did she differentiate them correctly?

904
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,760
She has been sensitive to color since childhood.

905
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,800
It's a piece of cake for her.

906
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,280
Qiu Yuan, how did you make it?

907
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,150
They have different colors.

908
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,390
One looks yellow and the other blue.

909
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,110
Did she differentiate them correctly?

910
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,830
Yes.

911
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,560
So magical.

912
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,320
Zhiyuan, she is more talented than us.

913
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,190
A promising repairer.

914
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,040
Gao Shuo,

915
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,320
do you have other questions?

916
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,040
In addition to sensitivity

917
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,560
to colors and materials,

918
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,320
she must have excellent restoration ability.

919
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,240
Take them

920
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,590
and try to wash them clean.

921
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,480
They can't look yellow or be bleached.

922
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,760
Restore them.

923
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,910
Got it?

924
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,910
Is this a test question?

925
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,910
Uncle, I'm kidding.

926
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,830
Okay.

927
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,830
You passed this test.

928
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,350
Let's move on to the next question directly.

929
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,830
You know Bai uses the wingceltis bark

930
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,150
to make paper.

931
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,000
After we leave,

932
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
he'll stay alone in the mountain

933
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,720
and no one will help him.

934
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,040
Your second test is

935
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,670
to pull off all the wingceltis bark.

936
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,150
So many braches.

937
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,430
It must take Yuan much time to finish this test.

938
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,960
Gao Shuo, I should

939
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,280
thank you, right?

940
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,630
You're welcome.

941
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,960
Can I give her a hand?

942
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,280
It doesn't matter, Shrimp.

943
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,430
I can do it myself.

944
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,520
In fact, I don't know how to do it,

945
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,630
so I can't help you a lot.

946
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,830
At least I can keep you company.

947
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,080
Okay, suit yourselves.

948
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,800
I'll first go to display

949
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,240
my excellent restoration ability.

950
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,720
Anyhow, I don't know how to pull off its bark.

951
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,830
I'll go to ask him

952
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,320
about the next question.

953
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,830
Control Gao Shuo

954
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,240
and don't let him go his own way, okay?

955
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,390
Luo Youqian went to talk with him.

956
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,240
Don't worry.

957
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,110
Mr. Gao,

958
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,280
can you tell me your third test question in advance?

959
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,910
Or I'm afraid

960
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,720
I can't stand the excitement.

961
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,040
Don't worry.

962
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,720
Only Qiu Yuan

963
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,150
can enter the third test.

964
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,240
You can just wait and see outside.

965
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,720
Only she can enter it herself?

966
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,590
Well,

967
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,040
what's the test question?

968
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,150
Test whether she can stare blankly, right?

969
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,960
It's getting dark.

970
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,280
Why don't you take a rest?

971
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,080
I'll do it a bit longer,

972
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,280
so that you don't need to be pressed for time.

973
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,720
Let me do more.

974
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,910
Have a rest.

975
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,630
I'll do it.

976
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,430
I'm not that delicate, okay?

977
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
It's nothing.

978
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,150
Why are you laughing?

979
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
I remember

980
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,350
I helped you when we were young.

981
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,000
But it's you who help me now.

982
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:55,960
Yes.

983
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,110
Yes.

984
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,960
When we were young,

985
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,190
you were the head girl of the South Street.

986
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,590
Your influence was exceptional.

987
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,280
You were short at that time.

988
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,800
I was only half a head shorter than you.

989
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,800
No.

990
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,670
Yes.

991
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,480
You just reach my armpits now.

992
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,240
Stop that.

993
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,870
I'm not that short, okay?

994
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,720
Don't you believe? You just reach my armpits.

995
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,350
Let's compare.

996
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,520
Stand up.

997
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
Stop that now. I haven't finished it.

998
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,000
Compare.

999
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,560
Look, I'm higher than you.

1000
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,760
You just reach my armpits.

1001
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,870
Okay, you're right.

1002
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,590
Okay?

1003
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,190
Slowly.

1004
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,910
Senior,

1005
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,150
they, both young and unmarried, share their joys and sorrows.

1006
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,520
Gao Shuo creates a chance

1007
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
for them to stay together.

1008
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,430
Senior,

1009
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,040
I think you should

1010
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,830
date a girl.

1011
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,390
How to say?

1012
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,830
You're such a busybody.

1013
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,830
You often put your fingers into others' pies.

1014
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,320
Why don't we do it tomorrow?

1015
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,000
The last pull.

1016
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,480
Okay.

1017
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,150
They stood up.

1018
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,670
I'll go on with it tomorrow morning.

1019
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,720
It's up to you.

1020
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,430
Let's go.

1021
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,480
They left.

1022
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,590
They left together.

1023
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,960
Senior, go to bed early.

1024
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,910
Oh, I can't bear it.

1025
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,670
Go now. Go.

1026
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,590
Thanks to Shrimp's  provision,

1027
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,000
I become refreshing.

1028
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,110
What can I do?

1029
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,830
After only a day of work, my hands hurt.

1030
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,800
How can I continue it tomorrow?

1031
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,280
Look at

1032
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,590
my delicate hands.

1033
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,830
Theoretically,

1034
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,480
I should a coddled girl.

1035
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,110
How can I do so hard work?

1036
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,430
Yuan, come on. Yuan.

1037
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,110
Yuan.

1038
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,390
Youqian.

1039
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,320
Let me sit down.

1040
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,720
What's wrong with you?

1041
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,760
Where did you go?

1042
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,520
Why is your leg bleeding?

1043
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,910
What happened?

1044
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,870
What's the matter?

1045
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
What's wrong with your face?

1046
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,150
Ask your cousin about it.

1047
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,900
Two-minute DIY rice paper-making

1048
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,860
of "From Repair to Pair"

1049
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,020
First, we need to prepare materials,

1050
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,860
[Pulp]
such as high speed blender,

1051
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,140
pulp,

1052
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,500
plant paper-making glue,

1053
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,340
[Water]
filter screen

1054
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,140
[Water]
and water.

1055
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,740
Then we need to put 3L of water

1056
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,140
[Water]
into the high speed blender.

1057
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,620
[Pulp]
Add the prepared pulp into it,

1058
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,180
adjust the blender to the juice mode,

1059
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,060
[Juice mode]
blend them for 3-5 minutes

1060
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,100
and let the pulp and water blend evenly

1061
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,740
until no obvious pulp particles can be seen.

1062
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,300
We can add plant paper-making glue.

1063
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,980
It should be noted that

1064
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,940
the ratio of pulp to paper-making glue is 2:1.

1065
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,300
[Pulp  Paper-making glue]
Then go on blending them in the blender.

1066
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,860
After that,

1067
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,900
we can add some flowers and leaves

1068
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,180
to decorate our paper.

1069
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,940
Then

1070
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,420
we can pour the blended liquid over the filter screen.

1071
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,540
After the paper is completely shaped,

1072
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,660
[Drying and shape-setting under the sun]
take it out of the filter screen.

1073
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,460
So a piece of handmade paper

1074
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,060
is successfully completed.

1075
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:26,340
