♫I take up a brush to paint its prime of life♫

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,260
♫The sandstorm has taken down time and tide for thousands of years♫

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,260
♫My concern in this life is to distinguish true from false♫

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,780
♫But love brought me to her♫

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,260
♫I play dumb and take only one glance under the roof♫

6
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,340
♫Every day and night lasts only a moment♫

7
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:12,180
♫I stand with her side by side and say nothing, forgetting a flashy life♫

8
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,860
♫I can't extricate myself from my worries♫

9
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,540
♫I take the brush to leave its elegance♫

10

♫Having the dirt washed away, the vicissitudes of life become pure♫

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,740
♫Let me put aside my worries♫

12
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,980
♫I draw a picture of her stroke by stroke♫

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,060
♫I take the brush to leave prosperous days♫

14
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,700
♫How can I say sweet words after having the dirt washed away♫

15
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,140
♫I paint with a bamboo hairpin on paper to set off her cheeks♫

[Episode 3]

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,550
Go, go.

19
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,110
Qin Zhiyuan is inside.

20
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,910
Later...

21
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,470
Man,

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
I think you're good at martial arts.

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,110
Have you ever practiced it?

24
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,270
Yeah.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,550
I learned from Xiaojin.

26
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,670
Then Xiaojin

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,080
is great.

28
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,240
Yeah, he is great.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,360
He is very...

30
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,390
Is there anyone over there?

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Hurry up.

32
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,750
Yuan.

33
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,030
How's my performance just now?

34
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,750
Perfect.

35
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,600
Must be super.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,030
Okay.

37
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,880
Let's go.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,440
Qin Zhiyuan is inside?

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,630
No.

40
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,320
What are you doing?

41
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
We can't save him.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,470
Who said I wanted to save him?

43
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:11,960
Go.

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Stop.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,960
Stop.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,440
Qin Zhiyuan.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,110
Save me.

48
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,960
What's up?

49
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,000
What's the plan now?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,670
No plan.

51
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,750
Stop.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,630
OMG.

53
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,240
Are you all right?

54
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,440
They are pumping iron every day.

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,520
Can I still stay sound?

56
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,670
Hurry up.

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,360
Leave me alone.

58
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,800
I can't fight if you are too close to me.

59
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,390
In such a situation,

60
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,720
I have no place to hide.

61
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,350
Qin Zhiyuan.

62
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,350
You rotten apple!

63
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,350
How dare you push me!

64
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,160
Luo Youqian.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,390
Luo Youqian.

66
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,640
Qin Zhiyuan.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Are you all right?

68
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,920
Are you the legendary stupid teammate?

69
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,270
How come?

70
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,790
I didn't know who is chasing me.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
If you were not stupid,

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,880
you wouldn't be lured here.

73
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,350
Not my fault.

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,880
If it wasn't for you,

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,440
I wouldn't be noticed by them.

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,070
If it wasn't for you,

77
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,760
I wouldn't hide under the car and twist my foot.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,390
If it wasn't for you,

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,390
my brother wouldn't be missing now.

80
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,000
It's your fault.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,830
Your fault.

82
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,320
That's how you treat your savior?

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Savior?

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,880
You hear it?

85
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,200
I don't need your help.

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,000
Quick.

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,830
Catch them all.

88
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,390
Wait. Wait.

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,480
Idiot.

90
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,790
Do you want a ride?

91
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,600
Nope.

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,640
We have a car.

93
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,600
Our cell phone is out of power.

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,550
We can't get a taxi.

95
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,110
Let's go.

96
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,640
Go.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
You refused just now.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,720
Mr. Qin.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,790
I didn't expect that

100
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,640
you are the legendary repair master.

101
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,880
Legendary?

102
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
Yuan told me.

103
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,320
She is his die-hard fan.

104
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
She watched all his programs.

105
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,670
What are you doing?

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,720
It's dirty.

107
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm sorry. Sorry.

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,070
Yuan has been like this since childhood.

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,510
She's grumpy,

111
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,040
but with normal IQ.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,110
But sometimes

113
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,720
she has brain fart.

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,000
Brain fart.

115
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,790
Yuan is

116
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,920
the most obsessed by the repairers of Yuxin Studio,

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,950
especially you.

118
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,670
Her dream is to be a repairer.

119
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,320
I think he has nothing to do with my dream.

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,270
Keep quiet.

121
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,040
Days ago, she even paid

122
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
that cottage training class.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,160
The most funny is that there is someone

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,070
who imitated you there.

125
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
At a glance, she told

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,390
that man is a liar.

127
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,110
She can tell he's a liar at a glance?

128
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,720
Just a fan.

129
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,070
Fan.

130
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Actually, I think

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,070
Yuan is still very talented.

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,230
Luo Youqian.

133
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,000
If you say one more word,

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,600
you'll lose your head.

135
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,040
You have good carving skills.

136
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,160
Right?

137
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,160
You know what?

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,350
She is the 18th generation descendant

139
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,510
of Qiu Rong Studio's New Year wood-block prints.

140
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,920
It's a pity to engrave offset plates.

141
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,440
You should engrave the wood.

142
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,830
I do know the merits of woodprint.

143
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,440
It has too high cost

144
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,760
but poor timeliness.

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,110
Marketing is more of a problem.

146
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,480
Mr. Qin, if you like woodprints,

147
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
we can customize one for you.

148
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,110
Friendship price.

149
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,640
Come to Yuxin Studio.

150
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,600
Never mind the marketing cost.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,000
You can carve woodprints as you like.

152
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,230
Woodprint engraving is my craft.

153
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,230
I can carve it anywhere.

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,640
Unless you take her as an apprentice

155
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
and teach her to repair.

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,000
He never accepts apprentices.

157
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,470
She is grumpy

158
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,080
with intermittent brain fart,

159
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,590
she is not suitable for repair.

160
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,760
Isn't that what I said just now?

161
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,670
No.

162
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,470
I, I

163
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,550
I just said it casually.

164
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,030
Besides,

165
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,080
even if she has a brain fart,

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
she can change it.

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,590
Details determine the result.

168
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
Her worktable tools,

169
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,400
including the finished products, are in a mess.

170
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,110
They're even covered with ashes.

171
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,520
This is obviously normal.

172
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,110
And her work clothes

173
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,640
have sleeves covered with paint.

174
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,790
If a girl doesn't even care about this,

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,880
she lacks the sense of awe.

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,670
Moreover, what I want to say is...

177
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,790
Stop.

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,590
I'm not your disciple.

179
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,080
How can you teach me a lesson?

180
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,110
What are you doing?

181
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,230
Well.

182
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,840
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
What are you doing?

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,150
What are you doing?

185
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,000
No.

186
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,200
They have gone.

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
You. You.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,760
Did you get

189
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,110
your brain hurt?

190
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,110
Do not persuade me.

191
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,150
Don't follow me.

192
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,440
I won't persuade you.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,280
Well.

194
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,110
I think what Qin Zhiyuan said

195
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,030
is really too much

196
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,550
How can he criticize you like this?

197
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,470
I'm feeling sorry for you.

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,590
Just now, he almost

199
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,230
agreed to teach you to repair.

200
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,760
But you messed up again.

201
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,550
I do want to learn how to repair.

202
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,470
But he doesn't accept apprentices.

203
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,230
And he is quite weird.

204
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,000
He bought paintings

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,960
and burned them.

206
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,790
And today, he even caused us

207
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,350
to be almost caught.

208
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,280
What the hell?

209
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,440
Yuan.

210
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
As for this matter,

211
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,350
actually, I have a different opinion.

212
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,150
He burned paintings to draw snakes out of their holes.

213
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,590
Although he is weird,

214
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,790
it worked.

215
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
Besides, he

216
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,640
personally came to save us today.

217
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,790
He's righteous.

218
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,760
I admit that

219
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,150
his repair skill is really good.

220
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,030
But he also

221
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,670
has a sharp tongue.

222
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,150
Qin,

223
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,670
I have a question.

224
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,350
Both of us went to fight.

225
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,230
Why does your face

226
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,790
have no even a bruise?

227
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,440
I blocked them with my hands.

228
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,200
You're smart.

229
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,110
What?

230
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,110
Your hands are worth more than your face!

231
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,790
Let me check them.

232
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,550
Come here.

233
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,760
Apply some medicine.

234
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,520
It's this painting again.

235
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,150
In my memory that I haven't lost,

236
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,280
you have been staring at it blankly

237
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,000
for more than ten times.

238
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,150
It's not so shabby.

239
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Is it difficult to repair?

240
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,910
This painting has its own story.

241
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,000
I can't rush to repair it until I understand it.

242
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,320
Yeah, story.

243
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,080
The painting "Ladies Playing with Butterflies"

244
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,150
at the auction

245
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,550
must have a story, right?

246
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,790
Anyhow,

247
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,080
I just feel these two paintings

248
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,880
have something similar.

249
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,030
But I can't tell

250
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,080
the specific connections.

251
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,280
Go on.

252
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,670
Look.

253
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,880
Look, it's getting late.

254
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,640
I've asked my teammates to play games.

255
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,670
Details determine the result.

256
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,000
Her worktable tools,

257
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,590
including the finished products, are in a mess.

258
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,230
They're even covered with ashes.

259
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,590
This is obviously normal.

260
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,230
And her work clothes

261
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,760
have sleeves covered with paint.

262
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,000
If a girl doesn't even care about this,

263
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,150
she lacks the sense of awe.

264
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,000
How is it?

265
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,110
Is it broken?

266
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
Your clothes are fine.

267
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,550
But mine...

268
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,790
Don't worry.

269
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,710
After I make money,

270
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,200
I would buy you all kinds of luxury brands.

271
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,150
Anyway, you just say it casually.

272
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,030
All right.

273
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,200
You've washed your clothes.

274
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,280
Just get away.

275
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,840
I want to be alone.

276
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,640
No, no, no.

277
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
I can't.

278
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,670
I can't go back tonight.

279
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,790
Why so?

280
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,590
Think about it.

281
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,280
Ms. Qian Junfang's

282
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,840
beloved eldest son

283
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,030
was fine when he left home in the morning.

284
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,000
Look, I'm all hurt now.

285
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,910
My mom is not young.

286
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,200
Right?

287
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,790
What if she has something wrong due to worry

288
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,080
and is hospitalized?

289
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,110
You just broke your skin.

290
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,030
Do I have to send you for the first aid?

291
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
What first aid?

292
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,790
You are hurt?

293
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,710
What's the matter?

294
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,840
Come on.

295
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,670
Come to sit down.

296
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,710
Sit down and let me have a look.

297
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,790
What's the matter?

298
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,670
What's going on?

299
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,320
A little injury.

300
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,960
You haven't seen those bad guys today.

301
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,790
They are as strong

302
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,840
as Tyson.

303
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,550
I spent two hours with them.

304
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,030
You hang yourself there for two hours.

305
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,880
Yuan.

306
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
Are you all right?

307
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,230
What's wrong with you?

308
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,550
I seem to have twisted my neck.

309
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,150
Then I'll massage it for you.

310
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,590
Come here.

311
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,400
I'll give you a massage.

312
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,470
Here?

313
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,440
Yeah.

314
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,150
Right here.

315
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,520
Are you feeling better?

316
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,350
It is really comfortable.

317
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,760
It seems that my head is still dizzy.

318
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,230
Dizzy?

319
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,790
Then, then,

320
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,670
then lie down.

321
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,710
Then I'll lie down.

322
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,230
Xixi.

323
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,790
It is really comfortable.

324
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Does your face hurt?

325
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
It hurts a little.

326
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,640
This shop has delicious food.

327
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,840
I like it.

328
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,520
Let's go next time.

329
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:17,910
Okay.

330
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,470
Try something else in it.

331
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,150
Do you like it?

332
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,320
Help yourself to whatever you want.

333
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,760
It's my treat.

334
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,710
Repair tortures me a thousand times,

335
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,150
but I take it as my first love.

336
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,200
This is too old.

337
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,880
Uncle.

338
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,710
Are you going to draw a new one?

339
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,230
I'm going to

340
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,520
fix this old one first.

341
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,960
Before that,

342
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,230
I need to make a draft first.

343
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,710
Her skirt has

344
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,550
beautiful colors.

345
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,110
It's like the color of morning dew.

346
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,910
The color of dew?

347
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,470
Wrong.

348
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,910
This is also wrong.

349
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,790
Yes.

350
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,200
It's the color of the dew.

351
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,030
Then I leave the remaining colors of our draft

352
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
to you, okay?

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,550
Okay.

354
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,710
Auntie, I'm full.

355
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,640
There's another bowl.

356
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,960
No need.

357
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,110
This bowl is for you.

358
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,400
After having it, close the stall and go back.

359
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,110
Girl, I haven't changed your money.

360
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,640
Keep the change.

361
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,670
Do you know the repairer at Yuxin Studio?

362
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,150
The cute guy in the video.

363
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,350
The cute guy?

364
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,910
You know him?

365
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,590
Yes, and no.

366
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,520
I've never met him in person,

367
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,200
but I've watched

368
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,790
every sing one of his videos.

369
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Follow me.

370
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,440
This is a painting of the Ming Dynasty.

371
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,350
You just throw it into the water?

372
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,280
Look carefully, everyone.

373
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,760
How come it melts away?

374
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,160
It's melted away.

375
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a fake.

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Fake?

377
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,520
Even with high-tech means,

378
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,000
we can't ignore the traditional discrimination.

379
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,190
Modern scientific appraisal means

380
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,230
are also mastered by the counterfeiters.

381
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,830
Use one cotton swab

382
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,560
to wipe it casually

383
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,350
to get the ink or paint on ancient calligraphy and painting,

384
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,430
and it can be accurately judged

385
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,640
through C14.

386
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,110
This statement

387
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,590
is just an anecdote.

388
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
At critical moment,

389
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,760
we have to rely on traditional methods to eliminate the false and retain the true.

390
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,590
Yes.

391
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,590
That's all for today.

392
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,800
Let's go to dinner.

393
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,070
Okay.

394
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,470
Let's go.

395
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,190
Director Qi.

396
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,560
It really broadens my eyes today.

397
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,760
It's nothing

398
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,430
but a little way to get rid of forgery.

399
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,040
With you here,

400
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,110
I'm relieved.

401
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,470
Otherwise,

402
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,680
only these advanced equipment

403
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,560
can't make it.

404
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,800
Zuo.

405
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,590
I know clearly

406
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,830
your contribution to the institute.

407
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,040
But...

408
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,280
Director Qi, just get to the point if you like.

409
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,710
Currently, the institute

410
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,800
has identified a large number of cultural relics returned overseas.

411
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,230
But among these cultural relics,

412
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,520
more are fake and less real.

413
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,070
So I think,

414
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,190
instead of buying back fake cultural relics from abroad,

415
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,560
it's better to set up a repair department

416
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,350
to rescue those real cultural relics in China.

417
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,000
Linda mentioned

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,230
this before.

419
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,470
Personally, I am very supportive of it.

420
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,310
How about this?

421
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,190
I will do my best

422
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,040
to support you in setting up the repair department.

423
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,920
But the identification

424
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,590
of cultural relics returned abroad

425
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,590
is our main business after all.

426
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,070
We rely on you.

427
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,710
You can rest assured.

428
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,830
No problem.

429
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,800
Yuan, stop crying.

430
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,400
Yuan.

431
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,560
What's wrong?

432
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,350
Dad.

433
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,710
Someone robbed me of sugar.

434
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,040
Yuan, help me.

435
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,950
But her painting is broken.

436
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,680
Yuan

437
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,920
I can fix

438
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,920
this painting.

439
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,950
Uncle Zuo,

440
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,000
can this painting really be repaired?

441
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
Of course.

442
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,190
My father is a very,

443
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,590
very great repairer.

444
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,190
Look.

445
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
After it's repaired,

446
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,760
gently touch it.

447
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,400
Come on.

448
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,000
The purpose of doing this...

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,040
It was the first time I saw a miracle.

450
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,880
The ancient beauty appeared on paper again.

451
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,760
She had elegant skirt, graceful posture,

452
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,520
and smiling eyebrows.

453
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,190
At that moment,

454
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,230
I was suddenly hit by something.

455
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,880
It is fixed.

456
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,520
I felt excited.

457
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,680
I felt that cultural relics repair...

458
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,400
Yuan

459
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,230
...would be my lifelong work.

460
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,400
If you want,

461
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,710
you will be a

462
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,160
a repairer greater than me.

463
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,830
Thank you, Uncle Zuo.

464
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,400
We'll see you tomorrow.

465
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,590
You're back, Yuan.

466
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,680
Yuan, you are at home.

467
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
We bought cold pot strings.

468
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
I'll get on the plates.

469
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,520
By the way,

470
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,760
this is for you.

471
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,430
What does it mean?

472
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,640
The rent

473
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
and your salary I owe you.

474
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,590
I've told my dad

475
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,560
and the landlord,

476
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,760
our shop is closed.

477
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,350
Closed?

478
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,950
Where did you get the money?

479
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,830
Take it easy.

480
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,680
As a business genius,

481
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,470
I do waste my talent

482
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,950
in running such a shabby shop.

483
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,040
I just found a chance

484
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
and sold all the goods we had stored.

485
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,560
Yuan,

486
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,400
do you know how great Luo Youqian is?

487
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,230
We met a tour group.

488
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,230
Then he gave an introduction in Chinese and English.

489
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,520
According to my observation,

490
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,230
both Chinese people

491
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,430
and foreigners didn't understand.

492
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,590
But he sold them all.

493
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,520
Is it amazing?

494
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,070
Great, Luo Youqian.

495
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,520
Compared with body language,

496
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,350
words are quite weaker.

497
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,310
Like this painting.

498
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,430
Where did you get this painting?

499
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,110
I haven't seen it.

500
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,470
A long time ago.

501
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,190
A long time ago?

502
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,640
This's an old painting.

503
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,950
Yuan.

504
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,310
I know a painting seller.

505
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,520
I can help you sell it.

506
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,280
No.

507
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,920
It's worthless.

508
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,400
Yuan.

509
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,230
It's worthless.

510
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,760
It's hot.

511
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,110
Hello!

512
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,640
Here is your coffee.

513
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,950
Here.

514
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,280
Waiter. Waiter.

515
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,920
Come on.

516
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Take a seat.

517
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,760
Long time no see.

518
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,430
Long time no see.

519
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,000
It's a good place here.

520
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,280
It's a little expensive?

521
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,950
That's OK.

522
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,920
It's my treat.

523
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,640
What do you want to drink?

524
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,590
This cup of coffee is more than 80 yuan?

525
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,160
Come on.

526
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,800
My treat.

527
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,040
A cup of Americano.

528
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,640
Okay.

529
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,190
Thank you.

530
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,760
The last time you showed me a painting.

531
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Where did you get it?

532
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,110
It belongs to one friend of mine.

533
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,590
How is it?

534
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,430
Is it valuable?

535
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,190
Is it valuable?

536
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,590
Look.

537
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,470
These two paintings

538
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,920
are like a series.

539
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,800
What series?

540
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,190
Poverty completely limits your imagination.

541
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,520
It's quite similar.

542
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,800
I just make a simple judgment.

543
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,230
These two paintings should be a pair.

544
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
This painting "Ladies Playing with Butterflies"

545
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,640
is a dark horse at the auction.

546
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
It's auctioned at five million yuan.

547
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,590
Five...

548
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,280
How much?

549
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,590
Five million.

550
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,040
Five million!

551
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,560
Calm down.

552
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:46,920
Calm down,

553
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,950
Sit down.

554
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,520
You mean,

555
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,280
my friend's painting

556
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,040
could be worth five million?

557
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,310
If the appearance is OK,

558
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,830
it should be worth that price.

559
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,800
Sir,

560
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,560
here is your coffee.

561
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,640
Waiter.

562
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,760
One more cup, please.

563
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,710
You drink so much coffee.

564
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,710
Can you sleep?

565
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,830
Five million.

566
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,400
I can't sleep anyway.

567
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,160
Thanks to you.

568
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:32,950
Otherwise

569
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,400
I don't even know the way to the cemetery

570
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,470
is changed.

571
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,110
Yuan.

572
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,590
You know what?

573
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,830
You'll be financially free soon.

574
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,110
Financial freedom?

575
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,040
Let me realize the freedom of the vegetable market first.

576
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,710
Be confident.

577
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,950
Come to Qingquan Hotel's Chinese Restaurant.

578
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,230
I've found a buyer for your painting.

579
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,470
Buyer?

580
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,070
What buyer?

581
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,000
Luo Youqian, don't move.

582
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,230
You can't sell it.

583
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,190
You wait for me there.

584
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,280
What's up?

585
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,110
Luo Youqian.

586
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,280
He started to make a trouble.

587
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,640
Shrimp.

588
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
Drop me

589
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,950
at the bus station ahead.

590
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,190
I'll turn around and take you back.

591
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,640
It'll be faster.

592
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,190
No.

593
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
We sweep the tomb in the morning.

594
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,470
You'll be late if you send me back.

595
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,040
There are not so many rules.

596
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,230
It's called tradition.

597
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,590
Bye.

598
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,280
Zeng Huai's "Grapes".

599
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,470
But it's seriously damaged.

600
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,160
Take it?

601
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,310
Yes.

602
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,430
Qin.

603
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,160
This is too broken.

604
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,110
Let's think about it again.

605
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,830
So it's fun.

606
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,830
Take it.

607
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Okay, then, we'll take it.

608
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,760
Mr. Qin.

609
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,560
Just leave after you finish?

610
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,520
I have some questions to ask you.

611
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,310
Talk to my boss if you have any questions.

612
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,590
I'm his boss.

613
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,830
If you have any questions, please ask me directly.

614
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,800
Your employee

615
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,190
is rude.

616
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,590
Yes. Yes.

617
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,190
Hard-core repairer.

618
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,830
He is like this.

619
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,110
I can't control him.

620
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,040
How about

621
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,520
we discuss the cost first?

622
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,640
Come this way, please.

623
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,760
It's absolutely not easy

624
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,640
to invite Mr. Qi here.

625
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,190
Yes.

626
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,880
Mr. Qin.

627
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,590
What a coincidence.

628
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,640
I'm going to collect a painting.

629
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,190
Now that Mr. Qin is here,

630
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,310
can you make some time

631
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,310
to help me take a look?

632
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,230
I've also invited Mr. Qi.

633
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,310
With senior like Director Qi here,

634
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,230
I won't disturb you.

635
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,640
Sorry.

636
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,520
I have to go.

637
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,680
Okay.

638
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,070
Then we can make an appointment some other time.

639
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,310
Mr. Fan.

640
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,560
Since that you have invited Mr. Qi,

641
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,800
why did you also invite Qin Zhiyuan?

642
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,230
Two kings won't work with each other.

643
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,310
It's my fault.

644
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,430
It's my fault.

645
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,470
Go.

646
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:02,560
Yes.

647
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,350
Turn right.

648
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,640
Yuan.

649
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
Come on.

650
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,000
Go, go, go.

651
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,110
Luo Youqian.

652
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,520
Why do you take my stuff here without my permission?

653
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,070
No, Yuan,

654
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,310
listen to me.

655
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,830
Calm down.

656
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,950
Shut up.

657
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,590
Give me the painting.

658
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,230
I won't sell it.

659
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,680
This painting is worth a lot of money.

660
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
Can we have a talk even if you don't sell it?

661
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,430
After all, our boss is so old.

662
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,520
He has been waiting for you so long.

663
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,000
And the boss...

664
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,520
Shut up.

665
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,520
Mr. Qi.

666
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,760
Your opinion?

667
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,760
Mr. Qin.

668
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,710
Glad to meet you here.

669
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,040
You know each other?

670
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,680
This bug again.

671
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,560
Gosh.

672
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
I'm going to have another bad day.

673
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,640
Mr. Qin.

674
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,680
Why are you back?

675
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,280
I'm curious.

676
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,590
I'd like to see what treasure it is

677
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,920
to alarm Director Qi.

678
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,110
Please go on.

679
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,070
Don't be influenced by me.

680
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,040
No impact.

681
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,470
I don't need to check this painting at all.

682
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,950
From a glance of the paint on this,

683
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,310
I can tell it is a modern chemical product.

684
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,310
What?

685
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,280
Chemical product?

686
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,350
I am not...

687
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,710
I don't think they are

688
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,760
deliberately counterfeiting it.

689
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,310
Young man.

690
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,590
I'd like to know

691
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,350
why it isn't a fraud.

692
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,520
In my opinion, this is a copy.

693
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,560
To cheat with a copy is no different from forging.

694
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
The paint used in this painting

695
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,070
is exactly as what you said.

696
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,710
The coloring technique is really naïve.

697
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,430
But the character lines are very powerful.

698
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,280
It's drawn by an expert.

699
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,110
In my opinion,

700
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,310
it's more like

701
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,190
an exercise to guide the younger generation.

702
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,640
Chop logic.

703
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,400
Mr. Qi.

704
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,230
Calm down.

705
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,800
Go.

706
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,590
Don't be angry, Mr. Qi.

707
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,590
We didn't expect this to happen.

708
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,470
Has this painting ever been torn apart?

709
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,640
How did you know it?

710
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,110
If I don't guess wrong,

711
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,830
this painting must be fixed

712
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,710
by two people.

713
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:08,920
Yes.

714
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,190
One of them is me.

715
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,950
You should be the green hand.

716
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,560
I'd like to meet another expert.

717
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,070
Could you recommend me?

718
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,920
He has passed away.

719
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,520
It's a pity.

720
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,310
If you still want to sell this painting,

721
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,430
I can buy it.

722
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,590
It's not for sale.

723
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,040
No.

724
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,430
Qin Zhiyuan.

725
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
I'll be a repairer.

726
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,280
Did he laugh at me?

727
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,040
You don't make money.

728
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,680
Who else will he laugh at

729
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,280
besides you?

730
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,430
Dad.

731
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,430
I was unfaithful.

732
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,760
I didn't come back to see you until now.

733
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,110
Look at you.

734
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,920
Every time you took a picture, you kept a poker face.

735
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,830
So now I can't

736
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,470
even remember clearly

737
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,830
how you laughed now.

738
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,680
By the way,

739
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,190
Qiu Yuan wanted to come.

740
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,190
She went back as she had something to do on the way.

741
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,350
If you see her now,

742
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,160
you may not recognize her.

743
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,760
She has grown up.

744
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,640
She is not that girl

745
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
who jumped over the wall and skipped class any more.

746
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,190
You'll be surprised if you see her.

747
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,310
Yuan, Youqian, time for dinner.

748
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,350
Coming.

749
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,590
We eat hamburgers today?

750
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,760
Xixi,

751
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,000
I think you can

752
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,680
call us in this order.

753
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,880
Yuan, Youqian.

754
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,280
Yuan is rich.

755
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,680
You're going to be rich.

756
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,280
It's too late today.

757
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,070
I ordered takeout.

758
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,880
Make do with it.

759
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,710
Luckily, you ordered takeout.

760
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,470
Or your kitchen will be gone.

761
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,400
Why do you always hit me?

762
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,000
I will resist.

763
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,520
You still have the face to resist?

764
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,950
I have summarized it.

765
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,920
As long as you and Bug Qin

766
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,560
show up together,

767
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,430
I will have a disaster.

768
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,470
It's more accurate than the astrolabe.

769
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,040
Youqian, what did you do?

770
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,190
What can I do?

771
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,110
Not my fault.

772
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,000
Look at that painting on the wall.

773
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,880
It could have been sold.

774
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,560
Because of revenge,

775
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,640
Yuan didn't sell it.

776
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,830
Yuan, what hatred you have?

777
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I don't bear a grudge against him.

778
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,400
Tomorrow,

779
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,230
I'm going to the Institute of Antiquities for an interview.

780
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,310
Really?

781
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,830
Xixi.

782
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,520
Look.

783
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,070
Our family has excellent genes, right?

784
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,000
I haven't passed it yet.

785
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,830
Yuan, you can make it.

786
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,400
Okay.

787
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,230
It's a matter of time.

788
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,070
Qiu Yuan

789
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,710
is embarking on a bright road.

790
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,640
Please fill in the form.

791
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,160
Miss...

792
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,350
There are so many people interviewing?

793
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,430
Yes, fill in all.

794
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,760
Okay.

795
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,710
Please fill in the form.

796
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,280
Okay.

797
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,350
Miss,

798
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,190
can I borrow your pen?

799
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,760
I have the last word to write.

800
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
My pen is out of ink.

801
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,560
Okay.

802
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,710
Thank you.

803
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,470
You graduated from Sucheng Arts Institute?

804
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,640
You're great.

805
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,310
I'm flattered.

806
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,280
Qingyu University?

807
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,040
Sucheng University?

808
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,880
This way.

809
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,470
To cheat with a copy

810
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,470
is no different from forging.

811
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,430
How could it be him?

812
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,230
How unlucky I am!

813
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,430
Next one, Qiu Yuan, get ready.

814
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,470
All the items you ordered are here.

815
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,800
OK. OK.

816
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,360
I think you are in a hurry.

817
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
So I bring them right away.

818
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,320
Okay. Thank you.

819
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,040
The atmosphere is a little strange.

820
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,080
We just met once.

821
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,630
He shouldn't recognize me.

822
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,630
Are you Qiu Yuan?

823
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,910
Do you have a cold?

824
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,630
Never mind.

825
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,040
It's not contagious if you stay far away.

826
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,630
Take off your mask and sunglasses.

827
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,150
Can you tell us

828
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,870
why you come to our Institute of Antiquities?

829
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,870
Because I want

830
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,000
to be a repairer since childhood.

831
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,630
When I was young...

832
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,910
I think you can leave.

833
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,470
Doing cultural relics repair,

834
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,080
the most important thing is character.

835
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,360
Our efforts

836
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,760
are used to restore cultural relics,

837
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,470
in stead of making fakes.

838
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,520
I don't approve of your character.

839
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,560
The institute will not accept you.

840
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,150
As long as I, Qi Wei, work here,

841
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,320
I will not let people who have evil intentions

842
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,910
join the team of cultural relics restoration.

843
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
You'd better go.

844
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,190
Why do you think I'm being dishonest?

845
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,120
I didn't want to sell that painting.

846
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,080
Can't I practice copying?

847
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,430
Don't waste our time.

848
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,840
I will be a repairer.

849
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,910
Bye.

850
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,360
Sorry, Xixi.

851
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,430
I actually, I...

852
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,710
Yuan, have you finished your interview?

853
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm waiting for you at the door.

854
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,670
Little Shrimp?

855
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,840
Zuo Huairen?

856
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,230
Hello.

857
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,320
Who are you?

858
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
Me?

859
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,320
Me...

860
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,190
Luo Youqian.

861
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,280
Grandma Qiu's grandson.

862
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,230
Qiu Yuan's cousin.

863
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,950
She told me about you.

864
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,470
Hello. Hello.

865
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,190
Hello.

866
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,190
Glad to meet you.

867
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,950
You came to pick her up?

868
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah.

869
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,600
You also came to pick her up?

870
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,320
Yeah.

871
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,150
You arranged the interview?

872
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,360
I said how could she...

873
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,320
No. No.

874
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,520
We are having an open recruitment.

875
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,910
Yuan depends on her own ability.

876
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,870
Let's go home for dinner together tonight.

877
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,230
I booked a box.

878
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,470
Then why don't you join us?

879
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,190
Okay.

880
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,670
What's up?

881
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,560
You failed?

882
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,150
It's your fault.

883
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,320
My fault?

884
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,080
No.

885
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,040
Yuan

886
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,000
You two, wait for me.

887
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,040
Linda.

888
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,600
Were you in that interview just now?

889
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,560
Yeah.

890
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,120
It's fun.

891
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,320
Let me show you.

892
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,360
Interviewees

893
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,870
are really weird.

894
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,040
Look at her.

895
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,120
Why was she passed?

896
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,470
She was caught making fraud

897
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,630
by Director Qi.

898
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,600
Fraud?

899
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,760
That's not right.

900
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
I'll go and talk to Director Qi.

901
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
Does this person matter?

902
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,320
Isn't she just a graduate of a vocational college?

903
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,470
Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.

904
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,000
What do you mean?

905
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,040
She's right.

906
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,190
Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.

907
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,390
I won't come here again.

908
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,320
No.

909
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,280
Yuan, we...

910
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,670
Yuan.

911
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,280
See you later, Little Shrimp.

912
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,560
Director Qi, I have something to talk to you.

913
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,360
Is it convenient for you?

914
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,190
Then I'll go first.

915
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,910
Okay.

916
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,670
I have something to talk to you as well.

917
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,630
Okay.

918
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,360
Here is the thing.

919
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,190
I have a friend coming for the interview today.

920
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,390
She was passed by you.

921
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,840
I understand your choice.

922
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,560
But I'm worried

923
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,710
there may be some misunderstanding.

924
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,190
So I think

925
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,630
I'd better ask you in person

926
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,840
why on earth.

927
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,600
You're referring to that

928
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,280
girl who made a fake?

929
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,710
Her name is Qiu Yuan.

930
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,360
I know her very well.

931
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,560
She won't cheat.

932
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,120
I don't know how well you know her.

933
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,840
But not long ago,

934
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,760
I saw her

935
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,230
trying to sell a fake painting

936
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,950
to a friend of mine.

937
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,840
I don't know if

938
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,320
you've heard about this.

939
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,670
A fake?

940
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,950
Are you sure?

941
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,710
Am I sure?

942
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,230
A clumsy painting

943
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,230
with chemical paint.

944
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,320
I won't make a mistake.

945
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,910
No, Mr. Qi,

946
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,390
I, I didn't mean that.

947
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,670
I don't care what you mean.

948
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,470
I was already retired.

949
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,320
I can enjoy the happiness at home.

950
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,800
I am now at the Institute of Antiquities

951
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,120
because of the restoration of cultural relics

952
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,870
is my lifelong wish.

953
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,560
I can't stand

954
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,320
such people appearing here.

955
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,120
Besides,

956
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,800
we talked before

957
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,560
to establish a repair department

958
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,320
to rescue national cultural relics.

959
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,800
I thought this recruitment

960
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,950
is for this.

961
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,080
But I asked Linda just now.

962
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
You were recruiting

963
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,520
people for you overseas business.

964
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,120
I, Qi Wei, came here

965
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,840
because I want to do something practical,

966
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,390
not to be a mascot for your institute.

967
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm so sorry for this.

968
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,670
Mr. Qi.

969
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,910
I've been in charge

970
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,040
of docking with overseas affairs.

971
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,710
I really didn't watch this personally.

972
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,910
But don't worry.

973
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,360
Now that I have promised you,

974
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,190
I will follow this project to the end.

975
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,320
Okay.

976
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,630
I'm waiting for you.

977
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,190
In addition,

978
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,280
I advise you to stay away from these counterfeiters.

979
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,280
Don't ruin your reputation.

980
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,040
Have some more.

981
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,120
You can add some if it's not enough.

982
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,000
Thank you, aunt.

983
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,430
Okay.

984
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,360
Yuan, please have some.

985
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
It's really my fault.

986
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,320
Don't be sad.

987
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,950
Who would expect

988
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,870
you met that old man again?

989
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,520
Gosh.

990
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,560
You still have that woodblock engraving skill.

991
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,120
At worst,

992
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
we can do live streams to sell paintings, right?

993
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,470
Follow us,

994
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,360
and you can live long.

995
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,150
Present gifts,

996
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,360
and you can be pretty always.

997
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,430
Yuan, you have been silent like this.

998
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,840
I'm worried.

999
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,390
Luo Youqian.

1000
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,470
Do you have a dream?

1001
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,950
Yuan, you'll get it through, right?

1002
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,390
Answer me.

1003
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,630
Making money doesn't count.

1004
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,520
That must be Xixi.

1005
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,840
I messed it up today.

1006
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,470
I lost my temper with Xixi today.

1007
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,360
She wanted me

1008
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,230
to find a stable job,

1009
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,520
so that her mom would accept me.

1010
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,630
But our business

1011
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,600
can't be solved by a stable job.

1012
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,760
She said it's not about money.

1013
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,280
Actually, it's about money.

1014
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,280
You know what, Yuan,

1015
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,710
I want to make money so much now.

1016
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,390
I just want to prove

1017
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,760
I can bring happiness to Xixi.

1018
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,630
I can give her a better life.

1019
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,080
I can so make her...

1020
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,040
You're right.

1021
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,150
Why do you have to end your happiness

1022
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,630
because they look down on you?

1023
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,630
How can I end

1024
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,840
my dream because of his words?

1025
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,950
Yeah.

1026
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm not convinced.

1027
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,670
Yeah!

1028
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,840
We are not convinced.

1029
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,760
We should fight them to the end.

1030
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,840
Knock till dawn.

1031
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
You're right.

1032
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,040
Knock, knock.

1033
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,870
To the end.

1034
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,000
Insist.

1035
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,390
Insisting

1036
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,000
will lead to a victory.

1037
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,230
Are you all right?

1038
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,080
The head girl of the South Street

1039
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,630
is not a false title.

1040
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,280
If you want to learn repair,

1041
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,800
the institute won't be the only choice.

1042
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,910
I'll keep an eye out for a right one for you.

1043
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,230
Thank you.

”From Repair to Pair” -

1045
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,100
why were the elegant folding fans so expensive?

1046
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,060
In ancient times,

1047
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,940
a delicate jade bamboo folding fan

1048
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,620
was an expensive and useful tool for relieving summer heat.

1049
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,820
Let's study together today

1050
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,660
the production of jade bamboo folding fan.

1051
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,900
First, cut a top-grade old bamboo,

1052
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,620
and select the longer knot.

1053
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:19,820
After cutting, water boiling and drying,

1054
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,340
store them until they were covered with spider webs naturally.

1055
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Then cut the bamboo section into strips of the same size,

1056
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,060
and grind the bamboo strips repeatedly with tools such as knife, bit, file, etc.

1057
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,540
Remember to level both sides of the bamboo strip.

1058
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,460
Then our fan rib is made.

1059
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,380
Then drill and nail the fan ribs,

1060
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,740
connecting the entire ribs together.

1061
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,980
Install the fan ribs and fan sector after completion.

1062
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,620
A folding fan is finished.

1063
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,180
After several years of usage, this kind of folding fan

1064
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,060
would have a jade-like texture.

1065
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,260
This is also the reason why the jade bamboo folding fan is expensive.
