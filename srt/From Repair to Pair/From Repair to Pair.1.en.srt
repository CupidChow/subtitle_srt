♫I take up a brush to paint its prime of life♫

2
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,020
♫The sandstorm has taken down time and tide for thousands of years♫

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:43,340
♫My concern in this life is to distinguish true from false♫

4
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,540
♫But love brought me to her♫

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,660
♫I play dumb and take only one glance under the roof♫

6
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,540
♫Every day and night lasts only a moment♫

7
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,180
♫I stand with her side by side and say nothing, forgetting a flashy life♫

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,900
♫I can't extricate myself from my worries♫

9
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,300
♫I take the brush to leave its elegance♫

10

♫Having the dirt washed away, the vicissitudes of life become pure♫

♫Let me put aside my worries♫

12
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,980
♫I draw a picture of her stroke by stroke♫

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,620
♫I take the brush to leave prosperous days♫

14
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,740
♫How can I say sweet words after having the dirt washed away♫

15
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,460
♫I paint with a bamboo hairpin on paper to set off her cheeks♫

[Episode 1]

18
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,390
It was the luckiest thing

19
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,520
for me to meet him

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,080
and I'd boast about it all my life.

21
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,160
He made me want to be a better person,

22
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,630
and my life changed because of him.

23
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,190
You got a video push from Yuxin Studio.

24
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,270
Please check it.

25
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
You are my idol.

26
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,390
Every technique is perfect.

27
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,030
It blows me away.

28
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,030
I'm so obsessed with his hands. I wonder what his face looks like.

29
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,190
He must be incredibly handsome.

30
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,830
Maybe he's too ugly to take a picture of his face.

31
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,800
Beg to see the face.

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,080
Me too.

33
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,110
Men can't only rely on their faces.

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
With his skill,

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
he can beat all the handsome men.

36
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,320
Are you sure you want to be a fan of an ugly man?

37
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm a fan of his talent.

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,440
It doesn't matter what he looks like.

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,390
I, Qiu Yuan,

40
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,080
want to be a repairer

41
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,720
like him one day.

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
Today I'll take

43
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,440
the first step to my dream.

44
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,160
There are two options for

45
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,030
our cultural relics repair courses,

46
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,720
either a half-year course with one-to-many repairers

47
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,110
or a full-year course

48
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,000
with one-to-one advanced repairers.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,390
The teachers here

50
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,800
are all experienced repairers in the industry

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
such as the live streamer of Yuxin Studio.

52
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,360
Is he that repair master?

53
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,000
The real person? How lucky!

54
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,830
We saw him.

55
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,230
Hello. Hello. Hello.

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,000
Excuse me, are you the repairer at Yuxin Studio?

57
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,110
Yes, I am.

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
Oh, my God!

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
I didn't expect to meet you here.

60
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,270
Well, I've been following you.

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,510
I've watched

62
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,440
all of

63
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,000
your videos

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,070
over and over again.

65
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,480
May I have your autograph, please?

66
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,510
Just sign it right here.

67
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,720
Let me hold it for you.

68
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,270
These are the wrong hands.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,670
Thank you.

70
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,160
Ling Yue.

71
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,510
You’re really a master.

72
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,110
Even your name is so powerful.

73
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,830
May I shake your hand?

74
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,670
These aren't the hands in the video at all.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,640
Liar.

76
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,510
That guy's been here a dozen days.

77
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,110
What is he doing?

78
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,040
My dad says he is repairing a family tree.

79
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,880
What is a family tree?

80
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,920
Go. Don't disturb him.

82
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,230
Look at this.

83
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,640
Li Jueming was a No. 2 scholar in palace examinations.

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,110
There was such an excellent person

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
among our ancestors.

86
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,110
Yeah, I heard Grandma say that before.

87
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,480
I thought it was bragging.

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,640
Here are noodles.

89
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,550
Here are noodles.

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
Enjoy it, Uncle Seven.

91
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,510
Qin, thank you.

92
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,510
You need to eat more.

93
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,160
Thank you.

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,320
Enjoy it.

95
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,600
How much money

96
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
do you make for repairing it for us Li family?

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,480
Qin didn't take any money.

98
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,480
He just came to help.

99
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,320
Thanks to you,

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,760
or those ungrateful kids

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,110
wouldn't know

102
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,070
where their roots lie.

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,790
I heard them call you Qin.

104
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,390
Your last name isn't Li, huh?

105
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm Qin Zhiyuan.

106
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,830
I don't get it.

107
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,550
They're not your ancestors.

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,550
Why are you so concerned?

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,390
Every name on this family tree

110
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,200
was once a living person

111
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,720
and the memory of those who came before us

112
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,160
is history.

113
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,320
If domestic discipline is lost, the family tree still keeps it.

114
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,320
If the family tree is lost, people don't know their roots.

115
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,270
I'm Qin Zhiyuan,

116
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,440
a calligraphy and painting repairer.

117
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,640
No matter whether they are ancient paintings and books

118
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,760
or obscure family trees and letters,

119
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,320
no matter whether they are put in the palaces

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,440
or lost among the common people,

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,550
to me

122
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,350
they are all the pearls

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,510
in the long history.

124
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,270
It's my mission to restore them

125
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,880
to their original appearance.

126
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,960
Here are the twenty pictures you asked for.

127
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,110
Would you like to pay in cash or scan the code?

128
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,590
Qiu Yuan, my money is tight.

129
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,640
I'll pay half up front.

130
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,670
You only paid half last time.

131
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,350
I'll pay for it next time.

132
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,350
You said you'd pay it next time, too.

133
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,440
Luo Youqian,

134
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,960
if you're bilking again,

135
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
I'll curse you to grab a dime all the time

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,030
when snatching a red envelope on-line.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,590
Qiu Yuan,

138
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,320
when I am rich,

139
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll send you a big red envelope every day.

140
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,640
Although you haven't studied well since childhood,

141
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,590
you really do a good job in the New Year wood-block prints

142
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,400
handed down by our family.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,230
I can learn well

144
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,320
if I'm willing to.

145
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,960
Who took

146
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,550
the driver's license examination subject two three times?

147
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,790
You're just jealous of me.

148
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,520
How one-sided you are!

149
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,790
You've seen

150
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,550
my business talent

151
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,320
revealed at the age of eight.

152
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,150
You've carried on Grandma's name and craft.

153
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm in charge of monetizing the craft.

154
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,200
Perfect.

155
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,840
Qiu Yuan,

156
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,320
you found another cultural relics repair class.

157
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,880
Don't mention it.

158
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,470
The last one was a total fraud.

159
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,030
So I have to figure out another way.

160
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,230
That's a lot of money for tuition.

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,230
No way.

162
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,790
How many years will it take you

163
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,110
to make money from this trade?

164
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,080
You're wasting your time.

165
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,470
With your engraving skills

166
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,840
and my intelligence,

167
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,960

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,560
What?

340
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
Not…

341
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,680
Not elegant.

342
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,280
Come on,

343
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
you're a tea boy.

344
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,400
What's wrong with you?

345
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,310
Come. Get out. Get out.

346
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,680
What do you care what I wear?

347
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,640
There's something wrong with the tea boy.

348
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,400
Here. This way.

349
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,760
You must pay me.

350
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,230
Yes. Yes.

351
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll pay you.

352
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,680
He doesn't wear

353
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,760
anything fancy himself.

354
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,880
Why did he say that to me?

355
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,280
OK. Calm down. Calm down.

356
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,470
You asked me to come here

357
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,400
to talk about business.

358
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,560
I didn't come here myself.

359
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,590
Don't be mad.

360
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,470
How about that?

361
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
I'll find someone

362
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,760
to take you out to buy some clothes.

363
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,880
I'll pay them.

364
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,000
Will you?

365
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,430
The time spent is included in the rates.

366
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,590
Is it?

367
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,280
Yes.

368
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,190
Why did you get out so fast?

369
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,590
Time should be calculated since we were on the road.

370
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,280
Even if it is less than one hour, you have to pay by one hour.

371
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,830
His boss asked him to take me out

372
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,470
shopping for clothes,

373
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,190
and he'll pay for the hours spent.

374
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,110
This is the first time I've ever been paid to go shopping.

375
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Take your time.

376
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,800
Go.

377
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
I sent her away on purpose.

378
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,070
She's not the one you're looking for.

379
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,110
She didn't sell me that painting,

380
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,710
but she made it.

381
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,800
I can find the one who sold it

382
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,190
after I find her.

383
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,800
She isn't the one who made it.

384
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,400
What does it mean?

385
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,710
Count the peaches.

386
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

387
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,160
Why is there an extra one?

388
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,800
Well, isn't that a waste of money to buy clothes for her?

389
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,680
Not at all.

390
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,830
She's the one I'm looking for.

391
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,070
Take a seat.

392
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,070
No way.

393
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,430
I can't return it if it's wrinkled.

394
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
It was all a mistake.

395
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,760
We're even now.

396
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,800
Ask me questions right now.

397
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,160
Take a seat.

398
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,950
Have a cup of tea.

399
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,710
Here.

400
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,640
Thank you.

401
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,110
This suit is of good color and texture.

402
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,310
You have a good taste.

403
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,070
Are you telling me?

404
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,070
That's so expensive.

405
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,760
I guess I can't return it now.

406
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,710
Nonsense.

407
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,760
The tag is ripped off. Who can you return it to?

408
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,350
You're the one who made this picture, huh?

409
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes. What's going on?

410
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
What business are you talking about?

411
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,710
Why can't I see it?

412
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,800
Let me in.

413
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,280
Wait here.

414
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
Are you looking for a fight?

415
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,520
Listen,

416
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
the one inside is my cousin.

417
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
I have to go in and see her now.

418
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,070
Who did you learn the trade from?

419
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,880
It was handed down by my family.

420
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,190
I wonder if they're really up to no good.

421
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,190
Hollow out the wood and carve on it and print it on plain paper.

422
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,230
Duoyun Studio in the south and Rongbao Studio in the north.

423
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,430
Neither of them.

424
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,760
Suzhou studios or Houmen studios.

425
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,430
Not really.

426
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,830
Don't talk nonsense.

427
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,950
The New Year wood-block printing of my family is a serious craft.

428
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,000
What's your name?

429
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm going to the bathroom.

430
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,280
What are you doing?

431
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,590
Are you making such a lame excuse

432
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,190
to run away?

433
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,920
Stop making advantage of me.

434
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
I…I…

435
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,160
I didn't.

436
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,310
I didn't. I didn't.

437
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,350
She ran away.

438
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,520
Go.

439
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,280
Stop watching.

440
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,640
What's wrong?

441
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,160
Go after them.

442
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,310
Wait for me.

443
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,190
Hurry up.

444
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,710
Hurry up.

445
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,760
Split up.

446
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,800
What?

447
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,470
I…

448
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,400
Should I stop her?

449
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,830
Since she wants to run,

450
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,520
let her be.

451
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,640
Drive slowly.

452
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,830
Luo Youqian,

453
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,830
you’re so nice.

454
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,230
Sure I am.

455
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,950
I was about to throw up,

456
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,880
but I still held this bag of clothes for you.

457
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,560
I've never seen you run faster for takeouts.

458
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,920
Can you be more reliable?

459
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,830
What’s matter with those customers?

460
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,310
How am I supposed to know what happened to you guys?

461
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,520
Moreover,

462
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I can't give up

463
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,430
every opportunity to make money.

464
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,560
Turn around.

465
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,470
The tag was ripped off.

466
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,680
I can't return it.

467
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,160
He was so stingy.

468
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,190
Yuan.

469
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,230
Stop that. Stop that.

470
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,190
They’re coming.

471
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,000
Who?

472
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,230
Those guys.

473
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,560
I can't run anymore.

474
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,640
Don't come over.

475
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,430
Listen, don't come over.

476
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,520
My cousin is getting changed.

477
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,880
Behave yourselves.

478
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,880
What…what are you doing?

479
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,280
There is where you work.

480
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,310
Yeah.

481
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,920
Why?

482
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,680
What?

483
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,950
What do you want?

484
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,880
Listen.

485
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,560
Not bad.

486
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,520
Don't come over.

487
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,760
Listen,

488
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,800
I've learned Taekwondo, Judo,

489
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,350
and Wing Chun.

490
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,640
You do have a knack for it.

491
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,710
To save time, labor and cost,

492
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,520
you carved rubber like a block one.

493
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,160
That's a bit of a skill.

494
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,040
How about this?

495
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,110
I want you to make me a "Print of Fairy Peaches".

496
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,070
Name a price.

497
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,430
There is one available.

498
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,760
I don't want your fake nine peaches.

499
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,160
Don't frame me up.

500
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,590
Eight peaches are a fake.

501
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,230
Nine peaches are to pay homage to the classic.

502
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
It doesn't matter.

503
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Do you want to take this deal or not?

504
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,350
Yes, I do.

505
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,400
I must get 5,000 yuan out of it.

506
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,190
He'll live on a shoestring for the rest of the month.

507
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,070
This price isn't negotiable.

508
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,310
50,000 yuan.

509
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,680
In cash.

510
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,950
OK.

511
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,470
But I'll only give you one night.

512
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,710
Gao Shuo.

513
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,430
What's going on?

514
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,760
A fool has a lot of money.

515
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,160
Do it fast.

516
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,950
What am I supposed to do?

517
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,280
Just take good care of them.

518
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,590
They don't need me.

519
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,950
They've even brought their own tea set for tea.

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,880
So dainty.

521
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,760
So artificial.

522
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,800
It takes so many steps to have tea.

523
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,040
That's showy.

524
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,640
He's unreasonable, arrogant and impolite.

525
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,230
Are you two thirsty?

526
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,040
No.

527
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,640
Then get to work.

528
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,160
Get to work. Get to work.

529
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,310
Get to work. Get to work. Hurry.

530
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,350
Get to work.

531
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,920
Are we really going to stay here all night?

532
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,760
Well, we can't go hungry.

533
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,430
Who is that?

534
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,680
Luo Youqian, right? Go.

535
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,040
- What do you want? - Go.

536
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,640
It's really annoying to see him.

537
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,520
You can enjoy your tea here.

538
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,830
I'll go home and continue to work.

539
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,800
Don't play games if you want to make money.

540
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,190
You can rest assured. I'm more anxious than you are.

541
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,110
I have to go home and print.

542
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,470
I'm not lying to you.

543
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,520
I got no device here.

544
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,400
Go.

545
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,470
Sir,

546
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
I can't finish it

547
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,160
in a while.

548
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,760
Why don't you go back first?

549
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,830
I promise

550
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,230
you'll have it first thing in the morning.

551
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,800
I'd cut the crap and focus on my work

552
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,640
if I were you.

553
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,430
Please.

554
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,880
This room is perfect for your temperament.

555
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,710
What temperament?

556
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,000
Vagabond temperament.

557
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,230
Sir,

558
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,070
you are a master of chat.

559
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,520
Why don't you just sit there

560
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
and stop talking?

561
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,590
Thank you.

562
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,070
Here we go.

563
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,950
Are you telling me?

564
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,590
He's paying me so much money

565
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,040
to copy this painting.

566
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,310
Is he going to print more fake paintings?

567
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,110
Wouldn't I be breaking the law?

568
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,830
I had to mark it,

569
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,920
so I could have an excuse.

570
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
She must be up to something

571
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,110
with that look.

572
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,400
I want the same engraving

573
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
as this painting.

574
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,520
If you choose to add one more peach

575
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,350
or one less leaf,

576
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,560
I won't give you a penny.

577
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,830
Get it?

578
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes.

579
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,590
Go on.

580
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,000
Have my dinner delivered to this address.

581
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,760
Hello, here's your braised pork.

582
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,520
Waitress.

583
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,280
Well,

584
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,710
can I have these dishes delivered?

585
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,920
You can just place an order on your phone.

586
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,590
Thank you.

587
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,310
My pleasure.

588
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,800
What are you doing?

589
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,040
Please enjoy your meal.

590
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,640
Braised Pork in the Purple Clay Pot

591
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
is the brand of this shop.

592
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,230
You have to wait in line if you're late.

593
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,710
How does it taste?

594
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:31,880
Pretty good.

595
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,830
These two dishes don't seem to be enough for us.

596
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,350
I have enough to eat.

597
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,230
I haven't eaten either.

598
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,310
I'm just bored eating alone.

599
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,880
Just sit there and play with your phone.

600
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,470
You can't.

601
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,520
Dude, I know you're kidding me.

602
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,760
You're not one of those people.

603
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,280
Really?

604
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,310
Then who am I?

605
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,640
Look,

606
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,520
you look like a boss.

607
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,560
Why can you be an assistant

608
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,430
to someone younger than you?

609
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,800
It means you're resilient

610
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
and tolerant.

611
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,830
You're hitting bottom

612
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,070
and waiting to bounce back.

613
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,190
I don't have to bounce back.

614
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,110
I'm his boss.

615
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,560
Bro, you are really good.

616
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,560
You can be so kind and generous

617
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
to your man.

618
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,590
How broad-minded.

619
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,880
I can't help it.

620
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,800
Because he's my uncle.

621
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,350
Uncle?

622
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,230
Yeah, it was my dad's fault.

623
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,110
Your dad.

624
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,880
Well, poor you two.

625
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,800
Come and have a drink.

626
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,640
It can get you relieved.

627
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,800
How did he know what I was up to?

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,350
Can he read my mind?

629
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,070
But don't think I'm a pushover.

630
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,000
Come on, mosquitoes.

631
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,640
He wants the painting exactly the same.

632
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,190
I don't think you'd be able to tell it

633
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,040
if I leave a secret name.

634
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,430
I understand

635
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,560
after you put it that way.

636
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,070
His grandfather's cousin's son is your dad.

637
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,160
No.

638
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,000
His grandfather's cousin's grandson

639
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,710
is my dad.

640
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,040
You can't talk about your dad like that.

641
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,880
Hello, here comes your takeaway.

642
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,040
So many dishes.

643
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,710
You can't eat them all by yourself.

644
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,280
I never attract mosquitoes.

645
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm even more relieved that you're here.

646
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,590
Why am I so unlucky?

647
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,310
Even the mosquitoes are picking on me.

648
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,640
Leave the window open.

649
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,800
It's more comfortable to eat

650
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,760
when it's ventilate on both sides.

651
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,190
Flower Shaped Shortbread Cookies.

652
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,160
I often have it

653
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
in a small shop on Shantang Street.

654
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,830
Have you eaten it there?

655
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,710
My grandma told me

656
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,470
to eat it fresh from the pan.

657
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,560
I always like to take a few salted plums

658
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,070
and soak them in boiling water.

659
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,800
The soft and sweet Flower Shaped Shortbread Cookies

660
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,680
paired with

661
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,640
the salty and sour plum drink

662
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,040
makes people feel happy instantly.

663
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,670
You’re greedy.

664
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,390
No.

665
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,120
You are.

666
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,630
I can see you swallowing.

667
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,150
People should eat and sleep in silence.

668
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
Are you watching a video of Yuxin Studio?

669
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,520
People should eat and sleep in silence.

670
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,670
Nothing.

671
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,520
I have some acquaintance with Yuxin Studio.

672
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,630
Do you know the repairer at Yuxin Studio?

673
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,560
There are plenty of repairers at Yuxin Studio.

674
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,870
Which one are you talking about?

675
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,600
The cute guy in the video.

676
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,710
The cute guy?

677
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,280
Do you know him?

678
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,800
I know him and I don't know him.

679
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,870
I've never met him in person,

680
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,560
but I've watched

681
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,910
every single one of his videos.

682
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,560
I know his hands

683
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,600
in any case.

684
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,520
Why are you smiling?

685
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,280
Have you seen him?

686
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,710
Yes,

687
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,710
sure.

688
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,280
Is he good-looking or not?

689
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,560
Can you see his Moments?

690
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,630
Show me his pictures.

691
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,470
He looks,

692
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,280
as you little girls would say,

693
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,390
cold, domineering,

694
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,390
and stunning.

695
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,360
Really?

696
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,840
I knew I was right about him.

697
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,910
None of those words has anything to do with him.

698
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,000
Have you seen him or not?

699
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,190
He's just

700
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,560
an ordinary guy

701
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,870
you can't notice in a crowd.

702
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,320
An ordinary guy?

703
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,120
You’re an ordinary guy.

704
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,470
You don't understand his charm.

705
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,710
You've never even met him.

706
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,870
It seems you know him so well.

707
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,000
Some people

708
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
are just transparent to me,

709
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,560
and even if I have seen them million times,

710
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
I can forget about them easily,

711
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,520
like you.

712
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,390
Some people

713
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,870
are like soul mates.

714
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,670
Although we have never met,

715
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,080
we have known each other mentally for a long time,

716
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,600
such as my idol.

717
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,630
You don't understand the way

718
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,840
our souls communicate.

719
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,560
I wish I could learn from my idol.

720
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,710
You have an eye for it.

721
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,190
Unfortunately, that's impossible.

722
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I knew.

723
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,000
What a bad apple.

724
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,230
You know nothing.

725
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,150
Why are you sleeping here?

726
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,520
Put your feet down. They stink.

727
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,230
Put them down. Put them down.

728
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,600
Oh, man,

729
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,950
his facial features are so three-dimensional and exquisite.

730
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,430
I wish I had

731
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,950
this tall nose.

732
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,120
He looks so handsome,

733
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,800
but is sharp-tongued.

734
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,630
With such a pretty face,

735
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,710
he must have good-looking hands.

736
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,430
What's up?

737
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,150
Mosquito. Mosquito.

738
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Mosquito.

739
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,430
It's done.

740
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
Have a look.

741
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,190
It's in bad contact again.

742
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,000
Yuan.

743
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,040
What are you doing?

744
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,910
I told you this guy was up to no good.

745
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,320
No.

746
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,800
We got an electric shock (also meaning hit it off in Chinese).

747
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,040
Hit it off?

748
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,390
No, you two hit it off?

749
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,190
That's the boss.

750
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,600
You and he should hit it off.

751
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,080
What are you talking about?

752
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,630
I don't care which one of you is the boss.

753
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,950
It's done.

754
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,630
Pay me.

755
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,320
Gao Shuo.

756
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,840
That's right.

757
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,000
Let me tell you in advance.

758
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,600
This is a personalized work.

759
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,910
No return or exchange.

760
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,600
No problem.

761
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,080
Well, I'll have to do the math first.

762
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,470
1, 2, 3…

763
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,560
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

764
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
I've counted them all.

765
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,320
8.

766
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,840
Leave me alone.

767
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,840
Well, how is it?

768
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,150
Have you ever been

769
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,000
impressed by my skill?

770
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,670
Not too bad.

771
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,430
What about you, Gao Shuo?

772
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,390
After my careful check,

773
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,150
there are

774
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,430
just eight ones.

775
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,950
After

776
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,150
your professional and meticulous check,

777
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,630
can you pay for it?

778
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,840
Take it easy.

779

780
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,080

781

3, 4, 5.

782
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,800
You're slow.

783
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
Remember to praise us.

784
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,390
Give it to me.

785
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,280
See you.

786
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,040
I'll keep it for you.

787
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Luo Youqian, give it to me.

788
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,560
This is the money I got for staying up all night.

789
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Can we share

790
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,000
weal and woe?

791
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,800
Give it to me.

792
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,280
Listen.

793
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,800
Trust me.

794
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,150
By the way,

795
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,430
I'm Qin Zhiyuan.

796
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,320
I just came to remind you

797
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,360
of what you said.

798
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,120
I said too much.

799
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,120
I don't know what he's talking about.

800
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,630
What's wrong with your face?

801
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,040
Yuxin Studio

802
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,910
did burn that painting.

803
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,870
A lot of people bought the fake objects

804
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,190
in our circle.

805
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,390
They admitted it.

806
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,840
But this is the first time

807
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,430
I've seen someone crack down on a fake

808
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,430
so aggressively.

809
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,280
He is young and full of vigor.

810

Gao.

811

Come here. Come here.

812
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,190
What can I do for you?

813
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,950
If I remember correctly,

814
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,600
the owner was desperate for money

815
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,470
when he mortgaged that painting to you

816
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,600
at 270,000 yuan.

817
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,870
Yeah,

818
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,080
that's a wise fraud.

819
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,800
He told me

820
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,870
it was worth half a million.

821
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,150
You guys are impatient.

822
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,600
What would you do

823
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,710
if he returns?

824
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,470
I beg him on my knees to come back

825
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,630
and take it away.

826
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,470
What does he take?

827
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,150
Ashes?

828
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,120
Ashes? What ashes?

The Beauty of Chinese Thread-Bound Books in From Repair to Pair

830
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,500
[Cutting Linen   Washing]
With the advent of papermaking,

831
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,900
[Cai Lun   Steaming]
paper became the main carrier of written language.

832
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,700
The familiar thread-bound book also came into being.

833
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,100
Today, let's learn

834
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
how to make a thread-bound book.

835
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,260
First,

836
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,180
we take out the printed leaves

837
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,300
and fold the side without words in turn.

838

After all the leaves are folded in half in order,

[Column Line]
they shall be stacked neatly

840

based on the column line of the leaves.

841
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,900
Then we can add

842
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
auxiliary leaves (or "protective leaves") at the front and back of the other leaves

843
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,500
for protection.

844
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,300
Take out the prepared awl to drill the leaves

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,540
and fix them with twists.

846
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,740
This step is to tie it together as a whole.

847
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Next cut the residual paper of the leaves,

848
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
wrap the corners,

849
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,140
and cover the book.

850
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,740
After that,

851
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,180
drill holes again

852
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,580
and thread them.

853
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,220
The whole book is fixed.

854
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,780
Finishing with a bookmark,

855
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,980
a beautiful thread-bound book is done.

856
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,620
♫I chase my dreams in the dream♫

857
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:31,140
♫I long to get close to you by tacit agreement once♫

858
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:38,020
♫My heart remembers again at one moment♫

00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,700
♫I look at the memory of departure♫

861
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,020
♫Depicting the joy and sorrow♫

862

863
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,780
♫I stare at you hidden in the picture♫

864
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,020
♫As time goes on♫

865
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,140
♫Love is here♫
