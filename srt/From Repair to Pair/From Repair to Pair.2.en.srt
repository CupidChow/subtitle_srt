00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,200
Yuxin Studio will suffer a huge loss.

171
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,880
Okay.

172
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,110
Gao Shuo, count the money.

173
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,510
What do you mean?

174
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,280
Aren't you going to redeem the painting?

175
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,670
Yeah.

176
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,080
Didn't you burn the painting?

177
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
Mr. Li.

178
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,960
Here's your painting.

179
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,710
So he didn't burn the painting.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,910
Well...

181
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,230
It was burned in the video indeed.

182
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,470
We'll take the money.

183
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,280
Please go back.

184
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,550
Come on. Leave.

185
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,400
Go. Go. Go.

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,840
Go. Go. Go.

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,790
Move faster. Move faster.

188
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Boss Gao,

189
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,790
Mr. Qin is a wise man.

190
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,590
"Qiu Deng Cong Hua" (Qing Dynasty, by Wang Han).

191
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,790
You're clever.

192
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,350
It's a classic routine from it.

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,230
Wanna cheat me?

194
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,030
Gao Shuo.

195
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
Let someone keep an eye on

196
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,280
that girls' shop and home.

197
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Girl?

198
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,230
The one who makes wood blocks.

199
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,030
Xiang,

200
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,640
the painting he burned in the video

201
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
is indeed "Print of Fairy Peaches".

202
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,910
But he couldn't create

203
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,400
an identical one

204
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,470
in such a short time.

205
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,110
Did you see it carefully?

206
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,960
Yes, very carefully.

207
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,200
It's 270,000.

208
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,840
If this painting is our painting,

209
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,590
he burned another painting.

210
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,590
Is Qin Zhiyuan that good?

211
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,200
Team.

212
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,230
It must be team cooperation.

213
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,470
It's time to have meal, Yuan.

214
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,440
What are you doing?

215
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,030
Luo Youqian!

216
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,470
I'm sorry, Xixi.

217
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
Luo Youqian, get my painting back!

218
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,060
[Green Mountain Villa]

219
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,640
Youyou, go inside and take a seat.

220
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,670
Zhiyuan.

221
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,200
Get out of my sight.

222
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Zhiyuan, I really don't have a choice.

223
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,030
He's President Zhang's nephew.

224
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,840
He adores you,

225
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,000
and wants to learn repair from you.

226
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,440
No.

227
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,670
It's to promote traditional culture.

228
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,790
Few young people like it.

229
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,910
And, I really can't refuse

230
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,520
President Zhang.

231
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,080
Why do you want to learn repair?

232
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,350
It's popular recently.

233
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,150
Okay. Follow me.

234
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,880
Are we going to meet Qin Zhiyuan?

235
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,910
What are you doing?

236
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,760
Qin Zhiyuan is too popular.

237
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,470
He doesn't have time.

238
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,710
Youyou, sorry.

239
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,320
He may be in a blue mood today.

240
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,760
How about this? I'll go to find you another day.

241
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,440
Okay?

242
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,520
Here it is. Here it is. Here it is.

243
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,320
The last dish.

244
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,350
Xixi is really virtuous.

245
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,280
It looks good.

246
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,200
Have a taste.

247
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,320
How does it taste?

248
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,880
It seems it's too sweet.

249
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,910
Sweet?

250
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,110
How come?

251
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,880
Let me taste it.

252
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,440
I might have used sugar as salt.

253
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,110
It doesn't matter.

254
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,710
I think it tastes good.

255
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,200
This may be the taste of love.

256
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,550
Okay.

257
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,000
Have more. It's all yours.

258
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm fed up with the PDA (public display of affection).

259
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,760
May I ask a question?

260
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,910
Haven't you convinced your mother-in-law-to-be?

261
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,840
Why do you always come to my home for a date?

262
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,760
Are you doing this

263
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,440
to comfort the single dog?

264
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,470
If I have convinced her,

265
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,150
I won't be here to comfort you.

266
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,110
It's mainly because my mom

267
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,670
always wants me to

268
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,910
find a highly-educated boyfriend

269
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,640
who can make more money in the future.

270
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,200
So you...

271
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,280
I am working towards it.

272
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,960
My mom asked me

273
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,910
to find a girlfriend who is good at cooking.

274
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,110
I am also working towards it.

275
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,640
You two are

276
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,470
contemporary Romeo and Juliet.

277
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,640
No.

278
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,840
I think we are

279
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,280
like tribe and alliance.

280
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,520
Enjoy the meal.

281
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,400
Come on. Come on.

282
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,030
This one

283
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,790
it's the highlight of the auction.

284
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,910
Sir, you have a great taste.

285
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,520
Director Qi,

286
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,640
it's been a long time.

287
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,670
It's great to meet you here.

288
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,400
Please give me some guidance.

289
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,880
I have something to handle.

290
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,790
Let's talk later.

291
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
Okay. See you.

292
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,440
I saw the video about ancient book repair

293
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,590
you posted on the Internet.

294
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,550
You did a great job,

295
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,150
but

296
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,110
such an ordinary folk handwritten copy

297
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,350
is not worth so much effort.

298
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,150
I didn't expect that

299
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,440
the repair video

300
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,590
would attract the attention of an expert like you.

301
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,030
I just want to tell you that

302
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,470
the unconventional things in your eyes

303
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,080
are actually sensationalism.

304
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
It's very stupid.

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
It may be stupid,

306
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,960
but something that people ignore

307
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,150
also has its value.

308
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,790
Repair is also enlightenment.

309
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,670
I am restoring their lives.

310
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,550
Is it also your enlightenment

311
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,910
to repair family tree in an ancestral temple?

312
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,520
There are so many ancestral temple in China.

313
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,840
Can you repair them all?

314
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,150
If a young person shows too much of his ability,

315
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,910
he will get a bad rap from his peers.

316
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,880
I make a living rely on capability,

317
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,230
not peers.

318
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,550
I advise you to make correction.

319
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,080
1 million. Deal.

320
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,760
Sir,

321
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,280
please show me your number plate.

322
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,150
Let's congratulate this mister numbered 3.

323
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,470
The next collected work is

324
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,910
"Ladies Playing with Butterflies".

325
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,440
The opening bid is 2 million.

326
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
You can start the bidding now.

327
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,400
Good.

328
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
The mister numbered 12 makes a bid of 2.2 million.

329
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,080
Any further bids?

330
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,590
2.4 million.

331
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,030
The mister numbered 12 makes a bid of 2.4 million.

332
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,470
Okay. Go on.

333
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,470
2.6 million.

334
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,710
The mister numbered 20 makes a bid of 2.6 million.

335
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,150
The mister numbered 12...

336
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,200
3 million.

337
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,670
Any higher bids?

338
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,350
3.2 million.

339
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,470
The mister numbered 5

340
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,230
makes a bid of 3.2 million.

341
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,520
3.2 million, one time.

342
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,320
Any higher bids?

343
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,440
3.2 million, two times.

344
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,200
4.2 million.

345
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,400
The mister numbered 12

346
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,080
makes a bid of 4.2 million.

347
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,590
4.2 million.

348
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,670
Any higher bids?

349
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,960
Sir,

350
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
do you want to make a bid of 4.4 million?

351
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,960
4.2 million, one time.

352
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,550
4.2 million, two times.

353
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,200
5 million.

354
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,710
Okay. The mister numbered 5 makes a bid of 5 million.

355
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,880
The current bid is 5 million.

356
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Any higher bids?

357
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,190
5 million, one time.

358
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,350
5 million, two times.

359
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,520
5 million. Deal.

360
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,640
Congratulate this mister numbered 5

361
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,350
on wining the Ladies Playing with Butterflies

362
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,680
with the price of 5 million.

363
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,880
Congratulations.

364
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,920
Mr. Qin, can we have a talk?

365
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,590
Zuo Huairen.

366
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,400
You know me.

367
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,800
You're investor of Institute of Antiquities.

368
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,310
I watched report about you on TV.

369
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
Thank you.

370
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,400
Are you also interested in

371
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,920
this painting?

372
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,070
Interest can't help,

373
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,040
but money can.

374
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,800
Linda invited you several times before,

375
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,830
but you didn't go.

376
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,470
Since we meet here today,

377
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,070
I would like to take this chance to

378
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,350
solemnly invite you

379
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,040
to work in Institute of Antiquities.

380
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,920
I have much work to do in Yuxin Studio.

381
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,230
I'm afraid I can't work part-time.

382
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,560
I promise

383
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,430
Institute of Antiquities

384
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,710
will provide you with the best equipment

385
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,230
and best technical support.

386
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,640
I believe

387
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,430
every cultural relics repairer

388
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,520
wants to deal with

389
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,430
these rare treasures.

390
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,040
But I'm not interested in rare treasures.

391
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,710
Thank you all the same.

392
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,040
I can't break this one again.

393
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,160
I will repair you.

394
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,920
Tong.

395
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,110
Come back for lunch.

396
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,070
Pack up all of them.

397
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,880
Okay.

398
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,560
Here you are.

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
Young boy.

400
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,230
Uncle.

401
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,300
[Jianjinqiao Lane]

402
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,520
Here I am.

403
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,110
Let's play another game.

404
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,590
Why?

405
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,950
I'm the leader here.

406
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,560
You need to listen to me.

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,920
Who are you?

408
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
Who are you looking for?

409
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,760
I lived here before.

410
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,590
I bought too many rainbow candies.

411
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,350
Would you like one?

412
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,310
Yes.

413
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,430
Here you are. This is yours.

414
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,830
This is yours.

415
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,400
Brother, do you like rainbow candy?

416
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,110
Of course.

417
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,590
When I was at your age,

418
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,950
I loved rainbow candy most.

419
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,190
Thank you.

420
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,110
Let's go out to play games.

421
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,880
Rainbow candy.

422
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,950
Yuan?

423
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,430
Are you Shrimp?

424
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,560
Are you Shrimp?

425
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,710
Oh, my God.

426
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,680
You've changed a lot.

427
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
You've changed from Shrimp

428
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,190
into Boston Lobster.

429
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,760
Do you still have rainbow candy?

430
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,040
Can't I have it?

431
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
We can't forget

432
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,160
some tastes for a lifetime.

433
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,350
You have not changed a lot.

434
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,560
But your straight bang is gone.

435
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,590
I have grown up.

436
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,190
Straight bang looks childish.

437
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,400
This vat is still here.

438
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,230
Do you remember?

439
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,350
When you were shorter than this vat,

440
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,470
you dared to climb up

441
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,520
and stood on it

442
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,190
to perform Snow Armor.

443
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Yes, Snow Armor.

444
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,310
And this swing.

445
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,880
It is gone.

446
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,110
Only the copper ring is left.

447
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,280
It seems it was used to

448
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,190
tie Luo Youqian one time.

449
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,350
Who is Luo Youqian?

450
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,920
My cousin.

451
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,520
You may not have seen him many times.

452
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,160
I didn't expect that Grandma Qiu has been gone for three years.

453
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,110
There have been so many changes.

454
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,800
You must have lived a good life abroad,

455
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,560
so you didn't contact us.

456
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,230
Not bad.

457
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,800
But I have never forgot

458
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,640
this yard

459
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
and people living in this yard.

460
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,110
Wait a minute.

461
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm returning it to you.

462
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,280
Shrimp, don't be sad.

463
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,230
Yuan, I'm leaving.

464
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,160
Please look after this home for me.

465
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,920
I will look after it for you.

466
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,590
But, Shrimp,

467
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,400
when will you come back?

468
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,590
Rest assured.

469
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,230
I will come back.

470
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Rest assured.

471
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,830
I will look after Huairen.

472
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,800
Huairen,

473
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,400
we have a big garden

474
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,110
at our home abroad.

475
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,560
You will like it.

476
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,310
Let's go.

477
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,800
Thank you.

478
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,950
It tastes like the dish

479
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,190
Grandma made for us in our childhood.

480
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:44,950
Yeah.

481
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,920
I learned more than one

482
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,950
survival skills

483
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,590
from my grandma.

484
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,040
It seems

485
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,520
you have realized your dream

486
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,430
to become a cultural relics repairer.

487
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,920
No.

488
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,000
It's just an old painting I bought

489
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,430
to practice.

490
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,350
I don't even have the qualification

491
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,310
to be a repairer.

492
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,000
What are you busy with recently?

493
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,400
Recently,

494
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,760
I opened a small shop with my cousin

495
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
to sell fake antique paintings.

496
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,830
What about you?

497
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:22,950
I went back

498
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,950
to Sucheng with the company

499
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,070
to set up a new business.

500
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,430
I may not leave after I came back this time.

501
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,310
Really?

502
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,640
In this case, I have to take you

503
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,190
visit the whole city.

504
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,680
Do you know?

505
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,070
So many changes have taken place.

506
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,350
How about you take me to visit your shop?

507
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,070
It is a small shop.

508
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,040
There are nothing valuable to watch.

509
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,680
Yuan,

510
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,830
do you still want to be a cultural relics repairer?

511
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,350
Of course.

512
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,400
Do you know the feature of the poor?

513
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,590
They have a strong will.

514
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,070
Hello. A glass of whisky.

515
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,760
Thank you.

516
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,310
Did you also go to this auction?

517
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,560
It's a pity that

518
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,950
I couldn't go.

519
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,040
It's indeed a pity,

520
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,760
because I was there.

521
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,160
Otherwise, we would have met.

522
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
My name is James.

523
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,800
Linda.

524
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,880
I also like "Ladies Playing with Butterflies".

525
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,830
But it is a pity.

526
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,520
I didn't even see it this time.

527
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,680
What a pity.

528
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,950
I was only interested in this painting

529
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,880
at this auction.

530
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,590
But good things are always popular.

531
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,520
So,

532
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,230
you failed this time.

533
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,920
But I don't care,

534
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,070
because before I met this painting,

535
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,880
I had the painting named "Ladies in Four Seasons".

536
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,110
When I saw this painting,

537
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,190
I found that

538
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,710
it may be

539
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,710
in the same series with

540
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,070
"Ladies in Four Seasons".

541
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,230
Or

542
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,310
they were created by the same painter.

543
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,920
This is a graduation gift for you.

544
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,430
It's to test

545
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,760
you capability in art history

546
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
and business administration.

547
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,350
Tell me what you see.

548
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,880
This painting

549
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,160
and the "Swing" my father collected

550
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,470
are from the same painter.

551
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,350
There should be more two paintings in this series.

552
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,070
Your father had

553
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,950
tried to gather all these painting before his death.

554
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,110
All these years,

555
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,760
I've made painstakingly efforts

556
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
but only found this "Ladies Playing with Butterflies".

557
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,230
I am too old

558
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,640
to do it now.

559
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,040
I'll leave your father's wish

560
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,470
to you.

561
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,280
This pair of annoying shoes.

562
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,000
Look.

563
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,800
My feet are hurt.

564
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,590
It really hurts.

565
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,830
I really don't understand you girls.

566
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,830
You know it will hurt if you wear high heels,

567
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,920
but you still do it.

568
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,590
Thank you,

569
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,920
my timely rain.

570
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,920
But I did this to help you

571
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,640
inquire James.

572
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
My feet are hurt because of this.

573
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,560
How is it going?

574
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
How many paintings does he have?

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,680
Are you so sure he has?

576
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,640
Of course.

577
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,590
I inquired about it on the date of auction.

578
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,110
I made high bids.

579
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,040
Persons who competed with me

580
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,430
must know this painting

581
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,640
is in a series.

582
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,400
James is one of them.

583
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,280
You won.

584
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,470
He has four ones.

585
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,680
Great.

586
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,520
You took out "Ladies Playing with Butterflies" for auction

587
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
to find out who has other paintings in this series.

588
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,560
This move

589
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,920
is really accurate and effective.

590
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,830
James has such paintings,

591
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,110
and Qin Zhiyuan also has.

592
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,280
Things get easy

593
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,190
as we know who has these paintings.

594
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,160
It's not so easy to deal with Qin Zhiyuan.

595
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,710
What a bad taste Mr. Gao has.

596
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,800
He asked me to buy clothes

597
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,830
and keep an eye on her.

598
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,710
What are you doing?

599
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,760
Yuan, we have big business.

600
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,520
Go with me.

601
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,950
Go. Go. Go.

602
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,310
Move fast.

603
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,920
This is a remote place.

604
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,880
You've had a hard time.

605
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,920
Our boss is busy with work,

606
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,830
so he can't go out to meet you.

607
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,100
[Yuxin Studio]

608
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,560
Why didn't answer your phone?

609
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,280
It's noisy, so I muted it.

610
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,000
What's wrong?

611
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,520
I asked big man to keep an eye on that girl.

612
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,040
She went to the nest of the counterfeiters.

613
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,710
It seems

614
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,760
she was deceived as they said they would buy paintings.

615
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,710
Luo Youqian,

616
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,040
what's wrong with your client?

617
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,110
Why does it take so long?

618
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,560
She said

619
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,430
her boss will check our paintings.

620
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,110
A boss must check the paintings very carefully and it takes time.

621
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,070
But

622
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,800
it has been two hours.

623
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,710
He must have finished checking the paintings.

624
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,430
Look at you.

625
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,950
You have no idea

626
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,590
about a client's psychology.

627
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,950
What does an old man value most in buying a painting?

628
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,710
Money.

629
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,160
Fengshui.

630
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,830
Every painting

631
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,950
represents the good wishes of the elderly.

632
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,590
For example, good health, longevity,

633
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,190
flourishing population and treasure.

634
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,040
We have to understand it.

635
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,310
I'm not waiting any more.

636
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,070
I won't sell the painting.

637
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,830
Let's go.

638
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,880
No.

639
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,350
Wait for more a while.

640
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,350
What are you doing?

641
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,110
I won't sell the painting.

642
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,110
We need to go.

643
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,110
Stay here.

644
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,400
Why did you push her?

645
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,520
What are you doing?

646
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,710
Stay inside.

647
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,190
What's wrong with you?

648
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,920
He locked the door.

649
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,280
Why did you lock the door?

650
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,110
No.

651
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,000
Luo Youqian, what kind of client is this?

652
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,110
Well...

653
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,040
I don't know.

654
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,470
This... This...

655
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,230
This way. This way.

656
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,710
Stop!

657
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,520
Go. Go. Go.

658
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,560
Stop!

659
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,560
Come on. Here, here.

660
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,400
Here, here, here.

661
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,880
Stop!

662
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,040
Go up. Go up.

663
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,800
Get down!

664
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,920
Yuan. Yuan.

665
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,190
What are you doing?

666
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,710
Stop!

667
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,160
How long does it take

668
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,310
to get there from the nearby police station?

669
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,830
About 20 minutes.

670
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
We'll go in first

671
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,000
and find Qiu Yuan as soon as possible.

672
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,430
Then we'll delay it to wait for the policemen.

673
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,350
Okay.

674
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,640
Come on.

675
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,760
Is it so high?

676
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,110
Okay.

677
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,680
Just here.

678
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,400
Jump.

679
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,190
Fly up high, young man!

680
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,640
Help!

681
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,760
I'm very satisfied with it.

682
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,430
There are flaws in its details.

683
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,680
The overall level

684
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,800
is pretty good.

685
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,350
How strange.

686
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,880
Did they catch me here to give me good comments?

687
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,280
Do you know Qin Zhiyuan?

688
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,430
It's him again.

689
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,110
He must be a bug.

690
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,230
I am in bad luck whenever I meet him.

691
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,190
No.

692
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,310
I'll give you one more chance.

693
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,470
I don't know him.

694
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,230
Stop acting!

695
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,640
I really don't know him.

696
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,800
Enough, enough.

697
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,520
Speak if you have something to say.

698
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,710
Don't use your hands.

699
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,430
Yeah, yeah.

700
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,120
Why are you covering your face?

701
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,560
Does it hurt?

702
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,120
Because you

703
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,040
carved "Print of Fairy Peaches" for Yuxin Studio,

704
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,000
we suffered a huge loss!

705
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,280
How dare you say you don't know him?

706
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,600
So they are

707
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,190
the frauds who make forgeries.

708
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,470
I won't yield.

709
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm a reasonable leader.

710
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,190
You worked with Qin Zhiyuan

711
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,950
and made me lose 270,000.

712
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,600
Do you have a compensation plan?

713
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,630
Compensation plan?

714
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,230
Well...

715
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,150
I am

716
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,670
a petty role.

717
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,910
I'm a migrant worker. You know?

718
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,630
I have to carve

719
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,950
as my customers request.

720
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,600
I shouldn't be responsible for it.

721
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,000
Joint responsibility, you know?

722
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,710
I don't know, don't know.

723
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
Carve this block,

724
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,230
and I will let you go.

725
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,320
Otherwise,

726
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,630
you have to pay 270,000 in full.

727
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,870
Bug Qin,

728
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,390
you are my doom.

729
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,840
You don't need to send me back.

730
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,360
I can go back on my own.

731
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,190
Go. Go. Go.

732
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,190
Cut the crap.

733
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,190
What does this mean?

734
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,430
You have luxurious equipment here.

735
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,190
It's not luxurious.

736
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,360
It's for temporary use.

737
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,430
Just make do with it.

738
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,470
Amazing. Amazing.

739
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,670
High-end humblebrag.

740
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,670
Go up.

741
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,390
I can go on my own. I'll go. I'll go.

742
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,950
Fighting.

743
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,430
I have faith in you.

744
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,760
Keep a close eye on her.

745
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,520
Got it. Got it.

746
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
I have a plan.

747
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,630
You will try to

748
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,520
lure them out later.

749
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,840
I have attended

750
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,670
more than 40 Thai boxing classes.

751
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,120
I'm sure I can knock them down with one blow.

752
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,120
It must be thrilling.

753
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,870
No.

754
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,710
It'll make loud noise.

755
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,870
That girl is under their control.

756
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,360
That's right.

757
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,470
How about this?

758
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,670
One of us will take the upper path

759
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,840
and the other the lower path.

760
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,630
Let the big man look for

761
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,760
the girl's location.

762
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,950
When he meets some subordinates, he can knock them down.

763
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,230
Trying to keep me in these walls?

764
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,630
A man was coming with her.

765
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,390
Did we catch him?

766
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,430
What?

767
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,560
Don't say catch,

768
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
but invite.

769
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,230
Don't use such low words.

770
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,040
It makes others feel we're unprofessional.

771
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,430
Did we invite the man coming with him?

772
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,760
C and D are playing with him.

773
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,670
They asked us to rest assured.

774
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,630
C has

775
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,670
high EQ.

776
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
If you are as professional

777
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,710
and positive

778
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,080
as him,

779
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,390
you can take work as joy,

780
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,280
just like that girl.

781
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,520
The decoration is costly.

782
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,840
Stop that,

783
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,000
or I will knock on you.

784
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,870
Stop.

785
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,150
I'll get it back for you.

786
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,470
What's our next step?

787
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,320
Do as planned.

788
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,470
You go to find Qiu Yuan.

789
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,430
Wait for my message.

790
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,080
Boss,

791
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,000
there comes a car.

792
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,190
It's Qin Zhiyuan.

793
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,230
Why is he here?

794
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,150
Who are you?

795
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,190
We're looking for someone.

796
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,190
The person you're looking for is not here.

797
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,190
Leave. Leave. Leave.

798
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,470
What?

799
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,800
Do we need to make an appointment

800
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,190
to go inside?

801
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,470
Open the door.

802
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,080
Since he is here, we can have a talk.

803
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,390
You go to take them in.

804
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
You asked someone to drive the container car away.

805
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,760
Open the door.

806
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,560
Mr. Qin, please.

807
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,280
Why are you here?

808
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,040
No.

809
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,430
Qin Zhiyuan?

810
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,560
My sister is caught.

811
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,600
Please save her.

812
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,040
Can you beat these guys?

813
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,710
No.

814
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,230
Use your wisdom.

815
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,840
Let go of me.

816
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,390
I can walk on my own.

817
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:28,950
What now?

818
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,360
Do as planned.

819
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,910
Be honest.

820
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Qin Zhiyuan?

821
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,840
Qin Zhiyuan! Luo Youqian!

822
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm here!

823
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,560
Yuan.

824
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,840
Get me out.

825
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Qin Zhiyuan,

826
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,000
get me out.

827
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,760
Qin Zhiyuan,

828
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,280
Don't you feel sorry about that?

829
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,470
Don't go.

830
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,470
Well...

831
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,870
You go in to have a talk.

832
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm not going in.

833
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,360
Okay.

834
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,870
What's the plan?

835
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,800
Online celebrity.

836
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,800
Have a seat.

837
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,710
We will follow your account later.

838
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,520
Boss Gao.

839
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,040
Don't keep standing.

840
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,800
Take a seat.

841
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,600
Standing

842
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,390
helps me lose weight.

843
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,360
Boss Qin,

844
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm curious about one thing.

845
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,120
You have won

846
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,320
in the matter about "Print of Fairy Peaches".

847
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,230
What do you come here for?

848
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,320
You lost, so you need to accept it.

849
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,150
Why did you catch that girl?

850
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,000
No.

851
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,710
We didn't catch her.

852
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,560
We invited her.

853
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,320
We invited her to be our exclusive block maker.

854
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,760
Boss Qin,

855
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,950
if you want to poach my employee,

856
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,040
I have a win-win method.

857
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,120
Man. Man.

858
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,630
Wake up.

859
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,710
What's going on?

860
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,630
Where's the girl?

861
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,080
Search for her.

862
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,280
What business? It's a large sum of money.

863
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,910
I want to join Yuxin Studio.

864
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,230
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.

865
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,840
In Yuxin Studio,

866
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,760
he controls me.

867
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,950
If you join our studio,

868
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,360
I will completely lose my job.

869
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,120
No, no, no.

870
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,080
Boss Gao,

871
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,670
title is not important in doing business.

872
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,670
Money is important.

873
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,150
Is that right, Boss Qin?

874
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,120
Title is not important,

875
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,470
but reputation is important.

876
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,800
Yuxin Studio does not counterfeit.

877
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,520
Yes.

878
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,150
Good faith is crucial in business.

879
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,320
I can't ruin

880
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,190
Yuxin Studio.

881
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,760
You have 30 minutes

882
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,670
to think carefully.

883
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,280
After all, the girl

884
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,710
is still in my company.

885
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,040
Your decision

886
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,670
affects her safety.

887
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:54,620
♫I chase my dreams in the dream♫

888
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:02,140
