00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,660
♫I take up a brush to paint its prime of life♫

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,260
♫The sandstorm has taken down time and tide for thousands of years♫

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,260
♫My concern in this life is to distinguish true from false♫

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,780
♫But love brought me to her♫

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,260
♫I play dumb and take only one glance under the roof♫

6
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,340
♫Every day and night lasts only a moment♫

7
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:12,180
♫I stand with her side by side and say nothing, forgetting a flashy life♫

8
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,860
♫I can't extricate myself from my worries♫

9
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,540
♫I take the brush to leave its elegance♫

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,140
♫Having the dirt washed away, the vicissitudes of life become pure♫

11
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,740
♫Let me put aside my worries♫

12
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,980
♫I draw a picture of her stroke by stroke♫

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,060
♫I take the brush to leave prosperous days♫

14
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,700
♫How can I say sweet words after having the dirt washed away♫

15
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,140
♫I paint with a bamboo hairpin on paper to set off her cheeks♫

[From Repair to Pair]
[This work is adapted from Mao Shangshu's work]

17
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,780
[Episode 4]

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,830
If you want to learn repair,

19
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,360
the institute won't be the only choice.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,480
I'll keep an eye out for a right one for you.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Thank you.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,630
What are you laughing for?

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Nothing.

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,160
Why do you come here?

25
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,440
This is a material from Mr. Zuo

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,670
about the cultural relics that will be sent back to China recently.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,600
Check it.

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,080
Well,

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,470
I proposed the establishment

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,030
of a department for cultural relics repair in China.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,440
How's it going?

32
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,390
It seems that

33
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,160
Mr. Zuo doesn't agree to it.

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,270
Why?

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,110
Mr. Zuo said that

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,960
our Institute of Antiquities

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,270
is not NGO,

38
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,670
and such a team

39
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,320
will increase our expenses,

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,630
so it's not time to do this.

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,550
I don't understand.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How much will

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,960
such a small department spend?

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,910
Can't we be public-spirited

45
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,320
and do charity

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,440
for good reputation?

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,550
Mr. Zuo wants us

48
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,190
to be unobtrusive.

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,470
You always

50
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,110
mentioned Mr. Zuo.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,080
Am I not surnamed Zuo?

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,960
Uncle asked me to come back from abroad

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,520
to establish the Institute of Antiquities

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,750
and designated you to help me with my work,

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,550
but now I even

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,720
don't have the right

57
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,110
to establish a small department.

58
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,240
How do I do my work?

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,360
Don't get shirty with me.

60
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,800
It's my duty to report to him.

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,440
You can

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
mature yourself

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
during this period

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,440
to win others' trust.

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,110
Then you'll be free.

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm not interested

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,520
in winning anyone's trust.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,270
Video watchers,

69
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,160
the last three live streams of Yuxin Studio

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,030
in this quarter will offer much benefit

71
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,030
at 10:00 a.m. this Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

72
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,800
Follow the topic about the repair master...

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah,

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,320
the Institute of Antiquities is not the only choice.

75
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,000
Then I have to badger Qin Zhiyuan.

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,360
Morning, Mr. Qin.

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,240
I brought you these.

78
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,390
Why are you here?

79
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,230
You'll do live stream today, won't you?

80
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,200
So I'm here to help you.

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
Is it time to begin?

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go.

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,390
Leave the food.

84
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,440
Then you can go.

85
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,270
Thank you.

86
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it good?

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,390
You're not an impolite man.

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,790
Stretch out your hand.

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,880
Send the breakfast earlier next time.

90
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,320
It's cold now.

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,270
See you.

92
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,230
Gao Shuo, close the door.

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
Qin Zhiyuan.

94
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,550
My money!

95
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,830
Goods here are excellent.

96
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,350
You startle my customer.

97
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,510
Stop making trouble.

98
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,390
Mr. Yuan, please patronize our studio again.

99
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,320
Please patronize our studio again.

100
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,000
Take care.

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,830
Mr. Qin.

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,230
Please bring me hotter plum drink next time.

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
Close the door.

104
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,070
Wait a minute.

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Is it hot enough this time?

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Very good.

107
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,440
Enjoy yourself in the courtyard.

108
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,950
Close the door.

109
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,390
Are you looking for me?

110
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,830
Yes.

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,550
Come earlier next time.

112
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,480
Don't keep me waiting.

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
Go to buy some Flower Shaped Shortbread Cookies again.

114
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,670
Let me teach you a lesson

115
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,390
to show my strength

116
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,640
as the head girl of the South Street.

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,550
Give off a little more smoke. Give off a little more smoke

118
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,320
to make him elegant

119
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,110
and mysterious.

120
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,830
Hurry up. Hurry up.

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't you know "a little more"?

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,920
It's too much.

123
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,600
You...

124
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,040
Gao Shuo.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,720
Gosh! Is it a fire?

126
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
Get out. Get out. Get out.

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,720
Stop.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,000
Get out. Get out. Get out.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,670
Stop.

130
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,640
Go on. Go on.

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,320
Hurry up. Hurry up.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,000
Get out. Get out.

133
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,200
What do you want to do?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,760
Me?

135
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,390
Master,

136
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,640
please don't be angry with me.

137
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,270
I'm kowtowing to you.

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,880
I was wrong.

139
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,830
Master.

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,040
Follow me.

141
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Master!

142
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,230
Master!

143
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,790
Sorry, sweets,

144
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,510
an accident suddenly happens

145
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,160
in our live stream room.

146
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,550
See you.

147
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,600
Turn it off. Turn it off.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,830
So, what do you want to do?

149
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
I...

150
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,070
Master,

151
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,510
apprentice me.

152
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
Are you threatening me?

153
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
I know I shouldn't have done this,

154
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,160
but I sincerely want to be your apprentice.

155
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
I had no choice but to do this.

156
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,200
I didn't sell

157
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,350
this painting to you that day

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,640
because

159
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
it was presented by a very important man

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
to me.

161
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,830
Only he believed that

162
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,230
I can be an excellent repairer,

163
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,110
but he passed away

164
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,600
before teaching me.

165
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,390
If you can teach me,

166
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
I'd like to share

167
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,830
this painting

168
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,270
with you.

169
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,270
Put the painting away.

170
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,110
Then,

171
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,520
how to deal with your unauthorized entry into our live stream room?

172
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,880
It's not easy for us

173
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
to operate this account.

174
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,710
If you two fail to solve it within an hour,

175
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,320
don't come and see me again.

176
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Well, I...

177
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,030
I'm sorry

178
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,150
for today's misunderstanding in the live stream room.

179
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,520
Mr. Qin Zhiyuan of Yuxin Studio

180
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,710
is not my master.

181
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,550
Out of love for the cultural relics repair,

182
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,640
I obtrusively broke in the live stream room.

183
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,320
I'm sorry

184
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,840
for the occupation of public resources.

185
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,150
I hope

186
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,150
you can support Yuxin Studio

187
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,640
and the repair master as always.

188
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,640
Thank you.

♫My concern in this life♫

190
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,460
♫to distinguish true from false♫

191
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,200
Hello, Qin.

192
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,910
Ask Qiu Yuan to go up the mountain tomorrow.

193
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,760
Remind her to get ready

194
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,590
and not to make trouble.

195
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,710
You really plan to apprentice her?

196
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,280
No.

197
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
I just give her one-month period of probation

198
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,910
to satisfy me.

199
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,760
OK, I see.

200
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,470
In this month,

201
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,470
we'll punish Qiu Yuan,

202
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,000
who was mischievous,

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,960
right?

204
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,230
OK, that's all.

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,910
Wait.

206
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,550
Do I also need to go up the mountain?

207
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,440
Bye.

208

♫...forgetting a flashy life♫

Why are you here?

214
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't realize that

215
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,030
there are always some people who are better

216
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,520
until I see how you repair cultural relics today.

217
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,790
You really think so?

218
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,880
You're a genius

219
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,910
and master!

220
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,880
Am I now

221
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,640
more awesome than you?

222
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,150
How,

223
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,110
how can I be compared with you?

224
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
From now on,

225
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,550
you're my idol

226
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,590
and master!

227
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,150
Kneel down.

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Master,

229
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
where are we going?

230
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,440
Don't call me master.

231
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
You haven't become my apprentice yet.

232
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,030
Then, how to call you?

233
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
Qin Zhiyuan.

234
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,710
Qin Zhiyuan,

235
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,520
can I ask you a question?

236
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,200
Go ahead.

237
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
Is there any supermarket ahead?

238
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,520
No.

239
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,080
Is there a convenience store in the hotel?

240
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,790
No.

241
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,200
How will we spend these days?

242
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,470
I won't live there.

243
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,230
I'll leave after driving you there.

244
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,110
Well,

245
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,030
is my room a standard room

246
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,590
or double room?

247
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,080
You're young

248
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,710
but narcissistic.

249
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,320
I should

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,550
protect myself as a girl.

251
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,400
You think too much.

252
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,280
We'll live here?

253
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,400
The road is uneven.

254
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,280
Doesn't any waiter come to pick us up?

255
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,790
This is a paper workshop

256
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,400
but not a hotel,

257
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,470
so there are not waiters.

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
How will we

259
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,590
carry the luggage?

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,150
Not us

261
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,000
but only you.

262
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,520
Qin Zhiyuan, don't go too far.

263
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,030
You can go back with Gao Shuo.

264
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,030
But this

265
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,960
fan seems heavier than me.

266
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,710
Let me call Bai.

267
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,760
The luggage is indeed too heavy.

268
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,880
I have poor reception.

269
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,030
The nearby base station breaks down.

270
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,150
You can only contact someone else

271
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,030
by shouting.

272
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,030
You're awesome.

273
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,640
I haven't seen you for several months, but you're no long single.

274
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,080
Hello, senior.

275
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,030
This is Qiu Yuan, my assistant.

276
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Hello, master's senior.

277
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm not your master.

278
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,150
Hello, uncle.

279
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,710
Girl,

280
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,880
don't call me uncle.

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,470
Otherwise, you may do something harder.

282
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,230
Got it?

283
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,400
How do you know he asked me to carry the luggage?

284
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,520
He is bad at these.

285
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,320
This is what he learnt from our master.

286
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,670
Moth (er zi), let's go.

287
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,790
He's his son (er zi)?

288
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,840
Carry the luggage. Hurry up.

289
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,320
You can ask Bai about it.

290
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm afraid Qin will punish me.

291
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,470
Well, don't you help me?

292
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,910
I can't.

293
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,230
I have to drive back.

294
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,790
Ruthless.

295
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,230
Pitiless.

296
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,590
Don't touch it.

297
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,880
You were mischievous in your childhood.

298
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,000
Can you stop mentioning my childhood?

299
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,400
What's wrong?

300
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,550
You feel embarrassed in front of the girl?

301
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,280
Actually,

302
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,000
you're too thin-skinned,

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,550
so you were single.

304
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,960
However, you perform well this time,

305
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,710
because you come with a girl.

306
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,550
You're mature.

307
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,150
You misunderstand us.

308
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,000
She wants to be my apprentice.

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,230
You know I don't want to apprentice anyone,

310
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
so I bring her here

311
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
to make her give up,

312
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,760
or else

313
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,030
I wouldn't ask her to carry my luggage.

314
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,280
You won't apprentice her

315
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,400
but still take advantage of her.

316
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,000
So heartless.

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,910
Shut up.

318
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,150
Go ahead.

319
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,640
What can I do for you?

320
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,550
I need a kind of special papers

321
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,400
for painting repair.

322
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,400
Special papers?

323
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,840
Well,

324
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
you intend to make papers for painting repair?

325
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,760
Do you forget what master taught us?

326
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,280
Why don't you cut off the head and end of the painting

327
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,230
for use?

328
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,280
I also wanted to try it.

329
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,440
Take a look.

330
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,760
It doesn't have the head and end at all.

331
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,590
Let me have a look.

332
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,000
This painting doesn't have name and inscription.

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
It's unknown,

334
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,350
but...

335
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,550
This is the paper offered for the imperial painting academy.

336
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,590
So I need such papers

337
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,790
to repair this painting.

338
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,110
How many do you need?

339
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,520
One.

340
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Go away.

341
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
How can you be so thick-skinned?

342
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,550
I won't make it for you.

343
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,840
I was kidding.

344
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,230
I'll buy all such papers you make.

345
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,440
I can't.

346
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,640
The cost of labor will be very high.

347
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,790
No matter how much the papers cost,

348
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,030
I'll pay.

349
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,880
It's not a matter of money.

350
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm short-handed.

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,640
Can't you make it alone?

352
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,110
No, I can't.

353
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,880
Where are

354
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,640
your two apprentices?

355
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,760
Don't mention it.

356
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,200
The young are unreliable.

357
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,910
They've long worked in the city.

358
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,030
Now that you can't help me, stop checking it.

359
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,760
You're annoying.

360
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,670
What do you want to do?

361
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,280
If you want me to make the papers for you,

362
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,440
no problem,

363
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,350
as long as you two can work for me,

364
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,230
but I won't give you a discount.

365
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,030
It's a deal.

366
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,550
Was he crazy? He brought so many things.

367
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,400
Luckily, I usually eat a lot of spinach.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Shrimp,

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,190
you come to see Yuan?

370
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,950
What's wrong with her?

371
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,110
She didn't answer my call

372
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,520
and is not at home.

373
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,470
Maybe she is on the subway

374
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,400
and has poor reception.

375
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
What do you come for?

376
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,430
I've got

377
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,710
the information of all the repairers

378
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,280
in Sucheng

379
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,160
and want to recommend her.

380
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,430
No need.

381
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,950
Yuan admires Qin Zhiyuan,

382
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,710
but it's a pity that he doesn't apprentice anyone.

383
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,190
Qin Zhiyuan?

384
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,000
He resolutely refused Yuan.

385
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,230
From today on,

386
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,830
we'll assist my senior.

387
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,190
You can call me Bai.

388
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,110
OK.

389
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,000
Bai,

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,590
call me if you need help.

391
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,760
Well, do you have water?

392
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,160
It's best to give me ice water.

393
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,230
Ice?

394
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,190
Well, follow me.

395
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,560
Is this OK?

396
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,000
Ice cola?

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,950
There is ice cola in such a remote place?

398
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,190
What do you mean?

399
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,280
Here is a little remote,

400
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,470
but deliverymen also come here.

401
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,040
Gosh.

402
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,710
I mean, I'm so happy

403
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,880
for being able to drink coke here.

404
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,280
I only have a guest room here.

405
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,040
How about

406
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,950
you share it?

407
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,760
You live in this room,

408
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,590
and I live with you.

409
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,760
No.

410
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,110
No need.

411
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,920
I'll sleep in the workshop,

412
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,000
and you live in it alone.

413
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,310
Good idea.

414
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,470
You're genuine.

415
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
Bai,

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can sleep in the workshop.

417
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
Are you sure?

418
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,950
Late at night,

419
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,560
in the deep mountains and forests...

420
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,190
Have you heard about Monster Black Mountain?

421
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,680
It only goes downhill at midnight.

422
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,110
Stop talking. Stop talking.

423
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,470
I'll live in this room.

424
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,710
But why do you choose to sleep in the workshop?

425
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,950
I'm afraid of him.

426
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,110
He's more horrible than Monster Black Mountain.

427
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,920
He always yelled at night.

428
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,310
His yell

429
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,310
was extremely horrible.

430
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,310
He was bewitched?

431
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,560
No.

432
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,350
A moth fell on his face.

433
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,160
You may doubt it if I don't tell you.

434
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,230
A man yelled

435
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,160
for a moth falling on his face.

436
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,040
Moth?

437
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,160
Yeah.

438
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,880
He yelled for it.

439
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,710
That's why you call him Moth.

440
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,470
Yes,

441
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,470
you're right.

442
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,070
Moth.

443
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,950
Qiu Yuan,

444
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
you're idle?

445
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm going to carry the luggage.

446
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,830
Let me help you.

447
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,760
Cook dinner after the end of carrying luggage.

448
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,560
I'm hungry.

449
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,760
Moth.

450
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,350
Late at night,

451
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,880
in the deep mountains and forests....

452
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,310
Have you heard about Monster Black Mountain?

453
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,520
What's the matter?

455
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,350
Shall we go out for a walk?

456
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,110
Why?

457
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,760
Because the air outside is very fresh.

458
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,760
No.

459
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,070
Why?

460
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,920
There are moths.

461
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,350
I take the brush to leave its elegance.

462
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,350
Having the dirt washed away,

463
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
the vicissitudes of life become pure.

464
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,560
Let me put aside my worries. I draw a picture of her...

465
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,280
A test?

466
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,800
It must be torture.

467
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,800
Mincing.

468
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,760
Relentless.

469
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,470
Pretentious.

470
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,800
Supercilious.

471
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,920
Captious.

472
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,470
Cunning.

473
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,400
Relentless.

474
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,520
It's repeated.

475
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,070
Moody.

476
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,640
Oh, no.

477
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,040
Shameless.

478
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,830
They're both sleeping.

479
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,350
I'm so industrious.

480
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,710
Morning, Qiu Yuan.

481
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,560
Morning.

482
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,400
Come and help me with some work.

483
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,160
Qin Zhiyuan,

484
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,310
why do you have dark circles?

485
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,560
Didn't you sleep well?

486
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,470
What happened?

487
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,280
There were moths in your room?

488
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,470
Did you hear anything?

489
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,040
No.

490
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,160
It's a pity.

491
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,430
Didn't you hear it?

492
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,470
Did anything happen?

493
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,520
Come on.

494
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,680
Follow me.

495
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,110
The noodles I cooked today

496
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,160
are very delicious.

497
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,830
Hey,

498
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,710
look carefully.

499
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,520
Scratch, pull and then tear.

500
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,920
Over.

501
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,470
So easy.

502
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,520
Put the wingceltis skin

503
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,310
here.

504
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,000
OK.

505
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,280
Have a try.

506
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,400
Put forth your strength.

507
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,070
It's stubborn.

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
Are you embarrassed?

509
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
No.

510
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,350
I can do it.

511
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,830
Try again.

512
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,350
Teeth. Teeth.

513
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,280
The girl you brought here

514
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,560
is so cute.

515
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,160
Look. She is biting it.

516
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,070
I'm sorry.

517
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,830
I didn't expect that this assistant

518
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,760
can be so stupid.

519
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,640
You both learnt the skills,

520
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,040
while I do this for the first time.

521
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,640
What's more,

522
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,520
I've also succeeded.

523
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,470
What?

524
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,880
I've torn a piece down.

525
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,560
Look.

526
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,430
Stay away from me.

527
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm afraid I'll sprinkle tea on you.

528
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,520
Bug Qin.

529
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,470
What did you call me?

530
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,880
I said,

531
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,640
Mr. Qin.

532
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,280
Wait for me.

533
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,710
I'll peel it for you soon.

534
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,590
Listen to me.

535
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,920
Just apprentice her.

536
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,950
She is as cute

537
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,230
as a pet.

538
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
You can apprentice her.

539
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,830
Don't be proud.

540
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,520
Actually,

541
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
she is just ignorant.

542
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,950
After staying here for some days,

543
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,040
she must know there are always some people

544
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,920
who are better.

545
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,000
For example, I'm better than you.

546
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,680
Come out to work.

547
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm teaching you again.

548
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,640
Tear the skin slowly. Tear the skin slowly.

549
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,560
Well, listen to me.

550
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,470
Come on. Tear it skillfully.

551
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,040
Come on.

552
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,310
Slowly. Yes.

553
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,520
Come on. Come on.

554
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,230
Try to tear it gently.

555
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,880
Gently. Slowly. Slowly.

556
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,000
Look.

557
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,430
I do it!

558
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,640
Bai,

559
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,830
you're awesome.

560
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,800
Actually, I'm bad

561
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,950
at everything,

562
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,830
except teaching students.

563
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,710
Look.

564
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,230
I've peeled it.

565
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,310
Under Bai's guidance,

566
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,640
I've learnt it,

567
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,000
but you said that I'm stupid.

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,640
Now that you've learnt this skill,

569
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,070
go to learn the next step.

570
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,880
Fill the reservoir with water.

571
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,110
Where can I fetch water?

572
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,000
On the mountain.

573
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,800
Wait a minute.

574
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,470
Isn't that a well?

575
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,110
I want to use the water on the mountain.

576
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,190
You mean,

577
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,590
I need to go to carry water as the ancient did?

578
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,040
In the courtyard,

579
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,800
there is a big bucket for the modern.

580
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,000
Stop kidding.

581
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,190
You must go to the spring

582
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,040
marked by big bricks.

583
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,040
Its water is the best.

584
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,430
She is very good.

585
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Apprentice her.

586
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,680
Insincere and pompous.

587
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
Where can I fetch mountain spring water for him?

588
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,920
If I can do it,

589
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,400
I'll open a mineral water plant

590
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,560
but am not here

591
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,160
to work for him.

592
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,590
Are you regretful?

593
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,710
Don't you think you went too far?

594
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,760
How could you ask a girl

595
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,160
to fill the reservoir with water?

596
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,310
Our master

597
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,800
always asked us to do this,

598
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,230
and she's an adult.

599
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,430
But you won't apprentice her.

600
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,800
Why did you stump her?

601
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,920
To piss her off.

602
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm helping her

603
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,760
to give up

604
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
Why didn't I find that

605
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,040
you can be so unreasonable?

606
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,590
So,

607
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,560
no wonder you're single.

608
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,110
No wonder I'm single.

609
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,350
I'm better than someone

610
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,230
who hides on the mountain

611
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,830
and dares not go out due to love hurts.

612
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,280
I don't hide on the mountain.

613
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,040
I just pursue freedom.

614
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,280
Before my network was down,

615
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,520
many netizens begged me for offline meeting.

616
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,310
Yeah.

617
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,400
Unlike us,

618
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,830
you can't enjoy yourself

619
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,920
at a campfire party at all.

620
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,560
Where is it?

621
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,400
Red bricks?

622
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,160
Oh, no.

623
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,520
There is a little water here.

624
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,800
How long can I fill this bucket?

625
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,950
The network has been down for so many days.

626
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,680
Hundreds of thousands of fans

627
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
are still waiting for me to do live stream.

628
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
They must be very anxious.

629
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
You only show your hands.

630
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,680
There is too much room for imagination.

631
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,000
It's unreliable.

632
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,310
Actually,

633
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,710
someone indeed recognized my hands

634
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,800
and even wants to be my apprentice.

635
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,920
Qiu Yuan?

636
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,520
Moth,

637
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,760
it's unbelievable.

638
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,230
You met netizens?

639
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,680
Can you stop calling me Moth?

640
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,880
It disgraces you in front of a girl, right?

641
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,230
OK, I won't call you Moth.

642
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,830
It has nothing to do with her.

643
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,590
I'm an adult,

644
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,560
but you always mentioned what happened in my childhood.

645
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,400
It's boring.

646
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,280
If I don't call you Moth,

647
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,350
what should I call you?

648
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,400
Mud?

649
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't think that

650
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,590
I can't still defeat you in wrestling now.

651
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,920
Are you sure?

652
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,040
Come on.

653
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,680
Are you convinced?

654
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,160
No!

655
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,160
Are you convinced?

656
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,070
Oh, no. Oh, no.

657
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,680
I can't go on waiting here, or else I'll be embarrassed.

658
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,230
It may be filled when I come back.

659
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,350
Be good.

660
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,230
Wait for me.

661
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,470
It was not my fault.

662
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,640
I had stopped,

663
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,000
but you pounced on me again.

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,280
Don't argue about it.

665
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,040
You cheat.

666
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,590
I cheat?

667
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,230
Cheat is also a part of tactics.

668
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,070
Understand?

669
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,760
Give me a piece of clean clothes.

670
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,590
I'm dirty.

671
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,760
Here you are.

672
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,040
What's the matter?

673
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,350
I help you?

674
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,710
Get out.

675
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,350
Close the door.

676
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,760
Hello.

677
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,190
Girl.

678
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,710
Excuse me, where is the nearby shop?

679
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,070
Shop?

680
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes.

681
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,920
There is not any shop near.

682
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,950
Then, where can I buy sanitary,

683
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,800
toilet paper near?

684
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,520
You have to go to the town.

685
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,430
The town?

686
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,040
How far is it?

687
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
How long can I get there?

688
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,880
My wife happens to be in the town,

689
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
and I'm going to pick her up.

690
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,160
How about I take you there?

691
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,880
Really?

692
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,110
Thank you very much.

693
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,590
You are welcome.

694
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,070
Get on.

695
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,880
OK.

696
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,000
We're now in the town.

697
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,110
This is a supermarket.

698
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,280
OK.

699
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,560
-I'll go back with my wife... -Thank you.

700
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,560
...later.

701
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,760
If you want to hitch a lift,

702
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,800
you can wait for me here.

703
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,280
OK.

704
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Thank you.

705
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,040
OK.

706
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
I have strong reception.

707
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,760
I want to recommend you to some repairers.

708
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,160
When can we go to meet them?

709
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,520
Where are you?

710
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,830
Why didn't you answer my call?

711
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,520
Yuan, where are you?

712
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,430
Yuan,

713
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,830
did you elope with a man?

714
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,230
Cousin, what happened to you?

715
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,400
Call back when you see my messages.

716
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,190
Yuan,

717
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,830
what happened to you?

718
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,230
Why didn't you

719
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,710
go back home last night?

720
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,520
You stayed out all night.

721
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,680
Where are you?

722
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,400
How do you know I stayed out all night?

723
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,520
You went to my house again?

724
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,160
Yeah.

725
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,070
You, you were out,

726
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,520
so I had to mind your house.

727
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,470
It's my duty as your cousin.

728
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,830
Actually,

729
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,230
Qin Zhiyuan took me

730
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,400
to a paper workshop,

731
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,950
so I had poor reception.

732
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,310
What?

733
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,230
Qin Zhiyuan?

734
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,350
Why did you stay together?

735
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,430
What's your feeling

736
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,110
of staying with the master?

737
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,680
Now I'm even inferior

738
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,760
to a maid in the TV.

739
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,880
I'm obsequious

740
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,190
and obedient.

741
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,950
He even gave me

742
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,680
a one-month assessment period.

743
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,640
Only after I satisfy him

744
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,190
can he apprentice me.

745
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,800
It doesn't matter, Yuan.

746
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,070
You'll succeed.

747
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,830
Come on.

748
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,400
Of course I'll succeed.

749
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,070
I'm going to hang up.

750
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,350
Remember to do the cleaning for me.

751
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,710
Don't worry.

752
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,190
OK. OK.

753
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,310
Why didn't you tell Qiu Yuan that

754
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,590
I broke her plate?

755
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,560
I even didn't tell her that

756
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
you almost burnt her kitchen,

757
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,830
let alone the minor thing that

758
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,350
you broke a plate.

759
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,830
We can't go on like this.

760
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,760
We always date in your cousin's house

761
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,110
and make trouble for her.

762
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,350
I also think so,

763
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,310
but you worry that your mother will see us

764
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,280
when we're out for playing.

765
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,070
Your mother can't move in an instant,

766
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,320
she can't be everywhere.

767
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,280
Youqian,

768
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,840
this Sunday is my mother's birthday.

769
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,190
Don't you want to go?

770
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,080
Of course I'll go.

771
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,560
What does your mother like?

772
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,520
I'll prepare it.

773
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,430
Love?

774
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:33,870
Shrimp,

775
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,670
you called me?

776
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,150
I was on the mountain

777
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,120
and had poor reception.

778
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,950
Why did you go to the mountain?

779
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,600
I even didn't see you in your house.

780
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,520
You went to my house?

781
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:44,910
Yes.

782
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,560
I collected the information of all the repairers

783
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,870
in Sucheng for you

784
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,710
and wanted to find a chance to recommend you.

785
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,710
Shrimp,

786
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,800
thank you.

787
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,760
I...

788
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,190
You, you

789
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,150
should tell me early.

790
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,190
Now I'm on the mountain for being an apprentice.

791
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,630
My spirit almost frees itself from my body.

792
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,670
You're on the mountain for being an apprentice?

793
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,670
Yes.

794
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,600
The repair master I admire

795
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,840
comes to the mountain for papermaking,

796
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,950
so I was brought here

797
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,120
without rhyme or reason.

798
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,230
Well,

799
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,950
I can peel wingceltis today.

800
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,840
Make papers on the mountain?

801
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,470
It seems to be called Mount Qingfeng.

802
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm going to hang up

803
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,600
for paying the bill.

804
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,840
I'll call you when I have strong reception.

805
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:31,910
Don't worry.

806
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,150
I'm safe here.

807
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,150
I'm hanging up. Bye.

808
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,870
Grandma, how much are these?

809
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,710
Mount Qingfeng.

810
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,560
Mount Qingfeng.

811
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,840
What's going on ahead?

812
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,670
Let me go and have a look.

813
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,670
Sir,

814
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,870
what's going on ahead?

815
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,080
A truck overturned ahead.

816
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,040
It overturned in front of me.

817
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,950
The driver was just sent away.

818
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,950
The road has been blocked for an hour,

819
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,150
but we don't know how to do.

820
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,760
Alas.

821
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,360
It's terrible. It's terrible.

822
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,950
There was an accident ahead.

823
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,630
Is the driver OK?

824
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,840
The driver is OK,

825
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,800
but the truck overturned,

826
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,430
and the road is blocked.

827
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
When will the road be accessible?

828
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,320
It's unknown.

829
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,230
We have no choice.

830
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,080
Just wait.

831
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,760
Moth, I'm going to cook dinner.

832
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,760
Why hasn't your apprentice come back yet?

833
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,710
Qiu Yuan.

834
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,870
Qiu Yuan.

835
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,190
You bought so many delicious snacks.

836
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,150
Let me see.

837
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Chips.

838
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,360
I like this.

839
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,000
I also like this.

840
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,710
You bought so many delicious snacks,

841
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,320
so I'll take out my treasured wine.

842
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,430
OK.

843
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,870
I'm going to ice the beers.

844
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,430
I also bought self-heating hot pots.

845
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,950
We live on the mountain,

846
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,430
but we can still

847
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,600
enjoy ourselves.

848
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,390
Qin Zhiyuan, you are back.

849
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,470
Look.

850
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,710
I bought you an insect repellent.

851
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,230
If you use it before going up the mountain,

852
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,670
you must be safe,

853
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,760
and all flying insects will stay away from you.

854
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Spray. Spray. Spray.

855
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,600
Where did you go?

856
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,600
Why are your clothes wet?

857
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,470
Where did you go?

858
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,150
I went

859
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,040
to buy daily necessities.

860
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,280
I went to the town.

861
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
I thought I would be back

862
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,630
within an hour,

863
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,280
but unexpectedly,

864
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,800
there was a traffic accident ahead,

865
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,360
and the road was blocked,

866
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,120
so I came back late.

867
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Is the road accessible now?

868
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,670
Yes.

869
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,910
Otherwise I'm not here.

870
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,040
Then you can go.

871
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,470
Where do I go?

872
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,120
You left the bucket

873
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,080
beside the spring

874
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,760
and went shopping in the town without telling us.

875
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,000
You're impolite,

876
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,630
irresponsible and bad-mannered.

877
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,430
We don't need to waste

878
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,470
each other's time.

879
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,190
Go.

880
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,280
I really had something urgent to do.

881
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,390
What's urgent?

882
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,320
Is it urgent to buy self-heating hot pots?

883
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
What are you doing?

884
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,430
You're serious.

885
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,600
I was hungry,

886
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,840
so I asked Qiu Yuan to go shopping.

887
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,670
Today, we have so many delicious dishes,

888
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,430
and I even take out my good wine.

889
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,870
Have dinner.

890
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:29,910
Listen to me.

891
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,840
Have dinner now.

892
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Have dinner. Have dinner. Have dinner.

893
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,760
You go to get changed

894
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,320
and then have dinner.

895
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,520
Hurry up. Hurry up.

896
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,390
Don't appear in front of me again tomorrow.

897
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,320
He is such a man.

898
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,150
Come on.

899
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,630
Have dinner. Have dinner.

900
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,390
Ignore him.

901
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,950
Don't spoil the fun.

902
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,120
I'm going to fill the reservoir.

903
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,120
You fill the reservoir

904
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,320
so late?

905
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,470
It's dangerous.

906
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,560
Cook the wingceltis skin before leaving.

907
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,520
How long can the wingceltis skin be cooked?

908
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,560
A day and a night.

909
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,800
A day and a night.

910
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,910
Qiu Yuan,

911
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
do it tomorrow.

912
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,320
Let me go on doing it for a while.

913
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,710
It doesn't matter.

914
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,230
Leave me alone.

915
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,470
You go to bed.

916
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,910
OK.

917
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,120
You go to bed early.

918
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,760
Do you know you're disturbing others?

919
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,870
I'm sorry.

920
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,630
I'll lower the sound.

921
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,560
I really have try best to lower the sound.

922
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,840
The wingceltis skin shouldn't be cooked in this way.

923
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,670
Your stir

924
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,670
is a disservice.

925
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,430
Do you dislike me very much?

926
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,800
Is everything I do

927
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,710
wrong in your eyes?

928
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,470
No.

929
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,470
I just dislike those who think themselves smart

930
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,150
and hold nothing in awe.

931
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,470
How could you say I have no awe for cultural relics repair?

932
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,320
How could you say I think myself smart?

933
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,190
I'm eager to learn cultural relics repair,

934
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,710
but you don't want to teach me.

935
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,600
You are arrogant and domineering.

936
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,520
You always prevent me

937
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,710
from learning cultural relics repair

938
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,950
by obscure truths.

939
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,870
You are the most annoying person.

940
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,660
♫I chase my dreams in the dream♫

941
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:58,380
