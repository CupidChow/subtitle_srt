00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,500
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,490
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,040
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,780
You finally achieved your dream.

10
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,390
You don't have to go back in there.

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,390
Pardon?

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,190
Chief Manager Choe Sa Ra,

13
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,960
you're fired.

14
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,460
 - What was that?
 - What did she say? 

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,510
Attorney Han.

16
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,390
Whoa.

17
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,580
 Divorce Team's Manager Choe Sa Ra was fired for violating articles 25 and 26 of company policies. 

18
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,250
Whoa, it's daebak.

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,090
No way.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,230
I was right, wasn't I?

21
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,940
- Seriously.
 - What did I say?

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,350
I told you I'm right!

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,040
- She's so brazen.
 - My goodness.

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,190
 Case 07: In the Name of a Mother 

25
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,850
 Attorney Jeong Wu Jin 

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,360
 Divorce Team's Manager Choe Sa Ra was fired for violating articles 25 and 26 of company policies. 

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,010
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong wrongfully terminated me.

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,880
I came to ask if you agree with her, Attorney Jeong.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,310
Manager Choe, you satisfied our company's termination policies.

30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,450
So the executives unanimously agreed to dismiss you.

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,870
Thanks for your work. You may leave.

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,780
I'll make an issue of this wrongful termination!

33
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
I'll go to the Department of Labor right away!

34
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,910
Sure, go ahead.

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,280
Your feelings for Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong are no different from mine.

36
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,090
Don't pretend to be superior.

37
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,470
For a person who has worked ten years at a law firm, you are sorely lacking in the legal mindset.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,550
A person's internal attitude is legally evaluated only if it is expressed in behavior.

39
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,140
Just because a person starts having some feelings,

40
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,680
not everyone lives like you.

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,780
Come to your senses.

42
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,220
This is Cha Eun Gyeong's business, not yours.

43
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,940
You'll get hurt at this rate.

44
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,590
You've made it my business.

45
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,730
You said I'm her office husband.

46
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,800
How unfortunate.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,890
You and I have worked together for ten years,

48
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,540
so did you have to do this?

49
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,430
As you probably know well,

50
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,450
love is like a car accident.

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,520
You can't avoid it.

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,180
It was an accident for Cha Eun Gyeong and Kim Jae Hui to have met someone like you.

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,760
Spend the rest of your life begging for their forgiveness.

54
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,870
Is there anything else you want to hear?

55
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,580
If you don't, get out of here now.

56
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,460
Seonbae, you didn't sign off on the performance review file.

57
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,660
What do you want to do about Choe Sa Ra?

58
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,060
- I'm thinking about it.
 - You gave her a perfect score.

59
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,840
Because she's good at her job.

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,400
I need to be professional about this.

61
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,050
In my opinion, you're not being professional if you don't fire her.

62
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,190
What do you mean by that?

63
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,700
I guess you forgot, but I'm a partner of this firm.

64
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,550
I also am an executive for the Divorce Team's personnel along with you.

65
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,110
But, according to company policy article 25, Choe Sa Ra

66
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,390
diminished the company's stature through an illegal act

67
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,970
and externally impugned the honor of company executives

68
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,790
according to article 26.

69
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,830
She should've been fired a long time ago.

70
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,580
I know.

71
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,370
I just needed to review to see if it was a just consequence.

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,260
- What in the world?
 - See? I told you it was100% her.

73
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,790
I thought it couldn't possibly be.

74
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,490
It's crazy how she came to work all this time with such thick skin.

75
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,430
Attorney Cha was the angel here.

76
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,220
I would've ended her right away if it were me.

77
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,090
 Episode 7 

78
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,020
The coffee tastes great, and the weather is great, too.

79
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,660
I mean, I feel so great now that Choe Sa Ra has been let go.

80
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,710
That's why you don't mess with the CEO's nephew.

81
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,840
"Office husband"? She should've been ready to get fired since then.

82
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,910
H-Hey, hold on now.

83
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,010
What are you saying?

84
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,270
Attorney Jeong is the CEO's nephew?

85
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,340
Yes. Why? Didn't you know?

86
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,940
You really didn't know?

87
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,590
Han Yu Ri, are you the last one to hear the news again?

88
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,760
There's hardly anyone who doesn't know this at work.

89
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,080
 From this moment on, you mustn't let others find out about your feelings. 

90
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,960
-  What feelings?
 - Your feeling of deep love for Attorney Cha. 

91
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,150
 So you won't do her harm... 

92
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,040
 I hope you won't think I'm crossing the line as a hoobae. 

93
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,230
 Because I'm speaking as Cha Eun Gyeong's representative. 

94
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,040
Gosh, I really didn't know.

95
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,170
Why didn't anyone tell me?

96
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,050
I heard that Attorney Jeong will be inheriting our company.

97
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,540
What?

98
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,570
Why? What is it? Did you do something wrong?

99
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,370
- It's nothing.
 - Come on and tell me.

100
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,500
I have an appointment at 2:00 p.m. Where's Attorney Cha's office?

101
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,010
Oh, I see. It's the last office down the hall.

102
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,050
Thank you.

103
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,350
Yu Ri!

104
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,430
 Hello. 

105
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,810
 This is Senior Manager Kim from work. You know her, right? 

106
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,910
 See you tomorrow. 

107
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,790
 We're not close enough to contact each other, are we? 

108
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,650
 What are you doing here right now? 

109
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,500
Attorney Jeon, you go on ahead.

110
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,460
O-Okay.

111
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,310
How have you been?

112
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,910
I was so happy to see you on TV.

113
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,500
Your dad must be so proud of you in heaven.

114
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,810
Don't even talk about Dad in front of me.

115
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,840
Are you still mad like a child?

116
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,880
Why on earth did you come here?

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,870
Where do you think this is?

118
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,560
I came for a consultation with Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

119
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,010
You didn't forget what you did, right?

120
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,710
And what about it?

121
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,470
Shouldn't your workplace also be aware of

122
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,790
what you did to me?

123
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,410
Does Yu Ri get along at work?

124
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,350
Are you Attorney Han Yu Ri's acquaintance?

125
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,690
Yes, we're quite close.

126
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,770
I'm her auntie.

127
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,720
Oh, you're Attorney Han's auntie?

128
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,310
I'm more or less her auntie since her dad got a divorce and lived with me,

129
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,830
though Yu Ri hates me.

130
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,760
Sorry?

131
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,090
By the way, you really don't age, Attorney Cha.

132
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,610
How are you still the same when ten years have passed?

133
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,910
- When did you see me? 
- Gosh!

134
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,140
How can you forget your past client?

135
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,900
I mean, you take the most cases in our country.

136
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,540
Past client?

137
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,520
Doesn't "home wrecker" ring a bell?

138
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,200
 Eight years ago 

139
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
You're a home wrecker!

140
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,030
I don't think my past client came by to ask how I'm doing.

141
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,040
Why did you come to see me?

142
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,320
I found it while preparing to move.

143
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,860
I couldn't find it for years.

144
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,960
 Gift Agreement: I, Han Myeong Jong, give all my assets to Kim Hui Ra at the time of my death. 

145
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,850
You're saying Attorney Han Yu Ri's father wrote this himself, right?

146
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,350
That's what I'm saying.

147
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,170
Even though I have the agreement,

148
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,230
Han Yu Ri and her mom are shamelessly living in that home as if they own the place.

149
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,690
This doesn't have any legal effect because it's not in a proper form.

150
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,370
I don't know about legal stuff. Yu Ri's mom said she'll give it.

151
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,880
So much time has passed, but she won't keep her promise and just doesn't care.

152
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm sure Yu Ri's manipulating her mom.

153
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,890
Why did you bother coming to me?

154
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,540
You seemed to be fond of her since you came out on TV together.

155
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,390
Do you know what Yu Ri did to me?

156
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm not interested.

157
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,290
She put on a one-person protest in front of my workplace.

158
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,910
 Please read this. 

159
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,530
 There's an adulterer couple who work here. 

160
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,570
 Young lady, you can't do this here. 

161
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,150
 Excuse me! Please read this. 

162
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,290
 - You can't do this here. 
- There's an adulterer couple who work here. 

163
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,270
 - Please read this once!
 - You can't do this. 

164
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,540
 There's an adulterer couple who work here. 

165
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,200
 You can't do this here. 

166
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,040
 Ahjumma. Ahjumma, this is about you. 

167
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,180
 This— Ahjumma, why are you avoiding me? Why are you running away? 

168
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,700
 Excuse me! Please read this just once! 

169
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,600
 Stop this. 

170
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,050
 Instead of respecting the person her dad lived with, 

171
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,910
 she made a scene at my workplace every day to destroy me. 

172
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,570
So, what happened?

173
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,990
I got fired.

174
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,890
I used to earn 50 million won a year.

175
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,600
But I became a mistress overnight at my workplace,

176
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
got fired, and became jobless.

177
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Yu Ri even got her own dad fired as well.

178
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,000
So?

179
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,230
What's with your attitude toward your past client?

180
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,670
Because the contract ended.

181
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,980
She made it seem like it was all my fault that her dad fell in love with me.

182
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,430
She's a terrible wench.

183
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,010
Someone like her shouldn't be practicing law,

184
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,700
especially at a big law firm like this one.

185
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,750
The time is up now, so please leave.

186
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,830
I'll refund your consultation fee.

187
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,540
I'll make a suggestion.

188
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,060
Fire Han Yu Ri immediately.

189
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,600
It's not hard for a big company like this to dismiss her, right?

190
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,390
- Why should I?
 - If you don't fire her,

191
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,710
I'll do the same thing Han Yu Ri did, so brace yourself.

192
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,050
Many people pass by in front of this place.

193
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,860
I'll bring a truck to protest there, so fire her right now.

194
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,870
Oh, and please tell Yu Ri this.

195
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,550
Tell her to transfer the ownership of that house to me by the end of this month,

196
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,450
just as her dad promised.

197
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,280
Don't take me lightly.

198
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,740
I'll be back in a few days.

199
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,740
Yu Ri, I'm going.

200
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,500
I'll see you again.

201
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,270
 Emergency Contact 

202
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,010
Attorney Cha, why did that woman come here?

203
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,520
I don't think I can tell you because you're an interested party.

204
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,900
Let's be professional.

205
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:54,240
Did that woman say she's my dad's mistress?

206
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,980
She said she's your auntie.

207
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,880
"Auntie"? That crazy—

208
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,890
Did you take her case even after hearing that?

209
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,150
It'll need some more review.

210
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,750
Attorney Cha, even if taking cases is important, I think this is wrong.

211
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,670
What's wrong with it?

212
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,420
I'm working on your divorce case right now,

213
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,960
so how can you do this to me?

214
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,350
Attorney Han, don't ever open up your own office.

215
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,510
You've always got a reason to turn down a case.

216
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,630
You'll starve to death if you open up your own business.

217
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,100
 Application 

218
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,570
 Relationship: Mother / Name: Kim Gyeong Suk / Phone Number: 010-0251-3528 

219
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,230
You became my daughter's supervisor at work?

220
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,270
What an odd turn of events.

221
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,700
I found out only today that you were the other party in my case.

222
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,830
Why did you want to see me without Yu Ri knowing?

223
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,890
Did my daughter make a mistake?

224
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,470
Ms. Kim Hui Ra came to see me.

225
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,400
What did you say?

226
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,480
She robbed 300 million won from me,

227
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,460
but she went there because it wasn't enough?

228
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,820
Three hundred million won?

229
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,600
Did she blackmail you with that ridiculous memorandum?

230
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,230
Why did you give her the money when it has no legal effect?

231
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,300
A gift causa mortis only has an effect if it is in proper form.

232
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,810
I know because Yu Ri told me.

233
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,050
But what's the use if it has no legal effect?

234
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,460
She kept threatening me to go to Yu Ri's workplace.

235
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,250
Is Yu Ri okay?

236
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,270
I sent her back without an issue.

237
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,790
You still shouldn't have given her money.

238
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,460
Yu Ri had done picketing and

239
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,140
she said she was fired and can't even make a living.

240
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,100
She said she'd get her revenge if my daughter got a job.

241
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,450
And she came to me right away after seeing Yu Ri on TV.

242
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:21,040
She said she'd never bring that up again if I gave her the money.

243
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,910
Even so.

244
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,450
That woman was the one at fault. Why did you give her 300 million won?

245
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,830
 Your Honor, please protect my family. 

246
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:38,180
I heard the laws don't accept a divorce request from the one who cheated.

247
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm correct, right?

248
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,360
This family is already broken.

249
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,600
Even if the request is denied,

250
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,690
the plaintiff has no plan to go back home.

251
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,270
So why don't you just agree to divorce?

252
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,900
Attorney, aren't you married?

253
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,570
It's not something you can decide so easily if you have a child.

254
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,590
Your Honor, this is so unfair!

255
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,870
If I divorce like this, what about my daughter?

256
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,800
Honey, please reconsider for Yu Ri's sake.

257
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,680
I'll do better. Please?

258
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,910
Can't you understand the issue at hand?

259
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,070
This isn't about being fair or not.

260
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,890
The plaintiff wants a divorce, and the defendant has no property to her name.

261
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,020
Without divorce, there can't be any division of property.

262
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,350
So, get a divorce and divide up the assets, too.

263
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,060
I'm saying let's settle in a way that's a win-win for both.

264
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,640
Your Honor...

265
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,660
how can the laws be like this?

266
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,840
Even if he cheated on me and abandoned his family,

267
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,810
are you saying I should just divorce if I want a division of property?

268
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,820
You shouldn't approach this so emotionally.

269
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,300
Who'd acknowledge you for not agreeing to a divorce when he wants it?

270
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,860
Please live your life.

271
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,540
 Kim Gyeong Suk 

272
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,980
 Kim Gyeong Suk 

273
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,320
 "That woman was the one at fault." 

274
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,940
It feels odd to hear that coming from you, Attorney.

275
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,510
Did you defend her because you didn't know that back then?

276
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,590
That's what an attorney does.

277
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,520
I only did my job.

278
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,280
You really shouldn't have resolved it so emotionally. It's too bad.

279
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,070
You're looking at me like I'm a pathetic fool again, like back then.

280
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,140
In this world, not everyone is as strong as you.

281
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,210
How do you feel now that it's become your problem?

282
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,150
Is it easy to divorce when you think about your daughter?

283
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,770
My Yu Ri was only a senior in high school.

284
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,950
Don't you think it's karma?

285
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,850
 Are you saying you wouldn't have divorced if it weren't for me? 

286
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,300
That could've been the case.

287
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,100
I was in court because the other person was in the wrong.

288
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,310
I wouldn't have had to feel such shame, at the very least.

289
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,730
You never let me visit, so why did you want me to come over?

290
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,200
- Mom. 
- Yes?

291
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,020
You remember how Senior Manager Kim wanted our house, right?

292
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes. Of course.

293
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,150
She hasn't contacted you again since then, right?

294
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,820
Of course not.

295
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,570
But why do you care about that?

296
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,780
That's between your dad and me. Don't worry about it.

297
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,880
You didn't keep in touch with that woman since then, right?

298
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,720
Aigoo, of course not!

299
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,330
Nothing's going on with you, right?

300
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,680
Does that woman contact you and stuff?

301
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,110
Gosh, I let her know what would happen if she messes with me.

302
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,350
Would she dare to contact me? She can't.

303
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,850
Of course.

304
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,310
So, stop worrying about those things

305
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,740
and meet a man and start your own family now.

306
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,170
Hurry up and eat.

307
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,950
The bulgogi came out so nice and tender.

308
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:17,140
Oh, that's right. I met your coworker at the elevator earlier.

309
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,430
She bought tons of groceries.

310
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,720
How can a young lady be so sweet?

311
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,100
She said she was cooking for her fiancé, so I told her my signature abalone porridge recipe.

312
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,200
Gosh, for goodness sake, seriously.

313
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,760
Gosh, what a way to talk to your mom.

314
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,900
That woman is the mistress in Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's case!

315
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,230
Oh, my. The secretary in the tabloids?

316
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,620
Yes.

317
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,570
My goodness. What a bitch. My gosh...

318
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,890
So please distance yourself from that woman.

319
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,350
You can't tell from one's looks.

320
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,020
Don't trust anyone, please.

321
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,100
Seriously. You can't trust anyone in this world.

322
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,680
How could she? At the same workplace?

323
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,230
Jae Hui?

324
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,360
 How do you feel now that it's become your problem? 

325
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,390
 Is it easy to divorce when you think about your daughter? 

326
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,440
 You should also reflect on yourself, Attorney. 

327
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,900
 We can't let the world become a place where 

328
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,610
 even the guilty can bark as long as they hire an attorney. 

329
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,210
 Little Prince 

330
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,820
It's all done.

331
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,550
Try it.

332
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,690
How does it taste?

333
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,930
- It's totally...
 - Yes.

334
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,720
not good.

335
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,650
Gosh, Kim Jae Hui, seriously.

336
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,110
I'm kidding. It's not bad.

337
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,660
- Just put some cheese instead of ketchup next time. 
 - Yes.

338
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,970
Dad always made it with cheese.

339
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,740
Jae Hui, give me the list of school events for this semester.

340
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,860
I'll leave my schedule completely free on those days. Okay?

341
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,280
Mom, I don't make the list of school events.

342
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,740
They show up automatically if you install the app.

343
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,510
Oh, right. That's right.

344
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,100
Since Dad's not here anymore, I'll make sure to check the alerts every day.

345
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,510
You'll also make breakfast every day from now on, right?

346
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,330
Of course. Send me a text of what you want to eat the night before.

347
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,620
I'll try everything.

348
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,720
Thanks.

349
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,270
Yu Ri said she also went through what I went through.

350
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,350
Yu Ri? Han Yu Ri?

351
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,080
Yes, Yu Ri's dad also met another woman besides her mom.

352
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,880
She said it still troubles her heart.

353
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,090
Well, that's what I heard.

354
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,400
You can't legally request alimony for your dad's adultery, huh?

355
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,730
That's what upset her the most.

356
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,160
She told you such a thing?

357
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,680
I can hang out with Yu Ri from time to time, right?

358
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,700
Of course.

359
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,590
Whoa, it's delicious.

360
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,540
We're stuck together 24/7 from now on, huh?

361
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,930
You've been waiting for the promotion all this time. You must be so upset.

362
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,060
It's okay.

363
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,550
I can be with you all day.

364
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,620
This is also one of the things I've been dreaming about.

365
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,940
You had to leave early in the evening because of Jae Hui,

366
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,110
and I had to go back to the office during the day.

367
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,040
We couldn't even go on a proper date, afraid someone might see us.

368
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,060
Right.

369
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,860
Oh, right. I met Jae Hui and

370
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,870
Eun Gyeong told Jae Hui that you and I weren't together.

371
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,880
So, you should also keep the secret.

372
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,750
I can't believe that.

373
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,380
I'm sure Cha Eun Gyeong would've made you an evil person to Jae Hui.

374
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,850
That's never the case.

375
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,660
You wouldn't know because you're not a parent.

376
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,990
Really?

377
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,410
I'm glad if that's the case.

378
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,460
What did you do with Jae Hui?

379
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,290
I showed her how her room was decorated.

380
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,650
She liked it.

381
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,260
When are you going to take me?

382
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,030
The attorney said you should refrain from going there.

383
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,530
You can never come there.

384
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,470
Let's eat.

385
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,930
- Whoa, what's this?
 - Whoa.

386
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,580
- What's this?
 - What is that?

387
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,900
All right, everyone. Jae Hui's mom sent us some snacks.

388
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,100
- Daebak!
 -   Whoa! 

389
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,710
We'll start class five minutes late, so enjoy!

390
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,620
 Yay! 

391
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,440
- It looks delicious!
 - It looks good!

392
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,690
Isn't this croissant from Gangnam Pastries?

393
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,560
Jae Hui's mom is so classy! Whoa!

394
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,340
- Teacher!
 - Yes, Jae Hui.

395
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,320
Did my mom stop by in person?

396
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,940
No, it was delivered.

397
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,610
- Go have some.
 - Okay.

398
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,880
Do I need to spell this out for her, too?

399
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,430
I told her to come in person.

400
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,900
What's this?

401
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,180
It's my vanity.

402
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,090
Doing makeup in the bathroom is so uncomfortable for women.

403
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,970
Sir, where should I put it?

404
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,550
- Please put it in the small room over— 
- Stop. Hold on.

405
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,050
Sir, I'm sorry, but we'll return this.

406
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,540
Why did you do that?

407
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,810
What do you mean why?

408
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,990
It's because I need a vanity I can use.

409
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,380
You know the family investigation will begin soon.

410
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,620
You also know if the court finds women's things during the custody investigation,

411
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,380
I'll be at a disadvantage. Why are you doing this?

412
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,300
It's called a vanity, but it's just a mirror and a drawer!

413
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,730
It's not necessarily women's things.

414
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,880
Do I have to run around in circles with you, too?

415
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,940
This is tiring.

416
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,110
Don't you think you're not giving me assurance?

417
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,020
Am I even going to be living here

418
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,470
after we get the verdict?

419
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,470
Live here? The three of us?

420
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,900
You didn't think about it, huh?

421
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,940
Sa Ra, we're lovers,

422
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,110
but I never considered remarrying.

423
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,340
I'm sorry if you were confused, but I must make it clear now.

424
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,660
You always said you wanted to get a divorce and live with me.

425
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,280
Didn't you want to leave Cha Eun Gyeong and live with me?

426
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,090
I've already failed at marriage once. Would I want to marry again?

427
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,250
What about me, then? I never got to marry.

428
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,920
Am I being too greedy for wanting to be happy with my lover whom I finally found?

429
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,650
Anyhow, let's stop seeing each other on the weekends.

430
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,960
- Why?
 - Why else?

431
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,880
I need to have visitations with Jae Hui on the weekends until I get custody.

432
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,080
- Let me come with— 
 - No, absolutely not.

433
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,010
Why must you say it so harshly?

434
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,110
Because you can't come with me, obviously.

435
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,820
I even left my job of ten years because I wanted to protect our love.

436
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,610
How can you be so indifferent to me?

437
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:00,150
You're not even trying to console me, but it's all about Jae Hui, Jae Hui, Jae Hui!

438
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,680
What am I to you, exactly?

439
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,160
Are you trying to compete with Jae Hui or something?

440
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,280
Can't I?

441
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,330
Why am I always second?

442
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,030
How long will I remain second?

443
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,610
Since you want to know, let me make it clear.

444
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,610
Jae Hui is the top priority.

445
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:25,030
In the future, I won't allow anything to hurt Jae Hui even for a bit.

446
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,930
You talk as if I'm the one who hurt Jae Hui.

447
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,270
As if I'm the offender.

448
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,520
Yes, you and I are the offenders.

449
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,720
How can you say that...

450
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,500
- How could you say that about our love— 
- Geez.

451
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,940
If we have to keep fighting over this, let's just end it here.

452
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,780
- What did you just say?
 - Just quit it! I'm sick of this!

453
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,520
Did I ever say I was going to marry you?

454
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,920
Know your place!

455
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,120
You can't forget about Yu Ri's blind date tonight. Okay?

456
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,320
How can I forget that?

457
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,550
Thank you.

458
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,390
- I'm going.
 - Yes, please take care.

459
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,790
Take care!

460
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,250
Transfer the title of this house to me.

461
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,690
If you don't, I'll tell the press a famous attorney won't keep her promise.

462
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,910
Since your daughter did that to me, it's my turn.

463
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,790
I told you not to mess with my daughter.

464
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,890
You two were happy together. Why are you blackmailing me now?

465
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,560
I can't make a living because of your daughter. Aren't you going to take responsibility?

466
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,580
I need to make a living, too.

467
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,770
I was going to sue you back then

468
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,100
when I was at a loss after getting fired, thanks to your daughter.

469
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,090
But that man must've felt bad as a dad.

470
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,730
He begged me not to sue you, so I let you off the hook once.

471
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,810
So what? Do you want me to thank you for it?

472
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,460
Gosh, give me a break.

473
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,670
You were the ones who were at fault. Why are you picking on my daughter?

474
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,210
My retirement funds went down the drain because of his hospital bills.

475
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,830
Do you even know how much of my money he drained until he died?

476
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,480
I hung in there because he said he'd give me this house after he died.

477
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,260
He left his family saying he loved me, but in the end, he couldn't even recognize my face.

478
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,640
He was Yu Ri's dad and your husband.

479
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,050
Don't you feel sorry for him?

480
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,160
Sorry for him?

481
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,870
That's all his own karma.

482
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,520
I really don't have any money.

483
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,420
I gave you 300 million won I had saved for Yu Ri's wedding back then.

484
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,010
I gave you that money so I wouldn't ever have to see you again.

485
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,970
Please stop blackmailing me using a dead man and my child.

486
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,680
Try to turn a new leaf now, Kim Hui Ra.

487
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,530
Don't tell me what to do. Who do you think you are?

488
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,230
And your daughter became a lawyer.

489
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,880
She's bound to be successful from now on.

490
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,590
Do you want to ruin her future because of money? You call yourself a mom?

491
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,700
Because I'm a mom... I held back because I'm a mom!

492
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,040
Yu Ri will make way more money than this house.

493
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,500
A daughter who protested in front of her dad's workplace because he had an affair?

494
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,810
A daughter who didn't even know her dad was dying or even care?

495
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,160
Would the world let a woman like her be a legal professional?

496
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,510
Think about it carefully.

497
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,240
How wicked.

498
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,190
Is this the data I told you about?

499
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,020
Yes, the record of wiring 300 million won and

500
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:14,190
the recording of the phone call I saved to use if she ever messed with Yu Ri.
  Recording 

501
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,180
I'll review them.

502
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,360
Making a recording was a great idea.

503
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,330
I thought I should save evidence since I had been through a lawsuit before.

504
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,540
It feels a bit odd to be sitting with you like this.

505
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,890
You scolded me so much back then.

506
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,340
But you're saying you'll help me now.

507
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,270
Don't you feel odd, too, Attorney Cha?

508
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,970
Not at all.

509
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,680
I only did my job.

510
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,200
Just like how you do your best as a mother,

511
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,270
I also did my best for the person who entrusted me with their case.

512
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:06,560
I actually even went to see a therapist back then because of you.

513
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,380
That wasn't because of me.

514
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,830
It was because of the two people who committed adultery.

515
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,480
Gosh, you're an attorney, all right.

516
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,550
I can't win with words, then and now.

517
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,820
If you didn't divorce back then,

518
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,790
your husband would've spent all that money on Kim Hui Ra.

519
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,850
Even if the divorce had been denied, he never would've come home.

520
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:38,670
You would've suffered because of a marriage life that existed only on paper.

521
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,560
Are you saying you scolded and forced me to get a divorce for my sake?

522
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,030
No, I only work for my client.

523
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:59,280
Will Yu Ri also become like you?

524
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,790
Yes, probably.

525
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:11,640
I still don't understand what it means when you say you work only for your client.

526
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,400
Anyhow, thank you for the help.

527
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,980
Let's try and get along since this brought us together.

528
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,640
Then, I'll get going.

529
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,810
Wait.

530
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,230
Your anger.

531
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,450
Did it get better

532
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,900
after some time passed?

533
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,100
I told you. It's all in the past, and we should get along.

534
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,550
No, not toward me.

535
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:48,030
I was asking about your anger toward your husband.

536
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,590
What can I do? He was my child's dad.

537
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,670
But I'm sure it'll be different for you.

538
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,620
My child's dad died.

539
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,670
Even if I want to hate him, he's no longer around.

540
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,890
I'm fine with losing my husband,

541
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,390
but I can't let Yu Ri lose her dad.

542
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,230
The moment I would think of her dad as a betrayer,

543
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,210
I was afraid Yu Ri would lose her dad forever, so I suppressed it so hard.

544
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,350
Saying, "I'm okay. I forgave him."

545
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:42,620
Because I need to protect his place as her dad.

546
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,530
Attorney Cha!

547
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,020
The case you said you'd mull over...

548
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,980
You didn't take the case, did you?

549
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,920
Who knows?

550
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,110
 Mom  
  It's at 6:30 this evening. 

551
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,080
 It's the I Hotel lobby, right in front of your office. 

552
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,650
 I told her you'd go. 

553
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,880
 It's my wish. You'll go for me, right? 

554
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,820
Now isn't the time for me to go on blind dates.

555
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,930
Gosh, she's just way too soft.

556
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,300
This is so frustrating. So frustrating.

557
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,170
What time is it?

558
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,490
 Hello, this is Jo Yun Seong, your blind date. 

559
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,480
 I'm here, and I'm wearing a jacket with a check pattern. 

560
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,450
If you're in your late 20s, it is a perfect age to get married.

561
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,950
Sorry?

562
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm not sure. Who gets married in their late 20s these days?

563
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,820
Even if the world has changed, things are different once a woman passes 30.

564
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,330
Of course, it's a bit better for you since you have a career.

565
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,530
What do you mean?

566
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,570
Well, I guess the value?

567
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,220
 Gosh, you young kkondae*.
 (A condescending older person, usually male.) 

568
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,410
 Why do I suddenly want to see Attorney Jeon? 

569
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,870
That's what you think, huh?

570
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,590
There.

571
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,490
- Take your time, Mom.
 - How pretty.

572
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,840
Your dad and I were going to head back down right after the wedding.

573
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,980
You didn't have to. You're busy—

574
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,380
Not at all. I'm not busy at all.

575
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,410
I wanted to come to a place like this with you two.

576
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,250
It's all nice and flashy.

577
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,540
Sun Rye raised her children so well, and she's got a nice son-in-law, too.

578
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,620
Oh, really?

579
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,850
But this place is too luxurious for me to come.

580
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,440
How can you say that? You raised a nice son, too.

581
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,220
You're more than qualified to come to a place like this. Here.

582
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,020
How long will you keep this up in front of your son?

583
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,050
I'm treating my woman well, so what's your problem?

584
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,640
"My woman"? Dad, seriously!

585
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,900
When will you show us your girlfriend, Eun Ho?

586
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,090
Don't tell me you don't have a girlfriend.

587
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,390
I have one. I do. I do.

588
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,190
But I'm not going to show her to you.

589
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,100
I'm curious about who my son likes.

590
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,270
Keep this up, and I'm going to leave first.

591
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,490
- Let me use the restroom.
 - Sure. Honey...

592
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,720
Huh? Attorney Han!

593
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,400
Sh-She's an attorney at our firm.

594
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,350
H-Hello.

595
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,060
She must be the one.

596
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,750
Dad, stop looking at her.

597
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,490
Stop looking, Dad!

598
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,730
She's pretty.

599
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,240
Oh, it's raining.

600
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,930
Attorney Han!

601
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,650
You don't have an umbrella, right?

602
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,620
Shall we go get pa-mak*?
 (Pajeon and makgeoli: scallion pancake and rice wine.)

603
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,410
- What's pamak?
 - Pajeon and makgeoli!

604
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,600
Gosh, stop doing that! It's terrible.

605
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,840
Why?

606
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,680
- Pajeon and makgeoli?
 - Yes.

607
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,520
If you keep doing that, you'll be coming up with all sorts of stuff.

608
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,510
The rain sounds great, doesn't it?

609
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,120
All right. Let me pour you one.

610
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,550
Looks delicious.

611
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,000
All right.

612
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,970
Look how crunchy it is.

613
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,240
Here.

614
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,790
You said you don't have time to date because of work.

615
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:41,760
You just didn't have time for me, huh?

616
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,160
I-It's not like that.

617
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,060
I didn't know I'd be going on a blind date until an hour ago, either.

618
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,650
What? What do you mean you didn't know you'd be going on a blind date?

619
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,800
Hurry up and eat. Eat it while it's hot. It's all crunchy and delicious.

620
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,410
Okay. Let's eat.

621
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,280
- Delicious, right?
 - Yes, it's delicious.

622
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:15,240
You know, our country needs to change parent-child relationships first.

623
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,480
- Thanks.
 - Sure.

624
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:24,720
It's my life, you know? Can my mom just do what she pleases with it?

625
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,080
Isn't it because you're too obedient to your mother?

626
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,780
Maybe because I don't listen to my mom.

627
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,270
She doesn't really tell me what to do.

628
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,820
Those people from earlier are your parents, right?

629
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,540
Yes, they came to Seoul for a wedding

630
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,590
and I wanted to treat them to coffee at a hotel.

631
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,000
Whoa, what's this?

632
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,460
You're a good son.

633
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,310
They seemed really happy together.

634
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,430
Don't even mention it. They're still like newlyweds.

635
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,890
My dad calls my mom "my woman."

636
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,390
That's really sweet.

637
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,760
Cheers.

638
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,760
Cheers.

639
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,440
How refreshing.

640
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,490
I can really go alone.

641
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,470
There you go again. Will you go alone again like you did in Sodaeri?

642
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,970
Not today. Absolutely not.

643
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,110
Then, I'll call the cab right now.

644
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,660
You call one, too, Attorney Jeon.

645
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,360
Okay. I'll go after I see your cab arrive.

646
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,020
By the way, who was that woman from last time?

647
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,730
Huh? Who?

648
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:53,770
The woman who made you freeze the moment your eyes met.

649
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,760
My dad's mistress.

650
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,220
Legally, she's my mom's defendant.

651
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,680
it's taking forever to get a cab.

652
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,980
Is it because of the rain?

653
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,610
It was delayed so many times.

654
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,520
I got one!

655
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,490
It's coming soon.

656
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,660
Does your mother know?

657
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,650
Mom doesn't know.

658
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,280
Which is why she's got time to tell me to go on a blind date.

659
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,740
But do you know what's even crazier?

660
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,140
What?

661
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,110
I think Cha Eun Gyeong took that woman's case.

662
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,090
What?

663
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:45,300
I mean, I'm her attorney.

664
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,720
And she takes a case from my dad's mistress?

665
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,040
Seriously. Is she a robot or a monster?

666
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,550
Hey, that's really crazy.

667
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,870
If I were our firm's CEO,

668
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,950
I'd leave the firm to Cha Eun Gyeong, not Jeong Wu Jin. For real.

669
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:05,180
If Attorney Cha is our firm's CEO, we'd be first in the country.

670
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,920
She said we need to be professional.

671
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,220
She said she couldn't tell me because I'm an interested party.

672
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,450
That's similar to you, Han Yu Ri.

673
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,120
You also needed to be professional,

674
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,540
so you can't date me.

675
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,250
- Hey!
 - "Hey!"

676
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,160
It says it's here.

677
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,800
Isn't that the one?

678
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,380
Oh, you're right.

679
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,170
- I'll get going.
 - Okay.

680
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,240
Sir, please drive safely.

681
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,950
Take care.

682
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,190
Kim Jae Hui, did you wait for me?

683
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,300
I was watching TV just now.

684
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,690
I was about to go to sleep.

685
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,370
You came home early for once, huh?

686
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,320
You got the snack, right?

687
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,480
Yes, the kids were making a big deal.

688
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,390
They said it was high-quality pastry their moms never buy them.

689
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,820
They asked how you bought so many expensive pastries.

690
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,780
It was really daebak.

691
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,560
They asked me, "Does your mom make a lot of money?"

692
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,020
So, what did you say?

693
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,750
I said, "You guys know Yoon Quiz, right?"

694
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,160
"My mom comes out on that show."

695
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,340
Jae Hui, you never talked about how I come out on TV.

696
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,070
Did you suddenly want to brag?

697
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:52,690
The kids just asked me first, so I answered them.

698
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,610
Is that right?

699
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,320
I did well today, right?

700
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,380
It wasn't bad.

701
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,000
Gosh, don't be like that. Can't you compliment me for once?

702
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,900
Good job.

703
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,710
But let me tell you one more time, because it seems you don't understand.

704
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,240
Next time, I want you to come in person.

705
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,990
I think the last time you came to pick me up was when I was on a field trip in third grade.

706
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:30,000
I got it. I'll try harder to make more time.

707
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,180
I put this semester's school event calendar in your room.

708
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,640
Okay.

709
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,680
- I'm going to sleep now.
 - Good night.

710
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,020
 Just put some cheese instead of ketchup next time. 

711
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,480
 Dad always made it with cheese. 

712
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,200
 The moment I would think of her dad as a betrayer, 

713
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,850
 I was afraid Yu Ri would lose her dad forever, so I suppressed it so hard. 

714
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:45,650
 Saying, "I'm okay. I forgave him." 

715
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,480
 Because I need to protect 

716
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,240
 his place as her dad. 

717
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,160
It's the same as the one your dad makes, huh?

718
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,900
Your dad makes tastier omelets than even hotel chefs, right?

719
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,670
Help yourself. Drink some juice, too.

720
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,900
 - Hello. 
 - Good morning! 

721
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,970
Hello.

722
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,970
 Hello. 

723
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,290
Why did you come this time?

724
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,590
It looks like Han Yu Ri still works here.

725
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,770
Did you think I was joking?

726
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,130
Oh, yes. You were kind of funny.

727
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,610
The press was noisy enough with your news alone.

728
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,510
Should I add to it with Han Yu Ri?

729
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,550
Do you know who the scariest person is in this world?

730
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,510
A bitch who's got nothing to lose.

731
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,050
That's who I am right now.

732
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,480
You've got nothing to lose? But you do.

733
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,920
What did you say?

734
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,820
Three hundred million won.

735
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,490
You extorted money from Yu Ri's mom.

736
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,650
I'm glad you brought it up. Three hundred million won.

737
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,760
That house's market value is one billion won, but I only got 300 million won.

738
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,110
Can you even get a place in Seoul with that money?

739
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,200
Whatever! It's all or nothing for me now.

740
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,790
You should just keep what you have before I make you lose all you have.

741
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,490
- Did this woman go mad?
 - That 300 million won...

742
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:47,220
Han Yu Ri didn't know about it.

743
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,480
But you know how Han Yu Ri is, right?

744
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,320
Legally, it's blackmail.

745
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,160
If I tell Han Yu Ri about it, Attorney Han Yu Ri will probably

746
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,640
file a criminal and civil suit to get that money back.

747
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,970
Then, it'd become a real blood bath.

748
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,170
Would you be okay with that?

749
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,780
Attorney Han, come to my office.

750
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,110
This woman, seriously?

751
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,490
Why did you call me over?

752
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,240
- I wanted to ask you something.
 - Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong!

753
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,340
Attorney Han, since you graduated from law school quite recently,

754
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:44,670
you remember studying about unjust enrichment and illegal payment, right?

755
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,980
Yes, why do you ask?

756
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,340
She must've gotten herself in trouble somewhere.

757
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,170
Well, it seems she wants me to take her case.

758
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:00,280
But I'd like you to take the case since I'm too busy.

759
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,520
Attorney Cha!

760
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,380
I can't do that.

761
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,310
Is that so? That won't work, then.

762
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,830
Let's get rid of this woman first.

763
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,070
Could you get lost, please?

764
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,880
You're both the same.

765
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,990
Can't believe you two.

766
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,790
I'll sue both of you!

767
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,110
Do you want me to sue you first for interference with business,

768
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,440
trespass, and violation of the Information and Communications Network Act?

769
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,480
Get out.

770
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,120
Let's get some coffee.

771
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,980
How on earth did you do that?

772
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,660
What can an attorney do?

773
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,510
We can screw them up with the law.

774
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:17,750
Isn't that why we spent our 20s studying like hell, living on kimbap and cup noodles?

775
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,190
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.

776
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,200
That's nothing new. You misunderstand me all the time.

777
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,290
You cause me to misunderstand you, Attorney Cha.

778
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,140
You should've let me know in advance.

779
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,610
It's not a misunderstanding.

780
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,880
I was the representative for...

781
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,970
your dad and Kim Hui Ra.

782
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,330
You were?

783
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:58,440
I saw the case in a new light while going through my own divorce.

784
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,540
I repaid my debt today.

785
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,720
What do you mean, debt?

786
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,850
Attorney Cha, thank you for getting her to divorce him.

787
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,530
If my mom hadn't got the divorce,

788
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:36,050
she'd have spent all her life unable to leave a marriage that existed only on paper.

789
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:45,190
Thank you for saying what I really wanted to say to that woman in my place.

790
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,690
I feel so much better.

791
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,700
What did I say?

792
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,530
You told her to get lost.

793
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,180
I desperately wished for her to get lost

794
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,150
from my mom's life.

795
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,840
♫  'Cause you're beautiful  ♫

796
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,570
♫  A beautiful stranger  ♫

797
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:17,270
Did you like my after-service?

798
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:25,360
You should also get rid of that woman from your heart now.

799
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,980
♫     ♫

800
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,830
Let's go.

801
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,470
Okay!

802
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:45,270
The weather's especially great today, Attorney Cha.

803
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,340
You're right. It's the perfect weather for a walk.

804
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,540
Mom, let's grab a meal tomorrow. I'll buy.

805
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,430
Do you have time?

806
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,420
Oh, Mom! Over here!

807
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,660
Do attorneys eat in places like this?

808
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,980
Only the attorneys in dramas do.

809
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,000
We eat kimbap in a car.

810
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:31,780
Wait, for a single meal?

811
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,580
Hey, let's get out.

812
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,360
- Why, why?
 - It's too expensive.

813
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,530
Gosh! I want to buy you something expensive today.

814
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,340
Why? What's the occasion?

815
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,600
A complicated case was resolved.

816
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,740
I feel so much better.

817
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,580
That's great. How did the blind date go?

818
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,270
Seriously, Mom!

819
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:03,290
- You need to date.
 -  That day, Mom and I didn't say a word about Dad. 

820
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:08,150
 Relieved to feel she had protected her child from a rough wind, 

821
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:12,500
 my mom smiled the most brightly in a long time. 

822
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:20,610
 Perhaps we were finally able to send off Dad and his mistress completely. 

823
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,690
Pick whatever you want.

824
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,420
 Also, there were two more moms. 

825
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,730
The child cried herself to sleep while waiting for her mom.

826
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,830
And that's how thirteen years passed!

827
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:44,930

 Good Partner 

835
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,620
 I raised Jae Hui all alone. 

836
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,840
 What? How can you lie like that? 

837
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,250
 If we fail to get custody of Jae Hui, 

838
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,380
 our baby can live with his dad, too, right? 

839
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,960
 Let me ask you for a favor. 

840
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,410
 Whose son is my Seo Jun, if not mine? 

841
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:48,910
 Isn't something wrong here? 

842
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,930
 It's a world where people abandon their own children. 

843
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,900
 But he raised someone else's child with so much devotion. 

844
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,390
 Let's get a verdict with the highest alimony ever.
