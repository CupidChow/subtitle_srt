00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,470
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,540
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,010
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,240
You didn't have to come all the way here at this hour.

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,470
My client so painstakingly requested after-service.

11
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,800
Of course, I should come.

12
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,790
Jae Hui's injury...

13
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,850
scared you a lot, huh?

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,890
How embarrassing.

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,590
I boasted, saying I could do fine on my own.

16
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,170
Look at me now.

17
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,930
Come on. It's not your fault.

18
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,850
I heard children can still get hurt, no matter how cautious you are.

19
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,770
I grew up with a few scratches myself.

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,400
Thanks.

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,380
But you do know a lawyer shouldn't rush over

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,310
just because their client asks them to, right?

23
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,030
Your lawyer career won't last long if you waste your energy like this.

24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,810
You didn't possibly cause any trouble while I was away, did you?

25
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,930
How did you know?

26
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,380
I really nailed a case.

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,890
I'll describe it to you later in detail. Point by point.

28
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,760
No, it's okay. That's not necessary.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,890
Attorney Cha.

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,290
Just as much as Jae Hui needs her mom at home,

31
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,800
I need you at work, Attorney Cha.

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,370
Please always stay by my side.

33
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,110
Thanks, Han Yu Ri.

34
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,620
I see you've made up your mind.

35
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,820
Please hand over...

36
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,250
Daejeong Law Firm to me.

37
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,110
You've made a good choice.

38
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,920
 Case 12: Closing Argument 

39
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,860
Ji Yeong!

40
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,450
Your husband's home.

41
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,800
How could you not come out and greet your husband when he's home?

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,100
Didn't you miss me? I sure did.

 Chun Medical Foundation - Daejeong Law Firm 
 Episode 12 

45
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,490
Director Chun!

46
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,860
- Aigoo! It's been a while.
 - Hello.
  Chun Medical Foundation - Daejeong Law Firm MOU Signing Ceremony 

47
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
- Hope you've been well.
 - Yes, yes.

48
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,230
By chance, is this the one—

49
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,210
Yes, this is my son.

50
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,660
As I told you before, he will take over our law firm.

51
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,580
- Oh, is that so?
 - Yes.

52
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,500
Hello.

53
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,250
This is my son.

54
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,940
He's currently the Executive Director of the Chun Foundation.

55
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,950
I see.

56
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,340
You two will probably meet often in the future. You should exchange introductions.

57
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,860
Yes, hello.

58
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,930
Nice to meet you.

59
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,740
Please take good care of us.

60
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,680
You must be exhausted coming all this distance.

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,030
- All right, let's go.
 - Oh, yes.

62
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,270
We'll take a moment to take photos.

63
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,330
 Chun Medical Foundation - Daejeong Law Firm MOU Signing Ceremony 

64
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm embarrassed to bring up a family affair. But could I ask you a favor?

65
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,150
Don't be embarrassed.

66
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,120
Please think of us as family and be at ease.

67
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,340
My son was served with a divorce complaint.

68
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,220
Will you take this case?

69
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,680
Aigoo, yes. Of course, I will.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,970
Actually, my wife has been going around

71
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,480
various law firms for the past few years.

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
She would file a divorce complaint, demand money,

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,990
then withdraw the complaint.

74
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,990
She keeps repeating this cycle, which is very distressing.

75
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,110
Since I still love my wife.

76
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,690
Is there a skilled lawyer who can take my son's case?

77
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,110
Yes, we have the best divorce attorney on our divorce team.

78
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,870
Who would that be?

79
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,950
- Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong— 
 - Rather than Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong,

80
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,820
wouldn't Attorney Han Yu Ri be better suited?

81
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,100
What kind of person is Attorney Han Yu Ri?

82
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,970
She graduated at the top of her law school

83
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,330
and has been winning every case since she joined us.

84
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,230
Yes, Attorney Han is very skilled, but she doesn't have much experience.

85
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,950
I recommend Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong—

86
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,600
Attorney Cha has caused some issues with her personal affairs

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,740
which might garner media attention.

88
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,800
And she tends to be a bit stubborn,

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,430
so you'll have an easier time managing a younger attorney.

90
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,220
Then please assign me to Attorney Han Yu Ri.

91
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,590
Leave it to Daejeong!

92
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,140
She'll file another complaint if she withdraws again.

93
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,940
We'll obtain a judgment of dismissal.

94
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,590
- Thank you.
 - Have some tea.

95
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,100
Our country's largest hospital belongs to the Chun Medical Foundation.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,570
With the MOU, we'll take all of their cases for five years.

97
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,980
So, do a good job.

98
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,170
Get the divorce complaint dismissed, no matter what.

99
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,200
Then, why did you assign a VIP case to a rookie attorney?

100
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
This isn't a difficult case.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,250
She even cleared a case on her own recently.

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,130
What's the problem?

103
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,000
In both skill and experience,

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,200
I believe Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong is better suited for a VIP case.

105
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,070
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

106
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,920
Don't mix your personal feelings into this.

107
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,450
Just do as I tell you!

108
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,510
 Daejeong Law Firm Signs an MOU with Chun Medical Foundation 

109
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,970
Yes?

110
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,390
Attorney Han.

111
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,200
CEO Oh is asking for you.

112
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,420
Sorry? CEO Oh?

113
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,330
Asking for me?

114
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,060
Wh-Why?

115
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,620
You heard we have an MOU with the Chun Medical Foundation, right?

116
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,230
Yes, I read the article.

117
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,120
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, the Executive Director there, was served with a divorce complaint.

118
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,890
Attorney Han Yu Ri.

119
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,780
You can proceed with this case on your own.

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,500
Sorry?

121
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,890
Why are you giving me a VIP case to me instead of Attorney Cha—

122
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,250
Cha Eun Gyeong...

123
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,510
I'm going to fire her.

124
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,610
You must pay extra attention to this VIP case.

125
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,540
Get the divorce dismissed, no matter what.

126
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,290
To determine whether a dismissal is right,

127
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,670
I think it's best to decide after reviewing the complaint

128
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,480
and meeting the concerned party.

129
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,530
And...

130
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,210
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong is my team leader.

131
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,170
I should discuss with her whether I can proceed with this case on my own.

132
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,470
I can make Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong leave this instant.

133
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,260
Just get a dismissal for the VIP's case.

134
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,690
It's a matter of life and death for our company.

135
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,730
If you get the dismissal, I'll hold off on firing Cha Eun Gyeong temporarily.

136
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,730
Good luck.

137
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,730
 Daejeong Law Firm Divorce Team Assignments 

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,500
The new case assignment indicates Han Yu Ri will be proceeding alone.

139
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,140
Attorney Jeong, did you assign it to her?

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,020
It's the divorce case for the Executive Director of the Chun Medical Foundation.

141
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,150
CEO Oh assigned it to Han Yu Ri to work on it solo.

142
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
What?

143
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,770
But in my opinion, you should take the VIP case, Seonbae.

144
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,520
It's not too late to talk to CEO Oh right now.

145
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,640
No, it's fine.

146
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,650
It's a good opportunity for Han Yu Ri.

147
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,210
CEO Oh must have a reason for assigning it to her.

148
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,960
Forget it.

149
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,160
 Cha Eun Gyeong... 

150
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,540
 I'm going to fire her. 

151
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,550
 Can I get after-service? 

152
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,140
 Attorney Cha, is something wrong? 

153
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,110
 Both at work and at home, 

154
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,890
 it seems no one needs me. 

155
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,150
 What should I do? 

156
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,450
 Complaint 

157
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,600
 Reason for dissolution of the marriage 

158
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,160
"Domestic violence"?

159
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,550
Wait.

160
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,350
"Since the start of the marriage, he habitually pulled the plaintiff's hair,

161
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,810
pushed her into the water and wouldn't let her get out.

162
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,550
She developed an aquaphobia due to water torture.

163
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,750
He always pulled the plaintiff around by the hair,

164
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,140
so she developed hair loss..."

165
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,730
 Evidence 

166
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,190
There's no evidence. 
  Petition 

167
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
Okay.

168
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,480
There's no evidence,

169
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,840
so anyone could...

170
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,100
get a judgment of dismissal.

171
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,950
It's okay.

172
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,900
It's okay.

173
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,800
 With my shallow sense of duty and equally pathetic sense of justice then if I hadn't decided 

174
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,150
 that I would somehow protect Attorney Cha 

175
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,990
 could there have been no negative consequence? 

176
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,900
Yes.

177
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,850
Attorney Cha, did you hear about it by chance?

178
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, of course.

179
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,410
I'm worried because it's a VIP case.

180
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,690
I can come to you when I'm stuck in the process, right?

181
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,190
Well, I heard they're asking for dismissal with no evidence attached to the complaint.

182
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,950
You probably won't have any questions.

183
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,920
That must be why the CEO also had you take the case alone.

184
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,960
 Just get a dismissal for the VIP's case. 

185
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,880
 If you get the dismissal, I'll hold off on firing Cha Eun Gyeong temporarily. 

186
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,290
Yes, Attorney Cha. I'll try my best.

187
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,070
 Even without you, things will run smoothly 

188
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,600
 as if you were never here. So, don't worry, Attorney Cha. 

189
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,560
Good luck.

190
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,130
 Major Violence Inidents­ 

191
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,870
 Means of proof 

192
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,480
The opposing party is claiming physical abuse.

193
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,380
But the complaint has no evidence attached.

194
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,400
I heard you wanted a dismissal.

195
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,630
Do you mean the plaintiff is making a false claim?

196
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,100
Yes. It's complete nonsense.

197
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,040
It's already the fourth time that Ji Yeong

198
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,160
submitted a complaint for divorce.

199
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,260
Why does she keep submitting and withdrawing the suit?

200
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,150
Well...

201
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,820
it's probably because of money.

202
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,770
I used to send her money whenever she submitted a complaint.

203
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,960
After that, she'd withdraw the suit.

204
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,730
And a while later, she'd submit another divorce suit.

205
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,290
Do you have a record of remittance details?

206
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,970
Yes.

207
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,970
One moment, please.

208
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,580
 To: Yu Ji Yeong 

209
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,640
 To: Yoo Ji Yeong 

210
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,820
Because I love Ji Yeong so much,

211
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,710
I wanted to hold onto her this way if I could.

212
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,140
Will I be able to get a dismissal?

213
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,830
Yes.

214
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,150
A cause for divorce isn't acknowledged

215
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,040
through claims without evidence.

216
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,360
If the plaintiff has no evidence to submit,

217
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,380
the court will dismiss the case in the judgment.

218
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,560
Thank you.

219
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,120
Please don't worry.

220
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,510
We'll get you the dismissal very soon.

221
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,020
Because Attorney Han Yu Ri is the ace of our firm's Divorce Team.

222
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,700
Well, I'll be counting on you, Attorney Han.

223
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,480
Please get home safe.

224
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,120
Bye now.

225
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,870
 Seoul Family Court 

226
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,210
Defendant's representative, are you asking for a  judgment of dismissal?

227
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,890
Yes, the defendant wishes to keep his family.

228
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,680
Plaintiff, you're claiming physical abuse,

229
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,580
but you don't have any evidence. Am I correct?

230
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,230
Then, how do you plan to prove your claim?

231
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,260
Plaintiff,

232
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,940
please speak up.

233
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,330
Do you really have no evidence at all?

234
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,060
 Plaintiff­ 

235
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,550
Yes.

236
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,230
I couldn't secure any evidence.

237
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,680
How adorable, my Ji Yeong.

238
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,410
Do you not even have circumstantial evidence aside from direct evidence?

239
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,940
If there were physical abuse,

240
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,360
there could be text messages, recordings of conversations,

241
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,480
or even medical records for your injuries.

242
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Anything of the sort?

243
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,920
I don't have any.

244
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,370
The plaintiff is actually the guilty party.

245
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,870
She has been filing litigations to extort money.

246
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,980
If you look at Article 5, the bank statement,

247
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,220
you can see that the plaintiff has recieved a hefty sum

248
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,000
from the defendant whenever she withdrew her divorce lawsuit.

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,670
That's not it.

250
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,670
I withdrew the lawsuits because I was scared.

251
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,300
I sent you some pocket money. Withdraw it.

252
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,790
Only if you agree to divorce.

253
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,200
You've been beaten up but not killed, huh?

254
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,600
Withdraw it when I'm telling you nicely. I said drop it!

255
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,230
The next court date will be for mediation.

256
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,480
Please try to have a solution-oriented conversation.

257
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,870
A solution-oriented conversation?

258
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,130
Please turn off the water.

259
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,060
- Sorry?
 - Please turn off the water!

260
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,020
Are you okay

261
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,470
 He always pulled the plaintiff around by the hair, 

262
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,080
 so she developed hair loss ... 

263
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,680
Are you okay?

264
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,410
Do you need help?

265
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,080
Help?

266
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,790
Help me?

267
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,700
Don't you people

268
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,440
defend even the trashiest human beings as long as you're paid?

269
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,850
Because of people like you,

270
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,590
I'll never escape hell for the rest of my life.

271
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,010
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo!

272
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,540
Could I have a word with you for a moment, please?

273
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,990
- Wait here.
 - Yes.

274
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,350
Yes.

275
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,730
There's something I must ask you.

276
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,760
Please answer me honestly.

277
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,750
Since I'm your representative, Mr. Chun Hwan Seo.

278
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,080
What is it?

279
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,150
Are you sure you never physically abused her?

280
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,080
I mean, I clearly told you I never hit her. What are you doing right now?

281
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,880
Out in public, on top of that.

282
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,510
Why? You can't believe what your client says?

283
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,700
If you lie to me as well, it'll be hard to continue defending you.

284
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,420
Unless you tell me honestly, getting a dismissal can be difficult as well—

285
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,450
What the hell—

286
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,590
I chose you because he said you'll be easy to handle as a newbie.

287
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,740
Why are you so talkative? I said it's not true, didn't I?

288
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,100
Hey.

289
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,070
You better not let me see you ever again. You got that?

290
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,900
I told Senior Manager Ahn to change the representative CEO.

291
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,570
You're really going to become the true owner of Daejeong now.

292
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,260
Yes.

293
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,160
I'll do my best.

294
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,370
Shouldn't you announce it to the employees now?

295
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,700
I'd like for you to keep it a secret until the paperwork is completed.

296
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,220
I need to personally inform someone before that.

297
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,130
You're the CEO of one of Korea's top three law firms now.

298
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,610
Behave properly so as to not cause any rumors.

299
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,760
He didn't accept her greeting.

300
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,440
I'm expecting great things from you, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

301
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,080
It's time for Daejeong to have a generational transition.

302
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,420
What's he saying?

303
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,990
Yes.

304
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:31,170
Attorney Cha, you were offended earlier, right?

305
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,500
No. Don't worry about it, and get back to work.

306
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,650
My gosh...

307
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,980
I don't know why the CEO is being so childish.

308
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,730
Attorney Han.

309
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,270
You're calling your superior at work childish?

310
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,350
I'll be careful.

311
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,890
Also, while working for a company,

312
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,700
unacceptable things do happen at times.

313
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,090
Whether we like it or not, we're CEO Oh Dae Gyu's employees.

314
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,390
So, just follow orders coming down from the company.

315
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,900
You don't know why the CEO is acting that way toward me

316
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,430
and why I decided to take this case, Attorney Cha.

317
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,850
Do I need to know?

318
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,570
You asked me for after-service, Attorney Cha.

319
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,070
If you were burdened by that, I'll take it back.

320
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,410
I didn't take Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case because I wanted to.

321
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,450
Let's stop.

322
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,310
Anyway...

323
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,360
I was only trying to protect you.

324
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,850
- Did you see that?
 - Is Attorney Han Yu Ri crying?

325
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,480
It seems Cha Eun Gyeong just picked on Han Yu Ri.

326
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,290
Attorney Cha must've snapped at Attorney Han because of the CEO, right?

327
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,500
They had such great work chemistry. What's the matter?

328
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,540
What do you mean?

329
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,250
It's because of the VIP case.

330
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,130
Attorney Han took that case all alone.

331
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,030
Usually, the top dog gets anxious as the underdog gets stronger.

332
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,240
Come on. Attorney Cha is Daejeong's main talent, though.

333
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,800
Exactly! If he excluded the main talent from the VIP case,

334
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,120
it means the CEO sent a signal, saying he'll fire Cha Eun Gyeong.

335
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,930
No wonder a fight is breaking out.

336
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,670
I feel bad for Attorney Han Yu Ri.

337
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,240
Why feel bad for Attorney Han?

338
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,760
Out with the old, in with the new. I feel sorry for Attorney Cha more.

339
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,490
Enough. It's always about the survival of the fittest at work.

340
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,150
 Tin House Briquette BBQ 

341
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,880
Aigoo, stop drinking now.

342
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,770
Let me be.

343
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:35,960
I can't go to sleep sober tonight anyway.

344
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:46,230
Attorney Jeon, have you ever taken on a case involving domestic violence?

345
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,170
Yes, I've done my share.

346
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,020
I'm still three months your senior.

347
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,120
Attorney Han, is it because of Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case?

348
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Representing domestic violence perpetrators is always difficult.

349
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,770
The perpetrators claim they never laid a finger,

350
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,850
but it seems there was abuse when you arrived at the court.

351
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,480
And when you look at the victim,

352
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,700
you don't feel so good and get upset.

353
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,100
So, you end up worried and confused.

354
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,690
When I was in law school,

355
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,310
I thought law...

356
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:35,100
could become your power.

357
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,760
But...

358
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,560
there's almost nothing meaningful

359
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,040
an attorney can do for the victim.

360
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,500
I mean, we just need to do as we're told

361
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,840
and get paid on time, right?

362
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:02,410
Why do I agonize over every little case?

363
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm not even sure if I can do anything for anyone now.

364
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,110
Gosh.

365
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,050
- I drank a lot, right? 
- Yes.

366
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,600
I should get going now.

367
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,760
Can you go alone?

368
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,580
Gosh, of course, I can go alone.

369
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,160
- I'll take you home. 
- Huh?

370
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,860
No, it's okay.

371
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,230
I need to organize my thoughts.

372
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,030
Thanks.

373
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:48,930
♫  I feel as though everything I had disappeared  ♫

374
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,000
♫  That's something which couldn't be helped  ♫

375
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,170
 Help me? 

376
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,230
 Don't you people... 

377
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,490
 defend even the trashiest human beings as long as you're paid? 

378
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,130
 Because of people like you... 

379
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,970
 Please turn off the water! 

380
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,600
 I'll never escape hell for the rest of my life. 

381
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,510
 Also, while working for a company, 

382
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,720
 unacceptable things do happen at times. 

383
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,070
 Whether we like it or not, we're CEO Oh Dae Gyu's employees. 

384
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,530
 So, just follow orders coming down from the company. 

385
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:31,440

387
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,740
♫  Would it be okay to hug me?  ♫

388
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,160
 You asked me for after-service, Attorney Cha. 

389
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,680
 If you were burdened by that, I'll take it back. 

390
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,950
 I didn't take Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case because I wanted to. 

391
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,960
 Let's stop. 

392
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,100
 Anyway... 

393
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,080
 I was only trying to protect you. 

394
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,710
♫  You can't blame anyone  ♫

395
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,160
♫  Every time  ♫

396

♫  Always falling down  ♫

397
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,810
I heard you were unhappy with our service during your divorce case.

398
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:35,500
I mean, I couldn't tell if Han Yu Ri was my attorney or a detective.

399
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,790
What do you mean by that?

400
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:43,090
She cornered me, asking if I really didn't hit my wife. I was dumbfounded.

401
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,280
Aigoo, I see.

402
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,540
Attorney Han Yu Ri tends to confirm the facts before proceeding with her defense.

403
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,080
So, you could've felt that way.

404
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,730
I didn't feel that way. She made a mistake.

405
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,780
The one you mentioned last time... That "Cha" something.

406
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,320
- You mean Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?
 - Yes.

407
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,330
Put her on instead.

408
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,860
I should've bought her in the first place.

409
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,370
Yes, I'll assign Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong to your case.

410
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,330
This is the only time your attorney will be changed.

411
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,930
We, attorneys, aren't objects.

412
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,620
It's not appropriate to say you "bought" us.

413
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,470
Attorney Han, Mr. Chun Hwan Seo requested a different attorney.

414
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,750
So, I'm thinking of assigning Attorney Cha in addition.

415
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm sorry, Attorney Jeong.

416
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,320
I took the case when I didn't have the tenure to take on the VIP cases...

417
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,320
and I think I'm causing a lot of trouble for many people.

418
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,200
No, you're not.

419
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,170
I know your style, Attorney Han.

420
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,450
You confirm and clarify the facts first.

421
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,260
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo didn't have a good attitude.

422
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,400
Thank you, Attorney Jeong.

423
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,440
By the way, by additional assignment,

424
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,020
are you referring to joint defense

425
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,210
or that Attorney Cha will be in charge exclusively?

426
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,650
I heard something happened between you and Attorney Cha.

427
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,010
Do you feel uncomfortable?

428
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,210
- Do you want to be taken off the case—
 - No!

429
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,230
Not at all, Attorney Jeong.

430
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:42,230
I want to proceed together with Attorney Cha.

431
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,350
Yes.

432
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,270
Seonbae, do you have some time?

433
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,330
Yes. Why?

434
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,330
Attorney Han asked Mr. Chun Hwan Seo if he really never abused his wife.

435
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,670
He took it as an interrogation.

436
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,300
So, he asked for a different attorney.

437
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,390
I'll submit a request for an additional attorney assignment.

438
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,200
How about you work with Attorney Han?

439
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,520
Sure. I got it.

440
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,250
- I'll go ahead with it.
 - Yes.

441
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,100
 You asked me for an after-service, Attorney Cha. 

442
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,660
 I was only trying to protect you. 

443
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,780
It must've been tough, Han Yu Ri.

Attorney Han.

446
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,320
I'm sorry.

447
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,130
For what?

448
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,670
You'll keep giving me after-service, right?

449
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,700
You're my attorney after all, Attorney Han.

450
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,150
Should I...

451
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,250
l-let you off the hook just once?

452
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,050
Let's give our best and finish Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case well.

453
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,580
That's how we can protect my position, right?

454
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,660
Attorney Cha!

455
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,330
Yes.

456
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,520
Don't you go anywhere.

00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,430
Yes.

460
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,860
I was notified of your request to change your attorney.

461
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,220
But Attorney Han Yu Ri is our divorce team's ace.

462
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,400
An additional appointment will be better than changing.

463
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,280
Joint defense will be better than sole defense.

464
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,020
Yes. It seems I inconvenienced many people.

465
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,030
Not at all.

466
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,750
I reviewed the complaint.

467
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,470
The physical abuse isn't true at all, right?

468
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,940
Gosh, of course, it isn't.

469
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,750
I already told Attorney Han once.

470
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,030
I can't live without my wife.

471
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,520
Please get it dismissed.

 Mediation Room 

473
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,460
Let me ask the plaintiff first.

474
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,960
You said you didn't have any evidence during the last court session.

475
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,980
Is it still difficult for you to provide evidence?

476
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,890
If she can't submit evidence on the second court date,

477
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,200
the physical abuse claim must be dismissed with haste.

478
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,010
I don't think a mediation meeting will be meaningful, either.

479
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,390
I looked into an old phone.

480
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,150
Is it called digital forensics?

481
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,200
I did get a recording file through that.

482
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,640
Are you able to listen to it, Official?

483
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,690
Sure thing.

484
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,540
 Looks like you'll have to go to the pool again tonight. 

485
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,090
 If you have aquaphobia, you should try to overcome it. 

486
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,390
 Please... 

487
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,350
Just hearing the sound of water frightens me.

488
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,640
I'll do a good job tonight.

489
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,030
Let's decide after you show me. Okay?

490
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,120
The pool? What's this?

491
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,220
He demanded intercourse every night.

492
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,580
But he used water torture on me whenever I refused.

493
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,720
Didn't you miss me? I sure did.

494
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm not feeling well tonight. Can we not do it, please?

495
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,680
- Are you looking down on me?
 - No.

496
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,220
I was so annoyed by the foundation's old farts.

497
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,860
And you're looking down on me, too?

498
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,710
Who's looking down on you? You're the hospital director's son.

499
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,840
What did you just say?

500
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,590
You were being sarcastic, right?

501
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,330
I wasn't.

502
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,690
My Ji Yeong...

503
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,010
You should go for a night swim for the first time in a while.

504
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,990
H-Honey!

505
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,750
- Come here!
 - Honey!

506
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,080
Why won't you listen?

507
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Shit.

508
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,400
Hey, didn't I tell you to be quiet?

509
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,660
- Huh?
 - Honey.

510
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,930
- Am I a joke to you? 
 - Please don't.

511
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,720
Don't—

512
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,710
All right.

513
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,620
Honey, please don't—

514
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,270
Listen to me. You're getting water all over me!

515
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,290
You're getting water all over!

516
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,200
I-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

517
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,210
Please forgive me —

518
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,340
Go under!

519
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,370
 He referred to the bathtub as the pool. 

520
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,710
This is nonsense, officials.

521
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,440
So, this is how evidence can be used against you, huh?

522
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,170
My wife has aquaphobia.

523
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,000
To overcome it, we used to go to hotel swimming pools together.

524
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,420
She said she'd only go to hotel swimming pools, so I had to pay tons.

525
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,940
I can submit the swimming pool log whenever you want.

526
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,090
That's not true.

527
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,120
That's not true.

528
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,980
It's not true.

529
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,550
It's not true.

530
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,630
It's not true.

531
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:50,720
It's not true. It's not true, Official.

532
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,230
Please save me.

533
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,020
If I can't divorce him this time,

534
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,010
I think it'll only end if I die, Official.

535
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,690
I swear it's true!

536
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,820
- Excuse me, Attorney.
 - Yes.

537
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,410
I think we better proceed separately. What do you think?

538
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,880
Yes.

539
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,570
Let's do that.

540
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,560
Shall we go outside?

541
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,720
Please calm down. Is that really the only evidence you have?

542
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,250
With this much evidence, it's difficult to get a divorce verdict.

543
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,830
He checks my phone every night and deletes most things.

544
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,130
He never looks or sounds like that.

545
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,080
He wears a mask outside and becomes a different person at home.

546
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,410
Please let me divorce him.

547
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,640
Please...

548
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,670
Please save me.

549
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,840
Our defense could get stuck if evidence suddenly comes out, like today.

550
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,830
So, tell me the things I need to know in advance.

551
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,300
After today's mediation,

552
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,260
I'll bring you the swimming pool log. So don't be worried.

553
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,980
All her evidence says is that we went to the pool.

554
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,000
Is that so?

555
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:37,300
Then, I'll take it as there's nothing more in store.

556
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes, there's nothing at all.

557
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,330
Please just end it quickly.

558
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,750
Yes, let's do that.

559
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,340
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo!

560
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,400
A separate procedure is to keep each party's statements confidential.

561
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,490
Come this way.

562
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,020
- Everyone can come in.
 - Yes.

563
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,460
We'll pass this over to family fact-finding.

564
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,990
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong, you should live separately from Mr. Chun Hwan Seo.

565
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,400
Thank you.

566
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,290
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

567
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,060
I have more to explain to you. Shall we talk here before you go?

568
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,580
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong, you can leave first.

569
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,410
Yes.

570
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,600
What does it mean I need to get family fact-finding done?

571
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,520
Must I do that?

572
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,740
Yes. When the intent to divorce differs, they tend to listen to—

573
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:22,350
You're not doing this properly! That's why they want family fact-finding! Shit...

574
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,650
That's not it. When the intent to divorce differs, it's mandatory—

575
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,080
Hey, are you a parrot or something?

576
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,620
I told you to get lost.

577
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,610
Just run your trap one more time.

578
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,360
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong can't get a divorce, right?

579
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,350
No.

580
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,300
It makes me think the law's really outdated.

581
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,830
You can't divorce if you can't prove a reason.

582
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,790
Defending within the boundaries of the law

583
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,650
is what a lawyer does, right?

584
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,120
 Railway Restaurant 

585
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,570
- Attorney Jeong.
 - Yeah?

586
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,850
Do you happen to know Mr. Chun Hwan Seo well?

587
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,600
- No, I saw him for the first time during the signing of the MOU. 
 - Oh.

588
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,490
Why do you ask suddenly?

589
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,030
It bothers me a bit.

590
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,540
Did the other party seem to be a victim?

591
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:06,650
She seemed to have been in fear for a long time.

592
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,630
But all plaintiffs in divorce cases look like her.

593
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,810
Was anything different from usual, though?

594
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,700
My instincts are telling me so.

595
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,910
I feel like Chun Hwan Seo will cause trouble.

596
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,630
But that's just your instinct.

597
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,910
It's not evidence.

598
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,420
Attorneys can't exactly defend with their instincts.

599
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,220
You're right.

600
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,670
You said you had something to tell me. What is it?

601
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,930
No, it's nothing.

602
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,280
Let's talk after Chun Hwan Seo's case ends.

603
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,260
All right.

604
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,990
 Daejeong Law Firm 

605
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,620
I apologize for causing you concern.

606
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,080
The young attorney seemed a bit rude.

607
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,570
Young people these days tend to speak their minds.

608
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,440
I'm sorry if you were offended.

609
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,630
I heard Attorney Jeong appointed Attorney Chan Eun Gyeong additionally.

610
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,490
I'd like to see her in person this time.

611
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,190
Of course, you should.

612
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,910
I'll arrange a meeting right away.

613
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,530
 You're not doing this properly! That's why they want family fact-finding! Shit... 

614
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,920
 Hey, are you a parrot or something? 

615
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,420
 I told you to get lost. 

616
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,090
Attorney Cha, are you busy?

617
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,650
No. Do you have something to say?

618
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,100
I heard you're on Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case with Attorney Han.

619
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,850
I'm headed to the Chun Foundation right now.

620
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,850
If you're free, why don't you come with me?

621
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,360
Yes, I can come.

622
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,080
- Shall we go in my car?
 - Yes.

623
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,760
Come down when you're ready.

624
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,810
I think it's my first time

625
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,400
seeing you going to a client in person like this.

626
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,740
Go in person and give briefings for

627
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,160
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case from now on, Attorney Cha.

628
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,810
They'll be our firm's moneymaker for a while.

629
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,840
Yes. I understand.

630
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,310
It's moving smoothly, right?

631
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,380
Yes, there's no substantial evidence of any kind.

632
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,290
I think you can rest assured.

633
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,500
Of course, you should do a good job.

634
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,440
You even stole your hoobae's (junior's) case.

635
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,910
Director.

636
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:49,420
I'm inconveniencing many people because of my son.

637
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,160
Don't mention it.

638
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,200
Our Construction Team and Civil Team are the best.

639
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,450
But our Divorce Team is also the best.

640
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:01,080
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong here will handle it perfectly.

641
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,590
Isn't it true, Attorney Cha?

642
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,630
Yes, Attorney Cha will get you the result you want.

643
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,270
Please rest assured, Director.

644
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,580
I'll be counting on Daejeong, CEO Jeong Wu in.

645
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,330
Attorney Cha, looking at your face,

646
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,480
it seems Attorney Jeong Wu Jin didn't tell you he'll become the CEO, huh?

647
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,110
We have the Director with us, so let's talk about that later.

648
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,660
Please take good care of my son, Director Chun.

649
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,710
Aigoo, I should be asking that of your son.

650
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,980
I'm sorry, but I'll take my leave first because of my schedule.

651
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,150
Oh, sure.

652
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,830
Shall we go have dinner with everyone here?

653
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,920
- Aigoo, let's do that.
 - Oh, yes.

654
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,180
 Did you hear about the CEO's son working at our company? 

655
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,650
 In my opinion, it's Jeon Eun Ho for sure. 

656
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,220
 Jeon Eun Ho. 

657
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,650
 Did you see how he got up and left at 5:59 p.m.? 

658
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,190
 He can't do that unless he's the son. 

659
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,600
 Isn't he way too young to be his son? 

660
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,330
 Please take good care of my son, Director Chun. 

661
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:26,340
 Aigoo, I should be asking that of your son. 

662
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:29,230
 Attorney Cha, looking at your face, 

663
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,770
 it seems Attorney Jeong Wu Jin didn't tell you he'll become the CEO, huh? 

664
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,000
 Why won't you ever tell me anything? 

665
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,200
 Let's be honest here. Okay? 

666
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,700
 We're on the same team. 

667
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,180
Seonbae, let's talk—

668
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,780
I'm sorry to break it like that.

669
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,300
It's been fourteen years.

670
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,220
How can you deceive me every day for fourteen years, face to face?

671
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,810
I didn't mean to deceive you.

672
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,650
I was going to tell you everything once the case was over—

673
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,440
Yes, I'm sure you had to wait until the case was over.

674
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,590
Because it's Chun Foundation, which will bring huge profits to Daejeong.

675
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,170
All of your actions finally make sense now.

676
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,940
Seonbae.

677
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,980
You knew that Chun Hwan Seo physically abused Ms. Yu Ji Yeong, right?

678
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,460
You knew, but you were just catering to the Chun Foundation.

679
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,280
Do you really think I did that?

680
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:01,360
CEO kept trying to fire you, Seonbae, so—

681
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,590
So...

682
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,010
you're saying you told me to

683
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,720
represent that scumbag of a human being,

684
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,540
by stealing my hoobae's place to take a VIP case, to protect me?

685
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,300
You're right.

686
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,640
It was to protect you.

687
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,800
Gosh, what a joke must I have been to you?

688
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,930
Was it fun?

689
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,780
"Was it fun"?

690
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,430
Why are you talking like that?

691
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,900
Hey, you said to be honest since we're on the same team.

692
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,710
Jeong Wu Jin.

693
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,760
Jeong Wu Jin!

694
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,790
You're really a hypocrite.

695
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,830
You'll take Chun Foundation's son's case, but it's not for profit.

696
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,550
Not telling me for more than a decade wasn't to deceive me?

697
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,310
Seonbae, you know that's not what I meant.

698
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,760
Anyhow,

699
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,840
please take care of the case until the end.

700
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,550
Is that an order?

701
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:05,110
If you're going to keep being so twisted,

702
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,210
I'll say it's a work instruction.

703
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:12,390
You know best that a contract is a promise we must keep!

704
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,530
Does Attorney Han know?

705
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,760
Why did you guide him that way?

706
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,640
- He just barged in there—
 - Hello.

707
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,060
Attorney Cha.

708
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,590
What?

709
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:04,810
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo is in your office right now.

710
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,260
Go back to your office.

711
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:18,340
I see you're sitting in my office while I wasn't even present.

712
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,080
Why? Can't I?

713
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,380
What brings you here without any notice?

714
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,440
Are you here to apologize for last time?

715
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:36,430
I believe I'm the one who's owed an apology.

716
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,860
Sorry?

717
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,500
I mean...

718
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,980
you said you'd get this over with soon.

719
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,810
Why? Do you need some pocket money?

720
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:51,120
How much do you need?

721
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,140
Why don't you be honest with me while you're revealing your true colors?

722
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:06,680
The allegation of water torture...

723
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,710
Is that allegation true?

724
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,180
Yes.

725
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,240
That's true.

726
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,040
So what? What will you do?

727
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,070
So what I'm saying is

728
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:34,050
come to your senses and defend me

729
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:37,060
unless you want to end up like her.

730
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,580
If we end up getting a divorce,

731
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,230
do you think I'll let Yu Ji Yeong go? I won't.

732
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,310
I'll just kill her.

733
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,100
If you don't want to see someone die,

734
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,250
do your job properly.

735
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,150
Properly.

736
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,950
Yeah.

737
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,200
Attorney Cha, why was Mr. Chun Hwan Seo here?

738
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,720
It was nothing. Don't worry about it.

739
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,910
How bothersome.

740
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,300
Mom! Mom!

741
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,230
 Why are you here? 

742
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,630
How many times is this?

743
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,820
 Let me live here. 

744
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,880
I'm so scared to death!

745
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,500
 I told you, didn't I? No one will welcome you here if you get a divorce. 

746
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,160
Mom! He really hits me.

747
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,310
What will I do if you turn your back on me, too?

748
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:23,370
 As if he hit you. He said you pushed each other around during an argument. 

749
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:25,130
 He said he was sorry. 

750
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:28,600
- Who did?
 - Son-in-law Chun called us.

751
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,320
Aigoo, Mother.

752
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,910
I'm always sorry.

753
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,630
Gosh, don't mention it. I'm the one who's sorry.

754
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:53,080
Mother, we'll get going now.

755
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,760
Let's go.

756
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,400
Ji Yeong.

757
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,220
You really want to die now, right?

758
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,350
I heard Mr. Chun Hwan Seo was here. What's going on?

759
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,940
Regarding Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case...

760
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,020
Han Yu Ri and I will drop out of it.

761
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,560
Is it Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's attitude?

762
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,720
No, forget his attitude. It's the truth that's stopping me.

763
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,090
I know a contract is a binding promise,

764
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,850
but I can't keep that promise this time.

765
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:52,010
If I have to quit Daejeong

766
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,810
as a result of this.

767
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:00,030
I will.

768
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:05,680
- Seonbae— 
 - And let me ask you a favor.

769
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,730
Keep a close tab on Mr. Chun Hwan Seo.

770
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,400
He told me he'd kill Ms. Yu Ji Yeong.

771
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,430
What do you mean?

772
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,650
 The allegation of water torture... 

773
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,450
 Is that allegation the truth? 

774
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,170
 Yes. 

775
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,360
 - Go back to your office.
 - That's true. 

776
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,240
 So what? What will you do? 

777
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,700
 If we end up getting a divorce, 

778
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,830
 do you think I'll let Yu Ji Yeong go? I won't. 

779
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:44,460
 I'll just kill her. 

780
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:05,200
 If you don't want to see someone die, 

781
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,190
 do your job properly. Okay? 

782
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,900
 Properly. 

783
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:14,280
I'll handle the legal separation for Ms. Yu Ji Yeong.

784
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,930
Please take care of the rest, Attorney Jeong.

785
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,850
All right. I'll take care of the rest.

786
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,300
- Yes?
 -  Hey. 

787
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:05,130
 Attorney Cha? I think you should come over to our house. 

788
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,470
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

789
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,610
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

790
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,170
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, are you here?

791
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:57,520
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong!

792
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,930
Oh, you're here.

793
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,280
Where's Ms. Yu Ji Yeong?

794
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,530
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong.

795
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:25,930
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong? Ms. Yu Ji Yeong!

796
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,290
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong, can you hear me?

797
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,890
 If we end up getting a divorce, do you think I'll let Yu Ji Yeong go? I won't. 

798
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,650
 Please save me. 

799
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,150
 I'll just kill her. 

800
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,610
 If I can't divorce him this time, 

801
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:43,920
 I think it'll only end if I die, Official. 

802
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,920
 My instincts are telling me so. 

803
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,850
 I feel like Chun Hwan Seo will cause trouble. 

804

 Good Partner 

810
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:36,220
 If that's what my attorney thinks, 

811
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:41,340
 I'll make your daughter end up the same way. 

812
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,580
 She would have lived if I had been there a bit sooner. 

813
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,910
 It was lacking evidence to indict him for pre-meditated murder. 

814
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,540
 I want to reveal the truth behind Ms. Yu Ji Yeong's death. 

815
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:53,060
 That will put you in danger, too, Attorney Han. 

816
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,970
 I'm witness to the scene. 

817
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:59,580
 I'll give up my right not to testify and make a statement.
