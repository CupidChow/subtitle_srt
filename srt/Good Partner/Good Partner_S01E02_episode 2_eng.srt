 Good Partner 

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,350
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,010
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:34,990


5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,030
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,830
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,540
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,080
 Child actors were filmed in a safe environment. 

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,170
Why would we come here?

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,450
Gosh, Mom. I'm not going in.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,730
 May the deceased rest in peace. 

12
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,730
What happened?

13
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,050
They suddenly said he had terminal pancreatic cancer about a month ago.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,340
You should've contacted me, then.

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,660
We're not close enough to contact each other, are we?

16
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,940
We're not. However...

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,910
He's Yu Ri's father.

18
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,250
You should've let him say a farewell to his daughter, at least.

19
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,620
She can just say her farewell here, then.

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,750
- What?
 - Hey!

21
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,330
Hurry inside, say bye, and go.

22
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,140
Don't talk to my daughter like that!

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,470
What are you doing here right now?

24
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,620
Mom, it's fine.

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,640
Don't even bother. Let's go.

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,360
Say bye to Dad.

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,250
Why the heck are you doing this to me?

28
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,780
 He was punished for betraying us. 

29
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,250
 That day... 

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,570
 Dad's two women were crying 

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,470
 for different reasons. 

32
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
Attorney Han?

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,080
 And here in this place... 

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,280
 there are two women once again. 

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,770
 Case 02: Two Women 

36
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,460
Attorney Cha!

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,200
 Why do these things keep happening to me? 

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,170
 Why on earth? 

39
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,030
You're still here?

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,930
I came to pick up the verdict.

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,610
Why did you come in at this hour, Attorney Cha?

42
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,880
I came to pick up the records, and the lights were on in your office.

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,150
I was so out of it for a while because of the case.

44
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,630
I toured the office while no one was here.

45
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,190
Sure.

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
Attorney Cha!

47
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,800
I'll get going from here.

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,220
Okay, I'll take the taxi a bit further ahead.

49
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,490
Okay.

50
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,600
Please get home safely.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,140
Take care.

52
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,370
 Episode 2 

53
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,980
- Hello?
 -  Hello, this is T Hotel. 

54
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,650
- Ms. Oh, please show her where she needs to go.
 - Yes, Doctor.

55
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,800
- Please take care.
 - Thank you.

56
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,900
 This is T Hotel. 

57
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,220
 Your check-in is after 3:00 p.m. on Friday. 

58
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,180
Yes?

59
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,070
Attorney Cha.

60
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,030
Kim Min Jeong and Kim Jun Hui are in the lobby for their scheduled consultations.

61
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,180
Oh, is that so?

62
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,230
Should I take them to the VIP consultation room?

63
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,200
You said their property value is high, right?

64
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,600
The litigation opponent of the plaintiff, Kim Min Jeong, owns about six billion won.

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,920
He's the son of the Assemblyman Park Hyeok Sae.

66
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,010
Park Hyeok Sae, who raised a controversy regarding gifting to his son?

67
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,240
Yes, that's right.

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,260
We'll need to take a lot from him in the property division.

69
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,200
You can take them to the VIP consultation office and...

70
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,300
Please tell Attorney Han Yu Ri to come up.

71
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't you always take VIP cases alone?

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,150
You said there are two plaintiffs.

73
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,430
Send up Attorney Han Yu Ri.

74
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,520
Yes.

75
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,640
At first, I didn't even suspect them.

76
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,970
-  It's snowing.  
- It's your favorite snow, Min Jeong.

77
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,170
Should we buy more and take some when we go camping with Jun Hui's family?

78
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,540
That sounds lovely.

79
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,950
Boss, please give us five servings of tteokbokki (rice cakes with chili sauce) to go.

80
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,220
- Yes.
 - Thanks.

81
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,530
I'm so glad you introduced Jun Hui's family to me.

82
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,020
The kids get along so well.

83
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,620
To think I'd get so deeply close with my wife's friend since middle school...

84
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,180
I'm thankful to you, Oppa.

85
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,770
Other husbands would hate it if their wives asked them to go places with their male friend's family.

86
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,630
Why? I love it so much.

87
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,780
Jun Hui's so good to me, calling me "hyeongnim."

88
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
Man, it's so cold.

89
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,350
It's cold, right?

90
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,380
Right, your seatbelt.

91
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,750
 But that bitch's handprint... 

92
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,910
 We sleep in separate rooms because I snore. 

93
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,720
Aigoo, it's cold.

94
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,290
 That's when I should've known. 

95
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,200
 I saw that bastard looking at my wife lovingly and yet... 

96
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,020
Min Seok!

97
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,810
-  H-Hey, Jun Hui. 
 -  I didn't have any doubts. 

98
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,080
 I was talking to Mi Jin about the menu for the camping this weekend. 

99
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,940
Oh, Honey? I must've fallen asleep.

100
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,110
 It's quite late now. Go to sleep now. 

101
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,940
 I'll see you at the camp. 

102
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,170
Y-Yes, Hyeong.

103
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,870
 We didn't even know that and went camping together every weekend 

104
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,110
 like complete morons. 

105
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,270
 Those evil bastards. 

106
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,490
Here's your meat.

107
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,520
Right?

108
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,070
All right. Pass them down.

109
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,120
It's orange!

110
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,700
- Pass them down.
 - Pass them down.

111
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,890
Mom, can I have one glass of Sprite before I eat the orange?

112
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,100
You can't have Sprite.

113
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,170
- Come on. Just one! 
- No, I said you can't have Sprite.

114
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,400
- Drink water.
 - Seung Wu, you want Sprite?

115
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,150
Should we have some Sprite just for today?

116
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,070
- Should I give you some? 
- You can't.

117
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,280
Come on. We're camping.

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,020
Gosh, this is when he gets some.

119
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,110
- Just for today since we're camping. 
- Okay.

120
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,710
Dad's the best, right?

121
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,840
Here's the Sprite Seung Wu loves.

122
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,430
All right. Moms can take the kids and go inside the RVs.

123
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,720
Dads will finish cleaning here.

124
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,470
Hyeongnim, what should we do? Our RV's heater isn't working.

125
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,890
Really?

126
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,360
It'll be a lot colder later at night.

127
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,420
Let's all just sleep together in our RV.

128
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,370
Shall we? But we'd be really intruding.

129
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,810
No need to say that when we're like family.

130
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,610
Here's good news for you kids.

131
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,990
You'll all be sleeping together today!

132
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,230
- Let's go inside now.
 - Let's go!

133
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,150
All right, now. Let's go.

134
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,350
Come on. Go inside.

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,580
Gosh, did I drink too much water?

136
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,380
 I thought I was in hell. 

137
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,750
 I should've killed those bastards on the spot. 

138
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,010
 Who knew those fingers 

139
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,660
 were really that bitch's fingers. 

140
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,080
The puzzle was completed when we put the pieces together later.

141
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,900
I asked myself a hundred times whether I should tell him or not.

142
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,060
It hurts so much I can die,

143
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,820
but should I let my friend feel the same pain?

144
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,590
But not telling him would be an even worse thing to do.

145
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,500
Did your wife admit to it?

146
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,160
At first, she said it was nonsense.

147
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,620
But I showed her the CCTV footage, and she admitted it.

148
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,730
I also recorded her.

149
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,980
Do you have additional evidence, Kim Min Jeong?

150
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,810
Yes, I captured the pictures of when they went away by themselves

151
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,510
and their messages that are on his phone.

152
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,040
Since you secured the evidence well, it'll go well.

153
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,220
Your husband is quite rich, Kim Min Jeong.

154
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,280
We'll need to make him pay a lot.

155
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,460
It's mostly from his father, so would it be possible?

156
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,210
Since his father has a reputation as an assemblyman,

157
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,760
I'll attempt a mediation.

158
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,000
A case where Kim Min Jeong is the plaintiff, and

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,220
another case where Kim Jun Hui is the plaintiff.

160
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,670
We'll be proceeding with two lawsuits that way.

161
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,780
Let's make it a success.

162
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,240
Yes.

163
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,190
All right, all right. Here's your tteokbokki.

164
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,740
Give it a try.

165
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,630
It's just kimbap (seaweed rice roll) and tteokbokki?

166
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,110
"Just"? This place is a really hip place.

167
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,550
It's hard to get a table here.

168
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,370
I went through so much to get a seat by the window here. Seriously.

169
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,080
Try this, too. This is really delicious.

170
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,170
Is it because I ate something delicious? I do feel a bit better.

171
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,740
It's delicious, right? I told you.

172
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,950
To be honest, I was on the job site yesterday.

173
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,990
The job site— You can't.

174
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,720
Did you forget our company is a major law firm?

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,450
It's so hard to get hired.

176
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,250
But it's a waste to quit right away like this.

177
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,410
Attorney Jeon, do you enjoy being a divorce attorney?

178
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,680
Since you started working three months before me, tell me how you feel.

179
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,460
What's this? How did you know I'm your senior by three months? My cover is blown.

180
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,210
My cover is blown.

181
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I thought you were my senior by a few years because you acted like that.

182
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,480
Come on. I'm still your senior, even if by three months.

183
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,870
I honestly applied, thinking divorce cases would be fun.

184
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,880
I love watching dramas, you see. Especially melodramas.

185
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,650
You joined the Divorce Team because you like melodramas?

186
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,370
Yes, they're funny.

187
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,850
There's all these headaches in mergers and criminal litigations,

188
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,320
doing all that research and looking for precedents. Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

189
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,150
Wow.  I found those way more interesting.

190
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,480
 She's so confident. 

191
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,650
 You're so great, huh? 

192
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,620
By the way, Hoobaenim, you're starting to skip the honorifics now, huh?

193
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,660
Is it because we graduated the same year?

194
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,460
We were in the same class, so I could skip the honorifics from now on, right?

195
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,710
It does feel a bit early, but...

196
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,990
Fine. If you can have a comfortable time at work

197
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,260
by skipping the honorifics for me, have it your way.

198
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,550
Attorney Han, please don't leave.

199
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,430
You don't know how many people came and left in the last three months, right?

200
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,990
 Why is he clinging to me like a puppy? 

201
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,970
If the attorney in charge was changed that often,

202
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,580
the clients must've had a lot of complaints.

203
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,720
It was no joke. That's why Attorney Cha was really busy.

204
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,060
She was doing sales here and taking care of complaints there.

205
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,960
She went to the provinces and attended all the trials alone.

206
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,890
I couldn't help but respect her from deep inside.

207
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,300
But Attorney Cha's daughter would only get to see her mom's face on TV.

208
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,010
Gosh, did he cheat on his wife because she's too busy?

209
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,570
Attorney Han, don't be like that. Hang in there for just one more month.

210
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,360
Our lunch is covered by our company,

211
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,160
so I'll buy you all the coffee you need.

212
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,660
Gosh, it's fine. Why would you buy me coffee?

213
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,990
I just want to buy it for you.

214
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,140
What's gotten into you?

215
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,790
- Are you interested in me?
 - What?

216
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,980
Love your colleague and your country.

217
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,010
Don't you know?

218
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,300
Go on. Help yourself.

219
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,080
Endure just one more month. Okay?

220
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,320
Attorney Han, are you working late today?

221
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,860
Yes, I still have things to review.

222
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,430
We'll go ahead and leave, then.

223
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,430
Oh, yes. Take care.

224
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,360
Let's go.

225
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,260
- Get home safe.
 - You, too.

226
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,040
Take care.

227
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,960
All right. Let's go in.

228
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,670
Hello. Boss, do you have a table?

229
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,180
What is it?

230
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,120
You always ate the basic kimbap to save time.

231
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,460
What made you order tteokbokki as well today?

232
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,380
And a spicy tteokbokki, on top of that.

233
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,510
Tell me.

234
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,210
It's not like that. This place is just good.

235
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,900
It can't be what I'm thinking, right?

236
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,520
- Not yet.
 - Not yet?

237
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,400
 I thought she was working late, but she was compositing a letter of resignation. 

238
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,290
Again?

239
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,200
She thinks listening to people venting is what a divorce case is.

240
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,540
I don't think she'll last long.

241
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,190
What about a 20% pay raise?

242
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,630
I'm not sure if she can be controlled with money.

243
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,920
From what I saw back then, she felt uneasy even after winning her first case.

244
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,130
Could that be the reason?

245
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,030
Comfort her a bit if she says she's quitting.

246
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,270
No, thanks. Why would I go that far?

247
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,730
I just won't give Han Yu Ri the chance to talk about it.

248
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,560
Seonbae, if I weren't here, there'd be no one who'd tell you these things.

249
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,450
Don't be too harsh on the kids.

250
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,180
And stop making enemies.

251
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,250
What's this, Attorney Jeong? Are you going somewhere?

252
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,560
Where would I go?

253
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,650
 In session 

254
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,890
 Plaintiff: Kim Hui; Defendant: Park Seok, Choi Jin 

255
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,170
 Plaintiff 

256
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,670
The plaintiffs, Kim Jun Hui and Kim Min Jeong, are friends.

257
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,200
They're of the opposite sex, so to be considerate toward their spouses,

258
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,720
they didn't meet alone and went camping together with their families.

259
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,800
And then their spouses committed adultery together,

260
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,120
so we're requesting divorce and alimony.

261
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,690
Excuse me—

262
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,500
They used to spend time together every weekend like a family,

263
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:24,040
so please note that the plaintiff's emotional damage is greater than that of other similar cases.

264
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,910
Please play the video.

265
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,130
 What did you tell your wife before leaving? 

266
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,320
 I told her I was going to work out. 

267
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,040
 Gosh, that's so lame. You need to give a variety of excuses or she'll start suspecting you. 

268
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,370
 or she'll start suspecting you. 

269
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,120
 It's true I'm working out, though. 

270
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,310
 That's true. 

271
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,240
 Didn't we come here last time? 

272
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,040
 I'm sure that one's the one behind the apartment. 

273
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,870
 This place was newly built. 

274
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,560
 It's confusing because we've been to too many. 

275
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,550
 Let's go. 

276
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,280
Defendants, do you admit to adultery?

277
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,880
It's true the defendants were seen going into the motel.

278
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,520
But they were only close friends, and there was no sexual intercourse.

279
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,520
As you know, proving there was sexual intercourse isn't necessary to establish the act as illegal.

280
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,600
Regarding how the defendants were in a romantic relationship—

281
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,110
It's true we're in love with each other.

282
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,730
Mi Jin, raise your head. Did we do something wrong?

283
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,760
Please sit down.

284
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,540
Your Honor, please add the last statement to the defendant's testimony.

285
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,630
He admitted to the illegal act.

286
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,230
Yes, you can add it!

287
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,530
The second defendant's testimony.

288
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,540
You admit to adultery. Is that correct?

289
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,490
If you classify it as adultery, I guess it must be correct.

290
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,480
But we were sincere toward each other, so I'm not ashamed.

291
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,260
I see.

292
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,580
If the first defendant, Choi Mi Jin, agrees as well,

293
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,350
there'll be no need to proceed with the trials.

294
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,440
What do you say about ending it with a settlement after setting a date for mediation?

295
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,120
Yes, I hope to end things peacefully with a settlement.

296
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,380
I'll agree to divorce,

297
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,910
but I won't agree to custody.

298
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,030
I'm going to take custody.

299
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,170
Regarding your own children's custody,

300
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,730
you can talk about them again during the trial your wife requested.

301
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,970
In this case, Kim Jun Hui is the plaintiff and

302
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,720
you're sitting here as the second defendant and her affair right now, Park Min Seok.

303
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,880
Don't talk about your children here.

304
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,180
As I said... Seung Wu.

305
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,850
I'm saying I want to be the one to raise Seung Wu.

306
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,530
You're talking about Seung Wu,

307
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:11,250
the child of Kim Jun Hui and Choi Mi Jin, not your own children?

308
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,100
Yes.

309
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,670
Your Honor, could you please add this to the record as well?

310
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,900
Second Defendant, please sit down.

311
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,460
All right, now. Does the first defendant agree with him?

312
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,710
Yes, I want to raise the kids together with this man.

313
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,790
I'll be setting the next date for mediation.

314
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,090
Park Min Seok's wife and Choi Mi Jin's husband will also be

315
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,550
attending the mediation as participants that day.

316
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,610
Let's have all four people of interest have a talk.

317
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,720
- Take a seat here. 
- Yes.

318
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,150
- Thank you for your time. 
- Thank you for your time.

319
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,530
- Attorney?
 - Yes.

320
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,760
How may I help you?

321
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,860
As you know, Park Min Seok's father is a renowned assemblyman.

322
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,610
So, there's nothing good to be gained from having his son's affair becoming known.

323
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,050
I don't think that's your business.

324
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,220
Wouldn't mediation be better than a verdict of adultery?

325
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,350
Please bring us a good settlement agreement.

326
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,480
I'll be waiting.

327
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,020
Let's go.

328
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,020
What did you tell him?

329
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,850
The easiest way.

330
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,560
You'll find out on the next date.

331
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,910
Why are you saying there's not enough evidence?

332
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,830
When I made eye contact with that woman,

333
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,810
she glared at me like this for sure.

334
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,320
That woman's surely his affair.

335
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,020
I'm telling you, she is!

336
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:18,180
Yes, but we can't show her glare to the court.

337
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,060
So I told you to record your husband confessing.

338
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,370
Did you give it a try?

339
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,350
Of course, I did!

340
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,060
But he denied it, so what can I do?

341
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,130
Well, how did you go about it?

342
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,180
You didn't ask the question I told you never to ask, did you?

343
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,080
I just asked if he slept with her or not.

344
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,060
Gosh, I couldn't help it because I was furious.

345
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,110
When you ask if he slept with her or not,

346
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:48,040
is there anyone who'd answer, saying he did?

347
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,830
But if you keep this up, you'll lose your chance to secure evidence.

348
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,750
Hello.

349
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,240
You're here, Attorney Cha?

350
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,390
- Hey—
 - How was the trial? I'm sure you did well.

351
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,460
I'll be going first, then.

352
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,100
Right on the dot.

353
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,500
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

354
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,660
Geez!

355
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,360
"You'll find out on the next date?"

356
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,410
It's because she's so bad at communicating

357
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,420
that she doesn't know her husband's doing that.

358
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
 A true story about adultery told by a divorce attorney. 

359
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,600
 Attorney, are there actually a lot of cases where adultery happens 

360
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,850
-  this close?  
- My goodness!

361
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,280
-  Most adultery happens near you. 
 - Seriously.

362
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,140
I have to see this face again after getting off work?

363
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,580
 It's commonplace at work, between neighbors, with friends' spouses, 

364
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,550
 and even among relatives. 

365
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,960
-  Oh, my.  
-  Are there a lot of cases where 

366
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,790
 you still don't know when they're happening so close? 

367
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,820
 Yes, people committing adultery are always near you. 

368
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,420
There's even a case where they never noticed it for years

369
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,710
where they cheated with someone who lived next door.

370
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,920
 Next door? 

371
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,290
-  Your husband probably can't lie since you're so scary.  
- It's happening to you right now.

372
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,670
 Right? 

373
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,130
Do I tell her?

374
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,160
 Cha Eun Gyeong 

375
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,500
Thank you.

376
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,880
Whoa, the weather's so nice today.

377
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,510
I thought I'd get to drink at hotel lounges

378
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,200
if I became an attorney, like they do in the dramas.

379
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,480
Huh? You're looking down on the convenience store beer and ramen now.

380
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,770
Just look at the cherry blossoms. How pretty are they?

381
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,010
Gosh, seriously. Look at the flower petals floating.

382
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,240
Also, you go to hotel lounges if you've already been there.

383
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,510
It's not a place where goody-two-shoes suddenly go to because they became an attorney.

384
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,800
Drinking the vending machine coffee while studying at the library

385
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,560
and drinking the convenience store beer while writing a letter at the office...

386
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,320
What's changed in my life?

387
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,090
I see. Thank you for telling me your sob story.

388
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,450
Why did you call me all the way out here after I got off work?

389
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,870
We already had lunch together.

390
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,120
- My friend's friend...
 - Yes.

391
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,980
witnessed her close eonni's husband having an affair.

392
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,220
But it seems she's not sure if she should tell the wife.

393
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,060
What would you do in this case, Attorney Jeon?

394
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,250
Me? I'd tell her right away.

395
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,910
Don't I look like I'd tell her right away?

396
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,050
Yes, you do seem that way.

397
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,290
Attorney Han, you're crossing the line a bit just because we're skipping honorifics.

398
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,490
Just kidding.

399
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,890
But ignorance might be bliss.

400
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,960
How is it bliss when you're ignorant? It's obviously better to know.

401
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,640
Isn't it a waste to use your time and energy on someone who betrayed you?

402
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,720
So, you'd tell her right away if it were you?

403
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,830
Of course. And if my future wife should ever cheat on me,

404
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,310
it's over right away.

405
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,390
Why live with her? There are plenty of women out there.

406
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,370
Even if there are plenty of women out there,

407
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,780
she's the one you chose with difficulty.

408
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,410
It's the same as stepping on poop.

409
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,420
I can just consider it was a bad decision and meet someone else.

410
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,680
It must be great to keep everything so simple.

411
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,700
Is that why you called me out to ask such a simple question?

412
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,320
What are we going to eat for lunch tomorrow?

413
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,100
 Seoul Family Court 

414
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,670
What are you staring at?

415
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,890
Attorney Cha...

416
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,350
 Resignation Letter 

417
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,720
 I can't let her talk at all. 

418
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,030
- I'm— 
- If you have something to say,

419
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,300
won't you wait until this case is done?

420
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,180
If I tell you then, won't it be too late?

421
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,650
Too late for what?

422
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,750
- It's better than being hasty. 
- Sorry?

423
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,040
 What's she talking about? 

424
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,670
You asked what I told the opposing attorney after the trial last time, right?

425
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,910
Did you attempt a settlement?

426
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,250
I lightly mentioned his father, the assemblyman.

427
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,030
I can only hope the opposing attorney realized it.

428
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,910
I was telling him to offer a bigger amount than usual if he wanted to protect his reputation.

429
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,660
I don't think money will be the dealmaker because custody is at stake, too.

430
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,500
Is there anything money can't buy?

431
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,340
Anything money can't buy?

432
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,510
It must be a person's feelings.

433
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,600
 You'll quit even if you get a raise, huh? 

434
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,230
Sure.

435
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,980
I got it.

436
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,130
- Are you Kim Min Jeong? 
- I'm Choi Mi Jin.

437
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,870
That's where the plaintiffs sit.

438
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,180
You need to sit on this side.

439
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,010
I can understand why you'd get confused.

440
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,860
This isn't a couples' dinner. The defendants can sit together.

441
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,570
Can we convey our agreement plan first, Commissioner?

442
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:41,020
Please talk about the mediation plan for Kim Jun Hui and Choi Mi Jin's divorce first.

443
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,130
Yes.

444
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,080
Their total net worth is about 500 million won.

445
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,440
Their marriage is also less than ten years old.

446
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,900
Since Choi Mi Jin didn't have any income during marriage,

447
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,070
we're willing to pay about 100 million won in consideration of

448
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,670
her chores and housework, which is about 20% of the contribution.

449
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,120
The dad will take custody, and we ask for 500,000 won in child support.

450
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,370
Choi Mi Jin, please give us your opinion.

451
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,830
Yes.

452
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,280
I didn't make money, but I still can't leave with 100 million won.

453
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,000
I heard other people's stories, and they got at least half when they divorced.

454
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,630
Your marriage was short and

455
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,730
it's only the house Kim Jun Hui's parents bought for your marriage that went up in value.

456
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,120
There's no technical wealth you built as a couple, so you can't take half.

457
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,620
Commissioner, does this make sense?

458
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,950
Also, I'll take custody.

459
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,650
You committed adultery with your son's favorite friend's dad and

460
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,830
you're going to take custody?

461
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,430
Can you... really live with Seung Wu,

462
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,820
ever so shamelessly?

463
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,660
I'm the one who raised Seung Wu.

464
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,130
Seung Wu can't live without me.

465
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,630
You're the one who can't live without Seung Wu.

466
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,990
One moment.

467
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,780
Please listen to the agreement plan I brought.

468
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,170
- Let's hear it.
 - Yes.

469
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,280
As he said during the last trial,

470
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,810
Park Min Seok wishes to raise all three children,

471
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,320
meaning he wants to raise everyone's children himself.

472
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,670
F***ing lunatic.

473
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,440
Hey, you're saying that again?

474
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,100
Why would you raise my kid?

475
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,800
Now, now.

476
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,410
Please hear it out to the end first.

477
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,590
Yes. Instead, Park Min Seok will give

478
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,480
two billion won to Kim Min Jeong, which is about 30% of his wealth.

479
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,120
And there won't be any division of property between Kim Jun Hui and Choi Mi Jin, either.

480
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,760
Which means she won't even take the 100 million won Attorney Cha suggested earlier.

481
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,570
Crazy bastard.

482
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,720
Are you trying to buy the kids with money or something?

483
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,740
Man, I knew you were a nutcase.

484
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,160
But you were a worse son of a bitch than I thought.

485
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,420
He can't.

486
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,270
Hey, say he can't do that right now!

487
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,710
Be quiet for a minute.

488
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,230
How confusing would it be when people they used to call

489
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,430
"uncle and aunt" suddenly become their dad and mom?

490
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,780
Can't you think in the children's shoes?

491
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,380
This is child abuse.

492
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,930
The court mustn't overlook this, either.

493
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,000
Think realistically.

494
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,200
You can't earn two billion won even if you worked your entire life.

495
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,550
I'm considering an international school

496
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,270
you mentioned before.

497
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,230
For now, we were given a sudden offer, so we'll need some time to think.

498
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,500
If you give us a few days, we'll get back to you with a response.

499
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,110
Yes. Let's do that.

500
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,600
How can you roll your eyes at the attorney on your side in the court?

501
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,440
Attorney Cha, this is wrong.

502
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,510
What's wrong with it? Let me hear you out.

503
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,140
If the kids live together, they won't grow up normally for sure.

504
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,590
It's bad enough to be featured in a precedent for a special child abuse law.

505
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,530
Okay, and?

506
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,890
Shouldn't you cut off such ridiculous agreement plans on the spot?

507
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,980
Are you the police? Or a social worker?

508
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,580
You're the plaintiff's attorney!

509
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,490
I'm telling you this because I'm the plaintiff's attorney.

510
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,410
You also saw how Kim Jun Hui said he wouldn't accept it then and there.

511
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,500
What about Kim Min Jeong?

512
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,830
There's no way Kim Min Jeong would give up her children for two billion won.

513
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,010
It's so easy for you, Attorney Han. Lucky you.

514
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,030
Sorry?

515
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,230
You think as you please and act as if it's the truth.

516
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,350
If Kim Min Jeong chooses two billion won, is she abandoning her children?

517
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,730
Didn't you think she might choose it for her children?

518
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,950
Do you even know how much international school costs per year?

519
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,350
I'm sure it's higher than your salary.

520
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,740
I don't think she'd ever choose

521
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,310
money if she's a parent.

522
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,500
We're representatives.

523
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,190
It's because I'm a representative

524
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,250
that I have a duty to explain how hurt the children will be

525
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,460
and the meaning of the agreement plan to her.

526
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,910
Ms. Kim Min Jeong would know better than you how hurt the children will be.

527
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,120
Cha Eun Gyeong seems more and more weird.

528
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,170
- Oh, hello.
 - Hello.

529
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,320
Is it because she's blinded by the success fee?

530
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,490
- Hello.
 - Hello.

531
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,170
I mean, getting a lot of success fee means

532
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,290
the client will be paid a lot as well. Isn't it a win-win?

533
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,780
That's not it!

534
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,210
It's not a win-win situation like that.

535
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,740
We're weighing between money and children here.

536
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,410
Attorney Han, getting carried away is taboo.

537
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,040
You're being too nosy right now.

538
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,900
If you keep this up, it'll only be harder on you.

539
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,050
I mean it.

540
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,940
- Attorney Han, come over here for a second. 
- What?

541
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,400
- Hello. Yes. 
- Hi, have you eaten?

542
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,120
- Did you eat, Attorney Jung?
 - Yes.

543
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,370
- Did you eat?
 - Yes.

544
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,780
I'm just curious about something.

545
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,550
If you witness a spouse of someone you know commit adultery,

546
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,820
would you tell the person or not, Attorney Jung?

547
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,000
Is it about a case?

548
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,290
N-No, I'm just curious.

549
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,790
If it were me, I'd tell right away.

550
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,130
I was wondering what you'd say.

551
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,270
- I'd ignore it.
 - What?

552
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,170
Is there a need to stick your nose in someone else's business?

553
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:10,050
I'll have to wait first until the person takes care of it.

554
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,290
You're completely different, huh?

555
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,680
By the way, Attorney Jung,

556
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,170
Director Kim Ji Sang doesn't come to work every day, does he?

557
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,260
No, he works at a medical office in his neighborhood

558
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,700
and comes in sometimes as our law firm's medical advisor.

559
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,520
I see.

560
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,380
I never got to introduce myself.

561
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,980
I'll introduce you to him soon.

562
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,880
Oh, yes.

563
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,520
I'll pay what I have to for the division of property.

564
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,580
I don't intend to let him flex and cover up his sin with money.

565
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,410
You made the right decision.

566
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,600
Fight for custody to the end and

567
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,130
you've got to engrave "adultery" in the verdict,

568
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,130
so he has to live with it for life.

569
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,220
You'll only get 20 million won in alimony if you get any and

570
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,680
if you accept the agreement plan, you'd be profiting 100 million won. You know that, right?

571
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,250
Yes, I've made up my mind.

572
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,080
I think Mom will be given custody anyway,

573
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,400
so I think it'd be to your advantage to give it to her as if you're being kind and save money at least.

574
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,250
No.

575
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,510
If it were you,

576
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,200
if your husband committed adultery

577
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,470
and tried to solve things with money because he didn't want the verdict,

578
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,010
would you be able to forgive him?

579
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:36,370
I'm saying we should be realistic, not forgive.

580
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,350
Well, it's 100 million won, so I understand.

581
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:43,790
However, I think two billion won will be different. Ms. Kim Min Jeong?

582
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,900
Could you pour me one more, please?

583
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,540
Yes.

584
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,080
I'll just be trash.

585
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,700
Hey.

586
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,740
You're going to exchange your children for money?

587
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,350
It's two billion won, not 200 million.

588
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,300
Park Min Seok will justify himself by paying that money, saying his sins were washed away.

589
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,000
You can say that because you're competent, Attorney Han.

590
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,970
My children grew up going to English academies and wearing luxury clothing.

591
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,130
I can't do that for them if they come to me.

592
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,020
My parents run a restaurant in the countryside, so they don't have time to help me.

593
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,690
And you said all of his wealth belongs to his dad, so I won't even get much if we get a verdict.

594
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,020
It's two, not even one.

595
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,330
I can't raise them.

596
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,770
Just because you hand over custody, you're not giving up being a mom.

597
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,740
The non-custodial parent actually becomes more affectionate,

598
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,540
treating the child better and keeping a good relationship in some cases.

599
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,870
You made the right decision.

600
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:23,670
Even if a mom is incompetent, children want to live with their mom.

601
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,340
They wouldn't want to live with the mistress.

602
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,070
The kids really like each other,

603
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,190
so wouldn't they be able to live happily, thinking they're camping every day?

604
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,050
Hey, cut the ridiculous justification.

605
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,970
Then, that asshole wouldn't be losing a single thing.

606
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,820
Why do you think Park Min Seok offered such a huge amount of money?

607
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,660
Just to flex, as Mr. Kim Jun Hui said?

608
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,800
That's how he's always been.

609
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,050
He's just trying to crush us with money right now.

610
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,980
Perhaps he's aware of how grave his sin is.

611
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,200
He probably wants to forgive himself even if he has to spend a lot of money.

612
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,700
Park Min Seok isn't losing anything?

613
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,620
Money.

614
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,590
He's losing two billion won of his money.

615
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,730
Park Min Seok lost his wife and family and two billion won.

616
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,300
He's the person who lost the most here.

617
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,670
So don't think you'll be losing.

618
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,960
You're winning.

619
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:37,480
The children might remember their father as someone who took responsibility to the end

620
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,060
and their mother as someone who left them.

621
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,680
Attorney Han Yu Ri.

622
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,620
Who said you can be the judge here?

623
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,510
You crossed the line.

624
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,580
Apologize to her.

625
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,820
I'm sorry.

626
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,280
I was just thinking in the children's shoes.

627
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,710
Whatever decision you make,

628
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,420
your decision is the best decision.

629
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,920
Don't harbor any guilt and

630
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,310
just think about the best in this situation.

631
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,340
That's for both of you.

632
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,270
We, as attorneys, will defend according to what you say, no matter what.

633
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,190
 Seoul Family Court 

634
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,200
What did the plaintiffs decide to do about the

635
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,200
agreement plan the defendant suggested last time?

636
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,350
We'll accept it.

637
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,680
Ms. Kim Min Jeong, what will you do?

638
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,450
Yes, I'll do the same as well.

639
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,830
 Mediation Room  
Once all four of you sign,

640
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,430
the case will be closed.

641
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,990
Plaintiff Kim Min Jeong and Defendant Park Min Seok will divorce.

642
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,150
Defendant Park Min Seok is made the custodial parent.

643
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,990
The defendant pays the plaintiff two billion won in the division of property.

644
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,000
Plaintiff Kim Jun Hui and Defendant Choi Mi Jin will divorce.

645
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,200
Defendant, Choi Mi Jin, is made the custodial parent.

646
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,960
There won't be any alimony or division of property.

647
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:45,150
All right. All the procedures have been completed now.

648
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,530
- Thank you for your time. 
- One moment, please!

649
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,050
One moment, please.

650
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,960
Mi Jin...

651
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,190
please make sure...

652
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,460
to raise our baby well.

653
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:16,660
If he asks why dad is not living with him suddenly,

654
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,670
tell him I live near my workplace...

655
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,860
because I need to make more money.

656
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,540
Don't ever tell him what you did wrong.

657
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,520
Do you understand?

658
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,260
Don't be so strict about Sprite, either.

659
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,810
I got it. I'll do that.

660
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,230
I'm sorry.

661
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,320
It's my fault.

662
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,760
 Two women are crying here again. 

663
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,690
 How will they live from now on? 

664
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:08,020
 When did the starting point of their happy days turn into 

665
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,550
 the current devastating moment? 

666
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,720
Kim Jun Hui said he'd never accept it.

667
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,490
But why did he change his mind?

668
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,870
I sent him the family fact-finding report.

669
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,930
Did you review it?

670
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,570
 Did my son... 

671
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:39,910
really tell the family fact-finding officials this?

672
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,950
Yes. Well, it seems he already realized what's happening.

673
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,920
They didn't even ask him,

674
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,550
but he apparently asked to live with his mom.

675
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,470
He said his mom needs him.

676
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:01,020
I still think it's crazy for all three children to live together.

677
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,730
Why are you being so naïve and obsessed with that?

678
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,960
Do you think those two will really live together?

679
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,300
That's what every adulterer says in court, male or female.

680
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,280
That they'll share their futures together.

681
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,870
Do they think they'd look a bit less filthy by saying that?

682
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,270
They won't live together, so just wait and see.

683
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:28,320
Still, Kim Min Jeong got her children taken away.

684
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,070
She didn't get them taken away. She let them keep them.

685
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:37,070
 Ta-da! This is mom's new home. 

686
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,000
- Mom?
 - Yes?

687
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,810
 While meeting frequently through visitation, 

688
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,720
 they're bound to say they want to go live with Mom. 

689
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,410
Call Dad for me.

690
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,950
 Park Min Seok is also doing that to gain justification right now. 

691
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:55,340
 But he'll become busy again soon, so he'll want to send the kids away. 

692
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,340
- Yes, Daughter. 
-  Dad. 

693
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,810
 I had to leave before I could see the night opening again. 

694
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,330
Can't we sleep a few more days at Mom's place

695
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,590
 so we can see it before we go? 

696
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,900
Yes, sure. Dad is in an important meeting right now.

697
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,390
Stay a few more days at Mom's place.

698
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,930
 Yes. Dad, I love you. 

699
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,630
Yes, I love you.

700
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,900
 A person who enjoys the fight itself 

701
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,330
loses steam the moment the referee is gone.

702
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,300
It's not like it's easy to win back custodial rights.

703
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,540
Just because the child wants to live with mom,

704
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,850
they can't change the custodial parent right away.

705
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,580
Come on, now.

706
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,160
If the kid just goes to live with mom, what can the court do?

707
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,890
As you know, there's no forced execution for sending back minor children.

708
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,150
 Kim Min Jeong will get to own a home 

709
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,720
 and get her children back in the end. 

710
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,830
This is a perfect win.

711
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,420
Well, it was inevitable for the children to get hurt.

712
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,810
We maximize the benefit for our clients in the situation we're given.

713
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,240
Kim Min Jeong got a home and you, Attorney Han...

714
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,390
got a bag.

715
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,190
- What?
 - Please go to the shop.

716
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,170
A-Am I going to buy a bag?

717
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:14,830
Do you know what our success fee is for settling Kim Min Jeong's case with two billion won?

718
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:20,010
It'll be hard for you to see this amount again while working as an attorney.

719
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,930
No, I'm really okay, Attorney Cha.

720
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,440
No, I'm not okay with it.

721
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,000
Let's see.

722
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,110
She told me to show you ones that are big enough for A4 papers.

723
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,230
Please try this one on.

724
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,840
Th-Thank you.

725
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,320
 Wedding Anniversary 

726
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,630
One, two, three. 
 First Anniversary 

727
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,040
- Congrats!
 - Congrats!

728
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,290
Whoa, I get to celebrate a wedding anniversary, thanks to you.

729
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,650
I was going to leave earlier.

730
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,430
It's fine. It isn't easy to leave early when you're at work.

731
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,310
I'll become a partner attorney soon, so just hang in there.

732
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,950
- I'm sure it'll get better. 
- Yes.

733
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,710
I'm sure it will. My great wife.

734
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,600
- Fighting!
 - Fighting!

735
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,480
I'll make more money and buy you the watch I couldn't get you for the wedding.

736
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,540
Gosh, I'm fine.

737
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,040
Just spending time together like this is the best.

738
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,650
Also... Ta-da.

739
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,790
- Open it.
 - What is it?

740
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,570
What's this? What's in it?

741
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,370
Do you like it?

742
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,540
You look at your watch a lot.

743
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,600
So, think of me once in a while when you do.

744
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,900
Thank you.

745
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,250
Thank you!

746
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,690
Welcome.

747
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,200
Is there any specific style you're looking for?

748
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,560
I came to pick up an item I had ordered in advance.

749
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,280
I'm sorry, but are you Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?

750
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,710
Yes, I am.

751
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,730
Daebak. One moment, please.

752
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,460
It's this one, right?

753
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,790
- Yes.
 - Gosh, I'm a big fan.

754
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,440
I also love "All About Divorce."

755
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,040
I watched it a few days ago, too.

756
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,860
How can he have an affair with his wife's friend? Crazy.

757
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,570
This is daebak. I'm sorry, but could I get an autograph, please?

758
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,260
- Yes.
 - One moment.

759
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,500
 Dear Hye Rim! 

760
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,570
 Wish you a happy family! 

761
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,690
 Wishing you happiness! 

762
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,460
Gosh, thank you so much.

763
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,860
Attorney Cha.

764
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,760
- Did you pick one?
 - Yes.

765
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,410
Thank you so much.

766
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,970
Attorney Han, I'm sorry, but you were with Attorney Cha, right?

767
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,910
- Yes.
 - Did Attorney Cha go home?

768
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,990
Yes, she went home for the day. Why do you ask?

769
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,750
It's nothing.

770
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,450
 Are there a lot of cases where you still don't know 

771
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,400
 when they're happening so close? 

772
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,040
 Yes, people committing adultery are always near you. 

773
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,790
The CCTV footage for the 16th floor?

774
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:59,150
That's open only to partner-level attorneys.

775
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:02,560
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong sent me.

776
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,090
Yes.

777
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,490
 Wedding Anniversary 

778
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,920
 
  I came home to get changed. 

779
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,080
 You're coming to the hotel, right? 

780
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,140
Mom.

781
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,410
You weren't sleeping?

782
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,480
When on earth will Dad's conference end?

783
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,730
Why isn't he coming home?

784
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,430
I'll ask him.

785
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,690
Dad always says he'll come home early.

786
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,370
I miss Dad.

787
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,490
Go to sleep now.

788
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,130
I'll take care of something and be back.

789
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,400
 I'll see you at the hotel. 

790
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,900
Last week Monday would be...

791
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,850
All right.

792
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,750
Yu Ri wants to eat japchae, huh?

793
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:10,950
Please put a lot of mushrooms.

794
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,960
Go on and choose. We can add mushrooms to the japchae (Korean stir-fried glass noodles).

795
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,030
Hello.

796
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,210
H-Honey, this is Senior Manager Kim from work.

797
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,630
- You know her, right? 
- Oh, yes.

798
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,670
She just moved to the neighborhood.

799
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,300
- Madam, nice to meet you. 
- Hello.

800
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,920
Let's meet often now that we live closer.

801
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,750
Sure, you can come over anytime.

802
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,480
Okay.

803
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,100
- See you tomorrow.
 - Yeah, I'll see you at work.

804
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,560
What else?

805
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,820
- Do we need meat? 
- Yes, we do.

806
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,680
- Okay, should we head over? 
- Okay.

807
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,160
 I asked myself a hundred times whether I should tell him or not. 

808
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,560
 But do I have to make my friend feel the same pain? 

809
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,400
 But not telling him would be an even worse thing to do. 

810
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:17,860


811
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,110
You absolutely had to speak to me at this hour at my home?

812
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,990
Yes. I ought to have sooner.

813
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,100
Fine, go ahead. Make it quick.

814
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,800
I have to go somewhere right now. Hurry.

815
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,160
Your husband, Attorney Cha...

816
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,060
Director Kim Ji Sang...

817
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,250
has another woman.

818
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,910
And?

819
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,360
Sorry?

820
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,780
I said your husband

821
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,810
is having an affair.

822
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,600
I'm aware.

823
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,120
Then you're also aware of who he's seeing?

824
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,820
I am.

825
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,850
Choi Sa Ra.

826
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:39,560
 A wife is bound to find out if her husband cheats on her, no matter what. 

827
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,430
 She knows through all her senses. 

828
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:46,720
 There are just people who didn't get to secure substantial evidence. 

829
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,060
♫  Facing challenges, I persisted  ♫

830
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,950
♫  Learning to navigate heavy days  ♫

831
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,870
♫  But, it's still hard  ♫

832
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:05,490
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫

833
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:09,390
♫    ♫

834
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:12,150
♫  will also blurr  ♫

835
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,880
♫  Keep holding on  ♫

836
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,730
♫  In the end there will be a bright day  ♫

837
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,430
 Good Partner 

838
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,260
-  You had a boyfriend? 
-  I'll introduce him when I get a chance. 

839
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,010
 No way. You're not going to get a divorce? 

840
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,930
 What will I have left by doing that? 

841
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,890
 How can you let those people get away with it? 

842
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,440
 When he called me and said he'd kill himself... 

843
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,390
 should I have done something? 

844
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:45,520
 I don't think I can work in the Divorce Team anymore. 

845
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:52,100
♫  Feel free to pause—, please take a break  ♫
