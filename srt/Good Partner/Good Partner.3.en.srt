Hello, I'm Attorney Cha Eun Kyung, your representative.

15
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,660
Ms. Cha,

16
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,229
in TV dramas,

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,669
we see many affairs caught first...

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,669
not by the spouses, but by those around them.

19
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:11,470
Is that often the case in real-life situations?

20
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,440

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,410
(Letter of Appointment, Kim Ji Sang)

22
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:21,118
We appreciate you coming on board...

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,780
despite your busy schedule.

24
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,349
We'll look forward to the married couple's devotion...

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,720
to our law firm.

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,020
You're too kind. I'm the one who's grateful.

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,029
Medical disputes we take on at Daejeong...

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,059
will be of even better quality.

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,669
(Episode 3)

30
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,300
Jae Hui, is there anything you need?

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,970
I only wanted some water.

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Jae Hui.

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,178
- Isn't it delicious? - Hey, Jae Hui.

34
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,079
- Hi. - Hi, Jae Hui.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,178
- It's been so long. - Gosh.

36
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:58,449
- Goodness. - You're a big girl now.

37
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,418
Jae Hui, we're celebrating a big day for your dad,

38
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,190
so I hope you won't mind the loud chatter.

39
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,059
It's fine by me.

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,030
I'll head upstairs.

41
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,269
- Sure. - Good night.

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,729
- Good night. - How sweet of her.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,239
- Isn't she a sweetheart? - She's adorable.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,839
As the newly appointed...

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,209
in-house medical expert of Law Firm Daejeong,

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,739
Director Kim should say a few words.

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,310
Right. Well,

48
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,909
I'm busy up to my neck...

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,479
with the hospital and raising Jae Hui,

50
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,120
so I'm worried about the added responsibility.

51
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,418
I'll do my best though.

52
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,549
- Gosh. - Nice!

53
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,359
Congratulations. Let's raise our glasses, then.

54
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,459
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

55
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,060
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

56
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,229
How did he get to join us as an in-house medical expert?

57
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,758
Did you propose it?

58
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,099
Mr. Oh voiced his concern over the quality of our medical cases.

59
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,369
I suggested bringing my husband on board first...

60
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,609
- and told him about it. - I see.

61
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,309
That means...

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,979
Director Kim now has two offices.

63
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,350
One at the law firm...

64
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:58,850
and one at the hospital.

65
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,179
Working in close proximity will allow me...

66
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,680
to see her at least once more.

67
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,850
- No way! - My gosh.

68
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,960
Can you be more of a love whisperer?

69
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,759
You're being weird.

70
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,828
I see everyone's glasses are empty.

71
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,298
Would you all like another drink?

72
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,530
- Sure. - Of course I'd like another.

73
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,939
We're out of booze though.

74
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,410
- Is it empty? - It is.

75
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,879
Ma'am, could you check the fridge for me?

76
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,078
- Have a drink. - Gosh, thanks.

77
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,008
There isn't any, but I'll go out to get some.

78
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,749
Gosh, no. I'll go instead.

79
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
By yourself?

80
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,449
I doubt you know where the store is.

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,818
I'll get the drinks for us.

82
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,388
Sure, you should go instead.

83
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,819
- I'll be back in no time. - Right.

84
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,530
Ms. Cha, allow me to pour you a glass.

85
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,099
It'll be a lot to carry by himself,

86
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,728
- so I'll help. - What?

87
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,630
- I bet it was quite the hassle. - Gosh, no.

88
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,798
You should try this.

89
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,799
Those still here should raise our glasses.

90
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,769
- Sounds good. - Sure thing.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,009
Yes, it happens on many occasions.

92
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,969
Even though the spouses who are being cheated on...

93
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,940
find something to be odd,

94
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,679
a defense mechanism kicks in...

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,780
which tells them that it can't be true.

96
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,449
That's why those around them figure it out first.

97
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:15,859
How do you feel about the car now that it's been a few days?

98
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,460
I like how quiet it is.

99
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,059
I definitely prefer sedans to sports cars.

100
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,868
Of course. You're sensitive to sound.

101
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:24,900
Right.

102
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,799
Anyway, I need to study up on all these features.

103
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,798
I like how wide the display is.

104
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,809
Right.

105
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,339
Hold on. Is this a featured option?

106
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,579
- What's this? - Leave it!

107
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,179
Sender, Director Choi. "Where are you?"

108
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,978
"Where are you?" is the key phrase...

109
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,080
that leads to spouses discovering the affair.

110
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,489
"Where are you?" might seem harmless and meaningless,

111
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,219
but it's an intimate phrase only said between those...

112
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,989
who share their everyday lives.

113
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,590
Who's that?

114
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,660
A director at my hospital, of course.

115
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,700
I should be back by now after lunch.

116
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,559
I see.

118
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:01,998
Sa Ra, why does it take you long...

119
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,510
to get back to the office after dropping by the courthouse?

120
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,970
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,409
There's always heavy traffic on the way back,

122
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,210
so I just take the liberty to grab my lunch...

123
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,280
since I'm stuck between lunch hour anyway.

124
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:15,650
You're dismissed.

125
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,548
What if you have no definitive proof...

126
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:20,760
of your spouse's affair?

127
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,919
Should you feign ignorance?

128
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,358
Yes. While you gather the necessary evidence,

129
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,299
you must play dumb.

130
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,529
- Until you have absolute proof, - Hello.

131
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,570
be patient.

132
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,270
Director Kim isn't here at the moment.

133
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm here with documents needed for his contract.

134
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,970
Could you pass these along?

135
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,869
But he'll be here in about ten minutes.

136
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,809
Is he on his lunch break?

137
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,179
Wait. Didn't you know?

138
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,220
He's only been seeing patients in the afternoon lately.

139
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,689
Gosh, of course. It slipped my mind.

Yes, she left it in my car...

after the trip to the museum yesterday.

152
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,489
You should've given it back to her already.

153

Please stay calm,

184
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,080
and escape from the tunnel of agony.

185
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,550
(Case 03: From Family to Non-family)

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Ms. Cha,

187
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,290
you were aware of it all?

188
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,229
What are you playing at by coming to my house at this hour?

189
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,340
Well...

190
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,008
I thought you'd be clueless.

191
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,479
That's what you thought? Me?

192
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,149
Are you not...

193
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,279
going to divorce him?

194
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,019
I'm not.

195
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,320
I won't divorce him, so save the drama.

196
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,290
How can you let them get away with it?

197
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,728
If it were me, I'd immediately file for divorce...

198
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,398
and tell everyone at the office as well as the press.

199
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,070
What do I get out of it?

200
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:02,070
Can it be solved with a divorce,

201
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,109
a division of assets, and an alimony of 20,000 dollars?

202
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,008
Adultery isn't punishable by law anymore,

203
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,680
so that's the only legal action you can take.

204
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,608
I'm truly surprised...

205
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,879
by your one-dimensional way of thinking.

206
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,778
She's a secretary...

207
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,518
who I've been satisfied with for ten years,

208
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,888
and he's been caring for my child for 13 years.

209
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,790
Should I instantly remove them all from my life...

210
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,989
and accept 20,000 dollars in alimony...

211
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,830
which is less than what I make a month?

212
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,430
If that's all you can do right now,

213
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,300
that's the least you should do.

214
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,009
Lawyers your age let the law sway your decisions.

215
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,439
To be a true lawyer or attorney,

216
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,479
one must use the law to their advantage instead.

217
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,680
But you were betrayed by the two people closest to you.

218
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,719
How can you not do anything?

219
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,889
An extramarital affair.

220
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,090
Is it an unlawful act?

221
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,430
It's not, so what about it?

222
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,869
Are you saying you're all right with this?

223
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,299
Things are running smoothly at home and at work.

224
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,599
I need them.

225
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,070
I'm not talking about your family or your job.

226
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,810
What about your own life?

227
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,149
My family and my job...

228
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,479
are my life.

229
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,859
Are you really leaving?

230
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,029
I already told you.

231
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,499
This isn't to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

232
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,170
I'm seeing her to negotiate our divorce.

233
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,040
How can I believe that...

234
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,139
when marital spats never last long?

235
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,479
A marital spat?

236
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,950
How is it one when we're done as a married couple?

237
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,089
You won't eat with her, will you?

238
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,319
Didn't you cook doenjang stew with snails...

239
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,359
so that I wouldn't have dinner with her?

240
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,359
Busted.

241
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,999
I'll call you.

242
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,269
Is it our 14th wedding anniversary?

243
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,379
I guess I should've been more attentive about these things.

244
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,710
Why haven't you given me an answer?

245
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,649
- What answer? - I texted you.

246
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,220
How will you proceed with our divorce?

247
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,988
I came today since I knew you'd drag it out...

248
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:09,590
if I didn't ask face to face.

249
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,690
Right, the divorce.

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,659
What's your reason for wanting one?

251
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,769
Telling you will only lead to a quarrel.

252
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,769
Let's stop going around in circles and end the marriage amicably.

253
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,340
You're claiming spousal negligence...

254
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,139
on my part.

255
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,479
Negligence would be a waste of an expression.

256
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,550
I was in this marriage alone.

257
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:43,320
I don't want to keep talking about this, so just agree to it.

258
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,529
I'll be more attentive to Jae Hui.

259
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:54,268
No couples will stay married if they divorce for such a thing.

260
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,899
That's my reason for wanting a divorce.

261
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,509
What's been agonizing for me...

262
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,149
is only a simple matter for you that you can brush off.

263
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,450
How's that a reason for a divorce?

264
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,919
Should we go down this route...

265
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,290
when the entire nation will know about our divorce?

266
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,460
So that's what it is.

267
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,659
Even in this situation, you worry more about saving face.

268
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,670
A divorce?

269
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,070
What big difference would that make?

270
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,479
Forget it. We're back to square one again.

271
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,279
Sit.

272
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm not one of your subordinates.

273
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,350
You listen up.

274
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,550
There's only one thing I want to talk about.

275
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,460
Which is?

276
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,159
The divorce, division of our assets, and custody of Jae Hui.

277
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,629
You're the best at discussing them.

278
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,159
Get back to me with an offer.

279
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,739
What can I do to change your mind?

280
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Should I quit my job and be a stay-at-home mom?

281
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,310
Don't be melodramatic.

282
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,409
I never wanted that from you.

283
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,180
Then, tell me.

284
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,619
I'll do whatever you want.

285
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,290
You seem to have the wrong idea about this.

286
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,330
I no longer see you...

287
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,269
as my wife, the woman I love,

288
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,999
or Jae Hui's mom.

289
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,680

(1st Wedding Anniversary)

291
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,679
I'll make a lot more money and buy you the watch...

292
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,478
I couldn't buy when we got married.

293
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,879
Spending time with you like this is the best gift.

294
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,519
Ta-da.

295
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,759
You check the watch often.

296
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,460
Every time you check, you'll think of me.

(Law Firm Daejeong)

298
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,648
You all did great work this month.

299
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,149
- Great work, everyone. - Great work, everyone.

300
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,089
Keep up the good work next month as well.

301
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,118
- Sure. - Got it.

302
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,419
- Great work, everyone. - Great work, everyone!

303
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,920
- Great work. - Great work, everyone.

304
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,760
All right. Ms. Han, this is for you.

305
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:19,070
Will Ms. Han be interviewing our new clients as well?

306
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,608
I've been worried with all the new clients...

307
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,609
that have been coming our way,

308
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,709
so welcome.

309
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,080
What Ms. Cha has been doing alone will be divided among you three.

310
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,618
- Do you have the list? - Of course.

311
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,490
I sorted everything out neatly while also adding comments.

312
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:33,689
That reminds me.

313
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,790
Here you go, Ms. Han.

314
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,990
Thank you.

315
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,389
(List of clients to consult, March, 2024)

316
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,158
Ms. Han, come to me with questions...

317
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,770
if you have any regarding your interviews.

318
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,500
There isn't anything different with them being new clients,

319
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,500
so address them with confidence.

320
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,369
Yes. Thanks for that.

321
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:53,709
Ms. Han.

322
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,580
I bet you didn't know we receive 300 dollars per hour.

323
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,209
- What? Really? - Yes.

324
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,549
Me? I get 300 dollars?

325
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,019
It's what you're worth as an attorney of a major law firm,

326
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,260
not what your time is actually worth.

327
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,789
Ms. Cha, we're already aware of that...

328
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,259
without you striking us with the facts.

329
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,928
I'm also well aware...

330
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,659
that the partners' time is worth 500 dollars per hour.

331
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,969
Wait. What does PB stand for?

332
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,709
That's something I wrote down.

333
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,369
It means "pain in the butt."

334
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:27,939
Mr. Jun.

335
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,979
Isn't there a better way of addressing them,

336
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,080
like "people who need special attention and care"?

337
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,080
I'll keep that in mind next time.

338
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,490
Mr. Jun, what do you categorize as "pain in the butt"?

339
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,759
What do I categorize as "pain in the butt"?

340
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,959
What does pain in the butt mean?

341
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,800
All right. Here we go.

342
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,560
Let's start with A.

343
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,500
(Those who are lonely)

344
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,569
They aren't interested in a divorce,

345
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,040
but they come to us out of loneliness.

346
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,240
And B.

347
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,638
There are people who accuse us of robbing them dry...

348
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:04,709
with our high retainer fees.

349
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,510
And C is this. The nitpickers.

350
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,019
They nitpick at everything we say...

351
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,148
but don't fully understand our words.

352
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:15,459
Lastly, we have D. The indecisive.

353
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,129
It's hard to deal with those who are indecisive.

354
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,159
Anyway, knowing this will help you immensely down the road.

355
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,799
Also, it's company policy to limit our consultations...

356
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,428
to five sessions.

357
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:28,869
Please comply with that.

358
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,240
I see.

359
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,740
I didn't know there was a limit to our sessions.

360
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:37,509
But isn't it up to the clients...

361
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,479
to decide on the number of sessions they need?

362
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,079
This is a law firm.

363
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,389
This isn't a consultation center where you pay by the hour.

364
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,789
The reason people get more than five consultations...

365
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,330
is usually because it's hard for them to decide to get divorced.

366
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,000
There is also the goal of leaving...

367
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,198
the decision to get divorced with our clients,

368
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,600
though we legally represent them as lawyers.

369
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,799
Why do you think we hand over the list of clients...

370
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,040
who are here for the fifth time to the newcomers?

371
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,409
To wrap things up neatly?

372
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,280
We're asking you to send them away in a kind manner.

373
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,519
Clients like that are highly likely...

374
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,019
to change their minds repeatedly even after they decide to sue.

375
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,919
Those kinds of cases are hard for large law firms to handle.

376
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,530
I guess deciding to get married...

377
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,000
is hard for everyone.

378
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,540
But...

379
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,010
I can't understand the limit of five consultations.

380
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,379
Ms. Han.

381
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,750
There's no need for you to understand.

382
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,090
You just have to follow the rules.

383
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,388
Could you help clean up?

384
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,129
- Yes. - Yes. Bye.

385
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
Yes?

386
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:18,050
Ms. Cha. Someone is here for their fifth consultation.

387
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,280
Ms. Han is going to meet with them.

388
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:21,679
Please escort them to her.

389
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,149
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,590
Is there anything else you need?

391
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,129
No.

392
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,129
I was just looking at you because you looked pretty.

393
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,669
I see. Thank you.

394
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,340
Are you going on a date?

395
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:49,639
Yes, I have a date in the evening.

396
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,679
With my boyfriend.

397
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,619
You have a boyfriend?

398
00:21:58,419 --> 00:21:59,490
I didn't know.

399
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,159
I see.

400
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,990
I'll introduce him to you when I get a chance.

401
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,189
Okay. You can go now.

402
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,780
I no longer see you as my wife, the woman I love,

403
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:26,850
or Jae Hui's mom.

404
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:42,399
Weren't we going to have a consultation with Attorney Cha?

405
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:46,229
Since you've already had four consultations with Attorney Cha,

406
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,070
it's better to get another attorney's opinion.

407
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,669
- Is that so? - Of course.

408
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:55,040
Attorneys have different opinions, so it'll be more helpful.

409
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,409
Hello.

410
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,649
Hello, Attorney Han.

411
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,218
This is my fifth time here.

412
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:04,850
Today is the last time, right?

413
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,560
Yes, it's a firm policy.

414
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,389
I'm paying for the consultations, so why can't I get more?

415
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,429
I agree. Come in.

416
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,830
A recording?

417
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:20,428
Yes. If you don't get a recording,

418
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,898
nobody will believe that your father verbally abuses you...

419
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,270
every time he gets drunk.

420
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,108
He's gentle when he's not drinking, right?

421
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,209
Gosh.

422
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,678
How can married couples secretly record each other?

423
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,010
That's a bad thing.

424
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,580
I've come all the way here,

425
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,149
but I still don't know whether divorce is the right thing.

426
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,320
If he doesn't drink, he's not bad for a man of his generation...

427
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,260
He is quite nice to me.

428
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,260
He doesn't plan to quit drinking. That's the problem.

429
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,428
Please stop it, Mom.

430
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,468
You're taking medication because you can't sleep...

431
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:55,198
from too much stress. Why are you still hesitating?

432
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,840
He's your dad.

433
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,908
He needs to walk you down the aisle when you get married.

434
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,080
Stop saying it's because of me! It's just an excuse!

435
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,510
If I get married, will you get a divorce?

436
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:08,449
There. Please calm down.

437
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,790
Ma'am. What exactly are you afraid of?

438
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,419
Your husband or divorce?

439
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,490
My daughter is getting married soon.

440
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,999
If her wedding is called off because of my divorce,

441
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,869
I won't be able to stand it.

442
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,639
Also, I don't have so many years to live anyway.

443
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,540
I don't know if it's worth it to be labeled as a divorced woman.

444
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,879
Your daughter already said she was okay with it.

445
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,550
And what do you mean? "Labeled as a divorced woman?"

446
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,679
Nobody thinks like that these days.

447
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:43,020
People will accuse me of throwing away my family...

448
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,049
without knowing what's actually going on.

449
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,820
I feel so frustrated.

450
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,929
So you're saying...

451
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,899
that you'll live in pain for the next 30 years...

452
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:59,330
for people who don't even know what's going on, right?

453
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,309
I think he has a lot of money because the few houses he owns...

454
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,909
all rose in value,

455
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,840
but he won't tell me.

456
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,608
When I ask him about it,

457
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:13,509
he yells at me saying, "Why do you need to know that?"

458
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,949
"Don't even think about claiming any of it."

459
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,350
Gosh.

460
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,688
There is only fear left in your marriage. You should end it.

461
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,889
I can live without him.

462
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,629
But without me,

463
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,699
he won't even be able to make rice.

464
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,500
Gosh.

465
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,569
He won't starve to death.

466
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,070
I'm sure he won't.

467
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,340
He'll die from disease after eating too much cup ramyeon.

468
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,480
With division of assets,

469
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,949
you can get half of everything.

470
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,319
And because the person who keeps swearing at you...

471
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,659
and being condescending to you will be gone,

472
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,459
you'll feel much more relaxed.

473
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:07,469
Will I...

474
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:09,969
really feel like that?

475
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,709
Mom. Dad's not even human.

476
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,980
So please just live your life.

477
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,550
How long are you going to live bound to Dad?

478
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,990
I'll help you work up the courage.

479
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Here.

480
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,199
If you sign here, it's all over.

481
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,330
We'll take care of things from here.

482
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,669
Just follow my lead.

483
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,339
I told you to get rid of the person who came for the fifth time,

484
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,879
and you still took on their case?

485
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,679
Yes.

486
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,050
The mother couldn't decide so her daughter...

487
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,090
Call her Ms. Park Jin Sook, not mother.

488
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,129
It's not as if you're her daughter.

489
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,628
It's good that you noticed...

490
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,869
the daughter would pay for the legal fees.

491
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:14,800
Where the money will come from is key.

492
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,499
It wasn't about the money.

493
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,909
Her daughter was the key to her heart.

494
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,539
She felt guilty about giving up on her family,

495
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,280
even after so much sacrifice.

496
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,649
Her daughter was the only person who could free her of that feeling.

497
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,819
I'll tell Mr. Oh...

498
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,850
that you got your first case.

499
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,590
You've earned your meal.

500
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,730
It's true that deciding to get divorced is up to the person,

501
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,429
but I realized someone needed to help them make that decision.

502
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,429
Help them, my foot.

503
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,269
She went ahead with the lawsuit because she wouldn't have...

504
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,239
anyone to whine to after her last consultation...

505
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,740
at our firm today.

506
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:53,570
This is why a company's system is important.

507
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,239
Would anyone in the world actually decide...

508
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,448
to get a divorce because of a company policy?

509
00:27:58,449 --> 00:27:59,879
Yes, Ms. Park Jin Sook.

510
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,449
I bet she will drop the case down the line.

511
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:10,459
If I support her well, I'm sure she will stay strong.

512
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,859
She can't go back to that miserable life.

513
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,560
Did you say "Just trust me" again?

514
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,340
Just follow my lead.

515
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,209
Are you some justice warrior?

516
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,810
Ms. Han. Please be honest.

517
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,580
You wanted to punish him.

518
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,949
He should be punished.

519
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,049
More than punishing him,

520
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,550
whether she can live on her own is more important.

521
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,419
Not everyone can get divorced.

522
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:48,129
Are you saying there's a qualification for divorce?

523
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
Of course, there is.

524
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,800
People like Ms. Park...

525
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:56,039
won't be able to live alone even if she gets millions...

526
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,800
in the divorce because she's too weak.

527
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,780
Then how about you?

528
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,780
You're qualified to get divorced.

529
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:09,619
All of a sudden?

530
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,790
Is it also because of society's judgment for you too?

531
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,129
Trash should go in the trash.

532
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,770
Your life is precious. You should live each day well.

533
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,769
Even when throwing out the trash,

534
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,638
you have to put food waste in the food waste bin...

535
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,379
and usable items...

536
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,409
in the recycling bin after cleaning it well.

537
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,520
It's not that simple.

538
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:46,090
You've done recycling on your own before, right?

539
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,520
Yes, I live on my own.

540
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,689
Is that so?

541
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,639
- Hello, Ms. Cha. - Hi.

542
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,869
- Did you eat? - Did you eat?

543
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,780
What did you eat? Are you going to court today?

544
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,519
(Mom)

545
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,849
Yu Ri. Someone at my church said they would introduce you...

546
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,689
to a good guy. I'm going to set up a date.

547
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,760
Now that you've gotten a job, you should start dating.

548
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,959
Gosh.

549
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,128
Did you have a nice lunch?

550
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,560
- Yes. - Hello.

551
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,468
Ms. Han. Have you had coffee?

552
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:34,830
Yes, I have.

553
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,138
- Let's have one more. - What?

554
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,408
- Out of the office. - Why?

555
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:39,639
To digest our lunch and whatnot.

556
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:44,010
So did you take on the case? What did Ms. Cha say?

557
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,609
She said, "Why did you do that?"

558
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:47,909
She's so mean.

559
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,449
Ms. Han. I'm so curious. Can I ask you something?

560
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,350
Why do you hate doing as you're told at work?

561
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:56,719
- Me? - Yes.

562
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,759
Do you have unresolved feelings...

563
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
of disobedience from your childhood?

564
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,300
No, not at all.

565
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,830
I'm just...

566
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,740
living each moment by my conscience as a lawyer.

567
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,169
Conscience?

568
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,010
I respect you. You make life very hard on yourself.

569
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,340
Cha Eun Kyung is the one who makes life hard on herself.

570
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,510
Why can't she just tell me that I did a good job?

571
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,350
How is she any different from Ms. Park Jin Sook?

572
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,389
Why? Is Ms. Cha not going to get a divorce?

573
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,020
She's not.

574
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,858
A divorce attorney will stay with her cheating husband...

575
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,230
because of society's judgments. Can you believe that?

576
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,359
Gosh. Isn't she ashamed?

577
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:38,869
Ms. Cha isn't the type...

578
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,270
to avoid getting a divorce because of society's judgments.

579
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,869
Could it be because of her kid?

580
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:53,878
Did you also know that it was Ms. Cha?

581
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,679
Me? I had no idea.

582
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,749
I was leading the witness,

583
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,689
and you caught the bait.

584
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,159
I didn't know that happened to Ms. Cha.

585
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,529
If I had a wife like Ms. Cha,

586
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,458
I would treat her like a queen.

587
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,830
Mr. Jun...

588
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,300
You'll keep this a secret, right?

589
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,600
Look. I'm an attorney too, you know.

590
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:15,399
Isn't confidentiality a legal duty?

591
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,409
- You will, right? - I will.

592
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,379
Gosh.

593
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,409
You must sleep well even after drinking two coffees.

594
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,879
I fall asleep as soon as I lie down.

595
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:30,320
Wait. How did you know this was my second coffee?

596
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,320
Leading the witness.

597
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,790
Look at that.

598
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,490
I had a quick blind date during my lunchtime.

599
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,230
You caught me. That's embarrassing.

600
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,760
Why didn't you do it in the evening?

601
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,459
I need to leave work...

602
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,730
right on time in the evening and have chicken and beer with you.

603
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,070
Mr. Jun. Do you really like me?

604
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,600
I really like you.

605
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,868
Love your colleagues, love your country, right?

606
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:54,010
Let's work together for a long time.

607
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:57,080
Stop being clingy.

608
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,780
Why? Let's work together for a long time. Don't leave, okay?

609
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,889
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

610
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,730
No, it's okay.

611
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,570
Do whatever makes you feel comfortable.

612
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,040
Ms. Han.

613
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,540
Without me,

614
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,740
he won't have anyone to take care of him when he's old.

615
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,080
I don't know whether it's okay for me to leave him like this.

616
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,449
Did you get married to take care of him when he's old?

617
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,118
Didn't you get married to be happy?

618
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,659
My daughter is on my side,

619
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,928
so he'll be totally alone.

620
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:49,730
He caused that to happen.

621
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,730
But still.

622
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,429
I'm worried...

623
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,000
who'll take care of him when he's old and sick.

624
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,510
It's not just you...

625
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,980
that has responsibility and duty.

626
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,178
Do you think the defendant will take care of you when you're sick?

627
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,350
Gosh.

628
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,290
He made you sick.

629
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:15,560
Gosh.

630
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:19,659
If only I didn't tell him that I met with you...

631
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,460
A part of me feels it's right to stop things now.

632
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,699
If you feel that nervous,

633
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,138
give my phone number to her husband.

634
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,639
Tell him to talk to you through me.

635
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,179
And just block his phone number.

636
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,679
Do it right now.

637
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:40,948
Is that really okay?

638
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,949
Of course.

639
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,718
(Husband)

640
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,159
I'm not going home.

641
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,730
From now on, contact me through my lawyer.

642
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
Gosh.

643
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,559
He'll go crazy if he can't get in touch with me.

644
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,630
It's okay.

645
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,670
I told you to trust me and to follow my lead.

646
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,068
Here are the records of Ms. Park Jin Sook's previous consultations...

647
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:09,179
that you asked for.

648
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,679
- Thank you. - Of course.

649
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,420
Who is this?

650
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,560
Yes? Hello?

651
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,860
Hey.

652
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,600
Are you happy to make a living by telling lies, you punk?

653
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,259
Who are you?

654
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:31,829
That...

655
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,369
You basically wrote a novel on that petition or whatever.

656
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,770
Look here. It's not a novel.

657
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,210
Those are the grudges in Ms. Park's heart.

658
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:45,350
Did you see me swear at my wife?

659
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,709
Do you have evidence?

660
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,408
All of my friends...

661
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:51,750
beat their wives once in a while.

662
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,790
They don't even feel bad.

663
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:57,318
I even say sorry and buy her gifts!

664
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,630
Gosh. Do you want an appreciation plaque?

665
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm going to sue you for false accusations!

666
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,428
How dare a woman...

667
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:07,100
leave her house without making food for her husband?

668
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:10,439
There's nobody in this world who wants to cook...

669
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,710
for someone like you. You should've treated her better.

670
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,770
Tell Park Jin Sook to go back home right now.

671
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,079
I won't let her do this.

672
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,179
Ms. Park...

673
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:19,579
will never go back to your house.

674
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,149
I'm going to make sure of that.

675
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,150
Hey!

676
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:24,679
If you don't stop this right away, I'm going to kill you!

677
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,889
You're going to kill me?

678
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,159
I'm going to kill you!

679
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:31,360
You...

680
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,560
(Conference Room)

681
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:38,699
Mr. Jung.

682
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,429
Are you not leaving yet?

683
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,299
I have a lot of work left.

684
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:47,139
I heard you got a new case.

685
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,210
Good job. That's not easy.

686
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,909
Right...

687
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Ms. Cha told me I shouldn't have taken the case.

688
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,190
Thank you.

689
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,519
Why can't people decide to get divorced...

690
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,860
even in the most ridiculous situations?

691
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,488
Are people that cowardly?

692
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:11,159
It might not be about being cowardly. They might be scared.

693
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:13,670
No matter how strong people are,

694
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:16,199
they fear being alone.

695
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,980
Gosh. You're so reliable.

696
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,610
You can do it.

697
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,509
Yes. Thank you.

698
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,549
- Work hard. - Yes. Get home safely.

699
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,860
- Here you go. - Thank you.

700
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,139
Yes. Yesterday...

701
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,250
Yes. Please wrap it up like that.

702
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,880
Yes.

703
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,009
- Thank you. - Thank you.

704
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,480
- Yes. - Are you done with your radio show?

705
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,610
Yes. Why?

706
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:37,750
Buy me a drink.

707
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:42,319
I can't believe Jung Woo Jin asked me for a drink.

708
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,560
Gosh.

709
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,959
Back in the day, you'd bring me here...

710
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,029
and buy me a drink after scolding me, right?

711
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,960
Did you even listen to me when I was scolding you?

712
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:56,139
You were the type to say yes but not actually listen to me.

713
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,369
It was totally the opposite.

714
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,270
I acted as if I wasn't listening,

715
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,139
but I etched each of your words into my heart.

716
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,579
Back then, I was just being a bit proud.

717
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,179
Now, you always nag at me.

718
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,020
And you tell me I have a bad personality.

719
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm just telling you to be gentle with the newbies.

720
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,259
What if they leave?

721
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,730
You'll be the one that Mr. Oh gets mad at.

722
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:22,929
Do you think I care about what others think of me?

723
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,500
You do.

724
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,139
Did you know Han Yu Ri accepted her first case?

725
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,610
Right.

726
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,580
I thought she'd leave soon.

727
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,819
She reminds me of someone's beginning of her attorney career.

728
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:47,819
Me?

729
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,790
Me?

730
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,889
What are you talking about? We're totally different.

731
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,170
Why did Director Kim suddenly quit giving advice?

732
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,569
Is he not on good terms with you?

733
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,040
What are you talking about? He's just busy.

734
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:17,219
You barely express your feelings...

735
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:19,549
at home or work, no?

736
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,150
What's the point?

737
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,360
It only burdens each other.

738
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,029
You should express yourself in at least one place.

739
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,600
Living like that makes your life lonely.

740
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,969
You never got married before.

741
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,110
Married couples understand each other...

742
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:48,409
more than colleagues and friends.

743
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,548
So sometimes you need a spouse for that function...

744
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,520
more than your emotions.

745
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:54,089
Because it's a long-term relationship.

746
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,330
But in the end, you're having a hard time.

747
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,130
Why am I having a hard time?

748
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,239
That's out of the blue.

749
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,040
Eun Kyung.

750
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,310
You know I want to be helpful, right?

751
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,250
What are you saying? Mind your own business.

752
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,040
Darn. What on earth?

753
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,850
Does she...

754
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,679
live here?

755
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,190
So she does live here.

756
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Dang it.

757
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,799
- Seriously. - Yu Ri.

758
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,369
You scared me.

759
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:48,469
- Mom. - What?

760
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:50,339
You should've called.

761
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,339
I made some greens.

762
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:56,480
I barely eat at home.

763
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,540
You will if you have side dishes.

764
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:00,949
Your dad always told me...

765
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,380
to feed you well.

766
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,250
That was my highest priority.

767
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,489
- Mom. - Yes?

768
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,560
He brainwashed you.

769
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,830
Why is your highest priority feeding me?

770
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,159
You need to see it straight now.

771
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,860
See what straight? He was right.

772
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,199
My goodness.

773
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,600
Yet, he backstabbed you. Don't you hate him?

774
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:30,580
I thought he only had a hard time making ends meet for his family.

775
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,310
Now I'm glad he backstabbed me at least.

776
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:39,790
Do people go crazy when they get married?

777
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,020
What's wrong with me?

778
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
Come on.

779
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,329
- We met again. - Hi.

780
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,860
Yes, we met again.

781
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,599
Ms. Han.

782
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,270
Hello. Mom?

783
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,469
We met the other day.

784
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,269
The last time I talked to her,

785
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,639
I realized you two work for the same company.

786
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:03,580
- We're meant to be. - I know.

787
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,879
Meant to be, my foot.

788
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,110
You're not with your boyfriend today?

789
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,080
He was tall and handsome.

790
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,989
You both looked like you could live without the law.

791
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,150
They're not afraid of the law.

792
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,758
I think he's working overtime today.

793
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:17,790
I see.

794
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,789
I'm going to try your recipe today...

795
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,230
and make beef brisket doenjang stew.

796
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:23,799
- Okay. - I loved...

797
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,960
your doenjang stew with snails.

798
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,469
I'm glad.

799
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:28,799
What?

800
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,299
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

801
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,679
Get off your phone and come and eat.

802
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,989
- Mom. - Yes?

803
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,488
Will you please stop acting friendly to everyone?

804
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,029
What do you mean everyone?

805
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,330
She's your colleague and your neighbor.

806
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,600
Have you forgotten your neighbor turned out...

807
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:02,699
to have an affair with Dad?

808
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,139
It looks perfect.

809
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:10,810
You don't...

810
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:15,049
pity Dad, do you?

811
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,279
You should pity yourself, not Dad.

812
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,048
You're the victim.

813
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:21,519
Victim and perpetrator.

814
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,319
Does everything look like a case to you?

815
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,089
Regardless, you're a victim, and he's a perpetrator.

816
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:28,690
Oh, this is good.

817
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,270
Anyway, why didn't you...

818
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:39,339
divorce Dad...

819
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,069
when you realized he was cheating on you?

820
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,650
Just because.

821
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,549
Because of me?

822
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,189
I hesitated because...

823
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,520
I'd disturb your studying.

824
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,190
And I tried to understand your dad.

825
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,159
- Mom. Look. - Eat.

826
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,799
You got the cause and effect relationship wrong.

827
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:10,900
I'm not the victim of Dad's affair,

828
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,710
but you because you decided to get a divorce?

829
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,480
How can you come up with that thought?

830
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:20,779
Seriously, Mom. It's so frustrating.

831
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,049
My goodness.

832
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,980
Why does everyone hesitate to get a divorce?

833
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,790
You're frustrating me more.

834
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,850
Wait until you have a child.

835
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:31,388
Did you study that hard...

836
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,060
just to promote a divorce?

837
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,758
Are you saying a divorce is bad?

838
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,699
That it's social evils out of the blue?

839
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,770
Fine. Continue to live in the Joseon Dynasty.

840
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,440
I can't live in the Joseon Dynasty.

841
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,909
I'm a divorcee from the modern time.

842
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,779
And why do you keep ignoring my texts when you're a modern girl?

843
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,080
Because they're not worth my attention.

844
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,850
Do you want me to set the date?

845
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,020
Do you want me to change the password?

846
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,690
You got a job. Come on.

847
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,060
Okay! I get it!

848
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,699
Okay? You just said okay.

849
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,400
Seriously.

850
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,198
Try the rolled omelet.

851
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,429
Mom. One second.

852
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,770
Yes, Ms. Park Jin Sook. What brings you to call me?

853
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,380
Ms. Han.

854
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,810
Are you sure...

855
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,350
about continuing this?

856
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,549
- What? - I mean,

857
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,989
he said he'd never drink again.

858
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,549
He's begging me to drop the case.

859
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:38,619
Do you trust him?

860
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,290
No, he was different this time.

861
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,059
He used to curse at me when he was drunk...

862
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,399
then begged for my forgiveness when he was sober.

863
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,770
But this time, he's begging me even though he's drunk.

864
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:50,468
- What did he say... - What the?

865
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,670
this time?

866
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,210
He asked me to come and cook for him.

867
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,210
He promised to quit drinking.

868
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,150
So I was wondering if I should make him hangover soup.

869
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,980
So you want to go back...

870
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,850
just to cook for him?

871
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:11,460
Don't ever trust him.

872
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:14,989
He's only eaten my food until now.

873
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,500
I'm sick of it.

874
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,440
Don't make any decisions for now. I'll see you tomorrow.

875
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,170
Seriously.

876
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,339
What is wrong with everyone?

877
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,750
Come and eat.

878
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,868
Ms. Park Jin Sook.

879
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,769
(Emergency Center)

880
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,540
I told you...

881
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:58,568
he might die!

882
00:48:58,569 --> 00:48:59,610
Mom!

883
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:02,239
It's not her fault.

884
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:03,909
She didn't force you to sue him.

885
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:06,480
I'm so sick of it.

886
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,179
Unfortunate women like me can never get divorced.

887
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,749
I knew this would happen.

888
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,559
That's why I told you I wanted to drop the suit!

889
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,489
Why are you being so unreasonable?

890
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,158
Ms. Han tried to help us.

891
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,190
Be quiet!

892
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,600
I can't stand you.

893
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,369
Get lost.

894
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:27,929
Leave!

895
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:32,569
Let go of me! I'm sick of this.

896
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:50,659
I'm sick and tired.

897
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:05,699
Are you back from the hospital?

898
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,139
How should I...

899
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,509
handle the case now?

900
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:15,980
Let it sit for now.

901
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,048
If he dies, you'll have to handle the succession of property.

902
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:21,519
If he lives,

903
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,589
drop the case if the client wants.

904
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:29,089
Have you been through this too?

905
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,658
Of course.

906
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:32,059
Lots of people...

907
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,199
take their lives when they're served papers.

908
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,299
But that's not on the attorney.

909
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,810
Is it not?

910
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,349
If they commit suicide after getting served,

911
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,650
is it on the prosecutor?

912
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,649
If they commit suicide after being urged to pay taxes,

913
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,249
is that on the tax collector?

914
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,290
It's not.

915
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,189
You had a hesitant client,

916
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,798
and with a misguided sense of duty and poor sense of justice,

917
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:07,330
you made her sign the divorce papers.

918
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:12,199
You shouldn't have done that.

919
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,879
Do you also think I goaded her to get divorced?

920
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,040
I didn't say that.

921
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:25,420
What are you saying I should've done?

922
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,690
Please tell my mom to get divorced.

923
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,759
I never say that.

924
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,130
A divorce attorney doesn't decide who gets divorced.

925
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,170
Separate your personalities.

926
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,940
Han Yu Ri the attorney and Han Yu Ri the person.

927
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,539
Han Yu Ri the attorney can't blurt out...

928
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,679
what Han Yu Ri the person thinks.

929
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,580
Separate my personalities...

930
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,719
Instead of starting with you,

931
00:51:58,279 --> 00:51:59,749
you should've started with...

932
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,690
the client's urge and wish to punish her husband.

933
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
Ms. Han?

934
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,270
Yes?

935
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:18,040
That was me trying to console you.

936
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:38,860
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

937
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,969
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

938
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:50,000
(Attorney at law, Jun Eun Ho)

939
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,869
How will he react...

940
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,170
when he gets the written complaint?

941
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,039
We'll have to see when he gets it.

942
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,509
How will he react if I move out?

943
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:03,949
What do you think?

944
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:07,149
He'll feel and realize you're actually breaking up.

945
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,318
Can she go back for the stuff she left behind?

946
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,318
Some will be cooperative.

947
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,190
It depends on the person.

948
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:16,129
That's enough for now.

949
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,758
What if the mother-in-law finds out? Will she call?

950
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:20,769
What happens to the rented water purifier...

951
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,770
when we divide our assets?

952
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,068
Do I have to pay it off?

953
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:27,109
The mother-in-law might or might not call.

954
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,979
And the person who paid the rental feel keeps paying it.

955
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,039
- Then... - Stop.

956
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,339
What if...

957
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:34,909
you get divorced now? How much can you get?

958
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:36,210
How much can I get?

959
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,779
Zero.

960
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,789
I don't think there are any assets to split.

961
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:42,948
I told you...

962
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:44,818
my husband inherited three million dollars.

963
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:45,888
Listen carefully.

964
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,989
You said he received the inheritance a month ago.

965
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,830
And you've been married for two years.

966
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,068
What if the court says you've been married...

967
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:55,400
for too short a time so you don't get a cut?

968
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,099
What? Then he doesn't get a divorce.

969
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,698
Then you shouldn't get divorced.

970
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:00,839
Then what must I do...

971
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,810
if I want to get at least half?

972
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,409
In that case...

973
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,650
I'll see you in 20 years.

974
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,879
What? In 20 years?

975
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,850
What kind of rule is that?

976
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,218
If you have any more questions,

977
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,988
- call this number again. - Okay.

978
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:20,388
I have another consultation right after this.

979
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,588
I need you to leave. I'm sorry.

980
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:23,698
Did you have lunch?

981
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:25,229
I know a nice tteokbokki place nearby.

982
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,468
If you'd like that.

983
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:27,968
- What? - If you have more questions,

984
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,428
- give me a call. - Okay.

985
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:31,040
- Twenty years? - Bye. Get back safely.

(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

988
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:54,659
Let's get an ice cream.

989
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:57,000
What?

990
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,429
Let's get an ice cream.

991
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:02,529
An ice cream?

992
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:04,569
"What if?" "What then?"

993
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,069
I hated those phrases in Korean and English classes.

994
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:09,368
- What did you do? - The obvious.

995
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:11,838
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, what if for a what if.

996
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,049
I asked them questions in the same manner. That's best.

997
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:17,880
I'm envious of you.

998
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,520
Why is it so hard for me?

999
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,730
That's because you're sympathetic.

1000
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,799
You keep thinking about the other person.

1001
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,730
It's tough, isn't it?

1002
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,739
When he called to say he was going to die,

1003
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:44,309
did I have to take action?

1004
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,048
That's on the person who threatened you with suicide.

1005
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:48,250
Why should you take action?

1006
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:51,949
What if...

1007
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:55,989
He won't die, will he?

1008
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,259
Don't mind it too much.

1009
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,730
People like that tend to do things for show.

1010
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:06,770
You seemed like an actual senior then.

1011
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,940
That's a lot of strength.

1012
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,580
(Park Jin Sook, client)

Open wide.

1014

- Come on. - No.

1015
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,149
- Open up. - I won't eat!

1016
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,718
You must eat to go home.

1017
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,689
Why should I even be here?

1018
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,888
Why do you think you're here?

1019
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:34,929
Darn it.

1020
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,059
Just eat, you nuisance.

1021
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,158
Whose fault could it be? It's yours!

1022
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,170
- Why you... - Oh, gosh.

1023
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:41,900
What are you doing?

1024
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,239
Oh, hello, Ms. Han.

1025
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,839
Goodness.

1026
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,509
It's nothing. He's just being silly.

1027
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,409
I just realized...

1028
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,850
I was worried for no reason.

1029
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:58,979
- Darn it. - Say you're sorry.

1030
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,119
- That hurt! - You troublemaker.

1031
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:02,920
Ms. Han. Come with me.

1032
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,259
(General Ward A)

1033
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:15,630
The lawsuit.

1034
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,799
I bet she will drop the case down the line.

1035
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,409
I'll drop it.

1036
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:23,480
It's my rotten luck.

1037
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:26,850
Someone like me can never get divorced.

1038
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,279
Why would you say that?

1039
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:31,880
A divorce...

1040
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,049
is something for the rich and smart.

1041
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,529
I really hope...

1042
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,730
this incident changes your husband.

1043
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:48,569
Goodness.

1044
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:50,900
Ms. Cha.

1045
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:52,869
Here.

1046
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,909
Why are you here?

1047
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:58,810
You've been through a lot, Ms. Park.

1048
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,250
What brought you all the way here?

1049
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,119
Ms. Park...

1050
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,750
will drop the lawsuit.

1051
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,330
Don't hope this incident will change your husband.

1052
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,659
After time, his old ways will set in.

1053
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,770
What is she doing?

1054
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,400
The darn fool.

1055
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,569
Come back when you're determined and convinced.

1056
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:28,639
Regardless of how many consultations you had,

1057
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:32,639
we'll take on your case for you, okay?

1058
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:34,980
Thank you, Ms. Cha.

1059
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,650
You even gave me a refund.

1060
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:42,589
How about you attend couple therapy?

1061
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,989
We'll put you in touch with an alcoholism specialist.

1062
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,690
Pay for five sessions at once, and you even get a discount.

1063
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,730
I see.

1064
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,600
- Thank you. - Sure.

1065
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,969
Then...

1066
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:55,630
Goodbye.

1067
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:57,069
Bye.

1068
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,210
Will you just eat?

1069
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,179
Goodness.

(Seoun University Hospital)

1071
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,759
You told me to let her go.

1072
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:20,029
Why did you come to win her back?

1073
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,028
Despite a massive incident like an attempted suicide,

1074
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:26,699
after a while, he'll go back to his old ways.

1075
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,799
That's when she'll make up her mind and finally decide to leave him.

1076
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,639
There comes a moment...

1077
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:38,179
where you just accept everything.

1078
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,480
And care only of the future.

1079
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:48,049
Your husband is having an affair.

1080
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,219
I know.

1081
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,290
Are you not going to divorce him?

1082
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:53,019
What do I get out of it?

1083
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,388
Things are running smoothly at home and at work.

1084
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:56,799
I need them.

1085
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,399
He made you sick.

1086
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,928
If only I didn't tell him that I met with you...

1087
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,429
And I tried to understand your dad.

1088
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,969
Ms. Cha.

1089
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,869
What does it mean...

1090
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,339
to be married?

1091
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,508
- Why you... - It's my rotten luck.

1092
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:16,580
Someone like me can never get divorced.

1093
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,480
How can you feed someone who tormented you?

1094
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,289
My daughter is getting married soon.

1095
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,290
I hesitated because...

1096
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:23,988
If her wedding is called off because of my divorce,

1097
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,189
I won't be able to stand it.

1098
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,489
I'd disturb your studying.

1099
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,790
How can you put up with it for your children?

1100
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:38,440
Strangers who have become family?

(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

1103
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,810
Hey.

1104
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,279
What is it now?

1105
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,830
I apologize, Ms. Cha.

1106
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:46,270
I can no longer work on the divorce team.

1107
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,610
What are you on about?

1108
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,380
Is it because of the attempted suicide?

1109
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,679
I don't want to...

1110
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,879
work at the expense of separating...

1111
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,388
Han Yu Ri the attorney and Han Yu Ri the person.

1112
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,650
Don't cling to what I said.

1113
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:05,119
I think...

1114
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,159
I see the assailant and victim...

1115
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,460
way too clearly to be able to work on divorce cases.

1116
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,968
Are you angry you couldn't get Ms. Park divorced,

1117
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:19,539
or was your ego bruised...

1118
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,039
because your case went how I said it would?

1119
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,170
It's neither.

1120
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,509
I made the call because I don't see...

1121
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:30,580
my future.

1122
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,048
Fine, then go. You never listen.

1123
01:02:35,049 --> 01:02:36,089
Leave.

1124
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:41,929
- And Ms. Cha. - What else is there?

1125
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,969
Your husband goes to Ms. Choi's place for dinner.

1126
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,739
It could be that they live together.

1127
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,319
How do you know that?

1128
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,860
Ms. Choi lives in my building.

1130
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,610
Ms. Cha.

1131
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,549
The affair with Ms. Choi.

1132
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:39,948
I wasn't being nosy.

1133
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,949
I just wanted to be on your side.

1134
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,730
You can go.

1135
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,779
(Jung-gu Chungam-ro 214, One Space Studio Apartment)

1136
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,759
You're helpless.

1137
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:55,028
Let me.

1138
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:57,600
- I can manage. - I'll do it.

1139
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,569
- You're hurt? - I got you.

1140
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,699
You scared me.

1141
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:10,379
Let me do the carrying.

1142
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,278
- I'll help. - Carry this, then.

1143
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,279
Just this?

1144
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,049
Were you going to carry that?

1145
01:05:15,409 --> 01:05:17,319
- You're all grown up. - Goodness.

1146
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,719
- It's fine. - No, let me.

1147
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:22,089
- Come along. - My gosh. Let's go.

1148
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:41,610
- What is it? - Nothing.

1149
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,949
There comes a moment where you just accept everything.

1150
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:29,049
And care only of the future.

1151
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,158
Ms. Cha?

1152
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:06,988
Your misguided sense of duty and poor sense of justice.

1153
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,029
I like it.

1154
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,500
- What? - You want to punish them, right?

1155
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,330
I'll let you do that.

1156
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:19,900
Did you actually drop by the studio apartment?

1157
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:21,909
I didn't accept your resignation.

1158
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,619
I want you to take my case.

How long have you known?

1161
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,159
Affair partners always ask that.

1162
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,770
They must really want to know.

1163
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:24,139
There's a rumor that Sa Ra had an affair with a married man.

1164
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:26,770
What will Mom and Dad do?

1165
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,410
About the divorce.

1166
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,338
I'll reveal how selfish you were...

1167
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,209
and what kind of mom you were.

1168
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,538
Will you be okay with that?

1169
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:34,549
Ms. Cha!

1170
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:37,980
What I read in the tabloids. Is it true?
