(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,020
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,940
Your dream finally came true.

12
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,369
No need to go back in.

13
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:14,809
Sorry?

14
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,979
Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,949
You're fired.

16
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,360
Ms. Han.

17
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,669
No way.

18
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,000
(Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra has been terminated from Daejeong.)

19
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,140
No way.

20
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,369
Seriously?

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,640
(Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra has been terminated from Daejeong.)

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,368
- Gosh. - What did I tell you?

23
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,079
- You were right. - Wasn't I right?

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,708
I told you it was her.

25
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,850
She sure has some nerve.

26
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,050

00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,269
(Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra has been terminated from Daejeong.)

30
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,180
I was wrongfully terminated by Ms. Cha,

31
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,949
and I came by to ask if you stand with her.

32
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,419
Your conduct was within the scope of our termination policy.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,560
The board was unanimous regarding your termination.

34
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,930
We appreciate your work. You may leave.

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,430
I will bring wrongful termination into question.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,739
My next stop will be the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,009
Go ahead.

38
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,579
Your feelings for Ms. Cha...

39
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,250
are the same as mine for Ji Sang.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,220
Get off your high horse.

41
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,160
For someone who has worked at a law firm for ten years,

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,259
you lack the mind of one.

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,899
One's feelings must be acted upon for them to be considered...

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,269
in the eyes of the law.

45
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,139
Not everyone who develops such feelings...

46
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,710
follows your path.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,780
Come to your senses.

48
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,350
This is Cha Eun Kyung's business, not yours.

49
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,079
You'll end up hurt at this rate.

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,319
You made it my business...

51
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,489
by calling me her office husband.

52
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,859
What a shame.

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,100
We've also been colleagues for ten years,

54
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,440
so was this really necessary?

55
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,109
You already know this,

56
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,539
but love is like a car accident.

57
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,810
It can't be dodged.

58
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,129
The fact that Cha Eun Kyung and Kim Jae Hui had to know you...

59
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,489
is the real freak accident.

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,770
You will owe them your whole life.

61
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,010
Is there more you wish to hear?

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,749
If not, get lost this second.

63
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,228
Eun Kyung.

64
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,960
You didn't sign the employee evaluation file yet.

65
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,700
What do you want to do with Choi Sa Ra?

66
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,928
I'm still thinking.

67
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:01,238
You gave her a full score.

68
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,499
She's good at her job.

69
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,369
I shouldn't bring my emotions into it.

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,369
Not firing her seems to be...

71
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,609
the exact opposite of it.

72
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,349
What do you mean by that?

73
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,579
This may have slipped your mind,

74
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,350
but I'm a partner lawyer at this firm.

75
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,950
I'm in charge of personnel alongside you.

76
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,820
Choi Sa Ra...

77
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,950
violated Article 25 of our company regulations...

78
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,488
by tarnishing company reputation with conduct...

79
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,229
that is subject to civil and criminal liability,

80
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,729
as well as Article 26...

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,859
by publicly staining the honor of a company board member.

82
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,570
She is guilty on both counts.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
She should've been fired long ago.

84
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,010
I know.

85
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,410
I only needed someone to check its justification.

86
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,869
Unbelievable.

87
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,378
- Can you believe it? - See? What did I tell you?

88
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,949
I thought it was absurd.

89
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,649
I can't believe she had the audacity to keep coming to work.

90
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,520
Ms. Cha has been a saint.

91
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,989
I would've fired her immediately.

(Episode 7)

95
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,700
The coffee tastes good,

96
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,340
and we have great weather.

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,270
Finally seeing Choi Sa Ra leave was satisfying to say the least.

98
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,039
That's what you get for going after Mr. Oh's nephew.

99
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,249
Office husband?

100
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:27,019
She should've known that she'd only get fired for that.

101
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,280
Hold on a second.

102
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,289
What did you just say?

103
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,419
Mr. Jung...

104
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,220
is Mr. Oh's nephew?

105
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,189
Yes. Hold on. Didn't you know?

106
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:38,629
Did you really not know?

107
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,400
Yu Ri, are you once again the last to find out?

108
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,669
It's common knowledge at the firm.

109
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,100
From this moment on,

110
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,070
please don't let anyone sense those feelings.

111
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,038
- What feelings? - Your feelings...

112
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,139
of deeply liking Ms. Cha.

113
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,378
Not do anything that could be disadvantageous for Ms. Cha.

114
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,209
I hope you don't think I'm overstepping here.

115
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,350
Not as a younger lawyer, but as Ms. Cha's attorney.

116
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,260
Oh, no. I really had no idea.

117
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,260
Why didn't anyone tell me?

118
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,059
Mr. Jung is rumored to one day run the place.

119
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,270
What?

120
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,900
What now?

121
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,439
Did you get on his bad side?

122
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,910
- Oh, no. - What is it? Talk to me.

123
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,739
I'm here for the 2pm consultation.

124
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,539
Where is Ms. Cha's office?

125
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,978
Right. It's the office at the end of the hall.

126
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,249
Thank you.

127
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,619
Yu Ri.

128
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,359
Hello.

129
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,060
That's Ms. Kim from my work.

130
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,029
See you tomorrow.

131
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,969
We're not exactly on speaking terms.

132
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,009
Who are you to come here and cause a scene?

133
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,479
- Mr. Jun, please head inside. - What? Sure.

134
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,350
Have you been well?

135
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,580
It was nice to see you on TV.

136
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,519
Your father would be proud from above.

137
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,590
Don't talk about him in front of me.

138
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,060
Are you still that same angry kid?

139
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,600
Why on earth are you here?

140
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,300
Who said you could be here?

141
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,470
I booked a consultation with Ms. Cha Eun Kyung.

142
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,109
I hope you haven't forgotten about what you did.

143
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,920
What about it?

144
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,590
Shouldn't your colleagues...

145
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,989
all know about what you did to me?

146
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,009
Is Yu Ri fitting in all right?

147
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,440
Are you an acquaintance of hers?

148
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,409
Yes, we're very close.

149
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,879
I'm her aunt.

150
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,849
Gosh. Are you her aunt?

151
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,849
Her dad married me after the divorce,

152
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,220
so I'm more like her stepmom.

153
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,989
Although, she hates my guts.

154
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Sorry?

155
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,129
By the way, it seems like the years didn't touch you at all.

156
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,570
You look exactly like you did ten years ago.

157
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,898
When have we met?

158
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:35,940
Gosh.

159
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,570
How can you not remember your client?

160
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,608
It's understandable though...

161
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,580
since you're the nation's busiest divorce lawyer.

162
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,210
My client?

163
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,619
Don't you remember the term "homewrecker?"

164
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,119
(8 years ago)

165
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,759
You're a homewrecker!

166
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,169
I doubt an old client...

167
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,670
came by to see how I was doing.

168
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,970
May I ask why you're here?

169
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,080
I found this during the move.

170
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,879
For years, I could never find it.

171
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,219
(Transfer of Assets)

172
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,559
(From Han Myeong Jong to Kim Hui Ra)

173
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,689
(My entire assets will go to Kim after I pass.)

174
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,029
(Han Myeong Jong)

175
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,329
Are you claiming that Ms. Han's father...

176
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,960
wrote this himself?

177
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,129
That's right.

178
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,228
That document states it clearly,

179
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,898
but Han Yu Ri and her mother are still living in his house...

180
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,070
like they own the place.

181
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,709
Since this isn't a proper form,

182
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,680
it can't be legally binding.

183
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,108
Legally binding or not,

184
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,549
Yu Ri's mother promised me the house.

185
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,679
She still isn't keeping her word after all this time...

186
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,779
and has been brushing me off.

187
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,518
I'm sure Yu Ri has been controlling her mother.

188
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,550
Why did you come to me out of all people?

189
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,290
You're on TV together which tells me you're fond of her.

190
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,459
Do you know what she did to me?

191
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,659
I couldn't care less.

192
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,359
She conducted a one-man protest at my workplace.

193
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,069
Please read this.

194
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,599
Two employees here are having an affair.

195
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,399
Young lady, you need to stop this.

196
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,369
Can you please read this?

197
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,638
- You can't do this. - Two employees here...

198
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,439
are having an affair.

199
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
(If cheating is a skill, then you hired the master!)

200
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,379
- You can't do this. - Please read this.

201
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,679
Two employees here are having an affair.

202
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,879
You can't do this.

203
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,550
Ms. Kim!

204
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,590
This is about you.

205
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,320
- This... - You can't do this.

206
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,790
Why are you avoiding me?

207
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,289
Why are you avoiding me?

208
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,330
Everyone, please read this.

209
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:40,759
You must stop this.

210
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,029
Rather than respecting the woman her father was with,

211
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,368
she came to my workplace...

212
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,040
and caused a scene to tarnish my reputation.

213
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,509
So what happened?

214
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,739
They fired me.

215
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,909
My annual salary was 50,000 dollars,

216
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,978
but because of her,

217
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,220
I was fired from my job and branded as a mistress.

218
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,820
She even caused her father to also lose his income source.

219
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
So?

220
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,228
Is this how you treat all your former clients?

221
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:13,830
Well, I'm no longer on retainer.

222
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,368
Her father fell in love with me,

223
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:19,999
but she made it seem like I was to blame.

224
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,569
She's a darn witch,

225
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,209
and someone like her shouldn't be a lawyer.

226
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,739
Especially not one at a law firm of this size.

227
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,580
Your time is up, so please head out.

228
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,779
The consultation fee will be refunded.

229
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,249
Let me make you an offer.

230
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,389
Fire Han Yu Ri this second.

231
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,789
It won't be a difficult task for a law firm of this size.

232
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,518
- Why should I? - If you don't,

233
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,359
I'll do exactly what she did to me, so brace yourself.

234
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,158
A lot of people pass this building daily.

235
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,100
I'll protest in front of it with a truck,

236
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,600
so fire her.

237
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,700
Also, tell Yu Ri...

238
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,639
to transfer that house to me by the end of this month.

239
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,269
It's what her dad promised.

240
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,109
I'm no pushover,

241
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,580
and I'll be back in a few days.

242
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,389
Yu Ri, I'm heading out.

243
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:17,930
See you around.

244
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,009
(Emergency contact, Mother: Kim Kyung Sook)

245
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,379
Ms. Cha.

246
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,109
What did that woman want?

247
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,450
I can't say since the problem concerns you.

248
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:44,050
Let's both be professionals here.

249
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,090
That woman...

250
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,399
Did she tell you she was my dad's mistress?

251
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,099
She referred to herself as your aunt.

252
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,840
My aunt? That crazy b...

253
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,269
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

254
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,440
Please don't tell me you still took her on as a client.

255
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,249
I'm reviewing her case.

256
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,119
Ms. Cha.

257
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,180
I know that it's important to take on clients,

258
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,920
but this is wrong.

259
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,119
How is it wrong?

260
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,460
How can you do this to me when I'm representing you...

261
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,259
in your divorce case?

262
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,399
Ms. Han, don't you ever open your own law firm.

263
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,129
You're saying you'll be picky about clients,

264
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,529
and your office will see lack of revenue.

265
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
(Resume)

266
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,460
(Mother: Kim Kyung Sook)

267
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:08,170
I hear my daughter is now your junior colleague.

268
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,840
What a twist of events.

269
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:14,508
It was only today that I realized...

270
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,810
that I represented the opposing side in your divorce case.

271
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,350
Why did you want to see me without Yu Ri knowing?

272
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,350
Did she do something wrong?

273
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,619
Kim Hui Ra came to see me.

274
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,790
What?

275
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,589
Taking 300,000 dollars from me wasn't enough,

276
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,629
so she went to see you at your office?

277
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,830
Did you say 300,000 dollars?

278
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,930
Did she threaten you with that ridiculous memorandum?

279
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:43,300
Why did you pay her when it isn't legally binding?

280
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,939
Proper protocol must be followed...

281
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,408
for a transfer of assets contract to be legally binding.

282
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,409
I know that since Yu Ri told me.

283
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,009
But how can that even matter...

284
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,680
when she threatened to go to Yu Ri's workplace?

285
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,320
Is Yu Ri all right?

286
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,790
I made sure she had no knowledge of this.

287
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,859
You still shouldn't have paid up.

288
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,899
Yu Ri conducted a protest,

289
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
and she said she lost her job and her income source because of it.

290
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,800
She threatened to get revenge once Yu Ri got a job.

291
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,569
After seeing Yu Ri on TV,

292
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,070
she immediately came to see me.

293
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,980
She said she wouldn't bring up Yu Ri's protest if I paid up.

294
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,209
Still.

295
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,949
Why did you pay her 300,000 dollars...

296
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,619
when she is to blame?

297
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:34,359
Your Honor, please protect our family.

298
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,889
I heard that the court doesn't grant a divorce...

299
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,459
if the cheating spouse asks for one.

300
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,559
I'm right, aren't I?

301
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,629
This is a family that has already been wrecked.

302
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,868
Even if this case were to get dismissed,

303
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,770
the plaintiff has no intention of returning home.

304
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,438
Would you consider giving your consent to the divorce?

305
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,510
Don't you have a family?

306
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,280
It's not easy to consent to a divorce when you have a child.

307
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,550
Your Honor! This isn't fair!

308
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,889
What will happen to my daughter if this divorce goes through?

309
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,060
Honey.

310
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,889
Please think about your daughter, Yu Ri and reconsider.

311
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,629
I'll be a better wife to you.

312
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,330
Can't you grasp the situation?

313
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,269
It's not about what's right or wrong.

314
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,898
My client wants a divorce.

315
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:23,800
You don't have any assets under your name.

316
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,969
Without the divorce, the division of assets can't be processed.

317
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:30,340
Agree to divorce, so you can have a part of the assets.

318
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,080
I want this to be a win-win situation for both parties.

319
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,790
Your Honor.

320
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,359
What kind of law is this?

321
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,800
Even if a husband cheats on his wife and abandons his family,

322
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,570
to get any part of the assets,

323
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,968
a wife must agree to divorce?

324
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,169
It's not something to get emotional about.

325
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,539
He left home to get a divorce.

326
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,309
No good will come from it if you insist on keeping...

327
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,310
the family together.

328
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,820
Live your own life.

329
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,399
(Han Myeong Jong)

330
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:33,139
(Kim Kyung Sook)

331
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,409
"She wronged me."

332
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,980
Hearing that from you...

333
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:44,850
sounds weird.

334
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,260
Did you represent them back then because you didn't think so?

335
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,730
That's what I do for a living.

336
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,230
I was simply doing my job.

337
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,329
It's unfortunate that our emotions have no place...

338
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,169
in matters like this.

339
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:02,899
You're giving me that pathetic look again...

340
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,240
just like that time.

341
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,039
Not everyone...

342
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,109
in the world has your strength.

343
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:13,480
How does it feel...

344
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,179
to be in my shoes now?

345
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,489
When you thought about your daughter,

346
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,189
was it easy to decide to divorce him?

347
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:25,689
Back then, my daughter was only in 12th grade.

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,030
Don't you think what goes around comes around now?

349
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,269
Are you telling me...

350
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,039
you wouldn't have gotten a divorce if I wasn't involved?

351
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,479
That's a possibility.

352
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,909
We were only in that courtroom because he had been unfaithful.

353
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,219
At least, my sense of humiliation could have been spared.

354
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,559
You always stopped me from coming over.

355
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,659
What a surprise to hear that you wanted me to come over.

356
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,629
- Well, Mom. - Yes?

357
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,840
A long time ago, Ms. Kim told you she wanted the house. Remember?

358
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:14,040
Yes, I do.

359
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,149
She hasn't reached out to you since then, right?

360
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,449
No.

361
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,718
But why are you asking me about that?

362
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,719
That was between me and your dad. Stay out of it.

363
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:29,958
You're not talking to her after that, right?

364
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,730
Of course, not.

365
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,399
Everything is okay with you too, right?

366
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,969
Did she try to get in touch with you or something?

367
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,569
Gosh, I showed the world...

368
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,100
what would happen if anyone messed with me.

369
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,310
How dare she try to call me? She'd be too scared to do that.

370
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You bet.

371
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:54,310
Stop worrying about her.

372
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,020
You should just start going on dates and make a family of your own now.

373
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,159
Dig in.

374
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,859
The bulgogi turned out very tender.

375
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,070
Oh, right. Guess what.

376
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,109
I ran into one of your colleagues in the elevator.

377
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,579
She had a bag full of groceries.

378
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,878
She seems so young, but she's excellent wife material.

379
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,448
She said she was cooking for her fiance,

380
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:29,480
so I shared my secret recipe for the abalone porridge.

381
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:32,418
Gosh, enough with your secret recipe!

382
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,119
- Seriously. - Don't talk to me like that.

383
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:37,290
She's the affair partner.

384
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,060
The woman Ms. Cha's husband had an affair with!

385
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Oh, my.

386
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,398
The secretary in the tabloid?

387
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,429
Yes.

388
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,129
My goodness, that wench.

389
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,040
Seriously. Keep your distance from her.

390
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,270
You can't judge people by their appearance.

391
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,239
Don't trust anyone. Please.

392
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,249
Right. Gosh. I mean, people talk about how you can't trust anyone.

393
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,609
How could she have an affair with her boss' husband?

394
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,290
Jae Hui.

395
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,350
How does it feel to be in my shoes now?

396
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,648
When you thought about your daughter,

397
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:41,320
was it easy to decide to divorce him?

398
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,490
You should look back on your life.

399
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,999
The world shouldn't allow those at fault to get their way...

400
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
simply because they hire an attorney.

401
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:09,080
("The Little Prince")

402
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,530
It's all done.

403
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:01,869
Try it.

404
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,050
How is it?

405
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,619
- It's so... - Yes?

406
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,020
awful.

407
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,129
Gosh. Come on, Kim Jae Hui.

408
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,359
I was joking. It's pretty good.

409
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,169
Next time, add some cheese and hold the ketchup.

410
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,969
- Okay. - Dad always added cheese.

411
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,010
Jae Hui.

412
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,750
Could you make a list of school events and give it to me?

413
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,449
I'll clear my schedule for those dates. Okay?

414
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,080
Mom.

415
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,250
I don't have to make a list of school events.

416
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,820
You just download the school app, and you'll get notifications.

417
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,490
Oh, right. Yes. That's it.

418
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,999
Now that your dad isn't around,

419
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,270
I'll make sure to check the app every day.

420
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,899
You'll start cooking breakfast too. Right?

421
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,770
Sure.

422
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,270
Text me what you want for breakfast the night before.

423
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,639
I'll try everything.

424
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,010
Thank you.

425
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,320
Yu Ri went through something similar like this.

426
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Yu Ri?

427
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,090
- You mean Han Yu Ri? - Yes.

428
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,389
Yu Ri told me her father had an affair with another woman.

429
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,959
She said it was still hard for her.

430
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:40,229
I heard her story too.

431
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,269
I heard that legally, she couldn't demand compensation...

432
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,899
from her father for his affair.

433
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:45,840
She said that felt unfair.

434
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,280
She told you all that?

435
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,919
I can call her and hang out with her from time to time, right?

436
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,820
Of course.

437
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,560
Gosh. This is so good.

438
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,399
It looks like we'll be together 24-7 now.

439
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,698
You had been waiting for that promotion.

440
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,840
You must be so upset.

441
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,139
It's okay.

442
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,980
The upside is that we get to be together all day now.

443
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,810
It's one of my many dreams too.

444
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,050
You had to go home early in the evening for Jae Hui.

445
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,850
I had to go back to the office in the afternoon.

446
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,659
We had never gone on a proper date in case we might get caught.

447
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,189
Right.

448
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,629
Oh, right. I met with Jae Hui.

449
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,428
Eun Kyung told Jae Hui...

450
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,859
that you and I weren't together or anything like that.

451
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,869
So keep our relationship a secret from her.

452
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:49,969
I don't buy that.

453
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:52,770
The Cha Eun Kyung I know...

454
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:55,480
probably turned you into the most evil man on Earth.

455
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:57,840
Never.

456
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,679
You don't know because you're not a parent.

457
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:02,719
Is that so?

458
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:04,449
That's good then, I guess.

459
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,490
What did you do with Jae Hui?

460
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,459
I showed her the room I decorated for her.

461
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,459
She was happy.

462
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,330
When will you show me the house?

463
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,869
Our attorney told me to be careful about bringing you there.

464
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,540
You cannot come to the house.

465
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,909
Let's eat.

466
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,810
- Gosh. Seriously. - That's fascinating.

467
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,349
- I didn't get any sleep. - I forgot to bring my book.

468
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,319
- Did we have homework? - What's that?

469
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,090
- What's that? - What's going on?

470
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,689
- Gosh. - Is that food?

471
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,059
Everyone, Jae Hui's mother sent us some snacks.

472
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,199
- No way. - Gosh. Nice!

473
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,898
Our class will start in five minutes,

474
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:52,928
so enjoy the snacks.

475
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,570
- Yes! - Yes!

476
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,908
- That looks good! - It looks delicious.

477
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,969
- Gosh. It's bread. - Oh, my.

478
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:02,780
- Isn't that from Gangnam? - Cool!

479
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,050
Jae Hui's mother has a classy taste.

480
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:06,449
- Gosh. - That looks good.

481
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,719
- Ma'am. - Yes, Jae Hui.

482
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,489
Did my mother stop by?

483
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,049
No. She sent it through a delivery service.

484
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,619
- Go on and eat. - Okay.

485
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,429
Do I have to spell it out for her?

486
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,369
I want her to come in person.

487
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:45,090
- What's going on? - It's my dressing table.

488
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,290
Doing makeup in the bathroom is the worst for women.

489
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,260
Sir, where should we place this?

490
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,399
- Put it in the small room. - Hold on.

491
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:59,070
I'm sorry, sir. But I'd like a refund for this.

492
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,669
Why did you do it?

493
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,169
Why do you think?

494
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,409
I needed a dressing table for myself.

495
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,549
You knew the family investigator would be here soon.

496
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,218
When the people from court come to inspect the house...

497
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,678
and see items belonging to a woman,

498
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,888
you know I'd be at a disadvantage.

499
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,549
Why are you doing this?

500
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,218
It's just called a dressing table.

501
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,219
But it's basically a mirror with some drawers.

502
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,560
It doesn't belong only to women.

503
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,929
Must I have the same talk over and over again with you too?

504
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,070
This is exhausting.

505
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,139
Hasn't it crossed your mind that you're making me feel insecure?

506
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,980
Once the lawsuit is over,

507
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,580
am I really going to move in here?

508
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,490
The three of us here?

509
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,959
You've never thought about it.

510
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,859
Sa Ra.

511
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,899
We're lovers.

512
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,159
But I never thought about remarrying.

513
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,800
I'm sorry if you got the wrong idea.

514
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,399
But I must make myself clear now.

515
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:12,340
You always told me you wanted to live with me after the divorce.

516
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,009
I thought you wanted to leave Cha Eun Kyung...

517
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,438
and start over with me.

518
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:19,178
I already failed once at marriage. Why would I want to marry again?

519
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,949
Then what about me? I have never been married.

520
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:24,549
Now that I fell in love with a man, I wanted to be happy.

521
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,919
Am I asking for too much?

522
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,459
We shouldn't...

523
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,929
see each other on weekends for the time being.

524
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,059
- Why shouldn't we? - Isn't it obvious?

525
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,799
Until I get custody of my daughter,

526
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,669
I need to spend time with Jae Hui on weekends.

527
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,240
- Let me come with you. - No. Never.

528
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
You didn't have to sound so cold.

529
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,280
You asked me something that would never happen.

530
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,049
To protect our relationship,

531
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,879
I left a job I had for ten years.

532
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,080
How could you completely dismiss my feelings?

533
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,519
Instead of comforting me about what happened,

534
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,990
you went on and on about Jae Hui.

535
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:04,858
What on earth am I to you?

536
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:07,358
Are you asking me to decide between you and Jae Hui?

537
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,459
Can't I?

538
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,060
How come I always come second?

539
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,129
How much longer must I put up with this?

540
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,869
Since you asked, let me be crystal clear.

541
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,080
Jae Hui is my top priority.

542
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,179
I will not tolerate...

543
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,909
any behavior that could potentially hurt my daughter in any way.

544
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:31,480
You make it sound like I hurt Jae Hui.

545
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,448
As if I'm some bully.

546
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,490
Yes, we are bullies in this case.

547
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,859
How could you say that about us?

548
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,199
- How could you describe our love... - Gosh.

549
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,800
If I have to repeatedly fight about this, let's end it here.

550
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,699
- What did you say? - Stop it! I'm sick of it.

551
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,469
Did I promise to marry you?

552
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,939
Know your place!

553
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,128
Oh, right. Yu Ri's blind date is tonight.

554
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,230
- Don't forget. Okay? - Gosh.

555
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,859
How could I forget?

556
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,029
- Thank you. - Sure. Bye.

557
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,969
- Bye. Get home safely. - Okay.

558
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:23,469
Gosh.

559
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,240
- Bye. - Bye.

560
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,119
Have the deed of the house transferred to me.

561
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:42,858
Or a famous attorney will talk to the media that...

562
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,219
you're breaking your promise.

563
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,158
Your daughter did that to me. So it's my turn now.

564
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,958
I told you to stay away from my daughter.

565
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,559
You two moved in together because you were so in love.

566
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,968
Why are you blackmailing me now?

567
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:53,428
I can't get a job because of your daughter.

568
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:54,698
She should be held responsible.

569
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,469
I need to make ends meet somehow.

570
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,839
Thanks to your arrogant daughter,

571
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,708
I got fired from my job and had no future.

572
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,179
So I was going to file a lawsuit.

573
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,908
But I guess he was a father after all.

574
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,279
He must have felt some sort of remorse.

575
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,279
He begged me not to file a lawsuit.

576
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,879
So I let her off the hook once.

577
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,690
So what? Do you want me to thank you?

578
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,559
Gosh. You're ridiculous. Seriously.

579
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,420
You were the ones who did wrong! Why are you blaming my daughter?

580
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,659
I used up my retirement money to pay for his hospital bills.

581
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,369
Do you know how much money he took from me until he died?

582
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,940
I put up with him because he said he'd give me the house when he died.

583
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,499
He abandoned his family because he loved me.

584
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,569
But he couldn't even recognize me at the end.

585
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,509
He was your husband once and Yu Ri's father.

586
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,080
Don't you even pity him?

587
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,449
Pity him?

588
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,779
He got what was coming for him.

589
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:51,290
I really don't have any money.

590
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:53,528
I already gave you 300,000 dollars.

591
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:55,330
I had saved it up for Yu Ri's wedding.

592
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,429
I gave it to you because I never wanted to see you again.

593
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,429
Please.

594
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,739
Stop blackmailing me with your late husband and my daughter.

595
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,210
You should start living your life differently now.

596
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,279
Don't tell me what to do. Who do you think you are?

597
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,310
Besides, your daughter became an attorney.

598
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:14,979
She has a bright future ahead of her.

599
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
Do you want to ruin her future because of money?

600
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,818
- What kind of mother are you? - That's precisely why.

601
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:20,850
I put up with you all these years because I'm a mother.

602
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,290
I bet Yu Ri will be earning far more than the value of this house.

603
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,559
A daughter went...

604
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,759
to her father's workplace and held a protest to reveal his affair.

605
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:32,899
A daughter who never saw her dad...

606
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,100
not knowing he was dying?

607
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:37,969
Will the public accept her as an attorney?

608
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,339
Think about it carefully.

609
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,089
How evil...

610
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:09,069
Is this the material I mentioned?

611
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,900
Yes. A record of the 300,000-dollar transfer...

612
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,408
and recordings of our phone calls I left...

613
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:17,210
to use as evidence in case she came after Yu Ri.

614
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,610
I'll take a look.

615
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,879
You did well by taping the calls.

616
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,909
Thanks.

617
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:24,818
I'd been through one court case,

618
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,089
and it taught me I'd need evidence.

619
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,429
It feels a bit strange to sit here across from you.

620
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,440
You berated me back then.

621
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,110
Now you're offering to help me.

622
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,239
Don't you find that strange too?

623
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
Not at all.

624
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,380
I only did my job.

625
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,819
As you fought as best you could as a mother,

626
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:04,259
I did as best I could for the client who hired me.

627
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,888
Actually, because of you,

628
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:08,730
I even saw a psychiatrist.

629
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:11,159
That wasn't because of me.

630
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,670
It was because of the two people who had the affair.

631
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,369
You're an attorney through and through.

632
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,369
There's no beating you in an argument.

633
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,580
If you hadn't divorced then,

634
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,949
your husband would've spent all he had on Kim Hui Ra.

635
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,618
Even if the case was dismissed,

636
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,989
he'd have never returned home.

637
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,029
You'd have struggled under a marriage in name only.

638
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,259
Goodness.

639
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,999
Are you saying you berated me into getting divorced...

640
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,669
when it wasn't what I wanted?

641
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,670
No.

642
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:50,940
I work only for my clients.

643
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,110
Will my Yu Ri...

644
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,310
become like you now?

645
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,650
Yes, possibly.

646
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:10,888
I still don't know what it means exactly...

647
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,460
to work only for a client.

648
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,429
Thanks for your help anyway.

649
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,869
Since we met again, I hope we can get along.

650
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,170
Then...

651
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,469
I'll get going.

652
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:25,839
Wait.

653
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,980
The fury.

654
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:35,380
Did it fade away...

655
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
with time?

656
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:40,948
I just said...

657
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,258
it was in the past and that we can get along now.

658
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,420
Not between us.

659
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:49,860
I mean the fury you had for your husband.

660
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,469
What could I do? He was my kid's dad.

661
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,339
But...

662
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,179
things will be different for you compared to how I felt.

663
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,580
My husband died.

664
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,520
He's gone, and I have no object left to hate even if I want to.

665
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:19,330
I'm okay with losing my husband,

666
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:23,060
but Yu Ri can't lose her dad.

667
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,900
I was afraid she'd lose her dad...

668
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,639
if I treated him like a traitor,

669
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,500
so I kept it inside.

670
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:36,139
I told her I'd forgotten it all and forgiven him.

671
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,549
She should still have a father figure.

672
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:05,739
Ms. Cha.

673
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,509
The case you said you'd think about.

674
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,850
You didn't take it, did you?

675
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,119
I can't say.

676
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,860
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

677
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,069
Today, 6:30pm.

678
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,139
Lobby of the IO Hotel that's right across your office.

679
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,469
I said you'd be there.

680
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,710
It's my only wish. Will you be there?

681
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:45,040
I don't have the time or energy to go on a blind date.

682
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,850
She's so naive.

683
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,679
It's all so frustrating.

684
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,290
What time is it?

685
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,060
Hello.

686
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,130
I'm Cho Yoon Sung, your blind date.

687
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:09,540
I'm here, and I'm wearing a checkered jacket.

688
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,480
If you're in your late 20s, it's the perfect age to get married.

689
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,679
What?

690
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,350
I'm not sure.

691
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,690
Who marries in their late 20s these days?

692
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,729
The times might have changed,

693
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,429
but so does a woman after 30.

694
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:38,159
It might be different for you since you have a good job.

695
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,739
- What are you talking about? - Your value?

696
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,908
He's an old-fashioned young man.

697
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,170
I see...

698
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,540
Why do I suddenly wish Mr. Jun was here?

699
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,710
So that's what you think.

700
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,980
Gosh.

701
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,049
Here.

702
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,489
- Take your time, Mom. - How lovely.

703
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:08,928
We were going to go straight home after the wedding.

704
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:11,360
- Did we bother busy you? - I'm not busy at all.

705
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,330
I'd wanted to bring you to a place like this.

706
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:16,040
Everything's so shiny.

707
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,170
Soon Rye raised her kids well,

708
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,269
- and her daughter married well. - Did she?

709
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,270
Yes.

710
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,549
This place is too fancy for me.

711
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,448
- What? - Why would you say that?

712
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,150
You raised our son well too.

713
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,279
You deserve to be here.

714
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,790
Here.

715
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,150
Hey.

716
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,118
Can you not do this in front of your grown son?

717
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,088
Why do you care how well I treat my woman?

718
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:42,230
"My woman?" Dad, please.

719
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:45,659
When will you introduce your girlfriend to us, Eun Ho?

720
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:48,169
Do you not have one yet?

721
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,499
I do have one.

722
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,199
But I won't introduce her to you.

723
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,238
I wonder who the person is that you like.

724
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,639
I'll leave you here if you don't stop.

725
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,939
- I need to go to the restroom. - Okay.

726
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,279
Let's try this.

727
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,909
Here.

728
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Ms. Han.

729
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,179
- Hey. - Hi.

730
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,290
She's a colleague of mine.

731
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:12,290
Hello.

732
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,810
That must be her.

733
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,319
Stop staring.

734
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,420
Stop staring, Dad.

735
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,690
She's pretty.

736
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:46,830
It's raining.

737
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:48,429
Ms. Han.

738
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,730
You don't have an umbrella, do you?

739
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:56,339
How about pamak?

740
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:00,069
- What's that? - Pajeon and makgeolli.

741
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,738
Stop shortening words. It's not funny.

742
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:03,739
It is.

743
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,480
- Pajeon and makgeolli? - Yes.

744
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:09,380
You could shorten almost anything if you keep trying.

745
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,088
(79 Daepo)

746
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:15,420
Don't you love the sound of rain?

747
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:19,259
Here.

748
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,989
I'll pour you one.

749
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:26,699
It looks so good.

750
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:32,199
Here goes.

751
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,940
Look at how crunchy it is.

752
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,009
Here.

753
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,610
You said you were too busy with work to date.

754
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,650
You were just too busy to date me.

755
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:46,750
Well...

756
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,960
It wasn't like that.

757
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,088
I didn't know about the blind date until an hour ago.

758
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:56,359
What do you mean...

759
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,759
you didn't know about the date?

760
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:00,368
Let's eat while it's hot.

761
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:01,699
It's nice and crunchy.

762
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:03,600
Yes, let's eat.

763
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:10,040
- Is it good? - Yes, it is.

764
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,119
Our people have to change how parents treat their grown kids.

765
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,350
- Oh, thanks. - Sure.

766
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:23,759
It's my life.

767
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,830
Just because she's my mom, is she allowed to do that?

768
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,830
Isn't it because you're too obedient?

769
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:31,630
I don't listen to my mom,

770
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,299
so she doesn't interfere much.

771
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,799
You were with your parents, weren't you?

772
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,440
Yes. They'd come to Seoul to attend a wedding,

773
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,139
and I wanted to treat them to some hotel coffee.

774
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,509
Really?

775
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,150
How nice of you.

776
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,350
They seemed close.

777
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,488
Don't even get me started. They're still like newlyweds.

778
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,619
Dad calls Mom "my woman."

779
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,259
How sweet.

780
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,100
Cheers.

781
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:07,900
Cheers.

782
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,670
How refreshing.

783
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,350
I really can manage on my own.

784
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,749
Not again.

785
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,020
Will you ditch me like you did in Sodae-ri?

786
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:24,819
I won't let you today.

787
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,218
Then I'll call a taxi.

788
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,520
You should too.

789
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:33,259
Okay. I'll watch you get into the taxi.

790
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:34,659
Goodness.

791
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:47,339
So who was that woman from before?

792
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,170
Who do you mean?

793
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,609
The woman who made even you freeze...

794
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,509
the moment you laid eyes on her.

795
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,389
My dad's affair partner.

796
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,190
The woman my mom sued.

797
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:05,659
I see.

798
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
All the taxis seem to be booked.

799
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,130
Is it because it rained?

800
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:16,440
There's a huge delay.

801
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,940
I found one.

802
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,679
It'll be here soon.

803
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,549
Does your mother know?

804
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,179
She doesn't.

805
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:34,619
That's why she set up the blind date.

806
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:38,560
Do you know what's even crazier?

807
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:39,830
What's that?

808
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:44,130
I think Cha Eun Kyung took that woman's case.

809
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,230
What?

810
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:48,100
She hired me to represent her in her divorce case,

811
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,839
and she'll represent my dad's affair partner?

812
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,810
Honestly,

813
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:57,040
is she a robot or a monster?

814
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,279
Hey, that is crazy.

815
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,908
If I were our CEO,

816
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:03,178
I'd leave the firm to her and not Jung Woo Jin.

817
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:04,179
Honestly.

818
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,948
If Ms. Cha were CEO,

819
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,520
we'd be the country's number one.

820
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,719
We must keep our work and lives apart.

821
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,388
I'm directly involved,

822
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,130
so she can't tell me, she said.

823
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,659
You're a bit like that.

824
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,369
You're all about separating your work and life,

825
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,469
so you can't date me.

826
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,239
- Hey. - "Hey."

827
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:28,770
My taxi's here.

828
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,679
Is that it?

829
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,649
It is. I'll go home, then.

830
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,650
Bye.

831
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,989
Drive safely, sir.

832
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:44,360
See you.

833
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,089
Bye.

834
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,850
Kim Jae Hui.

835
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,190
Were you waiting for me?

836
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,190
I was just watching TV.

837
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:18,489
I was about to go to bed.

838
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,500
You're home early for once.

839
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,230
Did you get the snacks?

840
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:28,599
Yes. The kids went wild.

841
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,400
They said it was luxurious bread their moms never got it for them...

842
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,509
and wondered how you bought so much.

843
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:35,270
They were amazed.

844
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,738
They asked if you made lots of money.

845
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:38,880
What did you tell them?

846
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,610
"Do you know the TV talk show 'You Quiz?"

847
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,150
"My mom was on it." That's what I said.

848
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,690
You never told anyone I was on TV.

849
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:49,960
Did you suddenly want to brag?

850
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:54,630
I just answered the questions they asked.

851
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,759
Did you?

852
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,270
Did you like what I did?

853
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,170
It wasn't bad.

854
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,909
Can't you praise me just once?

855
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,139
Good job.

856
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,679
But...

857
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:16,549
I'll say it again because you don't seem to be getting it.

858
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:17,880
What?

859
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,290
Next time, come in person.

860
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:23,088
The last time...

861
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:26,020
you picked me up was after my third-grade field trip.

862
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:28,790
Got it.

863
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,830
I'll try harder to spare more time.

864
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,130
Okay.

865
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:35,928
I left this semester's schedule...

866
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:37,238
on your desk.

867
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:38,239
Okay.

868
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:40,509
- I'm off to bed. - Sleep well.

869
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,790
Next time, add some cheese and hold the ketchup.

870
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,330
Dad always added cheese.

871
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,060
I was afraid she'd lose her dad...

872
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,569
if I treated him like a traitor,

873
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,369
so I kept it inside.

874
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,299
I told her...

875
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:47,270
I'd forgotten it all and forgiven him.

876
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,339
She should still have...

877
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,080
a father figure.

878
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,089
It's just like your dad's, isn't it?

879
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:04,790
His omelets are better than any hotel chef's.

880
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,529
Eat up and drink your juice too.

881
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,079
- Hello. - Hello.

882
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,019
- Hello. - Hello.

883
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,049
Hello.

884
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:44,900
- Hello. - Hello.

885
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,409
Why are you back?

886
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,650
Han Yu Ri. She still seems to work here.

887
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,810
You didn't take me seriously?

888
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,980
No, I didn't.

889
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,350
Your case is all over the media.

890
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,020
Do you want me to add Yu Ri's too?

891
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,290
Guess who the scariest person in the world is?

892
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,060
It's someone with nothing to lose.

893
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,129
And that's the situation I am in right now.

894
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,500
What do you mean you have nothing to lose?

895
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,230
- You do have something. - What?

896
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:22,029
Three hundred thousand dollars.

897
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:26,299
You ripped it off from Yu Ri's mom.

898
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,279
I'm glad you brought up 300,000 dollars.

899
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:34,349
That house is now worth a million,

900
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,750
but I only got 300,000 dollars.

901
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:37,880
You think that's enough to get a house in Seoul?

902
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,349
Whatever. I don't care anymore.

903
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,118
Don't take it any further...

904
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,889
before I make you care.

905
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,830
- Have you lost your mind? - About 300,000 dollars.

906
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:49,029
Han Yu Ri isn't aware of it.

907
00:53:51,259 --> 00:53:53,730
And you know what she's like.

908
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,469
That's considered a threat in law.

909
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:59,068
If I tell Han Yu Ri about it,

910
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,039
she'll file a criminal complaint and sue you...

911
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,710
to get it back.

912
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:07,409
Then it'll become a complete mess.

913
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,179
Will you be okay with that?

914
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:19,560
Ms. Han, to my office.

915
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:21,989
How dare you...

916
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,670
Come in.

917
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,480
Why did you call me?

918
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:37,639
I wanted to ask you a question.

919
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,779
Ms. Cha Eun Kyung.

920
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:42,250
Since you recently graduated from the law school,

921
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:45,080
you must remember studying unfair profits...

922
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:46,889
and unlawful payment, right?

923
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,790
Yes, why do you ask?

924
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,190
Did she get into trouble again?

925
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,389
Well...

926
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,329
It seems she wants me to take her case,

927
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,869
but I'm too busy. Why don't you take over?

928
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,500
Ms. Cha.

929
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,279
I can't do that.

930
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,480
No? Too bad.

931
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,650
Then let's get her out of my sight first.

932
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:23,049
Will you get lost?

933
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,060
You two are the same.

934
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:28,560
What the heck is wrong with you?

935
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,899
I'm going to sue you all.

936
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,130
Do you want me to sue you first...

937
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,729
for business obstruction, home invasion,

938
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,429
and violation of the network act?

939
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,639
Get out.

940
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,020
Let's get some coffee.

941
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,000
How did you do that?

942
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,170
What can a lawyer do?

943
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:12,869
Just mess her up with the law.

944
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,940
Isn't that why I spent my 20s...

945
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:19,540
studying to death eating only gimbap and cup noodles?

946
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:26,049
Sorry that I got you wrong.

947
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,960
It's nothing new. You always get me wrong.

948
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,830
But you always make it that way.

949
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:35,960
You should've given me a heads-up.

950
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,569
You didn't get me wrong.

951
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:45,940
It turns out I was your dad's and Kim Hui Ra's...

952
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:48,909
attorney.

953
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,239
You were?

954
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,250
As I've been dealing with my own divorce,

955
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,449
I'm seeing the case in a new light.

956
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,460
I've repaid my debt today.

957
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:19,739
What debt?

958
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,509
Ms. Cha.

959
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:26,679
Thank you for helping my mom get divorced.

960
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:30,119
If my mom...

961
00:57:31,049 --> 00:57:32,819
hadn't gotten divorced,

962
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,789
she would've never gotten out of the marriage...

963
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,889
that was only on paper.

964
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,699
Thank you so much for saying what I've always wanted to say...

965
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,529
to that woman.

966
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,600
You got it off my chest.

967
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:52,900
What did you want to say to her?

968
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:58,580
To get lost.

969
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:03,080
I wished for her to get the heck out...

970
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:06,279
of my mom's life.

971
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:19,029
Did you like the warranty?

972
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:25,699
You should get her out of your mind...

973
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:27,610
as well.

974
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:42,350
- Let's go. - Okay.

975
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,360
The weather looks even nicer today.

976
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:49,259
I agree.

977
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,400
It's the perfect weather for a walk.

978
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,969
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

979
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:02,369
Mom. Let's dine out tomorrow.

980
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,339
It's on me. Are you free tomorrow?

981
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,290
Mom. Over here.

982
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
Gosh.

983
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,190
Look at this place.

984
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,758
Is this where lawyers have their meals?

985
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:26,830
Only for those in dramas.

986
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:28,900
We have gimbap in the car.

987
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,110
Why is it so expensive?

988
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:35,869
Hey.

989
00:59:36,509 --> 00:59:38,440
- Let's leave. - Why?

990
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,639
It's too expensive.

991
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:41,549
Oh, stop it.

992
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:44,420
I want to get you something expensive today.

993
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:46,279
Why? Do you have something to celebrate?

994
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:54,330
A complicating case was resolved.

995
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,790
I couldn't be more relieved.

996
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,729
That's great. How did your blind date go?

997
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,499
- Seriously, Mom. - Sorry.

998
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,099
That day, Mom and I...

999
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,368
- didn't say anything about Dad. - Why do I have to...

1000
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,369
get in a relationship?

1001
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,238
- My mom was relieved... - You do it.

1002
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:09,439
to protect her child...

1003
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,179
- from a rough wind... - Oh, my gosh. I shouldn't.

1004
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:14,380
that she showed the most relieved smile after a while.

1005
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,980
Perhaps that's when...

1006
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,920
we finally got over Dad and his mistress.

1007
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,818
- You're being silly. - Feel free to choose what you like.

1008
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:28,330
- And there were two more moms. - What do they have?

1009
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:30,659
Your daughter fell asleep in tears after waiting for her mom.

1010
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,799
And it's been 13 years since.

1011
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,459
(Good Partner)

1012
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,529
I raised Jae Hui alone.

1013
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,869
What? How dare you lie?

1014
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,199
If you don't get Jae Hui's custody,

1015
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:46,170
will my child get to live with his dad?

1016
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,810
Let me ask you a favor.

1017
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,310
If he's not my son, then whose son is he?

1018
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,880
Are you sure something didn't go wrong?

1019
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,048
People even ignore their own children these days.

1020
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:55,810
He raised someone else's son with devotion.

1021
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,150
Let's get the most alimony in history.
