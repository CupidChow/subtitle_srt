(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

11
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,949
You really didn't have to walk me to school.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,950
(A year later)

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,819
- Have a good day. Bye. - Bye.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,190
- Call me later. - I will.

15
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,039
Ms. Cha.

16
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:14,110
A managing partner appears at the court himself?

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,880
Look who's talking. You're a managing partner too.

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,610
Am I?

19
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,080
I heard Spring Again has been thriving lately.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,419
Do you eat only gimbap and work like before?

21
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,190
I introduced Mr. Jun to you for a reason.

22
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,359
To learn the balance between life and work?

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,390
Of course.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,459
I have another trial. You should get going.

25
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,569
Make sure to eat well.

26
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,199
Yes. Have a good day.

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,009
- Hello. - Hello.

28
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,179
Hello, Ms. Han.

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,678
Hello.

30
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,179
- Hello. - Hello.

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,080
- Hello. - Hello.

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,418
- Hello. - Hello.

33
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,419
Good morning.

34
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,198
- Yes? - Ms. Han.

35
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,669
The orientation for a new attorney is ready.

36
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,780
- I'll be right there. - Okay.

37
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:33,560
Hello, Ms. Han.

38
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,059
We're only a few years of experience apart.

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,259
Don't be like this.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,989
Relax and have a seat.

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm very glad to work with a star attorney.

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,310
Even before I joined this firm,

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,870
you were always my role model.

44
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,120
Welcome to the divorce team.

45
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,948
I hope you're not disappointed to receive a divorce case...

46
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:05,620
when you just joined.

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,060
Not at all.

48
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,930
I've always wanted to be a divorce specialized attorney.

49
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,729
I'm looking forward to the cases I'll be working on.

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,530
I'll do my best.

51
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,430
I'm glad to hear that.

52
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,138
Most attorneys don't want to deal with divorce cases...

53
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,239
when they are newbies.

54
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,839
Am I really a divorce team newbie?

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,210
How can I move to a corporation team?

56
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,419
By the way, do you have a car? And a watch?

57
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,319
I don't.

58
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,289
A car and a watch are a must for attorneys.

59
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,729
Without them, it'll be inconvenient.

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,530
Trials often take place outside the city.

61
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,828
And if you look at your phone to check the time,

62
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,030
it's not good manners in front of your clients.

63
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,769
Got it?

64
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Get a car first.

65
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,909
And a watch too.

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,809
Time is crucial for attorneys.

67
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,578
If you keep taking your phone out to check the time,

68
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,180
it's not good manners in front of your clients.

69
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,319
I'll make sure to get a watch.

70
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,389
But as for the car,

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,220
I'm fine sticking to public transportation.

72
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,200
Sure.

75
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:54,600
Don't you get tired after driving me home...

76
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:55,900
every day?

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
- Why don't we... - Oh, it's fine.

78
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,700
This is the only time we get to meet after work.

79
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,340
Don't say that.

80
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,510
Sorry. I've been too busy.

81
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,979
No, it's okay.

82
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,749
Still, it'll be better now with the newbie, right?

83
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,919
Yes.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,320
I'm grateful for you all the time.

85
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,020
One thing is clear.

86
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,260
Like how I met you after becoming a divorce attorney,

87
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,830
life never goes as planned.

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,100
But I still like it.

91
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,220
Hi.

(27 years ago)

93
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,510
Jung Woo Jin?

94
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,710
- Yes. - Hi.

95
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,910
Nice to meet you.

96
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:20,479
Call me Aunt Ae Yeon from now on.

97
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,390
I think this is my first time seeing you in the office.

98
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,359
You look wonderful.

99
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:42,999
- Woo Jin. - Yes.

100
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:47,739
Help me divorce your dad.

101
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,650
I'm sorry to say this to you.

102
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:00,090
But it'd look funny for me to find another attorney.

103
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,530
Have you made up your mind?

104
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Yes.

105
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:12,229
We can't even have a logical conversation anymore.

106
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,600
File it right away, please.

107
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,309
I'm...

108
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,439
really sorry.

109
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,710
No, don't say that.

110
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,720
I'll put in a good word...

111
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,650
with my ace attorney.

112
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Thanks.

Did you want to see me, Mr. Jung?

115
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,729
Ms. Han.

116
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,470
She wants to divorce Mr. Oh Dae Gyu.

117
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,580
Can you help her?

118
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,450
Mr. Oh Dae Gyu?

119
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,450
Nice to meet you.

120
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:11,929
Nice to meet you too.

121
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,260
I understand. This way.

122
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,460
May I ask why Daejeong of all law firms?

123
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:44,790
Otherwise, he wouldn't end it soon.

124
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,859
If he refuses to divorce me, it'll be a pain in the neck.

125
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,329
And if his office is in charge of it,

126
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,200
he won't make a big deal out of it in embarrassment.

127
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,970
I know what he's like.

128
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,440
I see.

129
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,849
Have you tried to settle it with him?

130
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,509
There's no point.

131
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:08,850
I bet he'll argue he's right about everything.

132
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:10,180
I don't even want to talk to him.

133
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,519
It's been three years since we haven't talked to each other.

134
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,489
I want to end it now.

135
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,830
Yes. I understand.

136
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:26,269
I don't even want to run into him.

137
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,269
I'll leave now.

138
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Sure.

139
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,008
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,249
You said the settlement begins after filing a written complaint.

141
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,109
I'm here to file a complaint.

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
What's the problem?

143
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,049
Have you forgotten that this is my firm?

144
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,190
It's my son's firm.

145
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,749
Wouldn't it be weird for me to go someplace else?

146
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,819
My son is the CEO.

147
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,259
I should save the lawsuit cost...

148
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,758
when I don't know how much you're going to give me.

149
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,759
How dare you? Are you out of your mind?

150
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,570
Stop right there.

151
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,970
Ms. Han.

152
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,139
What did that woman say?

153
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,779
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,310
I'm Ms. Park Ae Yeon's attorney.

155
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,409
What? She signed a contract?

156
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,849
Who'd allow her to file a written complaint against me...

157
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,149
through my own company?

158
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,359
It was Mr. Jung Woo Jin's order.

159
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,439
Hey, Jung Woo Jin.

160
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,509
What the heck do you think you're doing?

161
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,810
Daejeong is going to take the case against me?

162
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:47,119
It's basically like a son battling his father in court!

163
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,779
She raised me.

164
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,619
I couldn't tell her to go to a different law firm.

165
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,320
You know a lot of other attorneys.

166
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,889
If you need an attorney, you can easily hire someone else.

167
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,559
What did you say? How dare you?

168
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,830
This isn't the time to act proud.

169
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,369
She must have waited for you at home for decades.

170
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,998
Please acknowledge that at least this once.

171
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,340
I didn't do anything wrong.

172
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,909
Why must I be the only understanding spouse in this?

173
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,539
If you regret it after the divorce, there's nothing you can do.

174
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,739
You've already been separated.

175
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,909
- They might approve the divorce. - I've lived...

176
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,850
the life of an ATM.

177
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,850
At home, I was treated like a machine that generated money.

178
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,220
Then the divorce will go through.

179
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,589
That's the number one excuse old spouses who get divorced make.

180
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,629
Hey!

181
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,590
I know that you worked hard!

182
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,299
But you can't be stubborn...

183
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,830
and demand your spouse to acknowledge that.

184
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,869
Your wife also made sacrifices for the family...

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,669
- just like you. - I never asked her...

186
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,899
to acknowledge my hard work.

187
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,340
After being patient for so long, I expected her to stop being mad.

188
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,269
I had no idea she would ask me for a divorce!

189
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,680
You were the one who asked for the separation.

190
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,580
I thought it would help our marriage.

191
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,019
You...

192
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,070
(Law Firm Spring Again)

193
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,609
Ms. Cha.

194
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,050
Mr. Oh?

195
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,629
My wife wants to divorce me.

196
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,258
- Pardon? - Of all the law firms, she asked...

197
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,430
my company to take her case.

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
Have you ever seen anything like this?

199
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,470
I can't believe her audacity!

200
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,040
I heard you left the company.

201
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,209
But still.

202
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,979
How could she betray me like this?

203
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,779
So what brings you here, Mr. Oh?

204
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,290
Ms. Cha.

205
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,090
Take my case.

206
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,658
You cannot lose.

207
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,729
You must wipe the floor with those jerks at Daejeong.

208
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,609
(Last Case: Good, Partner)

209
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,379
(In session)

210
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,550
Next, we will proceed with Case 2020-8723.

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,649
I ask Plaintiff Park Ae Yeon, and Defendant Oh Dae Gyu,

212
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,749
and their counsels to come forward.

213
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,590
We should go.

214
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,199
Please take a seat.

215
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,040
(Defendant, Plaintiff)

216
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,439
I'm Han Yu Ri, Plaintiff Park Ae Yeon's counsel...

217
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,109
from Daejeong. We're present for the hearing.

218
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,409
I see.

219
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:07,049
I'm Cha Eun Kyung, Defendant Oh Dae Gyu's counsel...

220
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,820
from Law Firm Spring Again. We're present for the hearing.

221
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,090
I see.

222
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,590
All right. State your petition.

223
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,229
(Defendant)

224
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,469
(Plaintiff)

225
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,599
The plaintiff...

226
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,099
raised a child that the defendant brought...

227
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,499
into their marriage the best she could...

228
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,340
and supported the defendant throughout her life.

229
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:38,279
But instead of showing gratitude for the plaintiff's sacrifices,

230
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,050
he took her support for granted.

231
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,479
The plaintiff claims that their marriage ended...

232
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,190
because the defendant neglected his family...

233
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,658
and treated her unjustly.

234
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,790
Your Honor. That's nonsense.

235
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:53,089
I see that the defendant's counsel...

236
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,459
hasn't filed a response to the petition yet.

237
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,759
What is your response?

238
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,700
If you have any proposals for dividing the assets,

239
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,399
we will arrange the next hearing as a mediation session.

240
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,769
The defendant does not want to divorce her.

241
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,210
Does he not agree to the divorce?

242
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
He does not.

243
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,109
I knew it.

244
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:15,119
It's been over three years since we've been separated.

245
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,850
He's refusing to divorce me to torture me.

246
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,819
For 30 years,

247
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,430
the defendant financially provided for the family.

248
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,658
He couldn't spend as much time with the plaintiff...

249
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,899
as he had wanted.

250
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,398
But it's a groundless claim that he neglected his family...

251
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,830
or treated her unjustly.

252
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,769
Your Honor, I was like her ATM, nothing more, nothing less.

253
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,109
If you were an ATM,

254
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,909
I was a housekeeper.

255
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,309
I had to clean up...

256
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,210
for decades after a man who never lifted a finger at home.

257
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,748
I did my absolute best...

258
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:49,550
to feed and clothe the child you brought into our marriage.

259
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,049
You should be thanking me.

260
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,619
Why don't you be more honest with yourself?

261
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,559
Just say that you don't need me now that I'm not making any money.

262
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,619
You jerk.

263
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,528
That's all you can think of because money is everything to you.

264
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,589
Forget it.

265
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,459
If you don't give me half of your assets,

266
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,028
I'll take you to court. That's all I'm going to say.

267
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,268
All you ever talk about is money.

268
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,800
This is why I say I'm treated like an ATM.

269
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,369
It's not like I cheated on you and had Woo Jin.

270
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,099
A woman I dated before our marriage...

271
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,108
suddenly showed up,

272
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,508
said he was my son, and left him with me.

273
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,070
- What choice did I have? - I'm sick of it!

274
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,509
It's that again!

275
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,450
I'm not here to discuss how it happened.

276
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:19,909
You...

277
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,748
Have you ever thanked me even once for supporting you?

278
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,789
What? Just be honest.

279
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,559
You used Woo Jin as a bargaining chip...

280
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,888
against me throughout our marriage!

281
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,060
When did I do that?

282
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,090
How could you say that about your own son?

283
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,330
All right.

284
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,999
- Mr. Oh. - Please stop.

285
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,759
We're in a courthouse.

286
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,940
(Defendant, Plaintiff)

287
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,649
My goodness. I'm so angry. How could you be so ungrateful?

288
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,580
What?

289
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,649
How dare you glare at me?

290
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,779
You think you’re the center of everything, don’t you?

291
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,719
"Ungrateful?" I should call you ungrateful!

292
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,518
- You little... - Gosh.

293
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,290
Aunt. Let me drop you off.

294
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,158
- Okay. - Ms. Han. See you in the office.

295
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,159
Okay.

296
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,188
You must think you're all that!

297
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,199
Mr. Oh.

298
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,569
It seems both parties have a lot to say to each other.

299
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,938
Let's set up a meeting before the next hearing.

300
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,070
I'll get going.

301
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,810
Okay. I'll call you.

302
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Mr. Oh!

303
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,819
For the two of you,

304
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,718
it may be better to schedule a private meeting to talk...

305
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,719
than a hearing.

306
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,520
We'll help you, so you guys can talk it through.

307
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,289
Talk? Don't be ridiculous.

308
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,060
Let's take this to court all the way.

309
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,369
I hate to mention it,

310
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,668
but I can see in your eyes...

311
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,639
that you don't want this marriage to end.

312
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
What?

313
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,379
You got it all wrong.
[Watch on www.kisskh.co to support Admin]

314
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,648
It's just that she knows how to push my buttons!

315
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,810
This may be the last time you ever see her.

316
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,749
Are you truly comfortable...

317
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,350
with receiving a ruling after only arguing with her...

318
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,219
and not having a proper conversation?

319
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,010
Woo Jin.

320
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,310
This isn't easy.

321
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,310
It must have been tough on you.

322
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,659
Could I not be present at the next hearing?

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,290
Usually, after the first hearing,

324
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,128
you must attend the mediation session...

325
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:47,189
once it gets scheduled.

326
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,369
Is the mediation session different from a hearing?

327
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,070
Does it mean I get a chance to speak my mind?

328
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,270
Yes.

329
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,869
You must have a lot to say.

330
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,550
Is it because I stopped myself from speaking up all my life?

331
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:09,350
I should say everything on my mind as it's my last chance.

332
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
You should.

333
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,060
But if the case ends with a ruling,

334
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,429
you may not get half of his assets.

335
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,199
I'll be fine even if I don't get half.

336
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,899
He keeps saying that all he ever did was make money.

337
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,100
So I thought, "Then give me a lot of money at least."

338
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,070
That's all.

339
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,649
You know what it's been like for me.

340
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,280
I lived my entire life as his wife.

341
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,649
How could he never acknowledge that?

342
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
I know.

343
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,159

345
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,639
Ms. Han. Thank you for handling the case today.

346
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,939
As the CEO of the law firm and a family member of the client,

347
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:13,850
I feel reassured.

348
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:19,649
Thank you.

349
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,219
I had...

350
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,129
no idea about your upbringing.

351
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,929
I know you will do a great job.

352
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,340
But please keep trying...

353
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,469
to figure out what the client truly wants.

354
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,179
Sometimes, even their own family can't see what they truly want.

355
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,080
Yes. I'll do that.

356
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,350
Okay.

Well, I'm doing my best with what I can do.

You seem much happier now.

Wait. It seems you're getting off work on time.

365
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,369
Gosh, no. Don't say that.

366
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,480
Okay. Keep working hard.

367
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,708
- Okay. See you around. - Okay. Bye.

368
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,709
Bye.

369
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,790
You're here.

370
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,359
Gosh, thank you.

371
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,129
Thanks for coming. I know you're busy.

372
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,800
I ought to come when you ask to see me.

373
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,939
It's nice to drink the coffee you prepared for me.

374
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,550
I wanted to get your thoughts too.

375
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,590
What thoughts?

376
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:00,149
Mr. Oh Dae Gyu.

377
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,928
From my observation, he doesn't want this divorce at all.

378
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,090
Or am I mistaken?

379
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,698
I've been calling him to get his thoughts on the settlement.

380
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,100
But he keeps stalling.

381
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,270
Mr. Oh.

382
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,368
Have you thought about the conditions of the settlement?

383
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,369
Ms. Cha.

384
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,699
Could you give me more time to think about this?

385
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,109
- Okay. - Bye.

386
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,139
Mr. Oh. Have you thought about the conditions of the settlement?

387
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,449
- In my opinion... - Ms. Cha.

388
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,209
I'm handling an urgent matter right now.

389
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,350
Let's talk later.

390
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,879
- Mr. Oh. - I'll think about it and call you.

391
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,119
Hello?

392
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,219
What do you think?

393
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,830
I agree with you.

394
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,359
When he's sorry, he gets angry at you first.

395
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,760
He raises his voice when he's lonely.

396
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,429
He's a typical patriarchal father.

397
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I see.

398
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,100
What about his wife?

399
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,439
She won't admit it openly.

400
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:53,810
But she seems very frustrated.

401
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,609
It makes me wonder if she wants mediation.

402
00:22:58,949 --> 00:22:59,949
I see.

403
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:04,050
I'll see what I can do.

404
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,619
Thank you.

405
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,219
All you ever do is thank me.

406
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,000
(Law Firm Daejeong)

407
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,499
I'm sure everyone here knows...

408
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,428
that it’s hard to have a rational conversation...

409
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,500
if feelings haven’t been addressed.

410
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:27,669
So we set up a meeting to talk one last time.

411
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,609
Right.

412
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,050
First of all, we made a report about our proposals.

413
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,678
Once you read our proposals,

414
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,449
I'm sure you'll find it reasonable to settle.

415
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,490
So here you go.

416
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:45,929
(Mediation Proposal, Plaintiff: Park Ae Yeon)

417
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,698
With two million dollars, she won't push to get a ruling.

418
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:50,959
She will agree to a divorce right away.

419
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,069
If we were to get a ruling,

420
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,839
it would go over four million dollars.

421
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,010
So it is a reasonable offer the defendant can accept.

422
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:00,510
I see.

423
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,540
If this isn't about your feelings,

424
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,909
do you want this case to be dismissed because of money?

425
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,449
Because you don't want to give her your assets?

426
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,020
Is this your first case?

427
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:10,280
Of course, that's it.

428
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,049
Well, if that's your concern, let's say...

429
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,319
the plaintiff asks for an amount...

430
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,060
lower than what we would get from a ruling,

431
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,789
you would settle right away. Correct?

432
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,790
Of course!

433
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,500
I'd divorce her right away if she only asked for that much.

434
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,300
But she demanded 4 to 5 million dollars.

435
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,929
That's why I don't want to divorce her.

436
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,439
It's within the range my client is considering.

437
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,740
Let's wrap it up then.

438
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
That's good to hear.

439
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:37,040
Then let's sign the document and submit it to the court.

440
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,310
Sure.

441
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:41,010
Sir, please sign here.

442
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,830
- Mr. Oh. - Hold on, Ms. Cha.

443
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,329
Why would we agree to the amount...

444
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,800
in their first proposal?

445
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,000
You should try to see if you can lower the amount.

446
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,100
I hired you to work for my interest.

447
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,909
You can't suddenly change your word.

448
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:07,938
Please don't...

449
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,409
Ms. Cha. You stay out of it.

450
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,780
If you keep acting stubborn, I might ask you for more.

451
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,679
I can take it to court.

452
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,679
- Then let's do it. - Yes.

453
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,589
You treated me like a housekeeper throughout our marriage.

454
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,889
So you must think it's a waste to pay me.

455
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,290
Did you...

456
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:26,628
ever consider me your wife?

457
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:27,659
What about you, then?

458
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,229
Did you ever consider me your husband?

459
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,369
Wasn't I just a money-making machine?

460
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,938
He wants to be acknowledged for working hard...

461
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,709
to make a living and support his family. Correct?

462
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,249
Say that straight up. Why beat around the bush?

463
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,850
What are you saying...

464
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,250
Hello, Ms. Cha.

465
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:54,019
Ms. Han, can we talk?

466
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,458
Yes. What about?

467
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:56,858
About the division of assets.

468
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,429
Mr. Oh offered two million dollars.

469
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,330
Really? My client wants two million.

470
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,629
We could reach an agreement.

471
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,799
If the amount matches...

472
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,840
and they still refuse to sign the agreement,

473
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,240
it means they're reluctant.

474
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,709
If that happens, let's quit representing...

475
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,740
and try interpreting instead.

476
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,580
Interpreting?

477
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,780
He never comes home, claiming he's working.

478
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:22,280
You have no conscience.

479
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,388
She means the time she spent at home doing chores,

480
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,119
raising a child, and waiting for her husband...

481
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,060
was long and tiresome.

482
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,688
She acts like she's above me...

483
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,500
because she raised someone else's kid.

484
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,499
He felt grateful and guilty enough...

485
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,898
that he thought...

486
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,969
Ms. Park was above him, but he was unable to express it.

487
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,040
What are you two doing?

488
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:49,909
We're interpreting.

489
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,949
If you want to interpret, do it properly.

490
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,179
I put my life aside...

491
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,350
to keep the family intact and the house going.

492
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,850
He calls that being haughty.

493
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,859
What makes you think he's grateful and guilty?

494
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:09,129
He's the one who has the upper hand.

495
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Out of the yearning for approval and praise,

496
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:26,010
you think your spouse...

497
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:28,850
has something over you and you resent them.

498
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,320
Isn't that most married couples?

499
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:51,139
(Settlement)

500
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,769
Before you make the decision,

501
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,408
try to think as if you tried to drill in your stance instead of...

502
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:01,719
listening to your spouse, trying to understand them,

503
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,320
and showing consideration.

504
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,619
I'd like you to look back and think.

505
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,020
(Settlement)

506
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,740
What are you doing?

507
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,580
Thank you.

508
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,280
And I'm sorry, Ae Yeon.

509
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,320
- What? - Thank you.

510
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,320
For everything.

511
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:40,490
I was able to work long hours...

512
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,189
because of your sacrifice.

513
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,030
I was grateful and sorry I made you raise my son Woo Jin.

514
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,859
But I was foolish.

515
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,570
I was old-fashioned.

516
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,840
So I never told you so.

517
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,810
This could be my last chance.

518
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,740
I'm so...

519
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,609
foolish.

520
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,280
Thank you.

521
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
And I'm sorry.

522
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,939
No.

523
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,879
I was just the same.

524
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,550
I know you had a rough life.

525
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,320
I know you gave us a good life too.

526
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:49,889
But...

527
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,459
My pride took a nosedive.

528
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,500
And I was so lonely.

529
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,399
For 30 years...

530
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,340
I was always so alone.

531
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,040
- Shall we go? - Where to?

532
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,310
You wanted to eat king crab.

533
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,750
I'll buy you some.

534
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,749
My gosh.

535
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,250
I can see you bragging about spoiling me...

536
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,689
because you treated me to one expensive meal.

537
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,320
Get in the car already.

538
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,030
My gosh.

539
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,090
Father.

540
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,840
Yes.

541
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,270
Excuse me.

542
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,350
Open doors for her now and stuff.

543
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,990
Have a good time.

544
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,629
Bye, Mother.

545
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:13,730
Yes, Woo Jin.

546
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:16,139
See you at home.

547
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:17,639
Okay.

548
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:37,990
Thanks a lot.

549
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,330
It's not your job to help couples reconcile.

550
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,369
You should bill him extra.

551
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:48,540
Let's sit down.

552
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,580
Mr. Oh.

553
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,208
I could tell the day he came to see me...

554
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,780
that his eyes were filled with regret and reluctance.

555
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,149
But he kept being so prideful.

556
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,189
I met my mother was the same.

557
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,760
She separated from him out of pride,

558
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,929
but she asked me about Father all the time.

559
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,159
I see.

560
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,000
We helped Yu Ri and Eun Ho get together,

561
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,540
and we helped Mr. Oh reconcile with his wife.

562
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,139
We're doing a lot of good.

563
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,250
Yes, we did.

So,

567
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:55,899
is there anything else you're keeping from me?

568
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,810
No.

569
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,420

I guess everyone knew but us.

Why did you ask to see me?

My mom.

652
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,310
She asked if I wanted to see my dad.

653
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,210
I wanted to know what you thought.

654
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,619
You went through what I did. I thought you'd understand.

655
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:22,199
This feels weird.

656
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,670
Is it a meeting of daughters whose dads did wrong?

It is like that.

You won't get it unless you've gone through it.

659
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,179
He did such a bad thing.

660
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,380
I don't want to forgive him easily.

00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,819
You might not get this.

663
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:54,089
But seeing your dad and forgiving him...

664
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:56,330
might be two different things.

665
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,929
How are they different?

666
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:03,100
Meeting him to have fun and laugh like before.

667
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,139
Doesn't that mean forgiving him?

668
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:13,009
Not wanting to see your dad because you want to punish him.

669
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:15,549
I get that so well.

670
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,580
But...

671
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,319
you shouldn't be punished as well.

672
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,259
You did nothing wrong.

673
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,960
You miss him, don't you?

674
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,769
I decided to put off seeing my dad...

675
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,170

678
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,880
I never got to see him again.

679
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,150
I felt...

680
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,089
regretful.

681
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,589
I should've met up with him and hated him in person.

682
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,029
- Did he... - Yes.

683
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,500
He died.

684
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:08,429
That must've been hard on you.

685
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,610
Do whatever you want.

686
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,739
Don't overthink it.

687
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,209
If you need more time,

688
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,710
you can meet him later on.

689
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,949
Do you think my mom means it?

690
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,189
What?

691
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,219
That I can see my dad.

692
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:32,830
Yes.

693
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,130
Of course she means it.

694
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,799
I can guarantee that.

695
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,799
Don't you think she's pretending to be strong?

696
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
I think I'd be really upset if I were her.

697
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:47,409
I know that best.

698
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,210
Your mom wants you to follow your heart...

699
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:53,250
more than anyone in the world.

700
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,989
I think it's ready.

701
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,190
It looks good. Shall we eat?

702
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,460
- Give me your plate. - Okay.

703
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,130
Thanks, Ms. Han.

704

Is...

708
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,969
something wrong with Jae Hui?

709
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,639
You fought for custody so fiercely.

710
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,940
Why did you never ask about visitation?

711
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,420
I wonder over ten times a day if I should...

712
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:05,920
call Jae Hui first.

713
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:09,690
But I decided it was only right to wait...

714
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,460
until Jae Hui called me.

715
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,489
She's just 14 years old.

716
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Do you think she can do something that you find so hard?

717
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,569
She misses you too.

718
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,080
Do you really think so?

719
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,919
I called you out of concern that you two...

720
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,179
would drift apart forever.

721
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,690
Thanks.

722
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,889
How about you see her starting next week?

723
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:49,429
I guess the time did her some good.

724
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,429
Jae Hui smiles much more now.

725
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,869
Will she want to see me?

726
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,409
She might not be able to forgive me.

727
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:05,850
It's possible she might not forgive you.

728
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:08,409
But...

729
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,219
whether you gain her forgiveness or not isn't important.

730
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,690
What's important is that Jae Hui doesn't lose her dad.

731
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,770
(Attorney Cha Eun Kyung)

732
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,339
- Mom. - Hey, Jae Hui.

733
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,310
Give me a few minutes. I'll wrap this up quickly.

734
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,679
Sure.

735
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,290
What did you and Yu Ri talk about?

736
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,959
You don't need to know.

737
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,020
- What? - It's a secret.

738
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:54,929
Jae Hui.

739
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,329
I met your dad,

740
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,799
and he misses you dearly.

741
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,009
Would you like to go to his place sometime next week?

742
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,580
Am I supposed to hang out with him as if nothing happened?

743
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,549
You two were always so close.

744
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,420
It can be awkward at first,

745
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:24,659
but I think you'll have fun.

746
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,190
Is that possible for you?

747
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:33,670
Can I be honest?

748
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,330
Sure.

749
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,639
I...

750
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,040
will always be honest with you from now on.

751
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:52,520
I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive him.

752
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,529
But you...

753
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:03,330
can forgive him if you want or choose not to.

754
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,239
Just meet with your dad for the dad that he is.

755
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:14,440
He's your one and only dad.

756
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:34,489
(Law Firm Daejeong)

757
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:39,100
How could you have added a zero to the settlement?

758
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,999
The amount says one million...

759
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,838
instead of 100,000 dollars,

760
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,400
and I heard the defendant threw a fit in court because of it.

761
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,409
He cried his eyes out in court...

762
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,580
saying he couldn't earn that amount in a lifetime.

763
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,779
How could you have requested a million dollars from someone...

764
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,279
who has less than 200,000 dollars in assets?

765
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,179
There should never be...

766
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,819
a typo like this again on a petition.

767
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,850
This is a written statement that is lawfully binding.

768
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:06,159
I truly am sorry, Ms. Han.

769
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:14,400
Revise the typo and submit it again.

770
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,000
You can go back to work.

771
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,969
Right. I get it.

772
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,549
But Ms. Han.

773
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,049
Yes?

774
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,319
The case you took on yesterday.

775
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,100
The one with Kim Myung Hwan and his five mistresses?

776
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Yes.

777
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,429
Was that not handled correctly?

778
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,310
Something raised a question while I was writing the petition.

779
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:56,580
There are six defendants in this case.

780
00:47:57,339 --> 00:48:01,110
Should one single law firm be representing them all?

781
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,849
Defendant One felt guilty...

782
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,989
that his five mistresses were sued.

783
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,060
He offered to cover all their retainers,

784
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,658
and the six of us came to our law firm together.

785
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,600
Yes, I'm aware of that.

786
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,770
It doesn't seem ethical.

787
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:26,810
What?

788
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,710
The defendants could have contradicting stories...

789
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,638
and there could be a conflict of interest,

790
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:34,949
so is it ethical for one law firm to represent them all?

791
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,549
I found myself questioning that.

792
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,350
That was never the case at my old firm.

793
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,420
Your old firm?

794
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,360
Didn't you just pass the bar?

795
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:49,730
I worked as a manager at a law firm for five years...

796
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,230
before going to law school.

797
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I see.

798
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:59,239
What you're asking falls under the purview of the managing partner.

799
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,169
Your job is to make claims for your client...

800
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,480
and back them up with evidence.

801
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:08,509
You may get back to work.

802
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,080
Sure.

803
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:33,339
Ms. Cha, the firm hired a rookie lawyer,

804
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:38,080
and I'm baffled as to how I can guide her.

805
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,310
I'm not confident answering a question like that.

806
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:44,218
Didn't you hear...

807
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,119
how two rookie attorneys quit before you came to us?

808
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:48,650
Only you were able to tolerate me.

809
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:52,219
What? That's absurd.

810
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,989
You're the one who made me fall in love with divorce cases...

811
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:58,299
which were what I dreaded.

812
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:01,429
Thanks.

813
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,400
What is she like?

814
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:04,900
Tell me.

815
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,709
I'm looking forward to the cases I'll be working on.

816
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,110
I'll do my best.

817
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,449
She has a pure soul.

818
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,719
It doesn't seem ethical.

819
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:18,420
She has a strong moral compass.

820
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:19,819
I see.

821
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,649
She was a manager at a law firm for five years...

822
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,520
before passing the bar.

823
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,119
But she's...

824
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:29,059
I'm fine sticking to public transportation.

825
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,659
I found myself questioning that.

826
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,699
That was never the case at my old firm.

827
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,839
She seems like a woman of principle.

828
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:42,639
But those qualities keep rubbing me the wrong way.

829
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,279
She's Han Yu Ri.

830
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,679
What?

831
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,690
I'm convinced he didn't have an affair.

832
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,088
I'll have the case dismissed.

833
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,560
The court should not allow this.

834
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:01,790
He must be taught a lesson.

835
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:08,600
You're right.

836
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,339
I apologize for that, Ms. Cha.

837
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,310
So this is what it feels like to be in someone else's shoes.

838
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,678
There's no particular advice I can give you.

839
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:27,290
I know you'll do way better than me.

840
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,060
Do you really think I can do well?

841
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,230
Try giving her more cases.

842
00:51:41,029 --> 00:51:43,339
She'll find her answer while working on them.

843
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,110
To us attorneys, cases are the best medicine.

844
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:50,540
I see.

845
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,210
Maybe I should do just that.

846
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,580
I never thought of that.

847
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:02,190
Can you take a look at that?

848
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,559
I don't quite understand...

849
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,159
and am puzzled as to how I should proceed.

850
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:09,190
Are you and Mr. Jun still going strong?

851
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,270
Give me your hand.

852
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:18,000
My hand?

853
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:26,679
What is this?

854
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,290
We'll go on dates all the time, eat delicious meals,

855
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,319
and watch movies together like we are doing now.

856
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:49,130
I don't know what the correct answer is just yet.

857
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,310
Ms. Han.

858
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,710
There is no right answer.

859
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,439
Marriage, non-maritalism, and divorce.

860
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,779
They're all a choice.

861
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,779
What we should be good at...

862
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:07,449
isn't making the choice itself.

863
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:11,860
It's doing our best to make that choice the right one.

864
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,860
And if you've done your best,

865
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:19,670
you can choose a different option without any regrets.

866
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,139
Going back and forth between choices and responsibilities.

867
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:27,739
Isn't that life?

868
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:37,779
Sure.

869
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:40,619
Whatever choice I make,

870
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,719
I will do my best...

871
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,089
to make it the right one.

872
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,330
Thank you, Ms. Cha.

873
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,759
Go, Han Yu Ri.

874
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,630
Go, me.

875
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,339
Go, Cha Eun Kyung.

876
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,049
Ms. Cha, I collected all the evidence needed.

877
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,380
I have over 100 counts of irrefutable evidence.

878
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,489
Nice.

879
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,219
How about a cheers?

880
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,500
- Please enjoy. - Right. Thank you.

881
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,769
- Mr. Jung, when did you get here? - Hey.

882
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,839
- You're here. - Tteokbokki and gimbap.

883
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,739
- Here. Let me pour you a glass. - Gosh, thank you.

884
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,150
So tell me.

885
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,709
How are things going?

886
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,319
Sorry? About what?

887
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,949
You said you were going to wait until Ms. Han opened up.

888
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,389
- Right? - Actually...

889
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,630
I mustered up the courage.

890
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:00,569
I expected no less, Eun Ho.

891
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:06,509
What if the constant waiting sent me down your path?

892
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:09,309
What? Me? What about me?

893
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,279
Know that I'm rooting for you.

894
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:14,179
Cheers.

895
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:24,759
Unbelievable.

896
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,000
It's been a while since the three of us were together.

897
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Right.

898
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,770
Here are her workbooks.

899
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,909
She's highly on edge because of her midterms next week.

900
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,409
You're in for a hassle.

901
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:20,509
She's highly strung when it comes to exams.

902
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,350
She gets that from us.

903
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,589
Don't worry. I'll make sure she's prepared.

904
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,819
She's not at an age where she needs that.

905
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,759
Just let her study on her own.

906
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,130
Sure.

907
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,630
Thank you...

908
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,759
for caring for her and letting me meet her again.

909
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,869
Smile and laugh with her a lot...

910
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,909
and be the one to close the gap.

911
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,980
I'll do that.

912
00:56:58,949 --> 00:56:59,989
Jae Hui.

913
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:03,919
I'll get going,

914
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,119
so have fun with your dad.

915
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,929
I'll get going.

916
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,210
Jae Hui.

917
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,270
Having your children smile again.

918
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,968
Creating an atmosphere...

919
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,600
where they know they're loved by both parents.

920
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,750
That's the final step of a divorce.

921
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,799
- You saw that. Didn't you, Dad? - Nice!

922
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,610
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

923
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,949
What children want aren't parents who constantly blame themselves...

924
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,920
but parents who fulfill their role.

925
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,929
You will be given ten more cases.

926
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,099
Think about the next written statement...

927
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,369
that should be filed and get back to me.

928
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,469
You can do that, right?

929
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,040
Try giving her more cases.

930
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,509
She'll find her answer while working on them.

931
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,409
To us attorneys, cases are the best medicine.

932
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:13,989
Of course.

933
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,020
At my old firm,

934
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,719
attorneys took on 50 cases at once.

935
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:22,889
With 10 more added, I'll only be up to 30.

936
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,560
This much I should manage.

937
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:26,830
Right.

938
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,838
(Law Firm Spring Again)

939
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:35,839
Yes, of course.

940
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,838
I'll be prepared for the next trial and manage that issue.

941
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:40,809
- This is Law Firm Spring Again. - Absolutely.

942
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,948
- Of course. - Don't worry.

943
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,179
You called us once.

944
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:50,589
(- Fate brought us together. - I love you. You know that, right?)

945
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,929
I'm glad there's more than enough evidence.

946
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,000
You'll be able to win a hefty alimony.

947
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,698
Are you done consulting the defendants...

948
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:06,170
in the five mistress case?

949
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,610
- Yes, Ms. Han. - How was it?

950
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:12,310
I wrote down their statements and submitted them.

951
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,549
Thankfully, there wasn't a conflict of interest.

952
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,819
I apologize...

953
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,819
for overstepping the other day.

954
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:23,049
Don't apologize.

955
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:26,860
It's natural for a rookie attorney to think from various angles.

956
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:38,100
Can I give you a pointer?

957
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,699
Yes, I'd like that.

958
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:46,409
Gradually, separate your character.

959
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,179
Separate my character?

960
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:50,549
Yes.

961
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,350
Separate Attorney Lee Han Na...

962
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,790
from the regular person that is Lee Han Na.

963
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,020
The latter...

964
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:01,529
should be left at home when coming to work.

965
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:03,730
Separate your personalities.

966
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,100
Han Yu Ri the attorney and Han Yu Ri the person.

967
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:07,769
Han Yu Ri the attorney can't blurt out...

968
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,869
what Han Yu Ri the person thinks.

969
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:17,610
You wrote up the statements quite well.

970
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,610
I will advocate for our clients,

971
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:22,779
so please observe from the gallery.

972
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:25,920
Sure, Ms. Han.

973
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,730
(Attorney Lee Han Na)

974
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:53,479
(Court, In session)

975
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,850
All right. Please state your petitions.

976
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:01,649
Last month, while the plaintiff was on Defendant One's computer,

977
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,618
she found evidence of Defendant One...

978
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,988
having extramarital affairs with five women...

979
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,690
throughout their marriage.

980
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:11,298
Please consider the maximum alimony possible...

981
01:02:11,299 --> 01:02:13,429
while realizing that he had stepped out on her with five women.

982
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:16,600
Defending counsel, do you admit to the affairs?

983
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:22,309
Yes, Defendants 1, 2, and 5...

984
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,979
admit to what is written on the petition.

985
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,539
However, Defendants 3, 4, and 6 claim...

986
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,110
that they got together after the marriage was over.

987
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,379
Your Honor, the defendant admitted to the affair.

988
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,819
Please state that on the record.

989
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:37,089
No. Like I just said,

990
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,658
only Defendants 1, 2, and 5...

991
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,089
admit to what is written on the petition.

992
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:41,528
However, Defendants 3, 4, and 6...

993
01:02:41,529 --> 01:02:45,298
only began a relationship after the marriage was over...

994
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,569
which makes the cases completely different.

995
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,350
(Defendant, Plaintiff)

996
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:15,360
Six defendants in one case?

997
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,560
That is one hefty retainer.

998
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,899
That's right. It's the heftiest yet.

999
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,600
The hassle will be out of this world too.

1000
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,969
This case will drag on for a while, right?

1001
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,170
We'll be meeting up once a month for about a year.

1002
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:31,739
Is the plaintiff...

1003
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,049
open to a settlement?

1004
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:36,449
No.

1005
01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:38,850
Then,

1006
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:42,250
is the opposing counsel open to some tteokbokki together?

1007
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:44,389
I am.

1008
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,029
Who is your good partner?

1009
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:57,369
Are you someone's good partner?

1010
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:01,239
(Thank you for watching and supporting Good Partner.)

1011
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:45,250
(Good Partner)
