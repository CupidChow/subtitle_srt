 This drama is fiction.

 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life.

 - Revenge affair?

16
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,470
 - I believe in her.
 - I'm disappointed. 

17
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,430
- I never liked her in the first place. 
 - Birds of a feather.

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,400
 You should withdraw voluntarily. 

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,920
Office husband?

00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,510
 Case 05: Office Husband 

21
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,000
Honey, you heard what the attorney said, right?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,630
That Cha Eun Gyeong refused an agreement?

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,980
Yes, I don't think she wants this to end quickly.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,080
Although Han Yu Ri is her representative,

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,150
I'm sure Jung Wu Jin is controlling everything.

26
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm sure he is.

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,380
Since Jeong Wu Jin likes Cha Eun Gyeong.

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,400
I knew it.

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,350
They actually might've gotten together before you.

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,310
The two went to out-of-town trials so many times for work, too.

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,030
She wouldn't have gone that far.

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,610
Cha Eun Gyeong doesn't even have the time to eat, let alone have an affair.

33
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,130
Is it possible for nothing to happen for a man and a woman

34
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,050
working together for more than ten years?

35
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,190
I'm sure most people at work also know by now.

36
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,430
Are you saying now there's something you know?

37
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,240
Just tell me if you're keeping something from me.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,880
They might've done it first.

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,780
It's too unfair if we're the only ones who are vilified.

40
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,480
It's unfair.

41
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,750
The trial is only a few days away.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,650
I don't think we can just stay put.

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,920
It's definitely not adultery.

44
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,050
It's not adultery, huh?

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,500
Also, Reporter, I don't know if I should tell you this.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,260
What is it?

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,870
Cha Eun Gyeong is actually the one who has a thing with her fellow attorney.

48
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,120
Does she have a thing with her fellow attorney?

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
It's something like an office husband.

50
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,620
She sounded like her marriage was so happy on TV.

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,370
They were all lies, huh?

52
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,760
We haven't slept together for more than three years.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,490
That might've been when it started.

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,260
Yes.

55
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,590
What's the hurry with a counterclaim right now?

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,660
No, please submit a counterclaim right now.

57
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,890
So people would also think both parties are at fault, not just one.

58
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,850
Fine. I'll do it right away. Happy now?

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,540
Does she think she's Cha Eun Gyeong just because she worked under her?

60
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,090
What a jinsang (rude client).

61
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,010
 Episode 5 

62
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's go to my office.

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
 Hello. 

64
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,540
- Hello.
 - Hi.

65
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,370
I'm sorry, Jeong Wu Jin.

66
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,520
Why would you apologize to me?

67
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,820
For making you hear something filthy because of me.

68
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,210
Are you apologizing in Kim Ji Sang's place right now?

69
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,070
You apologize for him since you aren't officially divorced yet?

70
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,310
Well, yes. It's not my fault.

71
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,130
But it's still because of me.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,400
- Are you taking the blame for your husband?
 - Stop fanning the flame.

73
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,340
Forget the apology.

74
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,180
Just let me know if I can help in any way.

75
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,790
A press conference, for example.

76
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,300
Are you crazy?

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,920
Why not? I just say I'm not your office husband.

78
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,730
And that the world is too cruel for handsome people. Right?

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,480
Is it because of what the employees might think?

80
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,240
No.

81
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,700
I'll come up with a plan, so don't worry.

82
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,860
I won't worry.

83
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,960
- I'll clean it up.
 - I'm going to lose it today.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,180
- I'll do it. Don't- No, I'll do it.
 - I-I'll do it. Don't touch it.

85
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,940
Look here—

86
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,320
I said I'll do it!

87
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,430
What's wrong with me today, seriously?

88
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,140
Let me see.

89
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,180
Cha Eun Gyeong... No way...

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,640
Crazy.

91
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,030
What are you two doing right now?

92
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,560
No, m-my finger was—

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,210
Don't you start having funny thoughts, Han Yu Ri.

94
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,050
It's really not true, right?

95
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,240
You, too?

96
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,240
You saw the article?

97
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,190
What article?

98
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,130
Could there be more than this?

99
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,380
 Counterclaim 

100
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,300
Attorney Han Yu Ri, CEO is looking for you.

101
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,650
 The defendant's marriage was already ruined by Cha Eun Gyeong's affair 

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,680
You can guess why I wanted to see you, right?

103
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,940
It's because of Attorney Cha, right?

104
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,220
Well, I'm sure they're just throwing whatever they can find at each other right now.

105
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,710
But if there's even one percent chance of Cha Eun Gyeong's office—

106
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,590
Wh-What was it called again?

107
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,260
It's office husband.

108
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,810
There's no chance she's having such a relationship with Attorney Jeong Wu Jin, is there?

109
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,620
No. Though I haven't been here for long,

110
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,580
as someone who saw the two of them up close every day,

111
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,880
it's absolutely not the case.

112
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,950
Since you've tried being an attorney,

113
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,970
I'm sure you know nothing is absolute anymore.

114
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,780
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong I've seen is

115
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,700
someone whose interest only lies in winning her cases by any means

116
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,320
and raising the company's revenue.

117
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,390
And she trusts Attorney Jeong Wu Jin as a human being.

118
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,790
There mustn't be any damage done to the company's image.

119
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,000
For now, don't just trust her unconditionally.

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,450
Properly verify the facts first.

121
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,320
Yes.

122
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,070
I'm sure it's absolutely not the case, but I'll confirm it to make sure.

123
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,070
Take care now.

124
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,150
- Yes.
 -  Attorney Cha, 

125
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,650
 I'll see you at the VIP consultation room right now. 

126
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,240
You can just come to my office. Why tell me to come?

127
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,850
 Attorney— I mean... 

128
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,990
In the case of the plaintiff, Cha Eun Gyeong,

129
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm the attorney, and you're the client.

130
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,740
So, I'd like to clarify this relationship.

131
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,060
You've come a long way.

132
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,490
Before we come up with a measure,

133
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,620
I must confirm something first as your attorney.

134
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,490
Confirm?

135
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,020
- No way.
- Attorney Jeong Wu Jin and you—

136
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,520
- Hey, Han Yu Ri. 
- aren't having an affair, right?

137
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,600
Watch what you say.

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,750
It doesn't even deserve a response.

139
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,640
You're the one who told me this.

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,120
Don't trust everything they say.

141
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
 That's what all the cheaters say. 

142
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,290
 They all say their wives and husbands have delusional jealousy. 

143
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,130
 By chance, did you believe that? 

144
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,610
I'm speechless.

145
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,990
Are you telling me to explain Attorney Jeong Wu Jin to you or something—

146
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,360
The fact they even submitted a counterclaim means

147
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
they might've secured certain evidence, right?

148
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,940
What evidence when it's not a fact?

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,440
You got betrayed in your first case, and you're taking it out on me here?

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,510
I'm only asking a question I'd have to ask naturally.

151
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,490
Han Yu Ri.

152
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,730
Attorney Han, if you're my attorney,

153
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,320
you need to bring me a plan on how to smash

154
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,330
that absurd counterclaim and the media manipulation.

155
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,710
What are you doing?

156
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,530
As you've taught me,

157
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm doing my minimum due diligence.

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,080
Please don't be like that and answer me.

159
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,920
We aren't.

160
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,990
We absolutely aren't.

161
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,310
An attorney is asking a question for her client.

162
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,400
Why are you getting so angry?

163
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,480
For my sake?

164
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,320
I think I appointed the wrong attorney.

165
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,270
I'm doing my best here.

166
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,140
Don't say you're doing your best so easily

167
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,390
and go take measures right now as my attorney should.

168
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,690
 Cha Eun Gyeong, Kim Ji Sang 

169
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,110
 Choi Sa Ra, Jeong Wu Jin 

170
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,200
 Office Husband... 

171
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:24,690
 Affair 

172
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,000
Um...

173
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Attorney Han, did you eat?

174
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:51,690
I'm not so sure if I should let you buy me food like this in our current situation.

175
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,670
I can see why you'd feel that way.

176
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,930
But there's nothing to worry about, so relax and eat.

177
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,260
Are you two trying to get over it by denying it

178
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,980
and telling me not to worry?

179
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,410
This isn't that simple.

180
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,060
The rumor's slowly— I mean, the news article is spreading.

181
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,740
And this might negatively affect Attorney Cha's trial.

182
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,260
You're right.

183
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,210
You're absolutely right.

184
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,220
That's why I wanted to eat together and think of a countermeasure.

185
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,840
First off, I want to hear about the two of you in detail.

186
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,880
Well, I'm also a victim in this situation.

187
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,040
An explanation? Okay.

188
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,110
It's right for me to explain since you're also Seonbae's attorney.

189
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,500
Attorney Cha was...

190
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,150
 Wait, you're not doing my case, 

191
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,580
 but this female attorney is going to take my case? 

192
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,950
 Why? 

193
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,250
 Well, the thing is... 

194
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,300
 No one has done more divorce cases than I have in this law firm. 

195
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,030
 - You must have faith in me. 
- Gosh... 

196
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,370
 how can a woman fight a man equally in court? 

197
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,350
 I won't fight equally. 

198
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,230
 I'll be fighting at an advantage. 

199
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,750
 In an age where female attorneys were scarce, 

200
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,380
 Attorney Cha broke through the glass ceiling with her own strength. 

201
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,890
 And I witnessed that up close. 

202
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,100
  
 We'll give 10 million won, so let's just settle. 

203
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,080
 Who is that settlement for? 

204
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,520
 We'll never settle on those terms. 

205
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,430
 Attorney Cha, how can you refuse to cooperate like this? 

206
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,640
 Even if this goes to judgment, the alimony will be 10 million won. 

207
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,490
 Just settle it at 10 million won, which is economical for both- 
   

208
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,890
 If this goes to judgment, even if the alimony ends up being 10 million won, 

209
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,650
 Your Honor will write the defendant's habitual physical abuse 

210
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,570
caused the marriage of the defendant and the plaintiff to be destroyed in the verdict.

211
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,010
 For my client, that one sentence is 

212
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,260
 more economical than ending the lawsuit quickly. 

213
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,870
 Who doesn't hit their wives like I do? 

214
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,470
 How dare you repeat "physical abuse"? How rude! 

215
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,740
 Your Honor, you heard him, right? 

216
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,010
 A criminal is running his mouth in court like that. 

217
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,060
 Will it be right to end the case for 10 million won without a judgment? 

218
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,190
 Damn it! 

219
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,600
 We'll go to a judgment. 

220
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,120
 I think she was in her third year. 

221
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,530
 She looked like she was born to be an attorney in my eyes. 

222
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,520
 And I ended up sincerely respecting her. 

223
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,690
 Even now. 

224
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,090
 You were really cool earlier, Seonbae. 

225
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,050
 I can understand cutting off the defendant. 

226
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,030
 But you even cut off the judge. 

227
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,760
 Isn't it a bit risky to be hostile toward the judge? 

228
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,350
 The judge was forcing a settlement. 

229
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,770
 "Settlement." 

230
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,130
 This means that both parties must agree, as the definition says. 

231
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,580
 How dare he order me around? 

232
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,060
 The judge must've been trying to help the two parties see eye to eye. 

233
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,210
 That's your problem. 

234
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,560
 Sorry? 

235
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,590
 You're way too soft. 

236
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,410
 A representative only needs to care about the client's interests. 

237
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,950
 Why does the judge's opinion matter? 

238
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,050
 I'm not sure. Well, that's your opinion. 

239
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,920
 And I also have my opinion. 

240
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,910
 What I said is right. It's right, no matter what. 

241
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,410
 Keep that in mind. 

242
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,000
 Yes, Seonbaenim. 

243
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,040
 Let's have a shot. 

244
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,250
She was so cool and respected.

245
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,960
So, I always rooted for her by her side.

246
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,350
The only thing I could do for Seonbae, who seemed so busy

247
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,860
 was bringing her coffee. 

248
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,760
 Yes? 

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,590
Seonbae, your coffee.

250
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,890
Leave it there.

251
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,350
Here you go.

252
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,010
 Drinking coffee was something like a forced break. 

253
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,680
 Because Seonbae seemed exhausted sometimes, 

254
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,900
 and lonely. 

255
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,790
I can already tell you're planning not to go home again today.

256
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,010
Just reading over this case's records once took me three hours.

257
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,870
I'm getting started with the writing now.

258
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,870
Whoa, whoa, easy now. You should relax first.

259
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,150
- You didn't eat dinner again, did you? 
- Jeong Wu Jin.

260
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,680
Could you please leave?

261
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,750
You always say you can't finish it by tomorrow.

262
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,580
But you always finish it in the end.

263
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,570
If you've got that much data on yourself,

264
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,200
let's allow yourself to eat at the very least.

265
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,610
 Railway Restaurant 

266
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,110
It's always the basic kimbap.

267
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,460
- It comes out the fastest. 
- Let's at least

268
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,570
eat tuna kimbap. Okay?

269
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,430
That's right.

270
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,540
Since I met you...

271
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,620
Here.

272
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,080
What's this?

273
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,420
 On one of those busy days... 

274
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,170
 she suddenly told me she was getting married. 

275
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,010
 Kim Ji Sang &amp; Cha Eun Gyeong 

276
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,030
Wait, wh-what's—

277
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,610
Why are you so surprised?

278
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,560
It doesn't make sense.

279
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,910
That I'm getting married? It doesn't make sense?

280
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,560
You only eat the kimbap that comes out the fastest.

281
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,630
When did you have time to date?

282
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,530
Didn't I tell you I went on a blind date three months ago?

283
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,910
- The physician?
 - Yes.

284
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,870
And you'll get married after only three months?

285
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,500
Rather than dating for a long time with so little time, just getting married is more efficient.

286
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,010
Did you find out what kind of a person he is?

287
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, we're two years apart, and he's a doctor, as you know.

288
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,900
- He's ordinary.
- N-No, that's not what I'm talking about.

289
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,840
Does he suit you well, Seonbae?

290
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,180
He's perfect for me.

291
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,500
First off, he cooks.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,600
- Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?
 - You'll come for sure, right?

293
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,670
Let's get going.

294
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,090
You should hurry up and get married, too.

295
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,370
- Shall we go?
 -  Like finishing a legal letter one by one, 

296
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,950
 that's how she got married. 

297
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,220
Just because you're a divorce attorney, you don't necessarily have an eye for people.

298
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,880
Kim Ji Sang is doing whatever he can to bring down Cha Eun Gyeong.

299
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,430
So, you need to hold your ground, Attorney Han.

300
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,330
So, you're saying you've respected Attorney Cha and

301
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,160
you still respect her, huh?

302
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,210
That's correct.

303
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,770
Kim Ji Sang knows all of this, too.

304
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,260
What a petty man.

305
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,030
Attorney Jeong.

306
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,840
From this moment on, you mustn't let others find out about your feelings.

307
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,830
What feelings?

308
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,790
Your feeling of deep love for Attorney Cha.

309
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,040
I thought...

310
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,380
I had explained it well so far.

311
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,890
Was it hard to understand?

312
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,120
You said you were the victim earlier, right?

313
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,620
It's true you're a victim, Attorney Jeong.

314
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,390
People are criticizing you due to a baseless claim.

315
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,650
However, you're not angry nor find it unfair as a victim.

316
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,230
You're really only worried about Attorney Cha.

317
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,500
Do I need to explain more?

318
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,410
Of course, I'd worry.

319
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,750
I told you. She's a seonbae I respect.

320
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,180
I don't think I can eat this meal.

321
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,560
You said we should plan a measure, right?

322
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,610
I don't think I can plan a measure with you, either.

323
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,870
Attorney Han.

324
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,620
I know you support Attorney Cha now,

325
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:46,260
so I'll believe you'll stay put so you won't do her harm.

326
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,790
I hope you won't think I'm crossing the line as a hoobae ("junior").

327
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:00,580
Because I'm speaking as Cha Eun Gyeong's representative, not a hoobae.

328
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:16,130
Attorney Cha told me a representative must always act in favor of her client's interests.

329
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,750
You saw the article, right?

330
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,640
Yes, I did. Daebak.

331
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,350
I knew it was suspicious, but I guess I wasn't the only one who felt it.

332
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,770
Of course! Everyone knows.

333
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,690
Know what?

334
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,430
Attorney Jeong likes Attorney Cha. Can't you just tell?

335
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,240
Watch what you say!

336
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,810
If someone hears you, that's defamation right there.

337
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,560
Attorney Jeong is totally acting like her Daddy-Long-Legs right now.

338
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,630
Gosh, I envy Cha Eun Gyeong.

339
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,500
If I were her, I'd change lanes right away.

340
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,210
It's only an absurd rumor.

341
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,070
You can't just assume it's true right away.

342
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,550
I've never seen the two of them being inappropriate.

343
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,870
I'm sure they never seemed inappropriate.

344
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,720
Because it's a one-sided love from Jeong Wu Jin.

345
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,580
I'm going to root for Attorney Jeong Wu Jin.

346
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,190
- I hope they end up together.
 - Me, too.

347
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,150
That's right. Did you know Choi Sa Ra took the day off?

348
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,850
- She's the mistress, right? 
- Totally.

349
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,970
I think she caused the problem and took the day off.

350
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,170
- It's suspicious. 
- Please! What if someone hears you?

351
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,490
Everyone here knows.

352
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,430
 Director Kim, I won't beat around the bush and will get to the point. 

353
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,320
 Please make today your last day of work. 

354
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,090
 Twelve years ago 

355
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,170
What kind of a dad quits his job to raise a child?

356
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,610
There's no law saying a woman should raise a child.

357
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,280
I should be by my daughter's side since she needs me.

358
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,770
 Five years ago  
Going all-in isn't even enough right now.

359
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,780
At this rate, it'll be hard for you to grow as a doctor.

360
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,070
Being a doctor is also a technical job.

361
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,490
If you don't practice continuously, you'll get rusty.

362
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,680
You're home.

363
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,120
I made an omelet, Jae Hui's favorite.

364
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,000
But she barely took a bite.

365
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,330
You can go now. Thank you for your work.

366
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,580
Yes, then. I'll get going now.

367
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:34,480
 Jae Hui asked me if her mom and dad were divorcing. 

368
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,750
-  So? 
 -  I think it's time you told her now. 

369
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,890
Jae Hui.

370
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,000
What? I'm doing my homework.

371
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,400
I have something to tell you.

372
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,740
Are you busy?

373
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,250
It'll only take a minute.

374
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,970
I have a vocab test tomorrow.

375
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,990
I need to memorize 60 English vocabs before I go to sleep.

376
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,900
And I have an hour and a half until bedtime.

377
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,240
You're very busy. But...

378
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,380
it's something I have to tell you.

379
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,680
Can we talk tomorrow?

380
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,750
Sure.

381
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,070
You've never had something like this at home, right?

382
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,340
The housekeeper did make it before.

383
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,550
Gosh, is that so?

384
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,920
The crab stew itself isn't the issue.

385
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,800
A couple should eat it while sitting together and have a conversation.

386
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,590
Cha Eun Gyeong should've stayed single instead of getting married.

387
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,210
She's unqualified as a human being.

388
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,800
It'll get cold. Hurry up and eat.

389
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,700
Did you know this?

390
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,660
- What?
 - It's your first time speaking ill of Cha Eun Gyeong.

391
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,530
It is? I don't think so.

392
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,970
It's your first time blatantly saying Cha Eun Gyeong

393
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,120
is unqualified as a human being.

394
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,830
Is that right?

395
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,580
I will stop at nothing.

396
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,890
I decided not to be afraid.

397
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,800
Let's stay strong.

398
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,280
Yes, don't worry anymore.

399
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,110
Everyone will be too busy trying to stop

400
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,250
her office-husband story to attack again.

401
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,700
I'll try to meet with Attorney Han Yu Ri.

402
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,090
She should understand it's better for both parties to agree to settle.

403
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,300
We even submitted a counterclaim. Will an agreement be possible?

404
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,250
You're supposed to initiate an agreement after a counterclaim.

405
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,200
Since we showed them we're not easy prey, they might just let go.

406
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,200
We're not close enough to drink coffee together.

407
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,830
It's interesting.

408
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,660
Why did you take the day off?

409
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,120
A counterclaim with no basis and the news...

410
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,110
You acted recklessly, and it got out of hand, didn't it?

411
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,630
With no basis?

412
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,910
You wouldn't know because you're still pretty new.

413
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:01,770
But those two always had rumors about them at work.

414
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,750
Don't tell me you thought the employees' gossip would work as evidence.

415
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,580
Are you testing me to see if I have evidence?

416
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,950
We will take care of proving our claims.

417
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,660
So you don't need to worry about it.

418
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,450
If we sue you for defamation over this,

419
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,060
you know you won't be okay, don't you?

420
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,030
Attorney Han, you'll have to study the law more.

421
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,150
I didn't publicly state it as the truth anywhere, so what defamation?

422
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,480
I merely submitted a written statement to the court

423
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,270
and the reporter only did his job.

424
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,180
 She thinks she's an attorney or something. 

425
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,150
You're really one brave soul.

426
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,450
Could you handle this against the masses?

427
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,220
Let me tell you since you mentioned the masses.

428
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,270
The damage is greater for Attorney Cha since she's famous.

429
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,980
Since you're Attorney Cha's attorney, it'd be better to convince her to settle.

430
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,710
 You're ordering me around now? 

431
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,650
I told you many times already.

432
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,970
But my client has no interest in agreeing to settle.

433
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,790
Since you said your client doesn't,

434
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,580
it looks like you're interested.

435
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,510
Isn't it better for you to close the case quickly, too?

436
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,460
For Attorney Cha, dividing the wealth quickly, which she has to do anyway,

437
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,440
would be better for her and Jae Hui as well.

438
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,710
The fact is you want this to be over quickly before rumors spread.

439
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,520
But you're talking as if it's beneficial for someone else,

440
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,280
which I find shameless and cowardly.

441
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,230
Attorney Han, think about it carefully.

442
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:02,250
Since you're her representative, what will be better for your client?

443
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,560
I'll see the end of this if you mess with me more.

444
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,030
Geez!

445
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,700
Attorney Cha.

446
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,680
Did you come up with a countermeasure?

447
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,230
I just met with Choi Sa Ra.

448
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,600
I'm sure she talked about settling.

449
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,290
Yes.

450
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,800
Attorney, I also hope...

451
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,050
you lean toward the idea of a settlement.

452
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,730
Why should I do that?

453
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,000
I told you already, Attorney Cha.

454
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,070
You're too full of the desire for revenge right now.

455
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,540
That way, the division of property will happen anyway and

456
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,570
the reputation you've built so far will fall to the ground.

457
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,250
And Jae Hui will...

458
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,650
end up being hurt more.

459
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,640
Isn't it you who are afraid, Attorney Han?

460
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,920
As you've taught me,

461
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,960
I thought about this as Attorney Han Yu Ri and the human Han Yu Ri separately.

462
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,800
Attorney Han Yu Ri concluded that she doesn't want to recommend

463
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,000
that her client continue this litigation where the outcome

464
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,510
is already obvious with mudslinging on the way.

465
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,040
It's so easy for a law firm employee with

466
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,280
ten years of experience to gaslight an attorney in her first year, huh?

467
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,800
Attorney Cha.

468
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,050
You know that's not the case right now.

469
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,670
I expressed numerous times that I wouldn't settle this with my attorney.

470
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,150
Bring me a different countermeasure.

471
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,120
I'll give it some more thought.

472
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,440
Why that little.

473
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,060
- Knock, knock.
 - Hey.

474
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,180
Han Yu Ri is so full of herself.

475
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:58,100
Kids these days think they can do whatever if they get a title instead of being grateful.

476
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,710
Why? I like how she speaks up to her seonbae,

477
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,550
unlike how we used to just obey.

478
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,510
So...

479
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:14,170
you just watched her leave without eating after interrogating you?

480
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,740
I told her that I respect you a lot.

481
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,490
I cleared up her misunderstanding, too.

482
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,370
How persistent.

483
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,760
She's really persistent.

484
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,580
Does she go to an academy?

485
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,330
There must be an academy that teaches how to get on my nerves.

486
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,930
Seonbae, I think you can count on Attorney Han.

487
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,420
You can say that after what she did to you?

488
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,660
What a saint.

489
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,600
You're too soft.

490
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,490
Yes?

491
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,330
Attorney Han, this is the case record for your countryside schedule today.

492
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,060
Sorry?

493
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,120
 Verdict 

494
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,500
Sodaeri?

495
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,090
Where's this, and what's this case?

496
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,170
You didn't hear about the outcall to the countryside?

497
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,820
What?

498
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,620
Attorney Cha said it'll be good training for the new hires.

499
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,890
The new hires?

500
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,260
She said you're an inexperienced driver,

501
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,930
so she told Attorney Jeon to accompany you.

502
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,050
What? N-No, I can go by myself.

503
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,210
I told Attorney Jeon about it, and he said he'll come with you.

504
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,270
 Is this revenge for telling her to settle? 

505
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,210
 Is she the icon of revenge or something? 

506
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,600
H-Hey, I'm here.

507
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,920
- Long time—
 - We can take my car—

508
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,610
- What was that?
 - What was that?

509
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,440
- No, the—
 - Y-You can go ahead.

510
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,580
We can take my car.

511
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,610
It's fine. Just get in. Let's go.

512
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
- The belt is over there.
 - Y-Yes.

513
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,470
Sodaeri? Where's this? I've never heard of this place.

514
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,210
I think we came quite a distance.

515
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,240
Will we be able to go back today?

516
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,440
Seriously. We might have to spend the night at this rate.

517
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,900
I don't think this place even has a motel.

518
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,980
A motel?

519
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,730
 Okay! Your seonbae will buy us a third round. 

520
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,230
 All right. Let's go get B.B. 

521
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,160
 Motel Eunyu 

522
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,770
- Let's listen to— Y-Yes.
 - Should we listen to music? O-Okay.

523
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,150
♫  Why are you hovering around me?  ♫

524
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,920
♫  What should I do?  ♫

525
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,160
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

526
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,860
♫ Speak! What are you doing? Speak! What are you doing?  ♫

527
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,130
♫  At this rate, you’re like a fool  ♫

528
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,230
♫  Don’t look away  ♫

529
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,740
 Sodaeri Supermarket   

530
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,180
How do you do, ma'am?

531
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,800
Do you know where 557 Mt. Sodaeri is?

532
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,900
It's probably about down there somewhere.

533
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,710
- That way?
 - Yes, it's far.

534
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,240
- Okay. Thank you.
 - Thank you!

535
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,840
557 Mt. Sodaeri.

536
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,480
- Up there?
 - Yes.

537
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,030
- I said it's not.
 - No, she's right.

538
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,150
Do you happen to know where 557 Mt. Sodaeri is?

539
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,460
- Over there?
 - Yes.

540
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,890
- Okay. Thank you!
 - Sure.

541
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,140
Hello, sir.

542
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,920
557 Mt. Sodaeri—

543
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,990
You have to go all the way over there.

544
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,840
It's further away.

545
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,430
- Thank you.
 - Take care.

546
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,280
Further away?

547
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,530
No, I'm sure it's pretty close.

548
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,680
No one would know a major law firm makes you do things like this.

549
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,120
I need to report this to the Department of Labor, too.

550
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,980
You can't report it. We got paid for the trip.

551
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,020
- What? We got paid— 
- W-Whoa!

552
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,540
- Thanks. 
- Sure.

553
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,100
- Are you okay? 
- Yes.

554
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,860
What a moron.

555
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,490
You even got called an office husband.

556
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,870
Even so, will you still stick around Cha Eun Gyeong?

557
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,560
Get yourself together.

558
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,980
I've never crossed the line,

559
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,180
nor have I done anything to be criticized for by you.

560
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,540
Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong is valuable only to the firm.

561
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,260
She's the worst woman for a man.

562
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,320
No wonder her man had an affair.

563
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,690
What do you like about a divorcee with a kid?

564
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,400
- A woman like her shouldn't— 
- Please stop.

565
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,340
You fool.

566
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,920
You're not waiting for Cha Eun Gyoeong to divorce, are you?

567
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,190
Is this how you show you grew up without a mom?

568
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,960
Do you think you have the right to say that to me?

569
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,870
Don't pretend to care about me after all this time

570
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,120
and reflect on yourself.

571
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,310
The right? What about you, then?

572
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,140
Do you think you have the right to inherit this firm?

573
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,180
I warned you many times.

574
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,240
You won't gain anything from getting on my bad side.

575
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,340
You become more and more pathetic.

576
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,340
I'll take my leave.

577
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,740
Why that little...

578
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,810
- Hello. 
- Hello.

579
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,080
You're Ms. Gu Hui Sun, right?

580
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,090
- We're from Daejeong Law Firm. 
- Yes.

581
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,410
Gosh, it's bitter.
  Marriage Certificate 

582
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,640
Whoa, what's this? Is it arrowroot extract?

583
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,360
 Marriage Certificate 

584
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,450
So, you're saying you registered for marriage again, right?

585
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,970
What's the frame for the marriage certificate?

586
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,840
- I've never seen this in my life.
 - Me, neither.

587
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,330
I mean, you can fight and make up after.

588
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,520
We only need to get the retainer.

589
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,970
You know, right? Thirty million won.

590
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,740
I can't give it to you.

591
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,070
I mean, the contract said the fee is for after we get divorced.

592
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,250
- But we got back together. 
- We got back together.

593
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,040
There's no reason to pay you!

594
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,940
We diligently processed your wife's complaint and

595
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,140
got you the division of property verdict.

596
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,030
Getting back together is what happened after that.

597
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,600
The retainer was for divorcing! Look, I said we didn't divorce!

598
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,680
No, you did divorce. You just remarried the same person.

599
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,650
So, please stop it now and pay us.

600
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,290
Honey, just stay put.

601
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,920
We didn't do anything wrong.

602
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,040
What's so wrong about a married couple living together for love?

603
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,070
People don't even get married these days. The country should reward us!

604
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:02,140
Sir, attorneys like us don't like it when you digress. Okay?

605
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,250
People these days only have sex and don't ever accept responsibility.

606
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,460
It's the end of the world.

607
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,130
We've been in love for twenty years without changing!

608
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,620
By the way, we paid off our debts and filed for bankruptcy.

609
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,700
We don't have money.

610
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,070
Hold on!

611
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,000
You've never once stopped loving for twenty years,

612
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,530
but you filed for divorce and paid off the debt.

613
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,720
And you registered your marriage again.

614
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,360
Your divorce was fictitious, right?

615
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,940
Many people mistake it as a fake divorce—

616
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,950
I'm sorry.

617
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:06,560
He was running all over the place to pay off our debt, hardly able to eat.

618
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,910
And I filed a fake complaint to save myself.

619
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,760
Yes, I know.

620
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,230
I should go to jail. I'll take the punishment.

621
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,360
He did nothing wrong. Okay?

622
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,480
Why would you?

623
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,310
She just did what I told her.

624
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:27,400
She didn't know anything and just did what I told her to do.

625
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,800
- If you want to report it, just report me v
- How can you do that?

626
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,580
Did you forget we're one in body and soul?

627
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,530
You can't. If you go to jail, I'm coming with you.

628
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,370
Silly! I'll never let that happen.

629
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,300
- No. 
- Please take me!

630
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,200
No, it was my doing. Fraudulent complaint. Yes.

631
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,180
Okay. Please stop the display of affection.

632
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,100
You'll just slither away from your crimes?

633
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,240
- I won't let that happen. 
- You're really too much!

634
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,760
You're really being too much!

635
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,180
You two are being too much here!

636
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,500
- What did you say? 
- Please stop it!

637
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,560
All of this happened while trying to protect our family.

638
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,390
Please...

639
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,940
He knows what he did was wrong.

640
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,790
So, please have mercy.

641
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,250
Honey.

642
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,880
Gosh, does this even make sense?

643
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,880
Attorney!

644
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,740
I'm sorry.

645
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,330
This is all I can give you.

646
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,900
Please take it with you.

647
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,310
Thank you.

648
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,590
Y-You know, in my life,

649
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,400
there wasn't a day...

650
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,460
I didn't love that man.

651
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,620
Not a single day.

652
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,670
I'm so sorry for deceiving you.

653
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,200
I'll take the punishment.

654
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,130
So...

655
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,690
I'll go to jail.

656
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,920
 Fictitious divorce and fraudulent complaint. 

657
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,740
 Who knew all these people in the textbooks actually existed? 

658
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,050
By the way, we couldn't get the money.

659
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,740
Let's file for default first thing tomorrow in the office.

660
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,020
Since you're busy these days, I'll take care of that.

661
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,700
Hey, Attorney Jeon.

662
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,840
Can you not do it, please?

663
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,290
Let's just report the debtor doesn't have any executable property.

664
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,660
It'll just be forgotten.

665
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,270
Why would you do that?

666
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,850
After we became attorneys, we met a lot of people, right?

667
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:13,270
But it's my first time seeing people who protect their love.

668
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,690
"Yes.

669
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,020
"That's what a married couple is supposed to be like.

670
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,360
"Though they might deceive others together,

671
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,790
they won't deceive each other." That's what I thought.

672
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,860
- Here you go. 
- Aigoo, thank you.

673
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,040
- Gosh, it looks delicious. 
- Thank you.

674
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,390
Excuse me, ma'am.

675
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,940
- One bottle of beer, please. 
- Okay.

676
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,590
All right. It's C.B. today, bought with per diem.

677
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,240
Chapagetti and beer!

678
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,440
- Here you go. 
- Thank you.

679
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,400
Thank you.

680
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,910
Can you really drink beer?

681
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,190
Aigoo, don't worry. I've got it all planned.

682
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,200
Beer for you, Attorney Han.

683
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,170
- And I'll drink water.
 - Huh?

684
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,940
What's this?

685
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,320
Only I'm drinking? What about you?

686
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,090
I have to drive you home safely, Attorney Han.

687
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,530
Right, the car.

688
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,320
All right. Cheers.

689
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,680
Great work again today.

690
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,890
- Looks good.
 - Let's eat.

691
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,950
- It's delicious.
 - It's amazing.

692
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,040
I feel alive now.

693
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,580
Hey, whether you'll believe it or not,

694
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,340
it was my first time.

695
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,340
What was?

696
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,930
That night.

697
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,090
I-It was the same for me.

698
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,070
Hey.

699
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,490
Which is why I'm saying this...

700
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,310
- let's—
- Let's—

701
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,890
We were both drunk...

702
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,180
and since it was the first time for both of us,

703
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,160
let's just consider it a good experience and leave it at that.

704
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,160
I don't want us to be awkward at work.

705
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,690
I really like to talk about work

706
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,500
and talk smack about Attorney Cha with you.

707
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,730
It's really fun.

708
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,880
I felt this all the time.

709
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,040
But we're really different for sure.

710
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,580
I was thinking about something else.

711
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,870
Since we were walking down from there.

712
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:37,400
And to be honest, I wanted to say it in the car on the way here.

713
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,100
What did you want to say?

714
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,500
That we should try dating.

715
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,010
Putting aside being a man and a woman, colleagues, and attorneys,

716
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,380
let's just get to know each other as

717
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,860
Han Yu Ri and Jeon Eun Ho, ever so casually.

718
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,140
A relationship between a man and a woman...

719
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,610
can never become a casual thing.

720
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,300
Just like what the debtor said earlier, responsibilities are bound to follow.

721
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,370
That's why...

722
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,650
I decided not to get married in my life.

723
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:44,000
Deciding not to marry and not dating are two different things, right?

724
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,040
Even if you're anti-marriage, you can still date.

725
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:53,020
I'm sorry, Attorney Jeon.

726
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:04,710
I hope we won't talk about these things again after today.

727
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,060
And establishing myself is more important to me.

728
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,500
What does it mean to establish yourself?

729
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,270
You studied hard for the test and became an awesome attorney.

730
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,030
We're still in our first year.

731
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:25,800
We're busy newbies who get scolded and lectured every day.

732
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,670
So, I want us to depend on each other as we endure together,

733
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,800
in a progressive manner.

734
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,760
Do I need to say more?

735
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:51,160
All right. If you want to remain friends, I understand.

736
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,370
Thanks.

737
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,740
Still, remember this.

738
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,090
I like you.

739
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,470
I'll go back on my own.

740
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:21,030
You know I have to bring a plan for Attorney Cha by tomorrow, right?

741
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,800
- No, this is the middle of nowhere. I'll drop you off. 
- It's fine.

742
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,690
It's okay. I'm fine.

743
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,030
I'll get going first.

744
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,280
- Is it still not time yet? 
- Who knows?

745
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,770
Seriously.

746
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,270
All right. Okay...

747
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,080
There you go.

748
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,400
♫  There's a small mirror in my heart  ♫

749
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,810
♫  No one will bother to look inside  ♫

750
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,290
Aigoo, thank you.  
 ♫  I am looking   ♫

751
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,800
The next one is at 4:00 p.m., right? 
 ♫  I am looking  ♫

752
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:24,680
♫   ever so exhausted and tiny  ♫

753
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,180
♫  What's gotten into me?  ♫

754
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:33,790
 In my life, there wasn't a day I didn't love that man. 

755
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,970
 Not a single day. 

756
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,910
 What is love? 

757
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,760
 So, what will Mom and Dad do? 

758
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,240
 What? A-About what? 

759
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,080
 The divorce. 

760
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,410
 You said you won't get a divorce. 

761
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,920
 I collected them so I don't get a divorce. 

762
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,000
 I was going to block the divorce with this evidence. 

763
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,550
 Is love the pain that exists somewhere 

764
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,540
 between love and affection? 

765
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,700
 If time passes and if I keep doing this... 

766
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,190
 - So, divorce me, at least. 
- I won't get a divorce. 

767
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,650
 I won't get a divorce. 

768
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:07,990
 We'll accept it. 

769
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,890
 I'll do the same as well. 

770
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,580
 I'll withdraw my case. 

771
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,980
 ...will I be able to... 

772
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,060
 Still, remember this. 

773
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,770
 I like you. 

774
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:22,900
 ...understand those people and love one day? 

775
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,140
♫  Every single little word  ♫

776
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:33,980
♫  gradually eats away at me  ♫

777
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,110
 Daejeong Law Firm 

778
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,870
De facto bigamy?

779
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,050
Yes, it's a concept attorneys are familiar with.

780
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,550
But it's an unfamiliar concept for most people. So it'll go viral.

781
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,490
- An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth?
 - A keyword for a keyword.

782
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:51,770
Attorney Han, did this ever happen to you while working before?

783
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,030
An experience where the textbook examples came alive.

784
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,610
Choi Sa Ra and Kim Ji Sang.

785
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,750
It's de facto bigamy.

786
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,940
When I saw it in the textbook, I doubted anyone would do that.

787
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,350
But they were right by my side.

788
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,480
De facto bigamy, huh?

789
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,040
Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra also threw the office husband out there

790
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,120
to discredit you, aiming for it to go viral.

791
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,960
So, we should do the same and throw de facto bigamy at them, right?

792
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,570
Yes.

793
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,350
Obvious words like adultery and affair

794
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,930
may cause a temporary shock but are easily forgotten.

795
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,780
However, legal terms tend to provoke people's intellectual curiosity, too.

796
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,590
I like that idea.

797
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,250
It'd be great if the reporter who wrote the office husband article

798
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,100
also writes the de facto bigamy article.

799
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,670
That's how we can stop people from shooting their arrows at you.

800
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,510
Pretty good.

801
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:54,040
I should send you to the countryside from time to time, Attorney Han.

802
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,850
What? Wait, Attorney Cha! That's enough.

803
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:05,810
So, you're saying Kim Ji Sang really has an affair with her secretary, right?

804
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,350
You know clicks are more important than facts.

805
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:13,780
And how can a reporter report only the facts?

806
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,970
If you can't report only the facts, you should also report facts.

807
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,370
So, you can continue being a reporter, not a trash reporter.

808
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,710
 
 The article is scheduled to be published today before noon. 

809
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,230
- Why didn't you come yesterday?
 - What?

810
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,010
Yesterday?

811
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,390
I told you yesterday was our camp day.

812
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,850
If Dad wasn't available, you should've come, at least.

813
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,350
I was the only one who was all alone without a parent.

814
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,330
Right.

815
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,940
Right. I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

816
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,770
Auntie was there, right?

817
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,840
If Auntie is there, does that mean you don't need to come?

818
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,760
Gosh...

819
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,750
That's not what I meant.

820
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:35,320
I was in a situation yesterday.

821
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,800
Jae Hui, I'll come to the English academy later this evening.

822
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,970
I have something I must tell you.

823
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,720
I'll hang out at Seong Hui's place this evening.

824
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,490
Don't come.

825
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,310
Hey, look at this.

826
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:19,870
"Cha Eun Gyeong... De Facto Bigamy?" What's this?

827
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:21,950
What's this?

828
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,870
If it's de facto bigamy, is it a double life?

829
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:28,170
- I feel sorry for her. 
- For what? She's an attorney.

830
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:31,420
- Look at this! It's daebak.
 - Isn't it daebak?

831
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,540
 Daejeong Law Firm 

832
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,120
Hello.

833
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,770
- Hello.
 - Hello, Attorney Jeong.

834
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,860
 Hello. 

835
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,230
You're here, Attorney Jeong.

836
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,540
Did something happen?

837
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,020
Will you take a look at this?

838
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,840
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's husband is in a de facto bigamy relationship 

839
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,600
 The wannabe of 20s and 30s. 

840
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,710
 With Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's first court date to come, 

841
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:33,740
 we're here in front of the family court. 

842
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,070
 Regarding the suspicion that Attorney Cha 

843
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,790
 filed for divorce due to her spouse's adultery, 

844
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:44,360
 she has officially announced they were all true this morning. 

845
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,490
Brace yourself.

846
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,020
I told you, right?

847
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,260
My divorce isn't simply a divorce but a show.

848
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,760
Yes, I understand.

849
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,840
And leave that childish facial expression in this car.

850
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,780
Yes.

851
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,410
 What will a divorce of a divorce attorney look like? 

852
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:24,220
 Attorney Cha's fans are oddly looking forward to it. 

853
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,660
- She's here!
 - There she is!

854
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,050
Attorney Cha, your first court date is finally here after much controversy.

855
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,650
How do you feel going into trial?

856
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,030
Some say both parties committed adultery, while others say it was just one.

857
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,880
Can you clarify it for us here?

858
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,740
We'd also like a word from her attorney.

859
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,470
I don't wish to fight in front of the entire nation.

860
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:13,100
I sincerely ask that you protect the other party's privacy.

861
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,730
However, so that my case can become

862
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:21,950
a good precedent for people who are enduring unsavory times at home...

863
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:27,900
In other words, I'll do my best to leave a precedent people will need.

864
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,810
The entire country is talking about the phrase "de facto bigamy."

865
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,520
Could you explain what it means exactly?

866
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,290
 And leave that childish facial expression in this car. 

867
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,700
Please give us a word!

868
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,570
A de facto bigamy is when a legally married person

869
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,550
forms a de facto marriage relationship with someone else while living together.

870
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:51,190
It means a de facto relationship not protected by law.

871
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,770
- Informally called— 
- Yes.

872
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,160
You're right.

873
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,010
It's a double life.

874
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:14,180
 Ma'am, Jae Hui has been missing since the recess after the first period. 

875
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,020
Choi Sa Ra!

876
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:34,910

 Good Partner 

885
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:17,350
 Since the defendant raised her thus far, the defendant should have custody. 

886
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:19,510
 The custody was actually the main point. 

887
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:22,620
 I think Kim Ji Sang seriously plans to take Jae Hui. 

888
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,270
 You want to live here? Just the two of us? 

889
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,280
 I also have the right to choose. 

890
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,990
 Have you seen Jae Hui? Kim Jae Hui. 

891
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,540
 We didn't talk about much. 

892
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,600
 Jae Hui asked me what my relationship is with her dad. 

893
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,650
 You're messing with the wrong person.
