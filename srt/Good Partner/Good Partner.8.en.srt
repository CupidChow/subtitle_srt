(Seoul Family Court)

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,719
Defendant, I ask you this first.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,130
Why must you be the one to raise your daughter?

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,899
To the family investigator,

15
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,459
you must discredit the mother as much as possible.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,099
Be petty if you have to.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,999
None of it can be proved, so say whatever you want.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,910
I raised Jae Hui all by myself.

19
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,508
The mother was married to her job...

20
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,178
and only came home around 1 to 2 in the morning.

21
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,179
Look here, Mr. Kim.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,949
She never once attended Jae Hui's graduation...

23
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,309
or entrance ceremonies.

24
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,020
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,389
I was at her kindergarten graduation...

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,618
and her elementary school entrance ceremony.

27
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,449
She's yet to graduate the latter.

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,159
How dare you lie?

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,259
Ms. Cha, I mean...

30
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,630
Plaintiff. I'd like to hear from the defendant first.

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,860
Right.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,100
I learned how to raise a child and put it into practice.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,539
Even when she recently had her first period,

34
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,309
I bought pads for her.

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,009
You know what that implies.

36
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:49,280
Is this true, Plaintiff?

37
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,850
Yes, that's true.

38
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:54,550
However, how is that important...

39
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,850
regarding this custody battle?

40
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,288
It's not even worth hearing about.

41
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,289
That's for me to determine, Plaintiff.

42
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,599
Defendant, is there more to add?

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,859
If I can say more,

44
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,429
I'd like to add that I made her birthday cakes myself...

45
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,470
because it was sad her mom never celebrated birthdays with her.

46
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,940
The loneliness one feels while raising a child alone?

47
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,239
You must experience it to know it yourself.

48
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,680
Plaintiff, please rebuttal.

49
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,280
For my child,

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,649
I took on the position as the breadwinner of the family.

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,720
For our child?

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,358
You did that to feed your career.

53
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,758
Are you saying it was all for our child?

54
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,989
Of course.

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,358
Of course it was for you and Jae Hui.

56
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,160
What an excuse.

57
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,698
Being acknowledged and moving up the ranks...

58
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,238
as well as poaching rich VIP clients.

59
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,169
You valued them over motherhood.

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,710
While you did, she waited for you and cried herself to sleep.

61
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,940
And 13 years passed.

62
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,479
Jae Hui cried herself to sleep again.

63
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,879
How can you call yourself her mom when she barely gets to see you?

64
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,689
You're even busier these days.

65
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,090
Just go about your work...

66
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,359
like always.

67
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,668
We're lovers.

68
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,470
But I never thought about remarrying.

69
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,280
I already failed once at marriage. Why would I want to marry again?

70
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,850
Stop it! I'm sick of it.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,479
Know your place!

72
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,430
I'll protect you.

73
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,970
You must also...

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,139
be a working mom.

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,039
Yes, I am.

76
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,549
Promotions and snagging deals.

77
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,150
Is there a mother...

78
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,779
who devotes herself to work...

79
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,419
because it outvalues her child?

80
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,289
What motivated me...

81
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,988
was the fact that my success...

82
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,459
would provide my daughter with tools she'll need...

83
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,890
to easily navigate this world.

84
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,129
Like he said,

85
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,330
I admit I neglected my family...

86
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
while trying to move up at the office.

87
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,840
From here on out,

88
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,280
I will raise her with love...

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,879
and have her be a fine young lady.

90
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:47,789
I can't allow that.

91
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,989
All that's left for me in this marriage...

92
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,689
is Jae Hui.

93
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,058
She did everything she wanted to do...

94
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:56,559
that granted her wealth and a solid career.

95
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,600
I can't let her also have Jae Hui.

96
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:08,109
Eun Kyung.

97
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,379
I had court today.

98
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,379
- Are you done here? - Yes.

99
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,749
- Will you be heading to the office? - Yes.

100
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,119
I'll drive you.

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Sure.

102
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,929
(Seoul Family Court)

103
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
I bet it was exhausting.

104
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,570
(Episode 8)

105
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,369
It'll all blow over.

106
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,939
For you and Director Kim...

107
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,910
I mean, Kim Ji Sang.

108
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,280
You can solely focus on Jae Hui now.

109
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,379
That, I should.

110
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,479
Thanks.

111
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,449
How he's trying...

112
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,520
to claim custody after what he did...

113
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,989
amazes me.

114
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:00,900
Can I put a positive spin on that?

115
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,998
We come across cases...

116
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,169
where both parents refuse to take custody.

117
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,869
Consider this as him saying he'll still be a father to her.

118
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,639
Is that it?

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,080
I thought that could cheer you up.

120
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,619
I have a favor to ask.

121
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,949
The family investigator is also a working mom,

122
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,359
so she seemed understanding of Eun Kyung's situation.

123
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:30,429
Your daughter will soon be attending middle school...

124
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:34,160
which means what she wants is crucial.

125
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,139
The family investigator will meet with Jae Hui.

126
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,340
In other words, this will be Jae Hui's choice.

127
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,939
What can I do, then?

128
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,710
I advise...

129
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:53,249
that you consider Choi Sa Ra as a card you can sacrifice.

130
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,320
A card I can sacrifice?

131
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,589
Financial support,

132
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,488
the fact that she's a girl,

133
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,160
and that she'll reach puberty soon.

134
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,689
Did you raise all those points?

135
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,058
It's better for adolescents...

136
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,389
to be raised by a parent of the same gender.

137
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,600
I spoke of that.

138
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,100
It's now up to Jae Hui.

139
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:15,269
The family investigator will be making home visits soon.

140
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,808
Kim Ji Sang decorated a room in the way Jae Hui likes it.

141
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,239
You should do that as well.

142
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,609
What does she like?

143
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,039
She's not childish enough to be swayed by that.

144
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,210
Ms. Cha, please.

145
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,449
I'm not saying you should shower her with gifts...

146
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,650
so that she will choose you.

147
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,759
What I mean is that you should express...

148
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,189
your love and interest for her.

149
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,059
I see.

150
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,169
That's a good idea.

151
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,799
How do you know about this when you don't have a child?

152
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,439
I may not be someone's mom, but I'm someone's daughter.

153
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:04,789
You came.

154
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,049
What's the case you want me to take?

155
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,520
Ms. Han, tell him.

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,759
Oh, right.

157
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,059
It's a custody battle.

158
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,329
According to the family investigator's report,

159
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,160
the child is greatly attached to the father.

160
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,069
We're most likely to win, right?

161
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,369
That's right.

162
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,939
It was an intense year-long case.

163
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,739
The son is a high schooler who is close to his father.

164
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,280
When the family investigator asked, he said he'd live with the dad.

165
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,850
There's a good chance the mother will finally give up,

166
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,749
so all you need to do is finish it up.

167
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,018
It just happened to overlap with another one.

168
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,790
Okay, I'll take care of it.

169
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,649
- Thanks. - Thank you, Mr. Jung.

170
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,518
(In session)

171
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,888
The investigation into the family...

172
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:48,228
revealed how much the son wishes to live with his father.

173
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:51,529
I suggest a settlement following a mediation.

174
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,169
(Plaintiff)

175
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,239
Your Honor,

176
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,869
I have evidence to submit.

177
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,170
Go ahead.

178
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,290
(DNA Test Report)

179
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,499
(Result)

180
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,040
(Park Seo Jin is not Park Ji Hwan's biological son.)

181
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:38,978
The custody battle has been going on for a year,

182
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,719
but now you're saying they're not biologically related?

183
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,879
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,350
Did the plaintiff...

185
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,618
deliberately withhold this fact?

186
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,518
Or did she just find out?

187
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,759
She was aware of it, but couldn't tell the father.

188
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,628
However, the biological father...

189
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,560
is now suing to claim his parental rights.

190
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,869
That is why the plaintiff wishes to end...

191
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,898
this custody dispute.

192
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,600
If the defendant isn't the biological father,

193
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:04,739
there will be no reason to continue this custody trial.

194
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,378
Defending counsel?

195
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,710
In the light of this new claim,

196
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,409
we'd like the time to reassess our strategy.

197
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,618
Sure. Go over this with your clients.

198
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,950
The next hearing will be a negotiation.

199
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:25,659
What?

200
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,830
She knowingly lied to him for 18 years.

201
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,569
They're not biologically related.

202
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,999
It hurts, but what can you do?

203
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,540
We'll drop the custody battle and sue her for emotional damage.

204
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,639
Thanks for this.

205
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,309
I'll talk to the father myself.

206
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,238
Since I took the case, I'll see it through.

207
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,340
Thanks for this, Woo Jin.

208
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,109
- I ask that you do a good job. - Sure.

209
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,559
Ms. Cha told me you were a respectable lawyer.

210
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Right.

211
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:05,869
I'm afraid...

212
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,700
we came across an unexpected issue.

213
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,540
But she said my case was close to being over.

214
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,809
Did something happen?

215
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,310
This will probably shock you.

216
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,080
Is his mother still not backing off?

217
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,519
Unbelievable.

218
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,220
But I'm the one Seo Jin wants to live with.

219
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,659
You may tell me anything, Mr. Jung.

220
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,768
I've been through a lot this past year,

221
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,399
and nothing could shock me.

222
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,739
Seo Jin...

223
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,180
isn't your biological son.

224
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,509
What?

225
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,850
Seo Jin's mother...

226
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,080
submitted a DNA test report...

227
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,518
that shows you and your son...

228
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,460
aren't a biological match.

229
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,629
What the...

230
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,898
Is she actually going that far to win custody over our son?

231
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,429
Unbelievable.

232
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,368
She will stop at nothing.

233
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,309
I'm sure it was forged.

234
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,509
I confirmed its authenticity...

235
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,009
with your wife's attorney.

236
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,810
You are to run a test of your own...

237
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,609
if you don't believe her.

238
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,050
What are you saying?

239
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,389
How does this make sense?

240
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,830
Whose son is he if he isn't mine?

241
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,529
My Seo Jin...

242
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,769
has my personality...

243
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,670
and looks just like me!

244
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,869
The test must be wrong.

245
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,810
Whose son is he if he isn't mine?

246
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Whose?

247
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,700
(Case 08: That's How Fatherhood Begins)

248
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,680
We'll get going first. See you tomorrow.

249
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,949
Be honest with me. Didn't you doze off?

250
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,248
Did you doze off as well?

251
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:36,149
I blacked out halfway through class.

252
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,220
(My everything)

253
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,729
- Are your classes over? - Yes.

254
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,859
What did the court say?

255
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,800
Did they tell Mom what I told the family investigator?

256
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,970
I bet it shocked her.

257
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:59,840
Don't worry too much.

258
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,840
No matter how this ends,

259
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,950
you'll still have two parents in your life.

260
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,420
No one can separate us.

261
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,249
Dad. When will you go home?

262
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,089
Can I come over to play a game?

263
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,190
Sure you can.

264
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,259
I'll come over now.

265
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,049
- What just happened? Get up. - Kick.

266
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,619
- Here goes! - A flying kick.

267
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:50,119
- A flying kick! - Uppercut!

268
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,690
A flying kick.

269
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,960
- No! - Yes.

270
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,329
- I won again. - I lost again.

271
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,398
It's not as fun now that I'm much better.

272
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,499
You should practice.

273
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,840
I let you win because you're my son.

274
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,170
Darn it.

275
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,479
It's time to go.

276
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,449
I wish the trial would end and I could live with you.

277
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,950
Do you think I'll let you play games all day if you live with me?

278
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,320
Brush your teeth before you go. You had some chocolate.

279
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,759
You said that for 18 years.

280
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,659
I will even if you don't tell me to.

281
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,690
Did you talk to the client?

282
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,100
He seemed to love the boy more than I thought.

283
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,699
This is a first for us.

284
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,929
Let's try and get the most alimony ever.

285
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,970
Yes, let's.

286
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,199
Money alone isn't enough to compensate,

287
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,840
but that's our job.

288
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,009
I'll expand the cause and demand of alimony...

289
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,179
and sue for child support that was paid so far.

290
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,478
We must also charge them...

291
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,350
for the expenses of the year-long custody battle.

292
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,389
We live in a world where parents abandon their kids.

293
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:29,720
He raised a child that wasn't his. He deserves compensation.

294
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,560
Yes.

295
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:47,940
You must consider giving up on Choi Sa Ra.

296
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,679
What do you mean "give up?"

297
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,349
What judge would give custody...

298
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,720
to a man who's living with his affair partner?

299
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,978
And what daughter would choose...

300
00:16:56,979 --> 00:17:00,119
a dad who had an affair with a family friend?

301
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,859
Keep as much distance as you can with Choi Sa Ra.

302
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,090
About what we discussed last time.

303
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,699
You asked if we'd live together after I got a divorce.

304
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,129
I got my answer that day. You don't have to explain anymore.

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,899
After the divorce is finalized,

306
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,139
we can think about it then.

307
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,909
No. You and I have different circumstances.

308
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,510
It would be wrong not to be clear and allow a misunderstanding.

309
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,510
You just want to date me.

310
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,179
You don't want to marry me.

311
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,119
Did you come here to say that?

312
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,459
You made that very clear last time.

313
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,790
I talked to a family investigator...

314
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,129
and realized I have no energy to spend on anything else.

315
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,929
Jae Hui will come see me this week,

316
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,139
and even after the divorce, I'll still be Jae Hui's dad.

317
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,010
I don't want you to bring that up for a while.

318
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,639
What about our baby, then?

319
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:59,709
Are you saying Jae Hui needs her dad's care...

320
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,719
and our baby can be abandoned?

321
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,350
What do you mean "our baby?"

322
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,419
I'm pregnant.

323
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,459
What?

324
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:15,929
Eight weeks.

325
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,840
No way.

326
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,909
Is this for real?

327
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,280
- Are you ready? - Yes.

328
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,919
You'll be there for just a day, and you'll study?

329
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,250
There's homework, and I'm stuck. I'll ask Dad for his help.

330
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,520
I see. Is that it?

331
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,730
You don't like it?

332
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,629
Why would I dislike that?

333
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,898
I'm afraid you'll study all day when you barely have...

334
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,899
enough time to have fun with your dad.

335
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,639
The court will send someone to Dad's home?

336
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:33,909
Yes.

337
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,239
Relax and do your thing.

338
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,879
You can say anything you want.

339
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,719
- Dad's here. Bye. - Bye.

340
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,908
A trial to prove the child isn't his.

341
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,310
I think these cases are the hardest.

342
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,850
"Petition to deny paternity."

343
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,750
Doesn't the term make you feel sad?

344
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,449
Doesn't it, Mr. Jung?

345
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:25,030
It does. Denying paternity of a child.

346
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,659
It's heartbreaking.

347
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Hello, Ms. Cha.

348
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,668
I attached the DNA test report Park Ji Hwan got and submitted...

349
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,269
a petition denying paternity.

350
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,138
Okay. Did we get the payment for the extra lawsuit?

351
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,178
Yes. I confirmed the wire transfer.

352
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,250
Good.

353
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,879
She's tough. She doesn't mind the sad lawsuit.

354
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,850
Be quiet.

355
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,760
Thanks a lot.

356
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,790
I hope Divorce Team Two will handle this well for me.

357
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,459
- Sure. - Okay.

358
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:07,169
- Give me another coin. - Instead of a coin...

359
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,399
You can jump in too!

360
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,590
Yes!

361
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,619
No way.

362
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,560
Neener.

363
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,530
One, two, three.

364
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,760
One, two, three.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,100
One, two, three.

366
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,800
You have three-meter-long legs.

367
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
I got it.

368
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,699
We were here around this time last year.

369
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,139
It's been exactly a year.

370
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,239
Do you know I brought you here...

371
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,879
for the flower festival every year since you were one?

372
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,350
Yes.

373
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:56,350
Why did you bring me here?

374
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,919
Bringing you to the same place as you grew up...

375
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,189
made it feel like our memories grew as well.

376
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,599
Jae Hui, wave at Mom.

377
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,840
- Dad! - Jae Hui.

378
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,439
Hi, there.

379
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,810
Let's go.

380
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,350
What a good girl.

381
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,718
Miss Kim. Do you like the carousel when you're a grown girl?

382
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,790
Yes.

383
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,889
Do you really?

384
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,899
I prefer this to looking for something new to do.

385
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,929
Yes. You liked old things.

386
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:48,570
That's why you don't throw things out.

387
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,108
I never saw you...

388
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,280
get sick of something you liked.

389
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:57,879
Right.

390
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,550
How is your mom doing?

391
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,619
She always pretends to be strong and okay.

392
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,250
She's the same.

393
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Jae Hui.

394
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,329
Even if you live with me,

395
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,260
you can see Mom as much as you want.

396
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,300
Don't worry too much about her.

397
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,109
After dropping Jae Hui off tomorrow, go to the OB-GYN with me.

398
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:41,559
- Rest in your room. - Okay.

399
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,889
I'll make you a strawberry juice.

400
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:03,770
Jae Hui.

401
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:05,969
This is the family investigator.

402
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:08,510
- Hello. - Hi.

403
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,850
Oh, this must be your room.

404
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,609
- Come in. - Well...

405
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,178
Can you let us two talk?

406
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,619
You can wait outside for a bit.

407
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,320
Oh, okay.

408
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,730
Thank you.

409
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,399
- Take a seat. - Thanks.

410
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,639
First, I think I should explain what I do.

411
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,449
The court wants to know what kind of relationship...

412
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,719
you have with your parents as your caregivers,

413
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,919
and who can provide you with...

414
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,619
the best living environment.

415
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,929
My duty is to check that.

416
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,429
You're basically here to ask who I prefer,

417
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,368
my mom or dad.

418
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,899
No, it's not like that.

419
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,639
Your mom and dad...

420
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
might not live together anymore,

421
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,239
but as your parents, for your sake...

422
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I heard that so many times my ears might bleed.

423
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,810
Only when the adults are honest with me...

424
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,679
will I honestly say what I think.

425
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:43,040
Jae Hui, shall I read you a book?

426
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:45,139
It's okay.

427
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,810
Sleep well.

428
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,479
I took on the position as the breadwinner of the family.

429
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,820
You did that to feed your career.

430
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,889
While you did, she waited for you and cried herself to sleep.

431
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,850
And 13 years passed.

432
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,310
"This rose means so much..."

433
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:03,379
"because of the time you spent with it."

434
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,148
"But you can't forget."

435
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,189
"But you can't forget."

436
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,320
"You're always responsible..."

437
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,730
"for what you tamed."

438
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:16,100
"You're responsible for your rose."

439
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,129
This is my favorite part.

440
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,729
"You're always responsible..."

441
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,939
"for what you tamed."

442
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,740
"You're responsible for your rose."

443
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,369
Hey, I feel the same.

444
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,909
Do you know you're Dad's rose?

445
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,050
Keep reading.

446
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,379
Kim Rose, read yourself to sleep.

447
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,948
I haven't read to you in bed in ten years.

448
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,149
Will you let me off?

449
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:42,119
No. I want you to read this book to me.

450
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,560
It's fun, and it helps me sleep.

451
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:46,358
Okay, then.

452
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:49,730
I'll keep reading to you in bed until you get a sibling.

453
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,240
"You're always responsible..."

454
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,669
"for what you tamed."

455
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,679
"You're responsible for your rose."

456
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:11,919
My Jae Hui.

457
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,520
This is how she waited...

458
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:17,659
every night.

459
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,609
You're always responsible for what you tamed.

460
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,010
You're responsible...

461
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,109
You're responsible...

462
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,919
- for your rose. - For your rose.

463
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,359
- You're home. - Yes.

464
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,830
Oh, that...

465
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,668
It was really dirty.

466
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:34,830
I brought it out to wipe it down.

467
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,439
Get ready for school. I'll drop you off.

468
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,040
- Get changed. - Okay.

469
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,449
I told you not to come here. If someone sees...

470
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,090
I don't care if someone sees.

471
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,010
Was it nice to spend the night with Jae Hui again?

472
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,639
You must've had a lot to think about.

473
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,780
- You did great. - I can't go with you to the OB-GYN.

474
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,780
My dad wants you there.

475
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,449
What man goes to an OB-GYN while fighting for custody?

476
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,049
You're weighing me down now.

477
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,319
Why are you so inconsiderate?

478
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,590
You spent a whole 24 hours with Jae Hui.

479
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,259
Our baby's getting ready to enter the world,

480
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,830
and you won't even go to see it?

481
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:36,628
How is that the same?

482
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,100
How is it different?

483
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:43,099
All lives are equal. I'm saying the circumstances aren't.

484
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,199
I don't want to fight.

485
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,139
Okay.

486
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,740
Let's say I don't make such demands...

487
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,080
until the divorce is final.

488
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,679
What about after that? What happens then?

489
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,948
I told you. I'm not interested in marriage,

490
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:01,149
and I'll live with Jae Hui.

491
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,688
I made it clear.

492
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:05,290
Not being married to me doesn't mean you're not a dad.

493
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:06,689
I'm sorry.

494
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,459
I need time to think, but that time...

495
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,730
isn't right now.

496
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,040
If you don't get custody of Jae Hui,

497
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,240
can our baby...

498
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,540
live with its dad then?

499
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,209
That won't happen,

500
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,649
but if Jae Hui lives with her mom,

501
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,379
let's think about it then.

502
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:41,330
We informed the court that you deny paternity.

503
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,800
I think the family register will get sorted out.

504
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,999
We'll do our best so you get back...

505
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,198
the money you paid as child support so far.

506
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,240
Mr. Jun.

507
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:54,709
I want to drop the lawsuit.

508
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,139
I asked to see you to say that.

509
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,279
What? You can't do that.

510
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,179
If you don't set straight the records about your paternity,

511
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,918
you'll have to leave everything to him.

512
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,789
And even after you're divorced,

513
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,859
your ex-wife can demand you pay child support.

514
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,559
I think your emotions are preventing you...

515
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,358
from being rational.

516
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,959
I completely understand what you're saying.

517
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,469
I also know that you're just looking out for my best interest.

518
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,730
But she just happened to deceive me.

519
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,770
That's not my son's fault.

520
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,639
No one is saying that.

521
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:29,879
We're just urging you to protect yourself.

522
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,980
I'm doing this to protect myself too.

523
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,080
My dear son, Seo Jin...

524
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,790
Once it becomes official...

525
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,389
that he's not my son,

526
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:50,230
I won't be able to live like that. I'm sorry.

527
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,139
No, Mr. Park.

528
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,250
But I still don't think this is right.

529
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:07,878
You must think carefully about this.

530
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,179
You must maintain a rational mind about this.

531
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,189
You will have to pay child support...

532
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,488
when he's not your biological son.

533
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,960
No! He's my son.

534
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,790
I don't care about getting extorted out of some money for child support.

535
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,210
Thank you for meeting me like this.

536
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,980
Are you...

537
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:40,980
pregnant?

538
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,649
So you saw it.

539
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,818
Didn't you put it in there for me to find it?

540
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:47,949
Gosh. No, that wasn't my intention.

541
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,919
I care a lot about you too.

542
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,360
Why would you?

543
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,690
That's because...

544
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,000
we're close.

545
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,130
Don't you think you're being too cruel toward me?

546
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:01,028
I'm still in elementary school.

547
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,540
You're basically all grown up.

548
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,339
But it seems your parents treat you like a little kid.

549
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,969
You'll start middle school soon.

550
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,779
But if you ask me, I think you're all grown up now.

551
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,549
I helped my mom run her business when I was your age.

552
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,009
That baby...

553
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,949
Is that my dad's?

554
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:23,759
Yes. You have a sibling now.

555
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:29,029
You will be a good sibling to our baby, Sa Rang, right?

556
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,100
Sa Rang?

557
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,799
Does my mother know?

558
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:36,839
No.

559
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,338
If your mother finds out, she'll be deeply hurt.

560
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,980
The lawsuit will get dragged on.

561
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,580
There will be articles too, right?

562
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:48,480
Did you even apologize to my mother?

563
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,549
Jae Hui. I'm sorry.

564
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,520
It's all our fault as adults.

565
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,960
But you've sufficiently been loved by your father.

566
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,529
And your mother desperately needs you too.

567
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,130
Can't you tell the family investigator...

568
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:05,199
that you must absolutely live with your mother?

569
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm really sorry to ask you of this.

570
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,069
Don't apologize to me. Did you apologize to my mother?

571
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,589
Jae Hui. Where are you?

572
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm on my way home.

573
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,449
Jae Hui.

574
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,080
- Hello. - Hey.

575
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,049
What are you doing out here?

576
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,449
Did you come here alone?

577
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,989
I was just passing by.

578
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,889
Should I ask your mom to come down?

579
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:07,560
(In front of Daejeong Building)

580
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:10,129
I have no problem taking the bus on my own.

581
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,329
You don't have to wait with me.

582
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,799
Gosh, I know that you're a smart girl.

583
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,670
But I'll see you getting on the bus before I go.

584
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,569
Where are you going?

585
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,069
Home? Your academy?

586
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,710
I don't know where I should go.

587
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,279
You should go home.

588
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,350
Which one?

589
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,389
The one with my mom? Or the one with my dad?

590
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,659
When I was your age,

591
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,730
I had a complicated family matter too.

592
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,400
So I somewhat know what you must be going through.

593
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,770
So did the complicated matter...

594
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,908
get sorted out well?

595
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:53,940
Of course.

596
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,810
It was over in due time.

597
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,380
But of course, I think about it from time to time.

598
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,130
Hey.

599
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,199
Be safe.

600
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Hello.

601
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,330
Gosh. Let me.

602
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,759
Okay.

603
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,869
I'm sorry...

604
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,369
for making you come over at this late hour.

605
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,469
I have no one to talk about this.

606
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,009
I see. I understand.

607
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:03,409
With whom could you possibly talk about what happened to you?

608
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,150
You can vent all you want on me.

609
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,719
Gosh.

610
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:29,400
Dad.

611
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:31,839
Hey.

612
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:34,569
Hello.

613
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,509
You must be Seo Jin.

614
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Yes.

615
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:43,750
He didn't get back to me, so I stopped by.

616
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,790
My study room is in this neighborhood.

617
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,718
I always had pork cutlets for dinner my dad fried for me.

618
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:52,089
We also had late-night snacks before I went back home.

619
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,699
He said he was going to have a drink with you here tonight.

620
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,199
Gosh. You and your dad must be very close.

621
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,739
My dad has high blood pressure. He shouldn't drink this much.

622
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,409
Everything is okay with him, right?

623
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,449
Of course. Nothing is wrong.

624
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,860
Gosh. It's my son. When did you get here?

625
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,929
Dad. Wake up. We're almost home.

626
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,239
Gosh. My son is so reliable.

627
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:37,639
Don't go anywhere.

628
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,210
I won't.

629
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,210
What's gotten into you today? Your attorney is here too.

630
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,409
You have me for the night. Remember?

631
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:47,909
I'll sleep over.

632
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,250
Don't go anywhere.

633
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:55,420
Do you resemble your father a lot?

634
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,130
No. Not at all.

635
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,199
I see.

636
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,699
I'm the spitting image of my dad, aren't I?

637
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,310
Yes. You're the spitting image of him.

638
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,658
All right. Today, we're having...

639
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:03,659
S and B.

640
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,229
That's it. Well done.

641
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,860
Squid and beer.

642
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,798
Do you remember this was the very spot...

643
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:13,429
I told you about Kim Ji Sang's affair?

644
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,428
Right. You said it was...

645
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:16,569
about your friend of a friend or something.

646
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,270
You were such a bad liar.

647
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,338
Do you remember what you told me?

648
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,009
Me? What did I say?

649
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,349
If I found out even later on that my wife cheated on me,

650
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,609
I'd end it right then.

651
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,549
Why stay together when half the world is made up of women?

652
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,420
You said half the world was made up of women.

653
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,319
Gosh.

654
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,060
That was only a few months ago.

655
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,929
But I now have a different opinion about that.

656
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,000
What did Park Ji Hwan say?

657
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,769
He said he wanted to live as Seo Jin's dad...

658
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,009
as long as possible.

659
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,409
Do you still think divorce cases are fun?

660
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,619
Did you know that your behavior can be contagious?

661
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,118
You already infected me.

662
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,250
I'm too invested in this case now.

663
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:08,419
It was awful for you too, right?

664
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,919
That's why I couldn't go home right away.

665
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,589
I got you to drink with me here.

666
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,929
Before I started this job, I thought divorces happened...

667
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,900
because a spouse did wrong...

668
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,639
and the other spouse decided to end it.

669
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:26,310
I thought divorces weren't much different from breakups.

670
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,210
But...

671
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,940
it wasn't simply a breakup between a man and a woman.

672
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:38,420
Our textbook talks about the best interest of the child.

673
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,850
The principle says...

674
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,319
the child's happiness must be our top priority.

675
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,920
Gosh. When I met up with Mr. Park today,

676
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,889
I could understand what the textbook was saying.

677
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:57,699
Hang in there.

678
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,669
You too.

679
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,670
Cheers.

680
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,980
- Great meeting, everyone. - Great meeting.

681
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:19,089
What does Mr. Park want to do?

682
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:21,560
He wants to withdraw his intention for the lawsuit.

683
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,829
He raised his son with all of his heart.

684
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,170
I understand why he wants to remain as his legal father.

685
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,539
Once the two-year exclusion period ends,

686
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,710
he will never be able to file a lawsuit.

687
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:37,238
Shouldn't we try to urge him more strongly to pursue this?

688
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,150
I don't think there's any point trying to explain the legal risk.

689
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,150
Let's drop the lawsuit.

690
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,479
In terms of alimony and child support,

691
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,988
we should negotiate, so he doesn't face any loss.

692
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:49,159
I trust your judgment, so proceed accordingly.

693
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,258
- Okay. - Okay.

694
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:52,658
- We'll get going. - Good luck.

695
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:53,859
- Thanks. - Bye.

696
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,860
Bye.

697
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,000
(Mediation Room)

698
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,429
(Defendant)

699
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,939
I've had this job for ten years now.

700
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,040
But I've never had a case like this.

701
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:10,279
Could you say something to explain yourself, plaintiff?

702
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,650
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,479
Don't you think...

704
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,420
you should apologize to my client, not the mediator?

705
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:19,889
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,020
How could you do this?

707
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,588
Have you been seeing him the whole time we were married?

708
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,299
Were you telling me nothing but lies?

709
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:31,400
It was only that one time.

710
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,199
One time? Are you serious?

711
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,369
So it's okay to cheat on me just one time?

712
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,999
You even did the DNA test.

713
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,069
Why did you drag on this lawsuit for a year if you knew?

714
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:42,138
Were you using Seo Jin and me...

715
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,310
to cover up your mistake?

716
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:45,810
If I won, were you even going to let me raise Seo Jin?

717
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,380
How could you call yourself his mother after what you did?

718
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:53,718
It was really hard on me too...

719
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:57,460
when I had to keep lying to you.

720
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,359
Why do you insist on raising my son?

721
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,658
He's my son too.

722
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,658
Seo Jin wants to live with me!

723
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:05,259
Think about your son for once!

724
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:07,000
Gosh.

725
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,969
I couldn't keep lying to you.

726
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:15,310
When you asked me for a divorce,

727
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,980
I thought it was because I wasn't good enough.

728
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:22,850
I'm a lowly cook who fries pork cutlets.

729
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,588
I'll try to understand you and let's say I forgave you for it.

730
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:30,259
But how could you do this to Seo Jin?

731
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,799
The defendant must have been miserable...

732
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,670
to cope with the fact that he was deceived.

733
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,639
Despite that, he only thought about Seo Jin.

734
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,968
He decided not to take any legal measures...

735
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:50,009
as he was worried...

736
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:53,949
Seo Jin would be utterly shocked if he were to find out.

737
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:56,049
Honey.

738
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,219
Take this secret to the grave, please.

739
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,000
That's the only thing I want.

740
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:16,639
Just let me...

741
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,040
stay as my son's father.

742
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:35,619
(Mediation Committee)

743
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,270
We would like to ask for one thing.

744
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:51,839
We won't be able to take custody.

745
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:54,838
So let's not put...

746
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,139
any visitation restrictions for my client to see Seo Jin.

747
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,580
We can't allow that.

748
00:47:58,639 --> 00:47:59,979
He's not the biological father.

749
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,179
Let's keep it at two visits per month.

750
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,319
Right, he's not.

751
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,048
But don't you remember he withdrew his demand for child support...

752
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:08,690
and decided not to file for a denial of paternity?

753
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:12,420
After all that, if you insist on visitation restrictions...

754
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,670
Eighteen years.

755
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,770
He raised Seo Jin with love for 18 years.

756
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,009
Let him see Seo Jin freely as much as he wants.

757
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,150
Let's settle on that.

758
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,380
(Plaintiff)

759
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,179
Thank you...

760
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,520
so much for helping me keep my son in my life.

761
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:14,690
Gosh, you don't need to thank us.

762
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:17,460
You're his father.

763
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,960
Even if we couldn't help you,

764
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:22,960
I'm sure Seo Jin would have come to see you often.

765
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,068
Right. His mother gave up on the division of assets.

766
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:28,599
So that's basically getting back...

767
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,040
the child support fee you paid.

768
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:32,170
That's the silver lining.

769
00:49:33,509 --> 00:49:34,569
Right.

770
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:36,110
I will continue...

771
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:39,279
to live as Seo Jin's dad.

772
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:43,179
I'll do my best to make sure Seo Jin never finds out about this.

773
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,589
- I'll get going now. - Okay.

774
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,920
Hey, my son.

775
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,690
Yes. Where are you?

776
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,130
Yes. You're spending the night with me tonight, right?

777
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,330
Is there anything you want to eat?

778
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:01,730
Yes. See you later.

779
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:12,179
- Good work today. - Good job.

780
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,810
Good job today. Well done.

781
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:17,380
Not at all.

782
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,588
I'm going to head home first. For the family investigation.

783
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:22,960
Right. Sure. Bye.

784
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,190
Bye.

785
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,029
- Eun Kyung. - Yes?

786
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,900
It's all going to work out. Don't worry too much.

787
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Thanks.

788
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:46,650
(Attorney at law, Jun Eun Ho)

789
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,619
- Mr. Jun. - Yes.

790
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:57,319
How did Park Ji Hwan's case go?

791
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,860
Well, it worked out.

792
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:07,069
But why am I so sad today?

793
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,480
You did a great job.

794
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,080
(Attorney at law, Jung Woo Jin)

795
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,000
Your room is very pretty.

796
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,600
Did your mom decorate it for you?

797
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,040
Yes.

798
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,940
Both my mom and dad are...

799
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,210
suddenly busy filling my room with my favorite items.

800
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,448
It feels like...

801
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,549
I'm getting my Christmas gifts for ten years at once.

802
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,290
You're humorous.

803
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,659
So?

804
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,360
Can you tell me what's on your mind today?

805
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:18,040
Can I get straight to the conclusion?

806
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,860
I wanted to ask if you needed a drink.

807
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
My work is done.

808
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,568
That was fast.

809
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:50,469
We didn't have to beat around the bush.

810
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:53,670
Really? That's better.

811
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:56,940
I'll get going.

812
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,210
- Yes. Thank you for your work. Bye. - Bye, Jae Hui.

813
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:14,460
- Thank you for the ride. - Sure.

814
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,759
By the way,

815
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,529
do you have something to celebrate?

816
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:23,838
In the middle of the custody lawsuit and the family investigation?

817
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,400
What would I have to celebrate?

818
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,569
Exactly.

819
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:29,710
But why do you look happy?

820
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,339
I'm not.

821
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:35,178
In the family investigation,

822
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:36,819
it said Jae Hui hadn't said...

823
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,080
what was on her mind.

824
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:43,589
Did she say she wanted to live with her mom? Is that it?

825
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,130
It's just my guess.

826
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,159
It seems Jae Hui has decided to live with me.

827
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,670
She said she was relieved.

828
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,900
Gosh.

829
00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:00,210
To be honest, she asked me...

830
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,380
whether the lawsuit will be over if she tells the family investigator...

831
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:06,210
that she wants to live with her mom.

832
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:09,179
Did she?

833
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,580
Then I must be right.

834
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:13,889
For sure.

835
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,488
She's going to middle school soon.

836
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,159
Her opinion will be reflected.

837
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:22,690
You won't have to worry about her custody anymore.

838
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,100
You can be at ease for the last family investigation.

839
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,469
Thanks, Ms. Han.

840
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,670
What's this awkward silence?

841
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:42,310
Your advice to decorate her room with her favorites.

842
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,920
No, to express my interest in her.

843
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:48,920
That was very helpful.

844
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,059
After the last nurture environment investigation,

845
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,830
Jae Hui seemed somewhat relieved.

846
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,639
Can you tell me what you talked about?

847
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,110
In the first family investigation,

848
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:08,839
Jae Hui refused to talk.

849
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:13,409
She kept saying we have to be honest for her to be honest.

850
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:16,310
The grown-ups have to be honest with me first.

851
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:19,119
Until then, I don't plan to be honest.

852
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,459
When we hold family investigations,

853
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,759
children often say...

854
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,460
adults are lying.

855
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,129
Perhaps that's because...

856
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,270
they can't accept the fact their parents are breaking up?

857
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:38,770
No.

858
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:43,238
Children often say that when their parents force them...

859
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,239
to believe what they believe is not true.

860
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,549
What do you mean?

861
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,179
Jae Hui knows everything.

862
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,489
Oh, yes. Well...

863
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:00,230
- Her dad's affair... - No.

864
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,460
She learned that her dad was having an affair with Aunt Sa Ra...

865
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,199
before you did.

866
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:14,969
Ms. Cha.

867
00:56:15,569 --> 00:56:19,008
Jae Hui was little Cha Eun Kyung.

868
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,749
You knew?

869
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,749
I thought you didn't know...

870
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,279
Did you think I wouldn't know? Me?

871
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:30,889
Look.

872
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,790
(She learned the defendant's affair with Choi Sa Ra...)

873
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,798
(She learned the defendant's affair with Choi Sa Ra...)

874
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,199
(before the plaintiff and was anxious.)

875
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,509
I'm no longer a kid.

876
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,080
But I guess Dad and Aunt Sa Ra...

877
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,449
didn't think I'd know.

878
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,949
Hi.

879
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:00,618
Where's Jae Hui?

880
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:01,850
She fell asleep while working on her homework.

881
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,770
- Jae Hui will wake up. - It's fine.

882
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:44,699
He lied to me in front of me.

883
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,869
I've never seen you getting sick of anything...

884
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:49,029
that you like.

885
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,669
Even if you live with me,

886
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,400
you can see Mom as much as you want.

887
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,408
So you don't need to worry about Mom so much.

888
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:56,810
Even though I gave him a chance, he lied to me until the end.

889
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,449
And...

890
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,290
this was really difficult for me to bring up.

891
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,420
What is it?

892
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,089
Tell me everything.

893
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,860
She will have a half-sibling.

894
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,469
When she went to her dad's house,

895
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:23,500
she must've seen the ultrasound picture.

896
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,169
- What? - Jae Hui...

897
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,239
told me to keep it a secret from you.

898
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:43,690
How could you hide this from me?

899
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,659
To be honest...

900
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:48,860
You should've told your mom.

901
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,400
Mom...

902
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,029
keeps lying to me to protect me.

903
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,130
I want to protect her heart.

904
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,239
I don't want to burden her.

905
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,509
Just as how all parents love their children in their own ways,

906
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,409
perhaps children are also...

907
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,420
struggling every moment to protect...

908
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,449
the way their parents love them...

909
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:18,819
and their sincerity.

910
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,989
Is that the way...

911
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,259
children love their parents?

912
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,210
Who is it?

913
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:38,509
Who is it?

914
00:59:41,509 --> 00:59:42,580
I said, who is it?

915
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,299
Father.

916
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:17,009
(Good Partner)

917
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,838
I know she's our client,

918
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:21,509
but Jang Seon A is a nasty piece of work.

919
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,409
He tried to seduce me first.

920
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:27,119
An earnest apology. That's what I need to carry on.

921
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,189
I said I wanted even a forced apology from you...

922
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,759
instead of money.

923
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,588
You must pull yourself together especially in times like this.

924
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:36,759
I guess I don't deserve to be a mom.

925
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,429
How much am I supposed to do for her?
