(Plaintiff)

14
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,560
What are your positions on custody?

15
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,999
As the mother, my client should have custody.

16
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:07,168
The public is very interested in this case,

17
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:10,338
so to speed up the proceedings,

18
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:13,639
I hope to decide who gets custody without an argument here today.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,679
Ms. Han.

20
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,509
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,550
(Defendant)

22
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,449
The defendant cares most about custody.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,719
The absolute time and effort put into caring for the child...

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,220
as well as attachment...

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,759
is in my client's favor, Your Honor.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,059
I understand. Please sit.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,899
What does the plaintiff say?

28
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,050
Plaintiff?

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,380
Yes, Your Honor.

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,020
- I just can't do it. - My gosh.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,418
What kind of mom says that?

32
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,849
I raised our kids so far.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,559
It's only right you raise them now!

34
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,789
- No way. - Your Honor.

35
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,890
It's way too hard on me.

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,830
I can't look after the kids anymore.

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,530
The mother should raise the child, Your Honor.

38
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,599
The defendant left home many months ago,

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,969
and the child in question...

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,370
is living just fine with the plaintiff now.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,979
A pubescent girl should be raised by her mother.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,380
She's not a young child.

43
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,509
She has opinions of her own.

44
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,948
And whether she's doing well or not is...

45
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,220
for the court-appointed family investigator to find out.

46
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,888
The defendant...

47
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,060
had an affair with someone the child in question knows.

48
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,829
If the defendant were to get custody,

49
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,500
the defendant's affair partner and my daughter Jae Hui...

50
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,609
The child in question...

51
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,109
That will do.

52
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,519
Since you can't decide who gets custody,

53
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,090
I'll send out an investigator.

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,160
Your Honor.

55
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,769
My client, the plaintiff must get custody.

56
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,870
The whole nation is watching.

57
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,268
The defendant raised her so far,

58
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,340
so the defendant should get custody.

59
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,509
That's the law.

60
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,959
Mom.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,060
- Hey. - Hi.

62
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,199
- Hey. - Kids.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,629
- Let's play with dinosaurs. - Yes.

64
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,568
- Come here. - Play with Uncle.

65
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,400
- Come and play. - Let's play with this.

66
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,969
Are our kids parcels?

67
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,210
To leave them by the door?

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,139
Not that again. Guys, let's go.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,850
- Yes. - Okay.

70
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,979
You're trash.

71
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,219
Why did you want kids if you don't want to be responsible?

72
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,479
Do you think you deserve to be a mom?

73
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,620
What?

74
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,119
I feel sorry for them for having you as a mom.

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,388
How dare you say that when you're a useless dad?

76
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,129
What have you done since our younger was born?

77
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,060
- What have you done? - What did you do?

78
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,429
Darn it. Will you just stop?

79
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,229
Ms. Cha.

80
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm a fan of yours.

81
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,539
Please help me.

82
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,809
- Mom. - Mom.

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
Let's play.

84
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,479
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,978
I'm distracted...

86
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,220
because I'm here as a client myself today.

87
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Oh, right.

88
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,650
Stay strong. I'm rooting for you.

89
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,559
- Let's go. - Let's go home.

90
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,428
- Let's go home. - Take her case immediately.

91

- Let's go. - Mom.

92
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:53,799
Okay.

93
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,429
Wait.

94
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,798

95
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:01,200

Is she not at school?

105
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,498
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,900
I haven't seen her since her after-school class.

107
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,749
Did you take Jae Hui?

108
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,950
What do you mean? She isn't at school?

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,889
Just answer the question.

111
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,689
Are you insane? You can't even watch a kid?

112
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,160
What about her friends' moms? Did you call them?

113
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,660
You don't have any of their numbers, do you?

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,530
I didn't call to listen to you criticize me.

115

I can't find Jae Hui, and she's not answering her phone.

Can you explain what happened?

152
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,619
Aunt Sa Ra had been asking to meet for a few days.

153
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,359
Why didn't you tell me about it?

154
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,290
Did Aunt Sa Ra come to your school?

155
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,259
Yes. She wanted to talk.

156
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,470
So you followed her here?

157
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,699
You avoided me when I wanted to talk.

158
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,070
Dad's affair partner.

159
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,310
It's Aunt Sa Ra, isn't it?

160
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,479
Did you see the news?

161
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,550
I wanted to tell you myself.

162
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,619
It's not Aunt Sa Ra.

163
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,259
I'm not a child.

164
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,290

165

It really isn't.

"I'm leaving the kids outside. Open the door."

183
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,580
Just this one text.

184
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,680
As if he were dropping off a parcel.

185
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,719
Did you mention this in court?

186
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,489
I had no counsel,

00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:23,060
so I was too nervous to say anything.

188
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,499
Everyone says I need proof if I want to bring up anything.

189
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,659
That's why I'm hiring you now.

190
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,170
Why on earth did he leave the kids outside?

191
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,979
He's always hanging out with friends filming YouTube videos...

192
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,080
and drinking, calling that a meeting.

193
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,748
It was just so he could go drinking?

194
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,549
Drink is his family and life.

195
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,680
No, it's his whole life.

196
00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:00,290
And you're saying you'll give someone like that custody?

197
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,700
It could put the kids in danger.

198
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,869
What did I do to deserve this life?

199
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,239
Since they have a loser for a dad,

200
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,509
must I care for them for the rest of my life?

201
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,840
Why should I suffer when he failed to provide for his family?

202
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,379
So you'll let your kids live with a man like that?

203
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,920
Please...

204
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,359
get me out of this pit of torment.

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,029
That's why I scraped together all I had to hire you.

206
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,559
- Mom. - Let's go home.

207
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,028
- Let's go. - Let's go home.

208
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,100
- Okay, go. - You can go home.

209
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,499
- Come here. - Let's go.

210
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,319
- Hello, Ms. Cha. - Hello.

211
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,350
Hello.

212
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,040
How did the consult go?

213
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,709
I've seen lots of couples...

214
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,080
fighting to win custody,

215
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,080
but a couple where neither wants the kids...

216
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:31,920
It's a first.

217
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,090
Such couples are on the increase.

218
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,329
Living expenses and housing prices are going up,

219
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,830
and it's harder to raise kids.

220
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,300
The kids will be neglected if they're sent to their dad.

221
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,800
I say this all the time,

222
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,239
but push what you think aside.

223
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,108
Our client wants her husband to take the kids,

224
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,840
so we must find a way.

225
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,810
Test the waters at the next hearing.

226
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,350
I will.

227
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,649
By the way, where did you go earlier?

228
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Sa Ra took Jae Hui from her school.

229
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,330
- I went to get her back. - What? What the...

230
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,489
Did you call the police?

231
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,869
Jae Hui told me she wasn't coerced.

232
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,399
She knows Sa Ra already.

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,570
Then Sa Ra tricked her.

234
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,940
That's kidnapping a minor.

235
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,670
Goodness.

236
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,009
She knows a bit about the law.

237
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,779
She even texted me that she was with Jae Hui.

238
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,820
Will you let them off?

239
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,399
He moved out without Jae Hui,

240
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,269
and he didn't mention custody much,

241
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,139
so I thought this was just a formality.

242
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,840
It looks like Ji Sang is actually thinking of taking Jae Hui.

243
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,450
Because Sa Ra said...

244
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,820
she wanted you to divide the assets and settle quick,

245
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,759
I didn't think there would be a custody battle.

246
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,889
But today's hearing tells me...

247
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,029
custody was the main argument.

248
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,129
Don't worry about it.

249
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,769
She's too old to be taken against her will or hidden away.

250
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,339
All kids say...

251
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,139
they want to live with their moms when asked.

252
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:39,879
As a mom,

253
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,249
I was often absent.

254
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,759
No, I was mostly absent.

255
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,700
So I'm not confident...

256
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,729
Jae Hui will choose me.

(Case 06: Qualifications to Be a Parent)

258
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,930

259
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,560
Find a place to live with her first.

260
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,929
You must create a home she'll want to live in...

261
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,368
before meeting the family investigator...

262

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,279
She is. She's just so cool.

268
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,349
She appreciates we work overtime because of the tabloids,

269
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,748
and left us her credit card to order what we wanted.

270
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,988
She's a true GOAT.

271
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:52,488
- She is. - She's amazing.

272
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,888
Shouldn't a woman who's getting divorced...

273
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,289
because her husband cheated look pitiful?

274
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,689
- Yes. - Exactly.

Yes. She's awesome.

How could a guy cheat on someone like her?

279

Not only is she a competent woman, she's beautiful too, isn't she?

280
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,669
- Yes. - She's my ideal type.

281
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,739
They say men cheat because they found a new catch,

282
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,478
not necessarily because they're prettier.

283
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,549
Darn it.

284
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,920
Why can't we prosecute people for having an affair anymore?

285
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,420
I didn't think Kim Ji Sang was like that.

286
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,420
Don't you think the gentlemanly type is even worse?

287
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,129
The tabloids say his affair partner is a secretary here.

288
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,358
Don't you think the CEO should...

289

gather them all for a grilling?

290
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,429
- Yes. - I agree.

291
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,439
- That would be fun. - I think so too.

292
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,069
- I'd like that. - I'm all for it.

293

- Something should happen. - It's not right.

294
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,979
Don't you know that's against the law?

Since we're on the topic,

299
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,259
let's say you had an affair with your boss' husband.

300
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:09,458
Would you stay or quit?

301
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,698
- I'd leave. - Me too.

302
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,229
- Who would stay? - That's just wrong.

303
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,369
- It's humiliating. - No one can bear to stay.

What does love have to do with work?

305
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,540
She's right.

306
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,709
Work should be kept separate from our private lives.

307
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:29,679
I have work to do. Excuse me.

308
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,949
You barely ate.

309
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,990
Did you have to bring that up?

310
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,529
She went red. It's her, isn't it?

311
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,529
- I think so. - There's no way it's her.

312
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,000
It's definitely her.

313
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,399
I said "affair," and she said "love."

314
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:47,969
How disgusting.

315
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,599
- Don't be like that. - Get her new chopsticks.

They don't have any assets to divide.

365
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,230
- The custody issue only remains... - Your Honor.

366
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,359
My client does not want to divorce his wife.

367
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,429
What?

368
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,799
Why did you change your stance the moment you hired an attorney?

369
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,439
You agreed to divorce at our last hearing!

370
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
Please.

371
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,040
Sit down.

372
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,040
He said some things he didn't mean...

373
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,010
without proper representation.

374
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,678
The defendant does not wish to divorce his wife...

375
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,849
since they have two young children.

376
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,378
Are you seriously doing this to me?

377
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,750
Plaintiff, please be quiet.

378
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,319
The written complaint says the defendant's alcoholism...

379
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,019
is making it difficult for you to maintain this marriage.

380
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,189
But I don't see any evidence.

381
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,458
Now that this divorce case is without the defendant's consent,

382
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,260
the evidence is insufficient for me to make a ruling in this case.

383
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,600
Ms. Han.

384
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:13,899
It's okay.

385
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,669
Your Honor.

386
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,939
We can provide grounds for divorce.

387
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,138
We will gather and present evidence demonstrating...

388
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,480
the defendant's fault in the marriage at the next hearing.

389
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,350
Why do you think he suddenly doesn't want to divorce her?

390
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,658
It might be because he will be obligated...

391
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,030
to pay child support once they get a divorce.

392
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,260
He's not earning any money for now.

393
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,359
He just goes out and drinks with his friends.

394
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:46,830
I doubt that's the only reason.

395
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,799
Once he withdraws his consent to divorce,

396
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,540
what's the next step we must take?

397
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:53,668
We must provide grounds for divorce.

398
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,439
That's what your opposing counsel is going after.

399
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,209
He wants us to fully commit to providing grounds for divorce.

400
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,148
In order to provide grounds for divorce,

401
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:08,918
if we submit his treatment record for alcohol dependence,

402
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,919
their next-door neighbor's statement,

403
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,129
and similar pieces of evidence,

404
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,159
we will be basically proving the defendant isn't a good father.

405
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,230
That's right.

406
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,599
Remember the sense of shock you felt...

407
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,300
during your consultation with the client?

408
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,309
And you're saying you'll give someone like that custody?

409
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,080
So you'll let your kids live with a man like that?

410
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,079
"She'll let him raise their children?"

411
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,350
He wants the judge to experience the same thing.

412
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,820
She will be able to divorce him because he provided the cause.

413
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:42,419
But she will end up with custody of her children.

414
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,959
That's what the defendant's counsel was after.

415
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,099
He wanted to make sure that my client would be granted...

416
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,459
custody before the divorce.

417
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:50,859
Right.

418
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,270
Don't prove he's at fault.

419
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,439
What?

420
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,639
But if I don't,

421
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,639
the divorce won't go through due to a lack of evidence.

422
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,718
Do you think the plaintiff wants to be divorced...

423
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,419
and have sole custody of their children?

424
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:12,688
If you paid attention during the consultation,

425
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,050
you know that's not the future she wants.

426
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,790
Please...

427
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,330
get me out of this pit of torment.

428
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,240
Kids.

429
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,810
Stop that.

430
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,179
What?

431
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:40,109
Don't touch them.

432
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,050
Come here.

433
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,919
Sit down.

434
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,929
Watch the car games.

435
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,969
- Gosh, look at that. - I'm so sick of this.

436
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,810
Look at the arrow.

437
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,540
This has been my life for the past five years.

438
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:09,280
I can neither sleep nor eat.

439
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:14,719
Well,

440
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:17,350
I know this must be very difficult on you.

441
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,790
Do you believe you'll be at peace after sending your children...

442
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,919
to a father who's unfit to raise them?

443
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,729
Why don't we prove he's at fault and go through with the divorce,

444
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,230
so you can get alimony?

445
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,969
That way, you can raise them yourselves.

446
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,129
Try it.

447
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,939
I don't care if you think I'm a bad mother.

448
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,939
I want to live like a human being even if it's for a day.

449
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,340
Look at this. Cool, right?

450
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,879
Hey! You guys!

451
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,520
I told you to stop, didn't I?

452
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,389
I told you to stop!

453
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,320
Why won't you listen to me?

454
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,560
Why won't you listen...

455
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

456
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,770
Mommy...

457
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:13,639
is tired too.

458
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,149
I just feel suffocated.

459
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:24,448
Have you ever helped her brush her teeth before she went to bed?

460
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,789
Did you stop taking care of your daughter...

461
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,020
after your one-year maternity leave?

462
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:29,158
How come you expect me to take care of everything?

463
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,958
You don't even behave like a mother.

464
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,759
Is it such a disaster that you're taking on more responsibilities?

465
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,799
Must we divide everything right down the middle?

466
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,730
- But I'm doing everything! - What? How...

467
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:39,629
Hey. You...

468
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,310
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,580
I'm sorry. It's all Mommy's fault.

470
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,770
If I do that, do you think I'll have a shot?

471
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,240
Even if we do this, you may end up with custody.

472
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,740
But if we play this by the book,

473
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,879
there's a 99 percent chance that you will be the custodial parent.

474
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,419
Isn't it worth a try?

475
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,020
But if we try this and it doesn't pan out as we want,

476
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:40,659
the kids might end up getting hurt.

477
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,429
Are you sure this is the best option she has?

478
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,439
I've been a longtime fan of yours.

479
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,240
I'll do as you say.

480
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm a mom.

481
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,580
I'm home.

482
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:02,850
Go to your room and sleep.

483
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,350
Jae Hui. Come here.

484
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,689
I can't do this anymore.

485
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,919
Jae Hui cried to sleep again.

486
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,458
She rarely gets to see you on a daily basis.

487
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,000
- How do you call yourself a mother? - Gosh. How could you say that?

488
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:22,139
You thought this was the best for your children, right?

489
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,909
I know what it's like.

490
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,840
I'm a mom too.

491
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,448
- Jae Hui. - What will you do after that?

492
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:36,449
Me?

493
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,418
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

494
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,520
- Bye, Jae Hui. - Bye.

495
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,490
- Give that to me. - It's okay.

496
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,659
You were gone for a long time for the symposium.

497
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,359
You must have gone to Argentina.

498
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,699
So you remember. That's the farthest country from Korea.

499
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,740
I told you that when you were about nine.

500
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,439
You have a great memory.

501
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,810
Right. I do have a great memory.

502
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,750
Did you text your mom that you would be with me?

503
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:06,948
No.

504
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,448
The academy will probably text her soon...

505
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:09,850
that I was absent.

506
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
I see.

507
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:12,689
Get in.

508
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,889
It's nothing serious. Jae Hui will take a day off today.

509
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,889
Yes. You don't need to call her mother.

510
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:20,629
Okay.

511
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:35,010
Where are we going?

512
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,810
There's something I want to do with you.

513
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,290
Come in.

514
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:03,699
Gosh.

515
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,109
It's a mess, isn't it?

516
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,959
Will you live here after the divorce?

517
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,500
In case you didn't know about it,

518
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,800
I came up with...

519
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,770
dozens of excuses to tell you.

520
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,240
But you caught me off guard.

521
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:42,409
You want us to live here?

522
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:43,939
The two of us?

523
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,080
You did that again.

524
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,350
Yes, you're right.

525
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:52,850
I'll work harder, so I can find a better house for us.

526
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,689
I know it's not perfect, but let's live together here.

527
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,629
Or do you want to go on a trip with me while I get the house ready?

528
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,830
You have no intention to make up with Mom, right?

529
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,070
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,990
I don't think we're going to win this case.

531
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,218
The defendant's irresponsibility as a father...

532
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,290
would come to light by the family investigator.

533
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,559
Do you think the judge will let him raise the boys?

534
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,830
That's why we must push before the investigation ends.

535
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,300
On what legal principles?

536
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,000
No legal principles can help in this case.

537
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,439
Only experience will.

538
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,939
I'll take first chair starting with the next hearing. So watch.

539
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,618
Seriously.

540
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:01,859
They gave birth to these beautiful two boys.

541
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,418
How could they fight to avoid raising their own children?

542
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,459
I really don't get that.

543
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:14,570
You don't know what it's like to raise a child, do you?

544
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,070
There's no life of your own.

545
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,810
Being a parent becomes your life.

546
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:27,280
You don't get any time of your own.

547
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,579
Every parent...

548
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,320
Yes, my baby.

549
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,919
experiences losing a sense of their own identity.

550
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:42,060
Kim Ho Seok is experiencing that for the first time in his life.

551
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,270
Some people only learn through personal experience.

552
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,770
But still.

553
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,280
We're using children as a tool to negotiate.

554
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:00,879
Who said we were using them as a tool?

555
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,549
The boys barely got to spend quality time with their dad.

556
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,550
Why don't we think of it as a good bonding opportunity?

557
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:12,459
Okay.

558
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:21,100
Ms. Cha.

559
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,840
Jae Hui...

560
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,339
also needs to bond more...

561
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,840
with her mother before the family investigator begins.

562
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,780
You said you couldn't be there for her when she needed you.

563
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,178
If she says she wants to live with her father...

564
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,419
Ms. Han.

565
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,550
Well,

566
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,148
could you call the plaintiff and find out more...

567
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,060
about the defendant's parents?

568
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay.

569
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,340
Ms. Han.

570
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,070
Yes.

571
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,179
I'll pay more attention to Jae Hui.

572
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,540
I'll do that.

573
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,550
I ought to do so.

574
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,920
- Okay. - Okay.

575
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,000
(Cha Eun Kyung)

576
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:37,508
The defendant cares most about custody.

577
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,908
The absolute time and effort put into caring for the child...

578
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,409
as well as attachment...

579
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,980
is in my client's favor, Your Honor.

580
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Come in.

581
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,759
Eun Kyung. I talked to a reporter I know.

582
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,500
The office husband scandal has run its course for now.

583
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,399
As it should.

584
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,469
The more I think about it, the more shocked I am about it.

585
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,210
- Sorry about that. - Gosh, don't apologize to me.

586
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,210
This must've been harder on you.

587
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,949
- Would you like to go for a walk? - What if people gossip?

588
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:14,549
How dare they?

589
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,580
We've known each other forever.

590
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,190
You must have a lot on your mind about Jae Hui.

591
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:24,989
But don't worry about it.

592
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:29,359
I wasn't concerned about anything,

593
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,429
but this matter with custody...

594
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,130
is making me think a lot.

595
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,569
It feels like I'm on trial as a mother.

596
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,810
Perhaps, I thought I was fulfilling my responsibility...

597
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,880
by making money to feed, clothe, and educate her.

598
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,389
Then...

599
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,158
it crossed my mind if that was the easiest excuse...

600
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,520
I could find to justify my absence as a mother.

601
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,600
No parent can be perfect.

602
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,400
So don't beat yourself up for it.

603
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,600
I've been watching you for over a decade.

604
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:14,369
Your work was your priority. Then you put yourself last.

605
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,480
It was all for Jae Hui.

606
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,610
That's what I thought too.

607
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,080
Why is the feeling of certainty fading?

608
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,319
You showed Jae Hui your commitment to work...

609
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,190
and supported her financially.

610
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,960
Not every parent can accomplish that.

611
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,629
Children are grateful...

612
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,500
simply for having their parents in their lives...

613
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,339
Thanks, Woo Jin.

614
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,080
But...

615
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,278
Why are you still unmarried...

616
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,279
when you have great insight on the subject?

617
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,690
Beats me.

618
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,350
Others' lives are clear to me,

619
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,589
but mine seems to be foggy.

620
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,529
Don't fantasize about certain people.

621
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,199
We're pretty much all alike.

622
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,380
Ma'am, are you looking for something specific?

623
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,689
I'm looking for a bra for someone who'll soon start middle school.

624
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,488
Sure, they're over here.

625
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:35,690
Over there?

626
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,670
Jae Hui.

627
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:51,500
Do you want to see what I got for you?

628
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,679
Ta-da. It's the best one they had in store.

629
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:11,290
I only wear wireless bras.

630
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,690
Regular bras are uncomfortable, so get a refund.

631
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,298
Gosh, bras with wires.

632
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:19,500
I see you find these uncomfortable.

633
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,830
Isn't this removable?

634
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,999
The housekeeper gets me things in the style I like,

635
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,199
so don't be bothered.

636
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,540
You've never bought these things for me.

637
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,250
Right.

638
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,420
Are you still upset about camp day?

639
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,650
What about it?

640
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:42,920
The housekeeper came, which settled things.

641
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,860
Don't be sarcastic with me,

642
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,329
and tell me what you're upset about.

643
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,000
Otherwise, I'm clueless.

644
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,969
I never asked this from you.

645
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,369
Besides, you're way busier these days.

646
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,040
So just go about your work...

647
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,310
like always.

648
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,989
Be honest with me.

649
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,719
By any chance,

650
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:23,799
is this your way of telling me...

651
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,369
that you want to live with your dad?

652
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,569
You're one to talk.

653
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
I know you want me gone.

654
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:35,980
Right?

655
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:38,080
Kim Jae Hui.

656
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,178
When did I ever say that?

657
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,179
Mom.

658
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,759
Don't try to pretend to be Mother of the Year...

659
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:53,460
and give me some time to think!

660
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Don't I also have a choice?

661
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,389
Hey, Jae Hui.

662
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,029
- Bye. - See you.

663
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,500
"Spare me some of your time."

664
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,569
Were you booking an appointment with me?

665
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,069
Be the 13-year-old that you are...

666
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,879
and just ask me if I can come see you.

667
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,909
What an ego.

668
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:21,408
- Aren't you hungry? - I am.

669
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:22,779
How about some tteokbokki?

670
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,819
Really? Your dad also had an affair?

671
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,560
Hey. Blurting it out like that...

672
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,290
kind of embarrasses me.

673
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:35,259
Why do you address me like I'm a child?

674
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:37,900
How else should I address you?

675
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,299
Do as you wish.

676
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,100
How old were you when you found out?

677
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,670
About your dad's affair.

678
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,509
I was in high school.

679
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,509
But even though I'm in my adulthood,

680
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,480
it still stings.

681
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,150
And since you're younger than I was,

682
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,719
it'll sting a little more.

683
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,190
Do you also only see me as a little kid?

684
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,500
You're seriously mature for a girl your age.

685
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,630
However,

686
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:15,270
you are at a tender age.

687
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,540
People always told me...

688
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,409
that I matured faster due to having a busy mom.

689
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:27,080
I never minded that though.

690
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:29,719
I had to do a lot of things by myself.

691
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,318
It sometimes got lonely,

692
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,989
but that helped me be better at those things

693
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,389
Gosh, you're commendable.

694
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,158
When I was a young girl,

695
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,929
my parents said I was mature for my age.

696
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,900
But I'm actually a big girl now,

697
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,170
so it's funny how they're suddenly treating me like a baby.

698
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,540
I see you're upset about the way your parents have been treating you.

699
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,850
You know what? You're right.

700
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,619
You're all grown up.

701
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,449
So don't think too much of it and follow your heart.

702
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,989
Since you're my mom's attorney,

703
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:17,130
you must want me to say that I wish to live with her.

704
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:21,529
It's not like that.

705
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:25,639
No matter which parent you choose to live with,

706
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,079
I only want you to be happy.

707
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,239
That's all.

708
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,350
If I choose one parent,

709
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,750
the other will be heartbroken.

710
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,619
Regardless of who's at fault,

711
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,460
they're still both my parents.

712
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,830
Don't think about things like that.

713
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:52,799
Your parents will be fine as long as you are.

714
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:57,000
You're their everything.

715
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:07,710
Don't agonize over it.

716
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,219
Dig in.

717
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,060
- Dad! - Dad!

718
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,799
- When will she get here? - When will she get here?

719
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,729
- Dad. - Gosh.

720
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,169
- When will she get here? - When will she get here?

721
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,028
- Dad! - Dad!

722
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:30,670
- The policeman will tell you off. - When will Mom get here?

723
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,209
- Guys, please. - Dad, when will Mom get here?

724
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,239
Bailiff.

725
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,679
What did I tell you about the police officer?

726
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,209
- Dad. - Please leave with the children.

727
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,350
- Dad... - We're sorry.

728
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,448
- Let's hurry out of here. - Dad.

729
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,350
- Dad. - I said you'd be told off.

730
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,659
(Plaintiff)

731
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,690
Your Honor.

732
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,159
You saw them.

733
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:55,859
The children desperately want to see their mother,

734
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,229
but she hasn't come by to see them.

735
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,699
How can a woman like her call herself their mother?

736
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,138
The children were sent to the father...

737
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:07,770
due to an unexpected car accident.

738
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,509
I'll do as you say.

739
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,179
Text your husband...

740
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,380
that you can't pick the children up due to a car accident.

741
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,750
Tell him to pick them up at 2:40pm.

742
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,588
Drive your car...

743
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:22,420
into something in the parking lot to damage it.

744
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:25,459
You must have him take care of the children...

745
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,630
for days to come.

746
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:30,360
That is also why she isn't present in court today.

747
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,459
She is still recovering from the accident...

748
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,100
and in no shape to care for the children.

749
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,099
Also, she does not have the financial means...

750
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,509
to care for them after the divorce...

751
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,809
because she was forced to leave the workplace for ten years...

752
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,610
so that she can raise the children.

753
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,209
Your Honor, this is an elaborate scheme...

754
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,309
that was designed to make her seem unfit as a primary carer.

755
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,948
If you look at Exhibit 15 that we submitted,

756
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:54,218
the plaintiff was recently diagnosed with depression.

757
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,019
And I was diagnosed with alcohol dependence.

758
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,658
If you look at Exhibit 16 which states one's list of crimes,

759
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:04,229
the plaintiff was punished for theft ten years ago.

760
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,629
And I have gotten behind the wheel while drunk multiple times.

761
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,229
Hold on a second.

762
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,439
Can't you raise children if you have kleptomania?

763
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,798
Can't you raise children...

764
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:13,209
if you have driven under the influence before?

765
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,309
Of course. Drunk driving will put children in harm's way...

766
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,710
and can hurt them...

767
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:19,810
Enough.

768
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,818
- What is the meaning of this? - But she...

769
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:25,779
Are you battling to see who's the worst parent?

770
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,549
Is this court a joke to you?

771
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,230
I apologize.

772
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,360
But Your Honor.

773
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,499
Yes, Ms. Cha.

774
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,169
(Plaintiff)

775
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,699
The defendant's parents...

776
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:48,009
as in the grandparents of the children in question,

777
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:50,239
used to be educators.

778
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,549
They were even given awards during their careers.

779
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,650
They seem like a great choice to be granted secondary custody.

780
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:00,888
Ms. Han. Well,

781
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,959
could you call the plaintiff and find out more...

782
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,860
about the defendant's parents?

783
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:07,088
- She's dragging... - No way.

784
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:08,790
- my parents into this? - That's how far she's taking it.

785
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:10,600
Unbelievable.

786
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,399
My parents weren't given those awards...

787
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,399
so that they could raise their grandchildren.

788
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,599
Isn't she a piece of work?

789
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,040
- Enough. - But...

790
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:23,540
The next hearing will be a negotiation.

791
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:25,080
Please try and settle.

792
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:26,949
Sure thing.

793
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,349
I hope that the defendant will strongly consider...

794
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,389
being the primary carer for his children.

795
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,618
You took the words out of my mouth. Tell the mother...

796
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,889
to raise her own brats.

797
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,658
Are you saying those brats aren't yours?

798
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:41,560
Who are you referring to as brats?

799
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,599
Order!

800
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,230
(Defendant)

801
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,239
Gosh. Mom!

802
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,139
Over here.

803
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:02,819
Mom.

804
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,319
Mom!

805
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:07,588
- Mom. - Goodness.

806
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,889
- It's pouring. - Mom.

807
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:10,319
I didn't know you'd come.

808
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,559
Gosh, Mom.

809
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,589
- Mom. - Over here.

810
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:14,659
Mom!

811
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,159
- Mom! - It's cold, isn't it?

812
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:17,860
Mom.

813
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:19,500
Bye.

814
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:21,600
- Dad! - Where are you headed?

815
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,650
(2 unread messages)

816
00:48:39,819 --> 00:48:40,819
Jae Hui.

817
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,989
I apologize for raising my voice at you yesterday.

818
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,259
(1 unread message)

819
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,630
I miss you, my daughter.

820
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,600
Don't you miss me too?

821
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,730
But no one's here to pick me up.

822
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,560
That we could get together.

823
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:19,830
Sorry, Mr. Jun.

824
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:24,130
I'd like this to be the last time we touch on the topic.

825
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,130
Just friends.

826
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,449
You said it was crucial to establish yourself.

827
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:43,049
Did you mean that as getting a seat at the convenience store?

828
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,719
What are you talking about?

829
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:49,790
And to me, finding my place is more important.

830
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:52,929
You're laughing?

831
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,330
You said I was fun to hang out with,

832
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:56,929
but here you are all by yourself.

833
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,759
Well...

834
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,270
It was late to call you out.

835
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,600
Excuse me, Ms. Han, but we're still colleagues.

836
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,310
Whether it's day or night, I don't really care,

837
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:11,040
so call me anytime.

838
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,480
Gosh.

839
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,719
Ms. Cha and her husband are both fighting for custody,

840
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:23,119
but the client we represented today...

841
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,360
and her husband both want to give it up.

842
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,330
Today's court session was a total mess.

843
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,000
They were both adamant about not winning custody.

844
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,600
My head's still spinning because of it.

845
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:39,339
I see you have to be two-faced.

846
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,170
I've been down that road before.

847
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:44,779
Even friends can say that they love each other.

848
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,080
The defendants are strictly friends of the opposite sex,

849
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:48,650
not lovers.

850
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,679
Transform.

851
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,588
How does it make sense for two friends of the opposite sex...

852
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:56,489
to text each other at night when they're both married?

853
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,630
I found it entertaining.

854
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:04,230
Transform.

855
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,529
- You find it entertaining? - Yes.

856
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:15,170
Specializing in divorce doesn't seem right for me.

857
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:20,810
I don't know how I should be judging what is right or wrong.

858
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,178
The corporate department is where...

859
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:27,190
Again with the corporate department. It's getting old.

860
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,388
Besides, there's no right or wrong when it comes to relationships.

861
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:33,029
Only the parties involved can tell that apart.

862
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,799
Is that what you believe?

863
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,500
Kim Ji Sang had an affair...

864
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,699
while Kim Ho Seok thinks of his children as parcels.

865
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,810
Trusting those men with the future of their children?

866
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,839
It's certain that shouldn't be allowed.

867
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:51,409
How is that not "right?"

868
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,080
I don't know.

869
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,718
Isn't there a limit to us judging what's right...

870
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,219
even in those cases?

871
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,619
I should also have some beer.

872
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:11,360
Who's calling?

873
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,199
I'm taking off.

874
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,270
What? Just like that?

875
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:21,610
Hey!

876
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:25,380
Seriously?

877
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,449
Was it a guy?

878
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,799
Do you know how long it's been...

879
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,730
since I've been out at this time of night...

880
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,839
drinking beer while staring at this godforsaken grill?

881
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,339
Well...

882
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,869
I'm not sure.

883
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:57,679
Five years.

884
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,549
Five years?

885
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,850
Can you believe that?

886
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,249
How so?

887
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,420
Isn't it obvious?

888
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,049
I was too busy raising my kids.

889
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:11,460
I don't have any siblings,

890
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,330
and my parents live far away,

891
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,360
so I had no one to babysit.

892
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,630
I couldn't even see a doctor while running a fever.

893
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,139
You have had it rough,

894
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,409
but how about...

895
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:34,980
you muster the strength to keep raising the children?

896
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,049
I came here today...

897
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,618
so that I could ask you that.

898
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:40,889
Ms. Han.

899
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,589
Will my being there for them guarantee them a good life?

900
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:47,529
Will my love be enough?

901
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:50,360
Their father doesn't earn any money, so I should instead.

902
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:53,130
I'll send the children away,

903
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,730
treat my depression,

904
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,139
and get a job.

905
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:02,369
I'll raise all the money I can while they're with their father.

906
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:06,080
I want...

907
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,509
to raise them well.

908
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,750
Also,

909
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,020
I want to find...

910
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:21,389
who I am and was.

911
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:34,339
I learned that all the parents in this world...

912
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,979
show love for their children...

913
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,338
- in the best way they can... - Come on. Let's eat.

914
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:42,580
by doing what can be done in their situation.

915
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,420
To that,

916
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,389
I couldn't dare to say anything else.

917
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,389
All I could do...

918
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:55,489
was pour her another drink.

919
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:01,629
(Seoul Family Court)

920
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,630
Defendant.

921
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,539
Are you still against the divorce?

922
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,540
(Defendant)

923
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,409
(Plaintiff)

924
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,509
Yes, for whose sake?

925
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,349
Even if the divorce is not approved,

926
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,948
the plaintiff has no intention to stay with the defendant...

927
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,989
and plans to continue staying at her parents' house.

928
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:25,818
So basically if I don't divorce her, she won't take the children...

929
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:27,129
with her. Is that it?

930
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,330
- It's either a divorce or nothing. - You got it.

931
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,639
What if I divorce her?

932
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,270
If you agree to divorce her,

933
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,509
we suggest you have the custody of the children,

934
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,210
and the plaintiff...

935
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:50,949
will look after the children every weekend.

936
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,718
So, the plaintiff's agreement is that...

937
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,190
if he agrees to divorce her,

938
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,359
the father will watch the children on weekdays,

939
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,388
and the mother on weekends.

940
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:02,059
Is that right?

941
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,560
Yes, she's available from Friday night.

942
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,830
So from Friday night, the defendant is...

943
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:11,440
free to drink without any restraints.

944
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,449
Okay.

945
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:31,060
He'll accept it. I'm sure.

946
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,488
Right. Now that he can drink from Friday to Sunday,

947
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:36,429
he might fall for that and sign it.

948
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,080
(Defendant)

949
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,789
I'm still paying for this watch.

950
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,520
You wouldn't ask for it back, right?

951
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,020
Take it and leave.

952
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,789
Be nice to our kids.

953
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,159
Watch your mouth.

954
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,960
(Plaintiff)

955
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,099
The massage chair we bought recently.

956
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,599
There's still a lot to pay off.

957
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,568
- I saw that you loved it. - Yes, it was very nice.

958
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:22,409
It's so refreshing. That's what I live for.

959
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,380
You can keep it.

960
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:40,659
(Defendant)

961
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:53,770
Seriously, the massage chair? Isn't that so cheap?

962
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:57,339
Because he didn't want to divorce. He was acting stupid.

963
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,209
How is that acting stupid?

964
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,209
I bet he realized how tough it is to raise children...

965
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,580
by himself.

966
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,718
Because he knew the divorce would only cause him a loss,

967
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,719
he clung to even the minor things.

968
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,060
Thanks to your strategy,

969
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,730
Choi Yeon Seo was able to divorce him.

970
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:24,440
And her children will be loved by both parents.

971
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,239
I learned a lot from you.

972
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,480
Gosh.

973
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:35,379
I can't believe someone would agree to it just to drink.

974
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,420
Kim Ho Seok didn't agree to it, so he could drink.

975
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,420
While he's with his children, he can finally play his father role.

976
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,290
And I got him that chance.

977
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,289
Oh, check this out.

978
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,488
Humans are stupid animals that are clueless...

979
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:52,230
until they experience it.

980
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,730
- Did you think that far? - Why won't it work?

981
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:56,170
- It's not working. - Boys!

982
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,540
- Mom. - Guys.

983
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,369
How are you?

984
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,738
You got even cuter.

985
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,809
Will you get off on time on Fridays?

986
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,310
Why didn't you just leave them by the door again?

987
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,679
You think that's funny?

988
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,020
You look well.

989
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:15,319
Are you happy now that you're divorced?

990
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
Of course, I am.

991
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,158
Are you in a rush to get a drink on Friday night?

992
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:20,159
Of course.

993
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,629
- Ho Seok. - Hey.

994
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,060
- Yeon Seo. - Yeon Seo.

995
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:26,729
We're back on it.

996
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,400
Oh, my babies.

997
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,368
Yeon Seo, will you give us likes...

998
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:31,999
- Subscribe. - and set the notification alarm?

999
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,670
Gosh, good luck.

1000
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,170
- Bye, guys. - Let's go.

1001
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,178
- Say bye to Dad. - For some parents,

1002
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,380
it takes them a divorce to become one.

1003
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:41,178
- You boys. - And for others,

1004
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:43,250
they need a very long time.

1005
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:46,449
- There are many immature... - What do you want to eat?

1006
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:48,850
- and lacking parents like that. - Cake.

1007
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,690
Dad was here.

1008
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:06,600
- What's this? - What else?

1009
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:08,739
Dad decorated my room.

1010
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:11,880
Were you going to keep it a secret from me?

1011
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:16,949
I want to decide who I'm going to live with.

1012
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,719
I'm all grown up now. I can make that decision.

1013
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,630
- Why transferred, not fired? - That's what I mean.

1014
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:33,329
- I bet she talked him into it. - It doesn't make any sense.

1015
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,229
- Hello. - This is absurd.

1016
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,468
- That wouldn't work on him. - They're basically best friends.

1017
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:38,500
I know.

1018
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,170
- Hello. - Hello.

1019
01:00:44,779 --> 01:00:45,980
Have you checked?

1020
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,509
Congratulations.

1021

(Personnel Appointment Notice)

(Choi Sa Ra to Chief Manager)

1023
01:01:01,529 --> 01:01:03,158
Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra?

1024
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,159
Yes?

1025
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,299
If I do my best, will I become the chief manager one day?

1026
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:15,869
Why do you want to become the chief manager?

1027
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,409
It's not like your salary's going to double or triple.

1028
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,880
I want my own room.

1029
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,319
Your office?

1030
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,319
I was raised in Haenam.

1031
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:29,949
Ever since I watched drama as a child,

1032
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:31,888
I dreamed of becoming a career woman...

1033
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,960
who has her own office in Gangnam.

1034
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:38,199
I've always wanted to have an office with my name on it...

1035
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,469
just like you.

1036
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:43,170
Will I ever have that day?

1037

(Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra)

1038
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,969
I became the chief manager.

1039
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:21,310
I even got my own room.

1040
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,690
Your dream finally came true.

1041
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:39,060
No need to go back in.

1042
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:41,429
Sorry?

Chief Manager Choi Sa Ra.

1045
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:51,170
You're fired.

1046
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,889
(Good Partner)

1047
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,249
I was so happy to see you on TV.

1048
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,920
What on earth are you doing here?

1049
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,529
How can you forget your client?

1050
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:49,859
Accept my dad's mistress' case?

1051
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,730
If you refuse to get a divorce, who would recognize that?

1052
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,100
Let me make a suggestion.

1053
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,729
Fire Han Yu Ri immediately.

1054
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,599
I told you not to mess with my daughter.

1055
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,969
You know what Han Yu Ri is like.

1056
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:02,409
It'll turn into a complete mess.

1057
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:03,739
Will you be okay with that?
