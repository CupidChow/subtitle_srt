 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,550
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,070
 Child actors were filmed in a safe environment. 

9
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,720
Attorney Cha?

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,650
Your shallow sense of duty and pathetic sense of justice...

11
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,180
I love them.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,560
- Sorry?
 - You take my case, Attorney Han.

 Complaint 

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,740
 Plaintiff: Cha Eun Gyeong, Defendant: Choi Sa Ra 

15
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,790
You've been preparing all this time?

16
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,580
This is what I do for a living. Wouldn't I have at least collected evidence?

17
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,220
You said you won't get a divorce.

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,500
I collected them so I don't get a divorce.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,910
Because the spouse at fault can't apply for divorce, as you know.

20
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,550
I was going to block the divorce with this evidence.

21
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,740
But you saw it with your own eyes, huh?

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,110
 After I saw them in person, 

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,540
my resolve from the last few months became nothing in one moment.

24
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,400
It must've been hard.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,220
I'm Cha Eun Gyeong.

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,680
I don't need consolation.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,120
What do you want me to do, then?

28
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,970
Let's show them the most perfect divorce show to ever exist.

29
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,960
Sorry? A-A divorce show?

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,240
Trial in court or trial by media are all shows

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,440
where you connect the dots with the evidence anyway, right?

32
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,530
Let's do it properly.

This is a delivery from the court.

36
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,030
Who is Choi Sa Ra?

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,880
Yes?

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,750
It's me.

 Plaintiff: Cha Eun Gyeong, Defendant: Choi Sa Ra 

42
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,050
Attorney Cha is coming!

43
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,430
Sa Ra, come to my office. We've got to talk, right?

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,610
Yes.

45
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,270
Just leave it.

46
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,820
Sit.

47
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,550
So, what do you plan to do?

48
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,970
- Sorry?
 - The complaint.

49
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,310
You've seen countless reply pleadings.

50
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,600
How do you plan to respond to this case?

51
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,130
Do I have to tell you that, Attorney Cha?

52
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,380
Tell me what conclusion you were thinking of or the plan you had.

53
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,310
I'm just curious.

54
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,580
I don't have any plans.

55
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,090
- We were just—
 - Just what?

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,400
Were you going to say you were in love and stuff?

57
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
Really?

58
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,020
I'll quit my job.

59
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,410
I know how much you love this company, Sa Ra.

60
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,130
You don't need to do that.

61
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,880
- At this point—
 - Just work.

62
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,990
Since you're good at your job.

63
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,920
Oh, the promotion review is coming up.

64
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,120
I thought you didn't like me.

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
Why?

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,980
Are you happy because it feels like you're finally getting acknowledged?

67
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,110
But why did you...

68
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,030
keep calling me by my first name?

69
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,660
Everyone calls me Chief Choi.

70
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,230
Is that important right now?

71
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,750
Since when did you know?

72
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,180
Gosh, I knew you'd say that line.

73
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Adulterers always ask the same thing.

74
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,780
I guess they just have to know, huh?

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,240
I don't think I deserve to hear that, so I'll be taking my leave.

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,760
Weren't you an adulterer, Honey?

77
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,270
I'm sure you know better than I do,

78
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,130
but you two were already strangers, more or less.

79
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,940
Rather, you were worse than strangers.

80
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,480
Do you go to an after-school academy or something?

81
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,950
Where do you learn such identical lines?

 Court of the Republic of Korea, Electronic Complaint

 Plaintiff: Cha Eun Gyeong, Defendant: Kim Ji Sang
 Complaint for Divorce and Request for Alimony 

84
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,830
-  Hey. 
 - What's this?

85
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,460
You got it at the same time somehow.

86
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,200
You two must be a perfect couple.

87
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,500
- What the heck did you do?
 - Hey, shouldn't I be saying that?

88
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,390
Since when did you know?

89
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,430
You're also curious about that, huh?

90
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,290
Is this something like that?

91
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,440
The desperation and anger of criminals who wished to commit the perfect crime?

92
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,030
Did you install a CCTV in my office or something?

93
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,530
 Is that why you told me to become your law firm's advisor? 

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,910
You were a creative man, weren't you?

95
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,300
I'm getting really sick of you.

96
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,200
 Thank you for proving my decision was right and that it was right to let you go. 

97
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,710
Excuse me.

98
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,980
Please don't call me. Call my attorney.

99
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,450
 Attorney? 

100
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,710
Did you go tattle on me to Jeong Wu Jin?

101
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,520
What?

102
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,180
Hello.

103
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,200
Hello.

104
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,610
Attorney Han, you're here.

105
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,790
Hello. By the way, is something wrong?

106
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,300
Sa Ra has received a complaint from the court.

107
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,230
Is that so?

108
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,580
However, she was taken to Attorney Cha's office as soon as she got the complaint.

109
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,220
And she came out with a bright red face.

110
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,290
What could it be?

111
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,180
She must've been scolded.

112
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:47,210
Attorney Cha is just too good at hurting people's feelings.

113
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,560
You must keep this to yourself, okay?

114
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,530
There's a rumor that Sa Ra is the other woman.

115
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,280
Gosh! Watch what you say.

116
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,260
You know this can be considered defamation, right?

117
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,010
 I collected them so I don't get a divorce. 

118
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,200
 Because the spouse at fault can't apply for a divorce, as you know. 

119
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,340
 I was going to block the divorce with this evidence. 

120
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,250
 After I saw them in person, 

121
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,040
 my resolve from the last few months became nothing in one moment. 

122
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,970
Attorney Cha.

123
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,320
By the way, of all people why does it have to be me?

124
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,490
You didn't really like how I process lawsuits.

125
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,980
Why does everyone think that I don't like them?

126
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,560
Because I only got into conflicts with you?

127
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,860
As you know, I don't really need an attorney.

128
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Because I'm the best at divorce.

129
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:03,670
Are you doing this so I can't quit, then?

130
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,200
However...

131
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,110
I do need you, Attorney Han.

132
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,320
Why do you need me?

133
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
Because you're different from me.

134
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,800
You've got a different perspective and opinion from me.

135
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,730
Your method is different, too.

136
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,080
Well, let's just say I needed balance.

137
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,270
It's almost time for a VIP consultation.

138
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,520
- Let's go.
 - Right now?

139
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,820
We're defending a division of property request for the CEO of a listed company.

140
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,990
It's a case you must try, right?

141
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,180
She wants half of our shares!

142
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,080
I worked my bones off to get this company listed.

143
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,330
The plaintiff is living abroad?

144
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,380
I've lived as a wild-goose dad* for ten years.
 (Family lives abroad with dad providing financial support for child's education.)

145
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,280
I worked like a slave to send them money for ten years.

146
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,680
I even got them an apartment in Manhattan, NY.

147
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,580
The older one is an adult now, so he earns his own money.

148
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,410
The youngest will be an adult soon, too.

149
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,680
She keeps asking for more, using the kids as an excuse.

150
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,340
You lived thirteen out of the 23 years of marriage together

151
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,050
and lived as a wild-goose dad for ten years, right?

152
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,610
Yes, that's right. But we already agreed to part ways about five years ago.

153
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,040
You didn't make an agreement regarding that matter, did you?

154
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,440
I should've made one.

155
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,470
I think there must've been a reason you decided to live as strangers.

156
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,720
What happened in the past?

157
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,080
I couldn't get physical evidence,

158
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,100
but there was something like an affair.

159
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,120
I told you it's not.

160
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,420
Do you have delusional jealousy or something?

161
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,310
I wasn't going to say this.

162
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,880
But the rumor is all over the Korean churches

163
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,840
 that you two are always together, arm in arm! 

164
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,530
I told you he's just a friend!

165
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,280
-  Do you have proof?  
- Should I go to the U.S. to find a witness?

166
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,020
 Let's just separate. 

167
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,540
- What?
 - I can't live like this.

168
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,060
I clearly told you it's not.

169
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,080
If you can't believe me, we have to part ways.

170
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,020
 Let's end things between you and me. 

171
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,150
Do you mean it? You want to get a divorce?

172
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,720
 I don't want to live with a man who doubts his wife anymore. 

173
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,150
There are a few years until the kids go to college.

174
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,370
So we'll do the paperwork, then.

175
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,190
Let's just separate in advance.

176
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,340
At this rate, weren't you actually hoping I'd catch you with a man?

177
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,530
 And if I did have an affair, 

178
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,790
that's also your fault.

179
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,470
Because you made me lonely.

180
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,490
And she changed her mind after your company went public, huh?

181
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,270
As if your marriage has continued peacefully.

182
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,790
She must've gotten greedy because a big fortune was within reach.

183
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,060
But I don't really have to give her half of the shares, do I?

184
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,730
The plaintiff will claim the shares need to be split evenly 50/50

185
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,100
since you've been married for 23 years.

186
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,330
We'll claim that the shares can't be considered eligible for division of property because

187
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,360
the company went public after you agreed to live as strangers.

188
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,730
Winning or losing depends on evidence.

189
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,370
Did you visit each other after that?

190
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,600
Well, I did travel to and fro.

191
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,410
But I went to see the kids during their vacation. I barely even talked to her.

192
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,260
And I couldn't even go recently because of COVID.

193
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,750
Lawsuits are 100% a battle of evidence.

194
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,540
Your wife will probably bring up your travel records

195
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,970
and say you did visit the U.S.

196
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,630
She'll say you maintained a normal marriage life.

197
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,750
A lawsuit is connecting the dots between pieces of evidence.

198
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,580
I didn't go to see her, though.

199
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,160
What do I do? It was really difficult to build this company.

200
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
If I give her those shares, the company will go bankrupt.

201
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,300
Please protect my—,  no, please protect our company.

202
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,080
Summarize the main issue.

203
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,500
Whether the length of their marriage is perceived as 23 or 18 years,

204
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,850
determines whether the public shares are subject  to the division of property in this case.

205
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,370
How can we prove it?

206
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,790
First, we'll request a verification statement from the mobile carrier

207
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,190
and prove they didn't have any contact for five years—

208
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,420
They might've called often to discuss their kids.

209
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,290
So, can it be evidence that the marriage is broken?

210
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,830
That's only if there are records.

211
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,250
If the mobile carrier has no records at all,

212
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,730
can't it be used as circumstantial evidence to say they didn't have any contact—

213
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,690
First, mobile carriers don't provide verification statements these days.

214
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,710
Is that the only evidence you thought of?

215
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,740
In that case,

216
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,010
why don't we request that Jang Hyeon Seong's parents be witnesses?

217
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,160
Jang Hyeon Seong said he has lived with his mother more or less for the last five years.

218
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,080
The skin is nearer than the skirt.

219
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,550
If we submit his parents' testimony as evidence, do you think the judge would believe it?

220
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,780
Also, why is living with his mom evidence of a marriage breakdown?

221
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,180
His wife is living abroad.

222
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,050
I don't have any other way I can think of right now.

223
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,280
So, I'll give it some more thought.

224
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,110
Remember what I said during the special lecture?

225
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,280
Find a brilliant idea from the client's venting.

226
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,190
 Let me go, so I can think. 

227
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,470
You're an attorney now, not a student.

228
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,470
So you can't keep thinking inside the box.

229
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,190
How will you take care of my case like this?

230
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,210
Try to be creative.

231
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,120
You got it?

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,430
- Yes, I got it.
 - Okay.

233
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,850
Why did you come to me for a divorce and compensation for damages case?

234
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,780
I mainly deal with criminal cases.

235
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,770
My wife is Cha Eun Gyeong.

236
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,360
Who's Cha Eun Gyeong?

237
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,320
Did she become famous for going through multiple divorces?

238
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,770
She's a divorce attorney.

239
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,780
We came here because if we went to someone

240
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,540
who knew Cha Eun Gyeong, they might turn against us.

241
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,680
Is that attorney from Daejeong that famous?

242
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,940
I looked at the complaint and ...

243
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,690
you had an affair right under the lamp, huh?

244
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,680
They hadn't slept together for a while and weren't even a couple anymore.

245
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,800
They were married on paper, but they were the equivalent of strangers.

246
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,010
And I met him when their marriage was already broken.

247
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,420
If the mom only worked to make money, who took care of the kid?

248
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,710
I raised her all by myself.

249
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,360
The child also likes me more than her mom.

250
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,180
This isn't a normal family, as you can see.

251
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,770
I guess she was arrogant for making some money, huh?

252
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,690
Women always get so arrogant the moment they make some money.

253
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,910
Even so, the evidence of adultery is too strong.

254
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,810
It's too strong. Okay?

255
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,920
You're quite bold, contrary to how you seem.

256
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,510
Since you lived together for about fifteen years, it'd be simple if you just

257
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,820
split what you have in half and sign it off to end it.

258
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,340
I want to take custody for sure.

259
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,860
Would it still be simple?

260
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,440
Why would a man bother to raise the kid?

261
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,540
The mom should raise the kid.

262
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,920
Attorney, please finish it with a settlement agreement.

263
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,350
Do you sincerely want to bring Jae Hui?

264
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,500
Of course. She's my daughter.

265
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,260
 Schedule 

266
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,180
Your Honor, the plaintiff and the defendant of this case are not a wild-goose couple.

267
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,770
If they aren't a wild-goose couple, then...

268
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,070
they're a separated couple.

269
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,470
Yes, you may continue your presentation.

270
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,990
A wild-goose couple can't help but live separately

271
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,150
due to circumstances, though their marriage is maintained.

272
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,010
A separated couple are strangers who are living separately

273
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,140
because their marriage has already broken down.

274
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,940
So, you're saying they're financially separated, right?

275
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,240
Yes, the two of them haven't talked about things other than their children and

276
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,900
they didn't have any sexual relations for years either.

277
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,780
We used to be close to each other.

278
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,460
People were always surprised how good things were

279
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,430
between us while living separately for so long.

280
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,110
Hey, Kim Sae Hui!

281
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,850
Your Honor, that's all a lie!

282
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,360
She's doing that for money! It's a complete show.

283
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,120
We lived like strangers since five years ago!

284
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,770
Sit down, please. Sit.

285
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,890
Your Honor, the Defendant's company was publicly listed three months ago

286
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,420
and its shares' value increased more than ten times.

287
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,420
The plaintiff is making a false claim to lengthen their marriage

288
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,460
to make the stock subject to the division of property.

289
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,620
They say it takes one to know one.

290
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,940
 Plaintiff 

291
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,550
Your Honor, the kids' dad is the one lying because of money.

292
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,350
He doesn't want to lose his money,

293
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,800
so he's lying and saying we separated and didn't have any intercourse.

294
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
You even cheated on me! Want me to spill it?

295
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,370
Why do you keep putting on a show?

296
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,220
You're the one putting on a show.

297
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,250
You're lying in court.

298
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,340
Do you have proof?

299
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,650
Your Honor, the adultery claim doesn't even deserve a response.

300
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,090
For them to say the two have been separated already,

301
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,920
he has been paying considerable amounts of money for living expenses.

302
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,960
That's true. It even shows you stayed in the U.S.

303
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,810
for two to three days per year in the travel records up until two years ago.

304
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,650
But you've been strangers from five years ago? And were separated?

305
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,240
You need to show me the evidence.

306
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,020
Yes, we'll prepare it by the next hearing date.

307
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,550
I'll see you on the next hearing date, then.

308
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,360
Is what the other attorney said true?

309
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,800
Are you sending your wife money?

310
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,260
Yes, naturally.

311
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,260
I send about 25 million won per month for living expenses.

312
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,350
T-Twenty five million won? That much?

313
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,850
Cut it off all at once.

314
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,900
H-How is she going to live, then?

315
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,490
She'll have to figure it out.

316
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,120
She'll use her savings.

317
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,340
Isn't that too irresponsible?

318
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,630
She might turn to the kids if she needs money.

319
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,010
You said "naturally" just now, right?

320
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,550
Is it natural to provide your kids and your wife plenty of money for living expenses,

321
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,810
buy her a home in Manhattan,

322
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,570
and send her tons of money for living expenses after breaking up?

323
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,020
It's what I've been doing all this time.

324
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,940
Is that so?

325
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,500
In that case, isn't it also natural to give her half of the shares of the listed company?

326
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,000
That's a different story!

327
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,550
Is doing my duty as the head of a household

328
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,060
and the company going public after breaking up the same?

329
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,150
"Head of household" and "duty."

330
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,430
You locked yourself up with those words,

331
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,960
trained the other party for twenty years so she'd consider it natural,

332
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,730
and if you tell her you can't give her half of your shares,

333
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,460
wouldn't she actually find it ridiculous?

334
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,900
W-Well...

335
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,560
what you said is correct, but...

336
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,040
Yes, you're right. I'm sure I wanted to be acknowledged as a head of household.

337
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,410
But is that a bad thing?

338
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,120
Would I have thought things would get this bad?

339
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,900
Accept that you're not family anymore...

340
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,450
Rather, accept that you're not the head of household...

341
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,960
anymore.

342
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,600
Ms. Park, is there any other case overlapping with Jang Hyeon Seong's trial date?

343
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,400
Including other attorneys' cases.

344
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,750
Great, say I have to go to the trial in Daegu, then.

345
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:53,500
And request a postponement of the hearing date to Jang Hyeon Seong's judge to delay it.

346
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,330
Why are you delaying the trial date?

347
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,190
His youngest will become an adult soon.

348
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,300
You didn't calculate when it'll be?

349
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,430
It's about three weeks later.

350
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,460
That's why I delayed it to after that.

351
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,530
You should've caught on to this first and checked the birthday.

352
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,590
Is it because the judges are reluctant to accept a minor's testimony?

353
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,880
Now, you realized it?

354
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,640
The oldest is in the U.S. and hard to reach, so contact the youngest.

355
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,130
Yes. I got it.

356
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,040
By the way, Attorney Cha,

357
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,200
I got a car as you told me to.

358
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,400
You don't need to give me rides starting today.

359
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,090
Okay.

360
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,260
Yes, Teacher. How are you? I'm sorry!

361
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,780
Yes, you said there's no shuttle today.

362
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,550
Oh, but my next appointment is...

363
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,440
Yes, well...

364
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,670
One moment, please.

365
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,060
Yes, I'll call you back.

366
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,870
Attorney Han, I'm really sorry, but can I ask you for a favor?

367
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,130
 No way. 

368
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,470
It's Jae Hui's field day today, so I have to go get her myself.

369
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,860
But it slipped my mind.

370
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,780
Please give her a ride to the after-school academy just once.

371
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,600
Me?

372
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,700
I have no one else to ask.

373
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,150
W-Well, c-can't Jae Hui's dad do it?

374
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,790
Attorney Han, you didn't forget you're my attorney, right?

375
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,250
The mom asks the dad to pick up the kid in the middle of a lawsuit?

376
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,380
Should I give them an upper hand?

377
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,710
I-If you delay your appointment just a bit—

378
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,420
I need to go into a VIP meeting right away.

379
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,970
You're free in the afternoon. Please help me out just once.

380
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,310
It's just once! I'll text you the address.

381
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,400
And you can go home right after. Thank you!

382
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,810
A-Attorney Cha!

383
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,580
You came five minutes late, so my schedule is a bit vague now.

384
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,290
I wanted to rest a bit.

385
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,910
What? Oh, the time. The time?

386
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,980
Could you pull it together and focus on driving, please?

387
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,870
Also, it's interesting for an attorney to lose track of time.

388
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,510
What? Wh-What did you say?

389
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,970
You don't even have a decent watch.

390
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,710
Forget it. Please just drive safely.

391
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,190
 Buy a car first. Buy a watch, too. 

392
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,510
 To an attorney, time is life. Check it all the time. 

393
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,480
 Daejeong is a major law firm that ranks among the top three. 

394
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,420
 We charge more than three times and get paid three times more than other places. 

395
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,710
 So, you need to use your work hours at three times the efficiency, too. 

396
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,290
 To do that, your own car and comfortable shoes are essential. 

397
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,890
You're Little Cha Eun Gyeong, huh?

398
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,380
I'm Little Kim Ji Sang!

399
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm nothing like my mom.

400
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,980
You're just like your mom.

401
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,760
Aunt Sa Ra used to come on field days.

402
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,800
Is she busy?

403
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,630
Yes, Aunt Sa Ra is really busy.

404
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,160
So, what are Mom and Dad going to do?

405
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,540
What? A-About what?

406
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,390
The divorce.

407
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,770
D-Divorce?

408
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,890
- Who said that?
 - How can I not know?

409
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,350
When your dad suddenly doesn't return from a business trip or

410
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,410
when your mom goes to live in Hawaii for a month,

411
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,720
all of those families actually end up getting divorced.

412
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,550
I don't know anything.

413
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,830
So, you'll have to ask your mom directly, Jae Hui.

414
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,890
Know nothing, my foot. You know everything.

415
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,080
I really don't know.

416
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,770
There's no way since you came to pick me up.

417
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,400
You really are a lot like your mom.

418
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,650
- All right, now. Cheers. 
- Cheers.

419
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,350
Now, it's pork rinds and beer today.

420
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,520
Hey, wait up now. Try one of the pork rinds.

421
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,150
It's really delicious.

422
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,150
Wow, pick up from school, huh? That's daebak.

423
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,780
I can pick her up from school ten times, no problem.

424
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,740
Attorney Han, you'll be an at-fluencer now!

425
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,790
- What does that mean?
 - You really don't know?

426
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,110
It's attorney plus influencer.

427
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,620
Attorney Cha is a superstar before she's an attorney, as you know.

428
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,710
And if you represent Attorney Cha,

429
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,650
you're bound to become famous with her, Attorney Han.

430
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,460
Is that so?

431
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,190
Man, you're becoming too successful.

432
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,260
Are you starting to look down on me now?

433
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,410
At-fluencer, my foot!

434
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,900
Am I a babysitter?

435
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,120
- Should I report her to the labor department?
 - W-Whoa, you can't.

436
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,690
If you don't want to do it, I'll do it.

437
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,910
I can pick up Attorney Cha's daughter as many times as she wants

438
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,880
if I can become famous.

439
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,570
What will you do with the fame?

440
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,110
What else? To start out as a freelancer.

441
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,630
I'll have to become a free-body who can work flex hours.

442
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,680
The seonbaes who opened their own offices didn't look free at all.

443
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,890
I mean, freelance attorneys seem busier sometimes, right?

444
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,370
Should I just quit everything and marry a successful woman?

445
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,780
If you're serious about marriage, put some effort into your blind dates.

446
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,470
Don't do them on the fly during lunch.

447
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,290
Excuse me. I've got blind dates lined up right now.

448
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,930
I'm not even sure if I can continue eating lunch with you, my colleague.

449
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,000
Just how many do you get?

450
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,700
Yes, according to the current blind date applications, at least three per week.

451
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,540
Whoa, you're a blind date machine, then.

452
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,860
Isn't it a waste of time?

453
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,270
Just hurry up and choose.

454
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,900
It's not like I could choose.

455
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,950
Look. People are weird because when I say I'm a major law firm attorney,

456
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,290
they think I act cool and recite cool lines like they do in the dramas.

457
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,710
I'm just a cheap salaryman in real life.

458
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,650
See? You're already this cheap by yourself.

459
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,970
How much worse will it get if you get married?

460
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,400
That's why I'm against marriage.

461
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,570
Humans have always been selfish animals who can't share anything.

462
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,310
I agree with that part.

463
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:49,150
So, you need to meet someone who will let you overcome your natural selfishness.

464
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,920
If I could meet a woman like that,

465
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,080
I'd love to marry her right now if I could.

466
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,200
All right, Hoobaenim. Got anything worrying you?

467
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Order whatever you want. Except for stuff like the sirloin.

468
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,290
Have some of this.

469
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,100
 In a moment... 

470
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,520
Why isn't it coming?

471
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,780
I'm going to file a report to the Department of Labor.

472
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,620
No matter how I look at it, it's right to report this.

473
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,400
What's the use of going on blind dates every day?

474
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,680
I don't like any of them, and how would I have a house?

475
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,480
- My pay brushes past my bank account. 
- I'm a lawyer.

476
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,950
I'm not a babysitter.

477
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,410
Would I do this if I had a place with a Han River view?

478
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,070
I would've quit a long time ago and started my own office to accept only the cases I wanted.

479
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:50,120
By the way, I think Jae Hui will really become Cha Eun Gyeong when she grows up.

480
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,670
Their synchronization is so perfect.

481
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,080
My head.

482
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,610
Huh?

483
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,420
Motel...

484
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:53,070
 Motel Eunyu 

485
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,000
 Exhibit 7 

486
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,760
 In 

487
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,940
Why did I come here?

488
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,030
Crazy.

489
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,910
Okay! Your seonbae will buy us a third round.

490
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,220
All right. Let's go get B.B.

491
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,330
What's B.B.?

492
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,520
It's ox bone hangover soup with beer.

493
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,720
Get up. Let's go.

494
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,230
Shit.

495
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,280
Attorney Han.

496
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,820
Hello.

497
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,060
You're wearing what you wore yesterday.

498
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,730
Didn't you go home right after dropping off Jae Hui?

499
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,490
I did!

500
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm wearing different pants.

501
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,180
That's right. Did you submit the Motel Eunyu evidence?

502
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,510
Motel Eunyu? Why?

503
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:38,140
I'm talking about the picture of the motel you said you'd submit by Monday.

504
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,780
Did you submit it?

505
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,960
O-Oh, yes! I submitted it.

506
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,160
- H-Hey.
 - Hey...

507
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,640
Send me your account number.

508
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,410
A mountain lumber?

509
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,800
Huh?

510
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,820
No...

511
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,220
Send me your account number.

512
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,410
Wh-Why do you need my account number?

513
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,850
Y-You paid yesterday, Attorney Jeon. So I'll send you half—

514
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,890
It's really fine. It's fine.

515
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,160
No, I'm not fine with it.

516
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,670
- Also...
 - Yes.

517
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,600
let's eat lunch separately.

518
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,770
Yes, I have a blind date today anyway.

519
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,270
- You have a blind date today, huh? 
- N-No, that's not it. No-

520
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,020
- Get going.
 - C-Coffee—

521
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,840
- You go first— 
- Y-Yes. Okay.

522
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,380
- Why ask for his account number? 
- Why tell her about a blind date?

523
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,170
- I'm crazy. I'm totally mad. 
- I'm crazy. I'm totally mad.

524
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,390
I'm going to lose it.

525
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,910
Where's Attorney Cha?

526
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,840
Where's Attorney Cha, I said!

527
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,060
Attorney Cha!

528
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,460
"C, a celebrity attorney who's at an all-time high engaging in various activities.

529
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,440
Because of the affair between her husband and her secretary,

530
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,030
they say one of the big three law firms, D, is in chaos.

531
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,580
How will a divorce attorney's divorce case go?"

532
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,000
Attorney Cha!

533
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,210
Is the rumor that's going around right now true?

534
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,820
It's partially true, CEO.

535
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,140
What's going on?

536
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,510
I'll try to take care of things here, so go inside.

537
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,040
Why would you, Attorney Jeong? It's my business.

538
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,450
I said raise Divorce Team revenue, and you're doing that internally?

539
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,850
Is that so, Attorney Cha? Please answer me!

540
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,730
CEO...

541
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,210
what are you doing in front of everyone?

542
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,070
This is a rumor that wasn't even verified and

543
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,830
even if it's true, it's private.

544
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,970
Please leave for now.

545
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,570
- You can be accused of defamation. 
- Defamation?

546
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,960
What about our company's reputation and mine?

547
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,740
I'll take care of it. Please go back.

548
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,230
What the heck?

549
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,040
You're the bigger problem!

550
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,700
You still should've confirmed it first.

551
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,880
How can you belittle your partner attorney in front of everyone as soon as you see a tabloid?

552
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,880
How can I just sit back when my company was mentioned?

553
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,950
I won't let it harm our company's reputation, so don't worry.

554
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,800
You're harming the company's reputation more by doing this, CEO.

555
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,400
Aigoo, Seonbaenim.

556
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,740
- You're so mean.
 - What do you mean?

557
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,210
How can you let me hear of your divorce through a tabloid

558
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,290
when I've seen you every day for the last ten years?

559
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,900
You should've let me know, at least.

560
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,940
I'll make it so that Daejeong Law Firm is known as the best for divorce with this case.

561
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,980
CEO won't say much after that.

562
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,880
- What will you do?
-  I'm already a channel and a medium myself.

563
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,700
I'll make the entire nation witness the entirety of divorce through a medium called Cha Eun Gyeong.

564
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,800
Let's think about the direction of the litigation, then.

565
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,940
 Attorney? 

566
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,510
 Did you go tattle on me to Jeong Wu Jin? 

567
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,840
- Jeng Woo Jin.
 - Yes.

568
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,370
I'll take care of it.

569
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,610
You can take it all if you want.

570
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,150
It'll only last a moment.

571
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,080
You saw the tabloid, right?

572
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,270
I always thought tabloids about celebrities were all lies.

573
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,570
But I guess I was wrong.

574
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,590
It was surprisingly factual.

575
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,160
Is it all my fault this happened?

576
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,180
Yes, it's all your fault this happened.

577
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,800
Don't become the entire nation's gossip.

578
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,380
Just end it through an agreement between us.

579
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,640
Me? Why should I bother?

580
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,010
I don't want to see your face, so appoint an attorney first.

581
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,950
I already did.

582
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,380
My attorney said he'd meet you right away,

583
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,520
but I still came in person for the last time.

584
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,260
For the sake of having been a family once.

585
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,900
Want to hear a piece of advice?

586
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,070
The judge doesn't really find a couple using the same attorney to be a good thing.

587
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:04,000
If you use the same attorney, you look like a couple of cockroaches.

588
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,780
You think you'll come out of this unscathed?

589
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,580
Threatening, too? Not bad.

590
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,120
You've changed a lot, Kim Ji Sang.

591
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,410
I can go back to my daily life after getting chewed up for a while.

592
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,330
But since your face is widely known,

593
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:27,070
if I reveal how selfish and what kind of a mom you were,

594
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,350
will you be okay?

595
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,880
Sure, go ahead. Do everything you want to do, Kim Ji Sang.

596
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,800
Are you saying you'll continue the lawsuite right now?

597
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,950
Don't you care about Jae Hui?

598
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,980
Can you still call yourself a mom?

599
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,660
Do you have the right to be Jae Hui's mom?

600
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,220
You dare talk about my rights?

601
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,620
You should've thought about Jae Hui first before things came to this.

602
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,700
Excuse me, Kim Ji Sang.

603
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,790
Listen carefully.

604
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,600
Don't ever utter my daughter's name with that mouth of yours with me.

605
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,700
And there won't be any agreement.

606
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,580
If I wanted to do that, would I have bothered to file a complaint?

607
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,710
Prepare thoroughly and fight properly. You got that?

608
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:29,850
I'll make sure you regret this.

609
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,700
Where's Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?

610
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,950
I've got something to tell her.

611
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,720
- What's the matter?
 - I said "Where's Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?"

612
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,270
Attorney Cha isn't here right now.

613
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,870
Also, you can't just barge in without an appointment like this.

614
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,240
I came in person because I knew she wouldn't see me even with an appointment.

615
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,930
Ma'am, please calm down and make an appointment—

616
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,290
Where is she?

617
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,080
What is the matter?

618
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,190
I saw you changed the hearing date.

619
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,660
Let's agree to settle instead of dragging it out like this.

620
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,430
I'll yield and—

621
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,190
We won't settle.

622
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,090
What kind of nonsense is that?

623
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,090
You'll only ask for 30% of the shares like you're being generous.

624
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,800
Isn't that what you were going to say?

625
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,400
I'm saying I don't need half.

626
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,130
I'm being very generous here.

627
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,930
It seems we're not on the same page.

628
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,560
Our goal is not to give you even 1%, let alone 30%.

629
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,270
Does that moron still have the right to be a dad?

630
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,210
Does making money make you a dad?

631
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,040
His children will receive them, though.

632
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,810
You should reflect on how hypocritical you're being right now,

633
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:04,170
asking for more money when breaking up and asking

634
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,280
if making money makes you a dad.

635
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,120
I'll see you in court.

636
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,030
She came all the way here without an attorney?

637
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,440
She's really something else.

638
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,010
Let's just give whatever she's asking for and end it.

639
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,940
She's threatening me, asking if I'm really a dad. It's exhausting.

640
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,870
You'll really agree to settle?

641
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,340
You're saying you'll give her that big sum, right?

642
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,700
If she threatens you, saying you don't deserve to be a dad,

643
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,300
you're saying you'll give in and go along with what she expects you to do, right?

644
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,200
Sure!

645
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,360
You can do that, then.

646
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,410
- What?
 - I'd be happy to wrap up the case quickly.

647
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,020
I'll contact them to reach an agreement then. Okay?

648
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,430
You can't answer with certainty.

649
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,340
You acted like you made up your mind.

650
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,740
What do you think I should do here, then?

651
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,680
Since you stopped giving her money, block her number and text.

652
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,760
She'll have a headache handling living expenses and utility bills.

653
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,860
It's her turn now.

654
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,580
She needs to be troubled over money to see what she took for granted

655
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,950
was a reward for one person's troubles and labor.

656
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,940
I want to do that, but I'm worried she'll take it out on the kids.

657
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,170
You'll let a mom who threatens you holding kids hostage have her way?

658
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,910
 Are you saying you'll continue the lawsuit right now? 

659
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,300
 Don't you care about Jae Hui? Can you still call yourself a mom? 

660
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,850
 Do you have the right to be Jae Hui's mom? 

661
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,330
You'd better come to your senses.

662
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:03,920
Even if things are hard for everyone right now, please don't give up.

663
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,460
You need to pull yourself together, fight, win, and protect your assets.

664
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,940
You're almost there.

665
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,040
Tomorrow's my youngest's birthday.

666
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,910
It's embarrassing to show her mom and dad fighting over money like this.

667
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,320
Birthday?

668
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,710
Your youngest daughter's birthday is very important to us, too.

669
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,990
It's a day away. Just hang in there.

670
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,150
Why is my youngest's birthday important?

671
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,260
Because your daughters are witnesses to your marriage, just wait a bit longer.

672
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,070
We'll do our best not to let you down.

673
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,100
- Attorney Han? Attorney Han. 
- Yes.

674
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,550
Attorney Han, your driving...

675
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:09,270
Attorney Cha, Jae Hui is totally Little Cha Eun Gyeong.

676
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,940
Really?

677
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,080
So, you gave my daughter a ride when you drive like this, huh?

678
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,420
 Can't believe she's complaining now. 

679
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:23,000
I-I dropped her off safe and slow.

680
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,940
Kim Ji Sang said we should agree to settle.

681
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,680
- On what terms?
 - It wasn't worth listening to, so I just left.

682
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,100
He'll contact us one more time after appointing an attorney.

683
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,040
Most likely.

684
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,500
Aren't you Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?

685
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,070
We meet like this.

686
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,720
- And?
 - Oh, I'm...

687
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,290
the representative for Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra.

688
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,100
Yes, I see.

689
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,120
I heard you're famous.

690
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,400
There's no need to cause a scene, right?

691
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,830
We know everyone through other people.

692
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,630
Let's not fight and agree to settle.

693
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,160
I absolutely don't plan on doing that at all. Bye.

694
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,860
I'm her representative.

695
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,790
You can contact me if you have something to say from now on.

696
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,720
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

697
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:35,410
Aigoo, you look like you just graduated from high school, Attorney.

698
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,920
We should go. We've got a trial to attend.

699
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:47,390
Oh, you look like a school principal facing retirement soon, Attorney.

700
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,810
 Defendant 
 We'd like to submit a statement.

701
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,110
Yes, please put it on the screen.

702
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,360
"Hello,

703
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,270
- I'm the defendant's second daughter..."
-  I'm the defendant's second daughter, Jang Ah Reum. 

704
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,490
As you mentioned, I met Jang Hyeon Song's youngest daughter, who's in Korea.

705
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:20,270
 Mom and Dad did their best in their own ways. 

706
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,350
 Dad established Ah Reum Corp. the year I was born, named after me. 

707
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,090
 He worked hard to develop it for twenty years now. 

708
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,140
 He even got it publicly listed. 

709
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:34,010
 Mom cared for us and helped us study in a foreign land. 

710
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:39,800
 About five years ago, our parents sat us down and told us this. 

711
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,740
 "We'll continue to live as your parents, 

712
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:48,600
 but it won't be as a couple since we'll be living separate lives." 

713
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,590
 I was shocked when I heard it at a young age, 

714
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:57,620
-  but there were many families like this in the U.S., so... 
 - Many families like this...

715
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,430
so I was able to accept it."

716
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,910
Th-That's nonsense!

717
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,510
You won't give the verdict based on a young child's words, right?

718
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,070
Sh-She's still a minor.

719
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,890
At the time that she wrote the testimony,

720
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,570
she had already become an adult.

721
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,790
 Tomorrow's my youngest's birthday. 

722
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,790
 Your youngest daughter's birthday is very important to us, too. 

723
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,100
You're sure her birthday passed, right?

724
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,200
Yes, she became an adult, and I got a statement favorable for us.

725
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,290
Also, the plaintiff changed all of her insurance beneficiaries

726
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:30,680
to her mother, which we confirmed and submitted.

727
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,320
Also, when the defendant visited the plaintiff in the U.S.,

728
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,390
he stayed at a hotel the whole time

729
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,650
instead of the plaintiff's home in Manhattan,

730
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,000
which we'd like to submit together.

731
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,640
This is the last evidence.

732
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,570
Yes, please play the recording.

733
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,480
 I told you to stop calling me, right? 

734
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,760
 Let's live separately, please! 

735
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,400
 Hey, I haven't called you in three years. 

736
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,630
 Also, we still need to discuss the kids' future! 

737
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,340
 Three years or five years, don't call me at all! 

738
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,610
 Schedule 

739
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,600
Attorney Cha, thank you.

740
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,990
I guess she was ashamed to face the kids.

741
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:15,390
Fortunately, she gave up on the shares, and it ended quickly.

742
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:19,420
The company went public after your marriage was broken.

743
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,000
And you have already been providing enough money for living expenses.

744
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,860
So, it was proven the plaintiff couldn't claim her contribution to the company's shares.

745
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,980
But for the plaintiff, she probably wanted to end the trial quickly because she had no cash right now.

746
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,760
Traveling to Korea for the litigation and the attorney all cost money.

747
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,960
I thought the kids would defend their mom because they spent way more time with her.

748
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,890
But my youngest really grew up. She can look at things objectively.

749
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:51,130
Because she's no longer a minor.

750
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,950
So...

751
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:59,240
don't be shaken up by words thrown at you using the children as weapons.

752
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,840
Yes.

753
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,540
You two are now complete strangers since

754
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,540
you don't have minor children between you.

755
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,390
You went through a lot.

756
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:15,010
I almost gave up because waiting was so painful.

757
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,680
Thank you for holding me back.

758
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,310
An expensive meal.

759
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,370
Thank you for the food. Thank you.

760
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:37,680
No need to thank me. We're eating with our fees.

761
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:59,350
Jae Hui asked me if her mom and dad were divorcing.

762
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:01,710
So?

763
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,270
I said I don't know for now.

764
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:10,390
I think it's time you told her now.

765
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,830
I should talk to her soon.

766
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,320
Since the tabloid is going around, too.

767
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,070
Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra's attorney

768
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,750
keeps contacting me to settle. What should I do?

769
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,770
You still don't know after doing this case?

770
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,070
I'm not interested in doing that at all.

771
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,880
I won't give him a thing.

772
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,710
If Kim Ji Sang says he'll give up and leave like Kim Sae Hui

773
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,380
I might reconsider, then.

774
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,620
But the situation is a bit different.

775
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:52,040
For this case, he had given her the Manhattan home in advance and

776
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,370
there was practically no marriage life for years.

777
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:02,070
But in your case, the marriage lasted about fifteen years.

778
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,120
So, the division of property will be set to almost half.

779
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,920
No way.

780
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:10,290
I won't give him anything.

781
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,900
Did you forget what you taught me, Attorney Cha?

782
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,040
I think you're too immersed in feelings of revenge right now.

783
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,940
Every victim of adultery says the same thing.

784
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,250
"Please strip my spouse to nothing."

785
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,050
"Please make my spouse go bankrupt."

786
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,750
They watched too many dramas.

787
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:34,220
But I think you can have that desire for revenge if your spouse cheated on you.

788
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,770
Revenge?

789
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,590
We're attorneys.

790
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,800
Tell them to get their revenge personally and

791
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,700
explain even the adulterer has a right

792
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,860
to the division of property within the boundaries of the law.

793
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,960
Yes, you're right. It's revenge.

794
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:57,600
I'll make him leave penniless, no matter what.

795
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,810
What's this?

796
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:19,180
Cha Eun Gyeong... No way.

00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,060
 Why do these things keep happening to just me? 

799
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,880
 Why on earth? 

800
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,580
 The defendant's marriage was already ruined by Cha Eun Gyeong's affair. 

801
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,010
 Office husband 

802
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,680
Crazy.

803
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,470
♫  Facing challenges, I persisted   ♫

804
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:05,340
♫  Learning to navigate heavy days  ♫

805
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,250
♫  But, it's still hard  ♫

806
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:12,810
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫

807
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:16,770
♫  my reflection in the mirror  ♫

808
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,560
♫  will also blur  ♫

809
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,350
♫  Keep holding on  ♫

810
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:27,910
♫  In the end there will be a bright day  ♫

811
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,530
 Good Partner 

812
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:34,100
 Is it possible for nothing to happen between a man and a woman 

813
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,080
 who worked together for more than ten years? 

814
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,890
 What are you two doing right now? 

815
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:39,680
 Attorney Jeong Wu Jin and you... 

816
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,900
-  Hey, Han Yu Ri.  
-  don't have an affair, right? 

817
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,950
 The damage is greater for Attorney Cha since she's famous. 

818
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,350
 I'll also see this to the end if you mess with me more. 

819
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,980
 I hope you reconsider leaning toward the direction of settlement. 

820
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,310
 I think I appointed the wrong attorney. 

821
01:00:54,310 --> 01:01:00,980
