I'm going to middle school soon.

13

You don't need to take me to school anymore.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,039
Are you rejecting me now that you're older?

15
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,440
To me, you're still a baby.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,850
I haven't been able to do it.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,619
Allow me to do it whether you're in middle school or high school.

18
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:24,619
Okay?

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,559
Sure.

- Yes? - Ms. Cha.

31
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,100
Mr. Oh looked for you earlier.

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,430
He told you to come to his office once you got here.

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,030
- Okay. - Bye.

34
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,479
Yes.

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,690
You were never...

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
late before.

37
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,199
Oh, have a seat.

38
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,100
Thank you.

39
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,339
It's been quite noisy due to your personal matter,

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,940
but it's all over now.

41
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
I called to hear about your plan.

42
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,549
I said...

43
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,318
I'd promote Daejeong's divorce team...

44
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,819
with my divorce.

45
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,130
Because I made an agreement with my ex-husband,

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,590
I couldn't keep my word. I'm sorry about that.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,358
I wasn't expecting your apology.

48
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,929
(Attorney at law, Oh Dae Gyu)

49
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,470
I wonder if you're needed in the divorce team.

50
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,099
Young people these days don't even get married.

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,440
I wonder if we need a divorce specialized team.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,139
That's what I want to go over.

53
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,350
Are you saying you want to get rid of the divorce team?

54
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,419
You took the lead in creating the divorce team.

55
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,388
But I wonder if a large firm...

56
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,319
should maintain a divorce team.

57
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,400
Then what kind of role are you expecting me to play from now on?

58
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,910
You've been working in this field for 17 years now.

59
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,709
Have you ever thought that there's a limit...

60
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,380
to growing yourself in the company?

61
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,280
Isn't it about time to think otherwise?

62
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
Are you telling me to go independent?

63
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,630
Or are you telling me to resign?

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,970
I've never thought about that before.

65
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,840
I thought I've proved myself with enough performance until now.

66
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,669
Why don't you go on vacation for a few days?

67
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,510
You've had a big issue.

68
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,309
After next week,

69
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,780
- I have many cases... - Even without you,

70
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,519
I'll make sure your absence is unnoticeable.

71
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,619
So don't worry.

72
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,539
(Case 11: Absence)

73
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:14,118
Hello?

74
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:16,618
Hello, Ms. Cha. Do you have a minute to talk?

75
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,748
Yes, teacher.

76
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:19,689
I called you because...

77
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:23,789
Jae Hui had an argument with other kids today.

78
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,988
- What? - She's been...

79
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:28,160
more sensitive than usual lately.

80
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,669
Is she like that at home too?

81
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,599
Well,

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,770
she didn't look any different at home.

83
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,109
She was in a good mood when she left home this morning.

84
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,910
I'm very careful about saying this,

85
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,939
but after parents get divorced,

86
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,779
children often feel vacancy of the missing parent...

87
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,749
bigger than before.

88
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,020
It could be because they're worried about what others think.

89
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,890
I think you should pay more attention to Jae Hui, ma'am.

90
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,359
Okay. Thank you, teacher.

91
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,780

- Yes. - Have a seat here.

96
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,030
You can take a seat too.

97
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,868
What are three young men...

98
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:45,809
doing in a divorce team?

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,710
Did you receive a petition?

100
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,679
You can give it to me.

101
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,049

An affair?

106
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,619
You're received a compensation petition for an affair.

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,858
I didn't have an affair, Ms. Han.

108
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,830
- He didn't. - He really didn't.

109
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,399
Ha Yun...

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I mean,

111
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,229
I've never expected her to be married.

112
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,140
In fact,

113
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,169
she had a son in elementary school.

114
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,679
How did you meet her?

115
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,450
Through Hug Hug.

116
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,479
Hug Hug? What's that?

117
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,450
It's a dating app.

118
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,688
He's never even been on a blind date before,

119
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,489
so we downloaded it for him.

120
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,989
But this is nothing weird.

121
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,260

Well, I'm planning to go on a trip with Jae Hui.

132

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,509

- Mr. Jung, you know what? - What?

144
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,350
Ms. Cha just submitted a vacation request.

145
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,989
A vacation request?

146
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:20,389
I've been working here for over ten years,

147
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,590
and this is her first time to go on vacation.

148
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,529
Yes.

149

Are you going somewhere?

150
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,269
I was actually about to tell you.

151
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,310
I'm going on vacation.

152
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,739
Why, all of a sudden?

153
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,509
Everything is okay, right?

154

Everything is fine.

156
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,190
How come you never tell me about these things?

157
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,560
Can't we be honest at least with each other?

158
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,489
We're on the same team.

159

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,199
we already submitted the agreement.

163
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,239
You just have to sign the document. That's all.

164
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,979
As for the request to transfer our case,

165
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,450
I informed our client that the date was set arbitrarily.

166
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,349

176
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,450
All done, right?

177
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,979
Let's see.

178
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,639
Gosh, this is...

179

How am I going to prove this?

180
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,590
Come in.

181
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,268
Ms. Cha, could you spare me a moment of your time?

182
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,869
What's this about now? What's not working out for you?

183
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,670
Sit down.

184
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,479
Please take a look at the table for the division of assets.

185
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,849
As you can see, the defendant has substantial assets.

186
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,349
- Right. - But if I go with this,

187
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,279
he will have to give away a lot of his assets.

188
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,779
- Really? - Yes.

189
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,649
But we're at a disadvantage.

190
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,019
Come in.

191
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Hey, Ms. Han.

192
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,099
Mr. Jung, could you spare me a moment of your time?

193
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,129
Sure.

194
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,728
The plaintiff and the defendant...

195
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,570
are claiming two very different things.

196
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,470
So I'm a bit confused.

197
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,839
Would you be open to read the written complaint?

198
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,739
Sure. Let me take a look.

199
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Thank you.

200
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,950
Let's sit.

201
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,728
The plaintiff is claiming that the defendant approached his wife...

202
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,940
intentionally and seduced her.

203
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,539
- This hand? - But Mr. Lee...

204
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,139
is claiming that she was the one who got seduced.

205
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,939
They're claiming two contrary stories.

206
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,009
- Hit the ball. - It's always the case with affairs.

207
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,779
They all claim the other party seduced them first.

208
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,778
But what makes you think that the client's story...

209
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,180
is only a claim, not a fact?

210
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,759
There are some parts I can't seem to understand.

211
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,229
Ms. Kim Ha Yun's husband's name is Hoon. And their child's name is Min.

212
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,330
But according to the evidence...

213
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,898
(I want to be glued to you just like Hoon and Min.)

214
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,899
Right here.

215
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,069
Anyone could see that my client talked...

216
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,739
as if he was aware of her husband and child.

217
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,680
But when I asked my client about it...

218
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,549
"I want to be glued to you..."

219
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,249
"just like Hoon and Min."

220
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,349
(Written Complaint)

221
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,119
"Hoon" is her husband.

222
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,420
"Min" is...

223
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,489
their child.

224
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,300
But you're still claiming you didn't know she was married.

225
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,629
It will be hard to believe.

226
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,729
I was told they were...

227
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,100
the names of the moss she was raising.

228
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,239
Moss?

229
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,440
You know, the Marimo moss balls.

230
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,378
They're Marimo moss balls. Aren't they cute?

231
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:44,379
Yes.

232
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,149
Their names are Kim Hoon...

233
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,249
and Kim Min.

234
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,519
Their names sound like people's names.

235
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,320
They are my pet moss balls.

236
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,989
They're my family.

237
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,460
This kind of argument will sound so absurd.

238
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,570
Maybe, I should request to bring in the moss balls as witnesses.

239
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,769
That's really odd.

240
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,669
Right. Exactly, my point.

241
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,839
No, hear me out. The evidence they used...

242
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,210
to claim that your client dated her while knowing she was married...

243
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,139
is too perfect.

244
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,350
That's what's odd.

245
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,550
It looks like...

246
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,888
the plaintiff set this up to prove...

247
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,489
your client knew she was married.

248
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,720
What?

249
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,659
The husband is the plaintiff.

250
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,729
He set this up to trap my client?

251
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,139
What?

252
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,970
No way!

253
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,809
Are you alluding to the possibility...

254
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,409
that the husband and the wife plotted this and filed the lawsuit?

255
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,749
Proving the suspicion will be your job.

256
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,050
Did you know?

257
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,649
The attorneys' suspicions can be quite dangerous.

258
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,159
Keep thinking.

259
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,359
No way...

260
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,669
Did he seriously fall for this?

261
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,240
Or is he playing innocent after having an affair with her?

262
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,740
(I want to be glued to you just like Hoon and Min.)

263
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,909
No matter how much I want to believe him,

264
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,179
moss balls are too much.

265
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,899
Through Hug Hug. It's a dating app.

266
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,898
Everyone uses this app to date these days.

267
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,899
(Hug Hug)

268
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,540
Right. A dating app.

269
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,209
A dating app, Hug Hug.

270
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,679
Jae Hui.

271
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,749
I bought something for you. Would you like to see it?

272
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,750
Sure.

273
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Ta-da.

274
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,119
It's a matching outfit. Let's go on a trip with this on.

275
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,820
- All of a sudden? - I'm taking days off from work.

276
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,490
You'll come with me, right?

277
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,959
Doesn't it look cute?

278
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,100
Come in.

279
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,599
What are you doing? You're working late again?

280
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,669
Hey, Mr. Jun.

281
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,040
Gosh. It's already 10pm.

282
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,109
(Hug Hug)

283
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,750
- What are you doing? - What?

284
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,549
Oh, this? It's called Hug Hug.

285
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,490
Apparently, it's a popular dating app now.

286
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,590
It's nothing, though.

287
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,790
You should go without me today.

288
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,059
Okay. I'll get going then.

289
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Bye.

290
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,070
Goodness.

291
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:01,409
All done, right?

292
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,280
I got everything.

293
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,449
- All set! - All set.

294
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
But what about this?

295
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,689
To the backseat. I'll do it.

296
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,718
Mom, will they all fit in the car?

297
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,090
Yes. I'll carry the big stuff.

298
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,760
It had never been just the two of us going on a trip like this before.

299
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,669
I'm even skipping school.

300
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,699
I don't think so.

301
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,540
It really is our first time.

302
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,740
From now on, let's travel a lot together.

303
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,010
I won't use my busy schedule as my excuse anymore.

304
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:42,080
It wasn't an excuse. You were really busy.

305
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,629
All right.

306
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,939
You get 25 cases each.

307
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,199
Ms. Cha sorted out the cases beforehand.

308
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,468
She also talked to her clients.

309
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,679
- So there shouldn't be a problem. - What?

310
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,250
But her clients might call us or need more explanations.

311
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,280
So she told you to take care of her cases.

312
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:16,080
Wait. I already have over 50 cases.

313
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,189
This is so inhumane.

314
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,790
Mr. Jun.

315
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,389
You know that Ms. Cha and Mr. Jung...

316
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,090
always handle over 70 cases, right?

317
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,590
- You got this. - We got this.

318
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Let's go.

319
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:30,659
- Good luck. - Good luck.

320
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,730
They handle a lot of cases because they're partners.

321
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,600
This is crazy.

322
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,709
That just proves the importance of Ms. Cha's presence in the firm.

323
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,250
Absence helps people realize someone's importance.

324
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,409
Gosh.

325
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,319
You said you didn't like Ms. Cha and Ms. Cha was awful...

326
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,719
on your first day here.

327
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,750
What happened to that Han Yu Ri?

328
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,659
Ms. Cha turned me into her fan.

329
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,689
I completely acknowledge that. I love her.

330
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,329
I can't believe...

331
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,730
the cold-hearted Han Yu Ri said she became Ms. Cha's fan.

332
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,300
I must give it to her. Ms. Cha is so experienced.

333
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,830
I wish I could be like her.

334
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,969
Mr. Jun.

335
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,468
Could you help me?

336
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,810
No way. My plate is full with these new cases now.

337
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:19,580
What is it? I'll at least hear you out.

338
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,919
Should I look at the camera?

339
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,850
Well, you can loosen up.

340
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,189
Look at the camera now.

341
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,959
Could you sit down in your chair?

342
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,090
- Here? - Yes.

343
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:30,389
- Just relax. - Relax?

344
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,629
Can you raise your chin?

345
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,189
Try to smile.

346
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,529
Mr. Jun. We're not taking pictures for the company website.

347
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,770
You look too serious.

348
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,769
You look like an attorney.

349
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,570
Try to look like an idol star.

350
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:45,809
An idol star? I'm not good at that kind of stuff.

351
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,209
I have to look cute. How do I do that?

352
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,540
Yes. There you go.

353
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,310
What? Why are you so good at this?

354
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,149
Can you register your profile?

355
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:56,419
- With this one? - Yes.

356
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,719
- Gosh, I look so weird in this. - No, you look fine.

357
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,819
- For your hobbies, pick tennis... - Tennis.

358
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,589
- and cooking. - Cooking.

359
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,689
Mark that you're in your 20s.

360
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,929
- In my 20s? - Yes.

361
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
(20s)

362
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,530
Yes. It worked.

363
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,958
You can tap it to keep going.

364
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,469
(Hug Hug)

365
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,770
What?

366
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,108
Wait. Wasn't that Kim Ha Yun just now?

367
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,780
- What? - Can you tap a little slowly?

368
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,439
Once you skip someone's profile, her profile won't show up again.

369
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,608
- Do it slowly. - Okay.

370
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:27,609
Gosh. You startled me.

371
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:31,250
Next.

372
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:32,689
Next.

373
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,448
(Attorney at law, Jun Eun Ho)

374
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:35,859
Okay. Skip her.

375
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Jae Hui.

376
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,770
Jae Hui. Are you okay?

377
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,340
Do you have some digestive medicine?

378
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,310
What is it? Are you not feeling well?

379
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,570
No.

380
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,209
I think I ate the bread too quickly earlier.

381
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,050
Oh, no. I didn't pack any medicine.

382
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,580
It's okay. I'll just tough it out.

383
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,689
You didn't know that I get indigestion often.

384
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,359
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

385
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,168
Let me see if I can find a nearby pharmacy.

386
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,000
No. I'll get better soon.

387
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,550
All right. I brought iced coffee.

388
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,320
Thanks.

389
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,830
- Did you get anything? - No. Not yet.

390
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,459
(Hug Hug)

391
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:48,899
(Kim Ha Yun)

392
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:51,869
I found her.

393
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,869
Hey, it worked.

394
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,169
I got you, Kim Ha Yun.

395
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,810
No way.

396
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,580
I found Kim Ha Yun on the app.

397
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,449
She posted a fake age on it.

398
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,419
Everything you said was true.

399
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,750
See?

400
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,250
Seriously. Who would lie to their own attorneys?

401
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,159
Actually, more than you think.

402
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:23,600
I can't be 100 percent certain, but I have some suspicions.

403
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,669
Let me just say this just in case. Until I verify my suspicions,

404
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,310
don't apologize or say sorry to the plaintiff...

405
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:33,609
I mean, to Kim Ha Yun's husband.

406
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,408
If you apologize, you will be admitting...

407
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,909
that you knew she was married while dating her.

408
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
I doubt...

409
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,549
he will try to contact me.

410
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,149
Keep in mind what I just told you.

411
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,859
Okay. I will.

412
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:53,929
What?

413
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,100
You said you'd help.

414
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,858
There's nothing I can do.

415
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,070
No way.

416
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,199
We're not the attorneys you see on TV.

417
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,698
Why would you go that far?

418
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:03,969
I'm really sorry.

419
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,369
But it's so not fair on my client Lee Seung Jun.

420
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,378
He's a young man in his early 20s,

421
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:11,750
and he might be ruled an affair partner.

422
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,280
For justice. Please?

423
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:15,719
Just this once.

424
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,918
No.

425
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,290
What if I get in trouble? Will you be responsible?

426
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,119
Yes, you bet. I'll be responsible.

427
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,959
It's still a no. It's not right.

428
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,399
Excuse me. Are you on Hug Hug?

429
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,339
- The lawyer? - Yes, hello.

430
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
Hello.

431
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,279
Shall we play, then?

432
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Yes.

433
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:46,709
Here.

434
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,290
- How about a break? - Sure. Are you all right?

435
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,129
- You're pretty good. - Not at all.

436
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,340
Oh, goodness. Sorry.

437
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,840
I have low blood pressure.

438
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,240
I see.

439
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,280
Let me see...

440
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,520
Okay. So this and this...

441
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:26,119
I got it.

442
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
- Are you done? - Yes.

443
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,560
I know what to do. I read the instructions.

444
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:32,689
Here we go.

445
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,729
- Wait, Mom. - What?

446
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,530
That doesn't go there. I think it goes in the black hole.

447
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,139
That pole has a black mark.

448
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,368
Look, there's a hole to stick it through.

449
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,439
Okay.

450
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,040
Aren't I right?

451
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,678
What's wrong with this thing? Oh, my.

452
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,279
- No, it... - What's happening?

453
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,340
My gosh.

454
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,510
- Hey. - Sorry.

455
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,449
It's my first time putting up a tent.

456
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,810
(No new messages)

457
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,409
(Calendar)

458
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,050
- Is it not ready yet? - What?

459
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:33,550
It's ready.

460
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:34,990
Here we go.

461
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,060
Let's see how Mom's ramyeon tastes.

462
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,159
It looks amazing.

463
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,429
Here goes.

464
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,369
Let's get you some soup too.

465
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,100
It's hot.

466
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,108
It looks good. Eat up.

467
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,570
It's hot. Be careful.

468
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,619
- Why won't you eat? - You added spring onions.

469
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,219
I don't like spring onions.

470
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Spring onions?

471
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,030
Dad. Is it not done yet?

472
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,760
Hang in there. It'll be ready soon.

473
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,830
Hurry up, chef.

474
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,330
I want the usual.

475
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,368
With spring onions and an egg.

476
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,600
- Minus the spring onions. - Minus the spring onions.

477
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,408
Shall I cook another pack without spring onions?

478
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:31,379
No, it's okay. I'll eat this.

479
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:34,550
Next time, add an egg instead of spring onions.

480
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,820
An egg. Okay.

481
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,919
Next time, Mom will add an egg instead.

482
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,230
Would you like some of this?

483
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,330
Goodness.

484
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,398
Aren't you Cha Eun Kyung...

485
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,800
from "All About Divorce?"

486
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,939
- Yes, hello. - That's right.

487
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,209
- My mom's Cha Eun Kyung the lawyer. - My gosh. Ms. Cha.

488
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,469
Your dad was too busy to come?

489
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,040
Well...

490
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,980
What are you doing, darling?

491
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,250
What?

492
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,148
- Hello. - What's up?

493
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,649
Honey. Come with me.

494
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,320
You really didn't know?

495
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,619
Her husband slept with her secretary.

496
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,559
- For real? - Yes.

497
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,958
So they got divorced.

498
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:20,959
Jae Hui.

499
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,729
Shall we clean up?

500
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,959
- Are you full? Are you done? - Yes.

501
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's put everything away and go for a walk.

502
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,100
I'll take that.

503
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,599
- That supreme court case. - Yes.

504
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,240
There are three appointments on Thursday alone.

505
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:33,638
Let's reschedule.

506
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,039
- Okay? Reschedule that. - Ms. Ahn.

507
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Ms. Ahn.

508
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,980
Kim Won Sook keeps calling. What do I say?

509
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:39,908
Ms. Cha said she called to explain.

510
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:41,080
She won't listen.

511
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,218
What should we do, then?

512
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,949
- Ms. Ahn. - Yes? Is there a problem?

513
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,418
We need to call Ms. Cha at least once.

514
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,659
We can't do that.

515
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,320
What should we do?

516
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:53,060
Should we call her?

517
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,659
- Mr. Jung. - Hey.

518
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:56,830
You look a bit frazzled.

519
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,369
There's a client...

520
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,469
who will only talk to Ms. Cha.

521
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,569
I think we should call her.

522
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,639
No, don't do that.

523
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,408
It's her first holiday in years.

524
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:09,678
I'll talk to the client. Send me the file.

525
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,179
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Jung.

526
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,079
- One chocolate ice cream. - One? You're not having one?

527
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,419
Why would Mom eat...

528
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,919
- Have one. - Shall I?

529
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,589
Another chocolate ice cream, please.

530
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,750
- Thank you. - Bye.

531
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:21,959
- Welcome. - Hi.

532
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,590
- Let's go slow. - It's like a slide.

533
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,500
- Mom, look at that. - Are you not scared at all?

534
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
No.

535
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,969
Just kidding. It's a bit scary.

536
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Look over here.

537
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,668
- Let's see. - It's totally different.

538
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:39,908
I think you look similar.

539
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:42,040
No way. I look much better.

540
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,479
Hey, look over there, Eun Ju.

541
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Dad!

542
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,520
Pose for the photos.

543
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,550
One, two, three.

544
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:53,649
- One more. - One more?

545
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:56,189
One, two, three.

546
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,658
Okay.

547
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,128
Hold on tight. It's dangerous.

548
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,859
- It's fine. - Don't be silly.

549
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,999
(Plaintiff Kim Hoon, husband, Kim Ha Yun, wife)

550
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,099
(Marimo moss named Kim Min, child)

551
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,770
(Yeoncheon home, Gangnam tennis court, 3-4 hour round trip)

552
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,340
- Look, Mr. Jun. - Okay.

553
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,740
Kim Ha Yun lives in Yeoncheon in Gyeonggi Province.

554
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,709
Marigold Tennis Court is in Gangnam, Seoul.

555
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,750
That's a three to four hour round trip.

556
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,879
Who travels that far to exercise?

557
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,648
As you said,

558
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,618
their purpose isn't to exercise.

559
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,418
And earlier, at the tennis court.

560
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,459
Are you on Hug Hug?

561
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,859
- The lawyer? - Yes, hello.

562
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,530
Someone was taking photos of you and her.

563
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:42,369
I'm guessing it was her husband Kim Hoon, the plaintiff.

564
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,040
This couple...

565
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,909
knows what they need to prove an affair so well.

566
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,109
Let's meet tomorrow if you're free.

567
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,459
Your membership expired.

568
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,159
Oh, no. It expired.

569
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:10,429
What should I do? I don't have my credit card.

570
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:14,129
Could you pay for me for now?

571
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,270
Oh, sure.

572
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,369
Can we have a membership card?

573
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,139
For one or for two?

574
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
For two.

575
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Okay.

576
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,719
Swing like this.

577
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:40,429
A hotel is a bit...

578
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,439
It's not the first time they conned and sued someone.

579
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:00,479
If I went over for kimchi stew and to meet the moss,

580
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,250
I'd have become her next affair partner.

581
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:04,820
I'm so grateful you didn't ask me to go that far.

582
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,189
- My gosh. - Hurry up.

583
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,789
- I'm starving. - Why does he teach like that?

584
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,500
- I know, right? - I didn't get a thing.

585
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,898
I just don't get anything.

586
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,099
- Karaoke? - Sure.

587
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,398
- Let's go. - Whatever.

588
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,168
- What do you want to eat? - Anything.

589
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:22,169
Mr. Lee.

590
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,899
Are you Lee Seung Jun?

591
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Yes.

592
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,619
You cheater.

593
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,490
Even if your parents did a crappy job of teaching you,

594
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,500
shouldn't you at least come to me to apologize?

595
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:52,030
I'm so...

596
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:56,198
I can't be 100 percent certain, but I have some suspicions.

597
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,639
Don't apologize to Kim Ha Yun's husband.

598
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,708
If you apologize, you will be admitting...

599
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,909
that you knew she was married while dating her.

600
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:09,219
It must be tough on you.

601
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,819
Darn you.

602
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
You, punk.

603
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,520
Are you offering comfort now?

604
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Seung Jun.

605
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,500
If I take you to court,

606
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,869
you'll end up with a record.

607
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,969
I feel sorry for you, man.

608
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,869
Give me 30,000 dollars,

609
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,339
and I'll drop the suit and settle.

610
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,710
Thirty grand?

611
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,750
Will you pay up?

612
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:50,989
Good.

613
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,110
Ms. Han.

614
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,040
He'll drop the lawsuit if I give him 30,000 dollars.

615
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,439
I want to pay him and end it.

616
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,480
You can't.

617
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,779
Are you saying you'll admit to seeing his wife?

618
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,679
It's not that, but...

619
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,988
Then you must keep fighting.

620
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,589
I'm doing the best I can.

621
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,630
If I don't give him the money now, he'll keep coming to my college.

622
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,159
Then word might get out that I dated a married woman.

623
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,900
Don't get weak just yet. Hang in there.

624
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,799
I'll be in touch.

625
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,448
Didn't I grill this amazingly?

626
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:55,719
What about me?

627
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,190
I'm doing all sorts of stuff thanks to you.

628
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,900
- I think this is what they do. - How do you know that?

629
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,330
I know stuff too.

630
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,130
I did it. Taste it, Jae Hui.

631
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,670
- Is it nice? - It's delicious.

632
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,750
Are you asleep, Jae Hui?

633
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,429
(No new messages)

634
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,588
Next time, add some cheese and not spring onions.

635
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:35,790
I don't like spring onions.

636
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:37,489
It's okay. I'll eat this.

637
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,989
It's okay. I'll manage.

638
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,259
Good job.

639
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,799
Sorry.

640
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,610
I wonder if you're needed in the divorce team.

642
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,110
Even without you,

643
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,979
I'll make sure your absence is unnoticeable.

644
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,049
So don't worry.

645
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:46,759
Jae Hui.

646
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,699
I thought I was needed both at work and at home.

647
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,900
Do you think I was mistaken?

648
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:02,069
Was I actually...

649
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,779
failing to do well in both places?

650
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,199
Was that settled?

651
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,839
Oh, the case is still on?

652
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,739
We'll apply for Jeon Ae Ran's personal details.

653
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,170
We need her resident number.

654
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:34,769
What year was they born?

655
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,279
Can I help... Oh, gosh.

656
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,009
What brings you here, sir?

657
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:41,549
Who's Jun Eun Ho?

658
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,350
- Who? - Jun Eun Ho.

659
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,290
Who's Jun Eun Ho?

660
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,420
Hey. Who's Jun Eun Ho?

661
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,419
Where's Attorney Jun Eun Ho?

662
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,489
I'm Jun Eun Ho. Can I help you?

663
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,259
- No way. - It's you?

664
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
Yes.

665
00:39:58,869 --> 00:39:59,899
Oh, no.

666
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,229
- What's going on? - Let go of him!

667
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,868
- Relax. - What's this about?

668
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,469
- Goodness. - Is he out of his mind?

669
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,540
What do you think you're doing?

670
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,940
This is assault.

671
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,579
- What do you want? - You deserve a beating.

672
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Mister.

673
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,210
What's the matter?

674
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,420
You must be high up here.

675
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,119
An attorney at this law firm...

676
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,259
has been fooling around with my wife.

677
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,258
- What's your take on that? - Who did what?

678
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,629
Please don't.

679
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,129
Do you have a death wish?

680
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,159
- Why you... - Don't.

681
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:35,469
Yes, sir. This is a law firm,

682
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,610
but making false accusations in a public setting...

683
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:40,810
is slander.

684
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,080
I'm calling the police.

685
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,520
My gosh.

686
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,179
Are you kidding me?

687
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:00,889
You.

688
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,900
You have another thing coming.

689
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,599
The real victim of the case...

690
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,170
will be revealed in the end.

691
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,310
How?

692
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:14,969
Because a fake victim is on a tight schedule.

693
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,310
They need to cash in before they're caught,

694
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,380
so they lack patience.

695
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,319
For instance, one will make threats.

696
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,420
They'll want to see results as fast as possible.

697
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Unbelievable.

698
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,529
What are you looking at?

699
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,659
- Are you all right? - Yes.

700
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:40,569
- Mr. Jun, are you okay? - I'm good.

701
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,400
What just happened?

702
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:43,499
Are you all right?

703
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,739
Ms. Han and Mr. Jun.

704
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:47,670
My office, please.

705
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,218
Mr. Jun had an affair with the wife.

706
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:03,420
Gosh, no. That's absurd. What are you talking about?

707
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:05,989
They're con artists who are also married.

708
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,429
They're more like career criminals.

709
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,900
I can't believe that such people actually exist.

710
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,569
By the looks of it, you actually solved the "maybe."

711
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,279
It wasn't my advice to take it this far though.

712
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,610
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,849
What is a hunch could end up killing people.

714
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,489
These con artists are really something.

715
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,719
So?

716
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,560
What's the game plan?

717
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:41,259
Now,

718
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,500
I'll conclude my case.

719
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,009
Ha Yun, I miss you. Should we meet again?

720
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:54,339
Check this out.

721
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,139
You went to see him, but he still doesn't care.

722
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,880
He must be head over heels for me.

723
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,020
I must've made the fire burn hotter.

724
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,319
Unbelievable.

725
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:10,759
- Throw it. - Here!

726
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,230
- Jae Hui. - Okay.

727
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:16,929
Catch my fastball!

728
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,799
Here, son.

729
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,040
- Catch. - Gosh.

730
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,839
Full power.

731
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,979
Bring it on.

732
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,009
Get over here.

733
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:37,049
Here.

734
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,089
Jae Hui.

735
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,520
Jae Hui, help me with this.

736
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,158
Help me with this.

737
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,190
- The other side. - The other side?

738
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:51,028
Okay, let's do that once again.

739
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,230
Why is it this heavy?

740
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,528
We'll take the family bike.

741
00:43:54,529 --> 00:43:56,199
You can get on bike number three.

742
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
- Let's go. - Thank you.

743
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,509
Is it for you, your mom, and your dad?

744
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,480
No, it's just us two.

745
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,679
Sorry, I thought you were a family of three.

746
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,249
- Sure. - You can ride that one.

747
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,250
Let's go.

748
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,759
Nice.

749
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,060
- Are you having fun? - Yes.

750
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,360
I bet you didn't expect such speed.

751
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,000
Here we go. Hold tight.

752
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,880
Mom, look out!

753
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,250
Jae Hui!

754
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,448
Let me see. Jae Hui, are you all right?

755
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:48,449
Let me see you.

756
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,219
Hold onto me.

757
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,360
Gosh, what's all this?

758
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,730
This is my best dish.

759
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,428
It seemed as though you barely had time...

760
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:01,929
to grab a bite outside the office.

761
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,269
Do you eat here instead?

762
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,969
I normally eat outside but...

763
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:08,338
Gosh, you even took off the stems for me.

764
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,639
How sweet of you.

765
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Hello.

766
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,420
I'm Han Yu Ri, Mr. Lee Seung Jun's attorney.

767
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,619
Mr. Jun,

768
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,520
what's going on?

769
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,489
It's not kimchi stew but a picnic-style lunch this time.

770
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:34,670
You really are a con artist.

771
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:40,869
I get it.

772
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,979
You're all in on it together.

773
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,039
What?

774
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,679
Those conspiring are you and your husband.

775
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,049
Why live this way when you have your whole life ahead of yourselves?

776
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:58,520
Your husband took photos on the first date.

777
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:01,130
You two being con artists is the only explanation.

778
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:03,699
Well...

779
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,699
It can happen.

780
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,899
Maybe we should sue you for fraud...

781
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,339
and obstruction of business.

782
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:12,539
With your fake profile,

783
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,409
you obstructed the business of Hug Hug.

784
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,980
And since your husband shook me by the collar,

785
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,279
he'll be investigated for charges of assault.

786
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:26,790
Darn.

787
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,290
- What... - Ms. Attorney.

788
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,159
I'm sorry.

789
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,028
I'm on probation for another fraud case...

790
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,770
and can't afford to be sued.

791
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:43,469
I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.

792
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,040
Apologize to Mr. Lee Seung Jun instead.

793
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,219
Hey.

794
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,619
I mean, Mr. Lee.

795
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,259
I'm sorry.

796
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,770
Ms. Attorney.

797
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:22,369
I'm sorry.

798
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,309
I'm on probabation for another fraud case...

799
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,009
and can't afford to be sued.

800
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,619
I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.

801
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,250
Apologize to Mr. Lee Seung Jun instead.

802
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:38,659
Call Kim Hoon...

803
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,429
and tell him to drop the lawsuit.

804
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,389
Also,

805
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:46,429
if he filed a lawsuit against Attorney Jun,

806
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,969
- have him drop that too. - This second.

807
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,420
Baby.

808
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,790
We've been caught. Drop the lawsuits.

809
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,420
Lee Seung Jun and Jun Eun Ho were working together.

810
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:22,469
Thank you.

811
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:25,940
I'm not the one you should be thanking.

812
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:29,009
Mr. Jun went through hoops on this one.

813
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,009
Gosh, that wasn't necessary.

814
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,009
I'll look forward to a delicious meal.

815
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,679
Thank you so much, Mr. Jun.

816
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,719
Take care.

817
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:44,489
Take care.

818

(Railroad Diner)

819
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,399
- Cheers. - Cheers. Good job, guys.

820
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,630
Good job.

821
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:00,310
Mr. Jun.

822
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,369
I'm sorry for what I put you through,

823
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,409
but please know that I'm extremely grateful.

824
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,509
I doubt you were a willing participant.

825
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,609
I don't do things I don't want to do,

826
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,119
but I agreed to it because you asked.

827
00:49:12,279 --> 00:49:14,790
I'm over the moon today.

828
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,659
At first, I was worried...

829
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,690
not to have Ms. Cha around.

830
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,900
But for the first time as an attorney,

831
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,799
I came up with a plan to prove a case...

832
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:28,830
and handled it by taking action myself.

833
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:31,069
You're right.

834
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,869
This was the first time you handled a case alone.

835
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,880
I finally feel like I helped someone...

836
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:44,920
and made a difference in his life.

837
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:46,290
That's why I'm happy.

(Year 2016)

839
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,730
What's the path you want for our divorce team?

840
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,560
A team that saves lives.

841
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,569
Rather than it closing out chapters,

842
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,639
I want a divorce team that helps to begin new ones.

843
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,779
It would've been nice to have Ms. Cha here.

844
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,980
I miss her.

845
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:22,249
- You know, right? - I do.

846
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,920
- You know what I'm saying. - Sure.

847
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,259
- Is this cab for me? - Yes. We'll talk tomorrow.

848
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:28,229
- Sure. - Good.

849
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,730
I can give Yu Ri a ride home...

850
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,829
- Good night. - Why are you rushing me off?

851
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,130
- Mr. Jun, good night. - Why only me...

852
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:38,600
Unbelievable.

853
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,909
Eun Kyung would've given you an earful had she been around today.

854
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,310
I know.

855
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,150
But, I for one, want to commend you.

856
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,650
Ms. Han,

857
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,119
you did a good job.

858
00:50:58,219 --> 00:50:59,529
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

859
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:04,199
Then, please get home safely. I'll get going first.

860
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:05,259
Good night.

861
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,380
Just a second, Jae Hui.

862
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:21,509
All right.

863
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,250
Here. Get up slowly.

864
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,588
Gosh, be careful.

865
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:27,749
Isn't the father around?

866
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,849
You could've hurt yourself.

867
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,119
- Maybe you can... - My dad's not around!

868
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,360
Sorry about that. Can you...

869
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,509
I'm going to call Dad.

870
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,009
Jae Hui.

871
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:52,839
Why not?

872
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,350
Can't I call him?

873
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:59,689
Of course you can.

874
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,088
Of course.

875
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:03,389
Didn't you two want me to act more like a child?

876
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,360
I'm being one right now,

877
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,130
so why won't you let me?

878
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:11,199
That's...

879
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,399
Your dad isn't close by at the moment,

880
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,500
and calling him out of the blue to say you're hurt will shock him.

881
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,198
If you can calm down...

882
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:20,969
He'll still come even though I'm far away.

883
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,739
He should come since I'm hurt.

884
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:26,449
He should come running this second!

885
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,119
I'm here by your side.

886
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,290
I know I lack in ways,

887
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:44,630
but I'm trying my best.

888
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,069
I...

889
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,880
miss Dad, that's all.

890
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,889
I've been trying not to,

891
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:10,690
but I miss him so much.

892
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,429
I hate him so much,

893
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:22,069
but I still miss him.

894
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,110
Mom.

895
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,810
Is he really no longer in our life?

896
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:46,830
I'm sorry.

897
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,259
I'm so sorry.

898
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,269
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

899
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,069
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

What are you doing here?

When I need to clear my head,

906
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:16,369
I stay back at the office after everyone has gone home.

907
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,339
It eases my mind.

908
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,909
How fascinating. That's what I do as well.

909
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,338
I spent my life either being at home or at work,

910

00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,299
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

913
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,839
The void you leave behind is huge.

914
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:05,119
(Missed calls)

915
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:06,690
(Calls)

916
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:22,770
Hello?

917
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:43,420
Can I request a follow-up service?

918
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:47,589
Ms. Cha,

919
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:49,690
is everything all right?

920
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,429
At the office and at home,

921
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,170
no one seems to need me.

922
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:10,250
What do I do?

923
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:15,690
Law Firm Daejeong.

924
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:18,790
Let me take over.

925
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:05,738
(Good Partner)

926
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,210
Just have the VIP's case dismissed.

927
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,679
I'll hold off on Cha Eun Kyung's reinstatement for now.

928
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,339
Mr. Oh had Ms. Han take the case alone.

929
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:15,908
I was given the case when I don't have the experience...

930
01:00:15,909 --> 01:00:17,819
to handle VIP cases yet.

931
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,049
At times, the unacceptable happens.

932
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,350
I need you, Ms. Cha.

933
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,420
Let's wrap up this case neatly.

934
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,389
That's how I can keep my job, right?
