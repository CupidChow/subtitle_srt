 In session | Plaintiff

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:34,890


5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,000
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,430
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,430
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,050
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,540
- Yes?
 -  Hey. 

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,880
Attorney Cha? I think you ought to come over to our house.

11
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,770
 My instincts are telling me so. 

12
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,140
 It feels like Chun Hwan Seo will cause trouble. 

13
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,470
Attorney Cha! What's going on?

14
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,700
Han Yu Ri.

15
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,180
Attorney Cha. Attorney Cha!

16
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,490
Attorney Han, you stay here.

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,770
Let me come with you.

18
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,270
How can I send you in alone?

19
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,130
He's the son of a well-known foundation.

20
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,030
He won't be able to act rashly.

21
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,370
But just in case, call the police if you don't hear from me in ten minutes. Okay?

22
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,720
- But still—
 - If you tell the police I'm inside,

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,920
it might make the news and hurt the firm.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,610
Say it's domestic violence and tell them to come.

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,260
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,540
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 Honey! Honey! 

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,300
 You think I'm being funny? Huh?   

29
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,740
 I'll show you what happens if you look down on me. 

30
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,350
 Honey! 

31
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,780
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,370
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, are you here?

33
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,920
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong!

34
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,970
Oh, you're here.

35
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,360
Where's Ms. Yu Ji Yeong?

36
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,390
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong?

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,700
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong, can you hear me?

38
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,530
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong, wake up!

39
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,250
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong?

40
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,400
Please...

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,790
help me...

42
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,540
I beat her up enough to kill her, but she's still not dead?

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,840
F***!

44
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,400
Y-You really killed her.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,210
You bitch! I didn't kill her!

46
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,100
She's the one who passed out and died.

47
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,550
How bothersome.

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,350
How much money do you need to get me on probation?

49
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,130
You need a life sentence, not a probation.

50
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,790
You just killed someone.

51
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,660
You killed her. She's dead!

52
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,590
If that's what my lawyer thinks,

53
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,800
she's no longer my lawyer.

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,210
You're a witness, and I don't have to let you live.

55
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,770
I'll make sure your daughter ends up the same way.

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,040
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

57
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,870
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

58
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,960
 Call the police if you don't hear from me in ten minutes. Okay? 

59
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,440
 Say it's domestic violence and tell them to come. 

60
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,100
 112 
 (Number for police in Korea) 

61
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,690
Shit...

62
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,330
F***...

63
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,200
Shit! Where is she?

64
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,990
Where the hell did she go?

65
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,410
Shit...

66
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,910
Shit.

67
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,340
Yes, Father.

68
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,560
There's a problem that needs to be taken care of.

69
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,180
Get your hands off me. I can walk on my own.

70
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,440
I promise to kill you one day, too. Okay?

71
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,240
 Episode 13 

72
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,590
 If that's what my lawyer thinks, 

73
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,670
 she's no longer my lawyer. 

74
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,770
 You're a witness, and I don't have to let you live. 

75
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,180
 I see you're sitting in my office when I'm not even here. 

76
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,480
 I'll make sure your daughter ends up the same way. 

77
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,220
 Police 

78
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,110
Attorney—

79
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,810
- Are you okay, Attorney Cha?
 -  Are you okay, Attorney Han? 

80
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,960
Yes.

81
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,590
 Where are you? 

82
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,170
I'm at the police station. What about you?

83
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,620
I'm home, of course.

84
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,440
As you said, I called the police after 10 minutes

85
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,820
and Chun Hwan Seo was arrested at the scene.

86
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,980
Good job.

87
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,840
Good job. You did really great. Good job.

88
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,430
Ms. Han Yu Ri?

89
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,870
Attorney Cha, I need to go for questioning.

90
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,110
 I'll call you back. 

91
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,700
Okay.

92
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,300
I'm Attorney Han Yu Ri

93
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,730
from Daejeong Law Firm.

94
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,490
How did you know to report the situation?

95
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,440
I'm Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's divorce attorney.

96
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,000
When I got there after receiving Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's call,

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,860
the door was left open.

98
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,480
And there were signs of physical struggle, so I reported it.

99
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,740
Did you go to Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's house alone?

100
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,530
 If you tell the police I'm inside, 

101
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,750
 it might make the news and hurt the firm. 

102
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,250
 Say it's domestic violence and tell them to come. 

103
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,880
Yes.

104
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,600
 Please... 

105
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,020
 help me. 

106
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,330
 I'll make sure your daughter ends up the same way. 

107
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,930
 Case 13: To Make Up Your Mind 

108
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,010
 STOP School Violence­ 

109
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,440
 I promise to kill you one day, too. Okay? 

110
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,620
Attorney Han!

111
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,990
Are you all right?

112
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,590
I'm sorry about this being so late.

113
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,330
I thought I should inform you immediately.

114
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,280
Don't be sorry.

115
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,720
That's unnecessary.

116
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,150
So, Seonbae got home safely, right?

117
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,930
Yes, it seems so.

118
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:13,260
Well, I haven't heard from her exactly what happened.

119
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,880
But I think...

120
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,060
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo and Attorney Cha had some sort of...

121
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:26,600
- physical altercation. I think...

122
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,400
You must be really shaken up, too.

123
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,860
Let's go for now. I'll take you home.

124
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,470
Okay.

125
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,940
Thank you.

126
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,480
The company will handle the rest, so don't worry and get some rest.

127
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,720
I'll get in touch with you.

128
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,550
Okay, I understand.

129
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,250
- Go on in.
 - Okay.

130
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,580
Yes, Director Chun.

131
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,640
Are you people aware my son has been arrested or not?

132
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,810
We've been informed.

133
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,200
I heard Attorney Han called the police. Did you know that, too?

134
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,910
Yes. Please calm down.

135
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,870
 You think I can calm down right now? 

136
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,310
 What kind of an attorney reports their own client? 

137
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,000
 You still call yourselves lawyers? 

138
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,340
We won't be able to proceed with Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's criminal case.

139
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,160
As if I'll let you?

140
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,920
I won't let this slide, you people!

141
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,850
 Seonbae, are you hurt anywhere? 

142
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,680
 The company will take care of this, 

143
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,700
 so take the day off and get some rest. 

144
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,810
 I'll be in touch. 

145
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,380
Yes, I understand.

146
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm truly sorry, Director Chun.

147
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,740
Did you ask for me?

148
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,590
I heard you declined to take Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's criminal case.

149
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,830
This is a murder case.

150
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,330
It wouldn't be right to take this case, period.

151
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,700
You think the issue at hand is whether we take this criminal case or not?

152
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,630
A person died.

153
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,290
It hasn't even been 24 hours since Ms. Yu Ji Yeong died.

154
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,530
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong isn't the issue right now!

155
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,050
If the Chun Foundation rescinds all their medical and construction cases,

156
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,810
don't you know our company will falter?

157
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,700
I'll come up with a countermeasure.

158
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,740
Get out of here!

159
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,700
 Dependable police, safe nation 

160
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,960
 If that's what my lawyer thinks, 

161
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,460
 she's no longer my lawyer. 

162
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,360
 You're a witness, and I don't have to let you live. 

163
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,310
 I'll make sure your daughter ends up the same way. 

164
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,170
Attorney Han Yu Ri from Daejeong Law Firm?

165
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,790
Why was she at the murder scene?

166
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,270
Isn't she an accomplice?

167
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,590
Damn. I guess money can even buy you a lawyer while you murder someone.

168
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,110
Isn't that where Cha Eun Gyeong works?

169
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,090
Damn, what a bunch of scumbags.

170
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,410
His representative? She defended a murderer?

171
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,320
Why was she at the murder scene with him?

172
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,400
I bet they're all in on this together.

173
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,440
I heard the Chun Hospital's Foundation is large-scale.

174
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,580
Money is always the problem. Damn money.

175
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,840
That's what I'm saying.

176
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,280
 Executive Director of Chun Medical Foundation, Arrested for Murder 

177
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,270
 Witness Is A Top Law Firm Attorney 

178
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,660
 On July 2nd, the eldest son of Director Chun Du Yeong, 

179
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,120
 Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, the Executive Director of the Chun Medical Foundation, 

180
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,860
 was arrested for assaulting and killing his wife, Ms. Yu. 

181
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,150
 Ms. Han of Daejeong Law Firm, who is Mr. Chun's legal representative in 

182
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,200
 his divorce case, was a witness to Ms. Yu's murder. 

183
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,340
- Han Yu Ri?
  - Attorney Han Yu Ri? 

184
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,880
 Executive Director of Chun Medical Foundation, Arrested for Murder 

185
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,300
 Witness Is  A Top Law Firm Attorney 

186
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,020
 It's the Chun Medical Foundation. 

187
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,030
 Everyone, would you believe it if I told you 

188
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,310
 the Chun Medical Foundation's son committed a murder? 

189
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,600
 Yes, I was also very shocked when I heard the news. 

190
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,630
 Our nation's largest hospital, Chun Hospital, 

191
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,970
 - belongs to this foundation.
 - Right. 

192
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,040
 But there was one more person besides the victim at the scene 

193
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,840
 where the son of that foundation committed murder. 

194
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,110
 It was Attorney Han Yu Ri from one of the top three law firms in the nation, 

195
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,040
 Daejeong Law Firm. 

196
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,490
 A union between a major foundation and a law firm. 

197
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,910
 What could be the nature of their relationship? 

198
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,140
 Doesn't something smell fishy here? 

199
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,300
 I'm absolutely 100% certain that there's a connection between them. 

200
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,630
 Two hundred percent. 

201
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,870
 Hello. 

202
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,800
- Hello.
 - Hello!

203
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,990
Attorney Han! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

204
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,310
Y-Yeah. I'm really okay.

205
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,670
Why would you go there?

206
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,660
I told you to stop putting yourself in danger. Geez!

207
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,240
Attorney Han, why did you come in? I told you to take a break.

208
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,560
I need to catch up on some files.

209
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,720
And I just wanted to work.

210
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,640
Attorney Han—

211
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,470
Seonbae.

212
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,110
I told you to rest at home—

213
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,850
Why won't you two listen to me?

214
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,050
Are you okay, Attorney Cha?

215
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,840
You should be resting. Why did you come?

216
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,720
I mean, why are you named as the witness?

217
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,250
You only got there after the situation was over.

218
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,150
Why are you the witness?

219
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,980
Don't worry about me.

220
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,210
It's all going to be revealed eventually

221
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,080
and it's just an internet rumor.

222
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,940
How can we not worry? They're dissecting you inside out!

223
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,680
He's right. Reporters might swarm here,

224
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,230
so don't come to work until the situation blows over.

225
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,140
It's okay! I'm fine, Attorney Jeong.

226
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,240
Yeah, go home and get some rest, Attorney Han.

227
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,220
I'll take care of everything.

228
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,400
- I have to do it.
 - Seonbae, don't get involved, either.

229
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,540
This isn't about individuals, Cha Eun Gyeong and Han Yu Ri.

230
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,490
The company will handle things,

231
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,800
so you two should stay out of this.

232
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,610
 1st Hearing 

233
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,140
Let us begin the hearing.

234
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,660
Prosecutor, please state the charges.

235
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,640
The defendant was the victim's spouse.

236
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,580
They fought frequently after the victim filed for divorce on June 4, 2024.

237
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,410
 When the victim came home, the fighting began. 

238
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,860
 The furious defendant laid the victim on the floor, 

239
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,820
 sat on top of her, and punched the victim's face and head multiple times. 

240
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,950
This assault caused subdural hemorrhaging on the victim's left side of the brain,

241
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,570
which lead to her death.

242
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,070
Do you acknofwledge the charges?

243
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,080
I-I'm sorry!

244
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,990
I'm sorry, Your Honor!

245
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,980
Yes, Your Honor. He accepts the charges regarding the assault.

246
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,130
However, we submitted the medical records

247
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,800
of receiving psychiatric therapy to prove the defendant's feeble-mindedness.

248
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,120
Please consider that this is the defendant's first offense. We ask for probation.

249
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,900
You murderer!

250
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,430
I had no idea my daughter Ji Yeong was telling the truth!

251
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,610
I thought my daughter would become a divorcee if I sided with her,

252
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,820
so I turned a blind eye and covered my ears!

253
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,520
Had I known she would be beaten to death after she left...

254
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,660
What's the big deal about being a divorcee?

255
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,570
I handed my daughter over to that murderer with my own hands!

256
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,960
My Ji Yeong died because of me.

257
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,150
I killed my daughter.

258
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,080
Ma'am, are you okay?

259
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,390
 Please... 

260
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,620
 help me... 

261
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,800
She would have lived if I had been a bit sooner.

262
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,080
Don't beat yourself up.

263
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,190
Did you see him?

264
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,150
Chun Hwan Seo's expression was that of relief, not anxiety.

265
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,730
I did.

266
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,280
I think he intended to kill Yu Ji Yeong from the start.

267
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,790
There's something wrong with this situation.

268
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,370
He should've been indicted for murder.

269
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:18,420
It was lacking evidence to indict him for pre-meditated murder.

270
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,450
What? Why would you report it when you weren't even a witness?

271
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,780
He was indicted for assault because it was determined

272
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,690
he had no intention to murder.

273
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,590
So, if I testify about my observations of Chun Hwan Seo's violent tendencies—

274
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,030
Wait, wait, Attorney Han. Think about this rationally.

275
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,520
You think that's going to work?

276
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
This isn't a drama. This is reality.

277
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,540
What if Chun Hwan Seo seeks revenge once he's released?

278
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,000
That will put you in danger, too.

279
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,700
- I...
   - Please turn off the water! 

280
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,370
 If I can't divorce him this time, 

281
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,480
 I think it'll only end if I die, Official. 

282
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,390
want to reveal the truth behind Ms. Yu Ji Yeong's death.

283
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,650
This is too unfair.

284
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,150
Attorney Han.

285
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,040
I wish Han Yu Ri would stay out of danger.

286
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,800
Okay?

287
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,900
 My daughter ❤ 

288
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,620
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

289
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,730
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

290
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,170
She should be at home. Why isn't she picking up...

291
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,210
 I'll make sure your daughter ends up the same way. 

292
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,840
 The call is not going through. 

293
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,140
 My daughter ❤ 

294
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,200
 Mom 

295
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,100
 Mom 

296
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,090
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

297
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,880
 Hello? 

298
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,010
Kim Jae Hui!

299
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,880
Where are you?

300
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,310
I told you I'm going to Coin Karaoke with my friends.

301
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,530
But why didn't you pick up your phone? I was... I was worried.

302
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,500
I couldn't hear it because of the loud music.

303
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,390
What's wrong?

304
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,330
Jae Hui, I'll...

305
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,410
I'll head over.

306
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,100
Send me the address right away. Okay?

307
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:20,240
Jae Hui did anyone follow you or anything today?

308
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,740
If a stranger tries to lure you, you must not follow them, okay?

309
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,220
Are you okay, Mom?

310
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,840
You're acting really strange right now, Mom.

311
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,290
Yeah. Everything's fine.

312
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,690
Fine, my foot.

313
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,620
Well, I...

314
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,060
I'm...

315
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,580
You were always right.

316
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,460
You know that, right?

317
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,200
Everything will be okay.

318
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,180
 I'm standing in front of Deajeong Law Firm. 

319
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,180
 Recently, Chun Hwan Seo, the Executive Director of the Chun Medical Foundation, 

320
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,320
 murdered his wife and Attorney Han Yu Ri 

321
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,890
 from Daejeong Law Firm was revealed to be a witness at the scene. 

322
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:29,000
 The question is whether the two organizations are somehow connected. 

323
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,470
 Hello, everyone. 

324
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,190
 Continuing from our last episode, we will also talk about Daejeong Law Firm. 

325
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,320
 It's extremely shocking and suspicious that the establishment of the MOU 

326
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,310
 and taking on the divorce case for 

327
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,210
 Executive Director Chun Hwan Seo's occurred at the same time. 

328
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:48,670
 I have my suspicions that these events might've been planned from the start. 

329
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,360
 If I dare to make a guess, 

330
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,150
 I think the two organizations schemed a big picture 

331
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,840
 to mutually benefit each other. 

332
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,050
Hey, did you see these comments? 
  Han Yu Ri is scary... 

333
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,030
Geez, aren't they too harsh? 
  Han Yu Ri is a trashy lawyer. 

334
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,730
- I know.
 - It just became a fact.

335
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,030
What should we do? 
  Daejeong Law Firm is scummy. 

336
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,060
 Han Yu Ri and Cha Eun Gyeong are both trash.  
 Jeong Wu Jin is also trash. 

337
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,390
 Daejeong Law Firm, Chun Medical Foundation, MOU Crisis? Public Opinion Plummets. 

338
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,360
 Trashy law firm... trashy lawyers... 

339
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,220
 If that's what my lawyer thinks... 

340
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,390
 You're a witness, and I don't have to let you live. 

341
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:42,450
 I'll make sure your daughter ends up the same way. 

342
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,770
 Please... 

343
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,930
 help me... 

344
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,840
 Don't worry about me. 

345
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,110
 I'm fine, Attorney Jeong. 

346
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,270
 My Ji Yeong died because of me. 

347
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,640
 Please talk Han Yu Ri out of it. 

348
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,610
Why? What is she saying?

349
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,220
She keeps saying she'll report Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case.

350
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,860
But honestly, I'm worried.

351
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,320
She's already being badmouthed online when she's innocent.

352
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,800
If she steps forward a bit more...

353
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,710
Yu Ri will really be in danger.

354
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,150
 You were always right. 

355
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,140
 Everything will be okay. 

356
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,550
Attorney Jeong, you are officially registered as the CEO of our firm as of today.

357
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,300
- Thank you.
 - Congratulations.

358
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,410
I'm sorry about all the commotion as soon as you became CEO.

359
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,440
 CEO: Oh Dae Gyu succeeded by CEO: Jung Woo Jin 

360
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,200
Yes?

361
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,310
"Trashy law firm, trashy lawyers."

362
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,200
Have you read the articles and comments?

363
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
It will all pass.

364
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,510
I'll prepare a rebuttal article.

365
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,610
Why on earth was a Daejeong lawyer at the scene of the murder? Why?

366
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,290
She recognized Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's violent tendencies

367
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,070
and went to separate Ms. Yu Ji Yeong from Mr. Chun Hwan Seo.

368
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,020
But the murder had already occurred.

369
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,660
Isn't that what Ms. Yu Ji Yeong's lawyer should've done?

370
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,730
We're the lawyers for Mr. Chun Hwan Seo!

371
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,990
Ms. Yu Ji Yeong didn't have a lawyer.

372
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,930
If we had respectfully redirected Director Chun's son's case

373
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,780
somewhere else from the start,

374
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,700
we wouldn't be having this discussion.

375
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,360
I agree.

376
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,320
A divorce case is outside the parameters of an MOU.

377
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,110
Accepting Chun Hwan Seo's case was the start of our troubles.

378
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,390
Because you had to accept that divorce case,

379
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,400
our construction and civil cases are suffering damages.

380
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,020
Are you...

381
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,110
now saying this is all my fault?

382
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,420
I signed...

383
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,680
the contract without confirming the other party.

384
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,700
It's my fault.

385
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,730
However, the important thing right now isn't pointing fingers. It's to find a solution.

386
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,290
And what's your solution?

387
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,680
 From: CEO Attorney Jeong Wu Jin of Daejeong Law Firm 

388
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,780
It's to terminate the MOU with the Chun Medical Foundation.

389
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,320
Absolutely not!

390
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,090
What a preposterous solution you brought to the table!

391
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,640
As of today, I'm officially registered as the CEO.

392
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,590
From now on, all the decision-making power lies with me.

393
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,800
 Daejeong Law Firm 

394
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,200
 Statement ofVerified Facts 

395
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,480
 From: CEO Attorney Jeong Wu Jin of Daejeong Law Firm 

396
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,030
These scumbags dare stab me in the back?

397
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,120
 Railway Restaurant 

398
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,640
The termination of the MOU was a huge loss.

399
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,800
Will you be okay?

400
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,010
A wrong process leads to a wrong result.

401
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,980
If that results in our loss, I'll just have to bear it.

402
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,540
It was huge income and a relationship that was necessary for the company's profit.

403
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:22,080
I might have turned a blind eye and covered my ears as well.

404
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,540
You did it to protect the Divorce Team and me.

405
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,590
I'm the one who turned a blind eye and covered my ears.

406
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,120
I'm regretting a lot.

407
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,080
I feel like this is all my fault.

408
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,370
 2nd Hearing 

409
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,320
I see the prosecution has changed the charges.

410
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,600
Please make your statement.

411
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,890
Yes, Your Honor.

412
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:17,120
We will change the defendant's charge from physical assault to murder.

413
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,920
Your Honor, this is absurd.

414
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,230
I had no idea Ji Yeong would die like that.

415
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,180
How could you accuse me of deliberately murdering her?

416
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,200
Defendant, please sit down.

417
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,790
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, please sit for now.

418
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,790
I'd like to call on Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong of Daejeong Law Firm to testify.

419
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,170
The defendant's divorce attorney and the first witness at the murder scene.

420
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,230
I approve.

421
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,290
I'm Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong of Daejong Law Firm.

422
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,510
What brings you here?

423
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,660
Prosecutor.

424
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:07,550
Chun Hwan Seo must be indicted for murder, not physical assault.

425
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,330
Excuse me?

426
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,230
I'm...

427
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,370
a witness to the murder.

428
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,070
That woman...

429
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,420
How could that woman be a witness?

430
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,870
That woman appeared after Yu Ji Yeong died!

431
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,340
She doesn't know anything!

432
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,640
You... You're my lawyer!

433
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,730
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, please calm down.

434
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,600
What's going on?

435
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,300
Why were you chosen as the witness, Attorney Cha?

436
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,830
I'm the one who made the report.

437
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,420
I'm the one who witnessed the murder.

438
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:00,160
What if the career you built at the company up until now all falls apart?

439
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,380
If the time has come for it to fall apart, then so be it.

440
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,880
I should've done this sooner.

441
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,920
 The divorce lawyer of the 

442
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,060
 Chun Medical Foundation's son, Chun Hwan Seo, who beat his wife to death, 

443
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,800
 was later revealed to have been star Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong. 

444
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,790
 While Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong was selected as the witness for this trial, 

445
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,360
 the public is waiting to hear her testimony. 

446
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,500
Damn these people and their comments.

447
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,850
"I knew it."

448
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,250
"Then Cha Eun Gyeong defended a murderer"?

449
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,310
"Whoa, what a scary woman."

450
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,460
There's another comment.

451
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,050
"Cha Eun Gyeong. She gave me the chills."

452
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,010
"What a complete psychopath."

453
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,300
"She's a trashy lawyer who goes around exposing her client's story"?

454
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,420
These damn airheads.

455
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,660
I ought to find them and report them so they come to their senses.

456
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,410
- Scroll down.
 - Here?

457
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,100
- This one?
 - This one.

458
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,730
Attorney Han, did you read the comments?

459
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,430
"National back-stabber."

460
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,700
People can be really cruel.

461
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,270
They're blind to Attorney Cha's dedication to Ms. Yu Ji Yeong

462
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,790
and are only obsessing over her legal representation in the divorce of a murderer.

463
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,810
Exactly, gosh.

464
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,900
The only person Attorney Cha betrayed was Mr. Chun Hwan Seo.

465
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,500
They have no idea.

466
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:58,000
Attorney Cha probably won't be okay at work, either, right?

467
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,020
Of course not. You think CEO Oh will let her be?

468
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:07,300
She's exposing the secrets of her client to the entire world.

469
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,080
Our existing clients will find it difficult to trust us.

470
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,060
And they probably won't seek our services in the future.

471
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,220
 3rd Hearing 

472
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,300
We will now proceed to question the witness.

473
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,270
 Defendant 

474
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,760
Witness, you can refuse to testify 
  Witness 

475
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,590
the information you found out as an attorney or while under contract.

476
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,050
Will you give up this right to decline to testify and make a statement?

477
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,660
Yes, there's a great public need, as mentioned in the proviso clause

478
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,210
of criminal procedure law's article 149.

479
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,690
I'll give up my right not to testify and make a statement.

480
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,720
What is the relationship between the witness and the defendant?

481
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,670
I am the defendant's legal representative in a divorce

482
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,870
as well as the first person to witness the scene.

483
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,740
Please describe the situation when you first arrived at the scene.

484
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,140
When I arrived at the scene after receiving the defendant's call,

485
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,560
 Ms. Yu Ji Yeong? 

486
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,430
- the victim, Ms. Yu Ji Yeong...
  - Please... 

487
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,890
 help me... 

488
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,960
was painfully breathing her last breaths.

489
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,340
The moment I tried to call 119 (Korean 911 emergency),

490
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,150
the defendant grabbed my phone and flung it away.

491
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,980
At that moment,

492
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,710
I witnessed Ms. Yu Ji Yeong pass away.

493
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,350
So, there was enough time to attempt an intervention,

494
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,990
but the defendant stopped you.

495
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,390
Yes, she was definitely alive.

496
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,070
And as the defendant looked down at the victim,

497
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,150
 I beat her up enough to kill her, but she's still not dead? 

498
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,020
he said, "She's still not dead?"

499
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,970
No, that's a lie.

500
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,490
The defendant called me from the scene,

501
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,810
thinking the victim was dead.

502
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,850
There were instances,

503
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,760
 I'm going to kill that bitch. 

504
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,180
where the defendant told me he'd kill the victim.

505
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,890
 So, I carried a voice pen to the scene. 

506
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,560
 Recording Log 

507
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,520
 I beat her up enough to kill her, but she's still not dead? 

508
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,860
And the victim ultimately did not survive the night.

509
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,610
Yes.

510
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,510
During the divorce hearing,

511
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,340
 If I can't divorce him this time, 

512
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,260
 I think it'll only end if I die, Official. 

513
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,380
she said it would "only end if she dies."

514
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,650
That's how it turned out.

515
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,890
Hey! You're saying my son is a murderer?

516
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,360
How dare you lie in a court of law?

517
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,300
How could you stab my son in the back when you're his lawyer?

518
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,150
- That's enough.
 - I'm far from done!

519
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,450
What? MOU termination?

520
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,650
Are you cutting ties so you can escape by yourself?

521
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,350
I won't let you or your father get away with this. Got that?

522
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,120
Just as Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's crime has nothing to do with you,

523
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,910
my actions have nothing to do with my father.

524
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,850
I'm the CEO of Daejeong now.

525
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,400
Please just refer to me.

526
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,720
Do you know how much I lost because of you people?

527
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,690
How each of us recovers our losses should be up to ourselves.

528
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,060
Thank you for everything.

529
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,740
Seonbae, let's go.

530
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,370
 Let’s fix the outmoded law 

531
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,940
 Ease the proof of the reason for divorce 

532
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:17,380
Everyone, the third hearing for Yu Ji Yeong's murder case is currently being held.

533
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,360
All of us might be the ones 
  Reason for divorce proved to be physical assault... 

534
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,560
who caused Ms. Yoo Ji Yeong's death.

535
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,490
The families and society that consider divorce to be taboo, 
  Special procedures for domestic violence needed... 

536
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:33,290
and the social pressure and difficulties of proving one's claims during a divorce trial.

537
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,480
Could those things have prevented Ms. Yu Ji Yeong from escaping domestic abuse?

538
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,770
We mustn't allow more instances like Yu Ji Yeong.

539
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:50,080
Attorney Han Yu Ri is protesting in front of the courthouse.

540
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,460
 All of us might be the ones... 

541
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,290
I warned her not to do something dangerous like this.

542
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,510
She's becoming popular on SNS right now as Attorney Picket.

543
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,680
 And the difficulties of proving one's claims... 

544
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,160
What do we do, Attorney Jeon?

545
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,730
 ...prevented Ms. Yu Ji Yeong from escaping domestic abuse? 

546
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,810
Please give this a read.

547
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,860
What should I do...

548
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,000
Attorney Han Yu Ri!

549
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,510
Attorney Jeon— Wait, all of you—

550
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,810
Wait, you can't— How could you all be out here during work hours?

551
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,650
I'm really fine. I can easily do this alone.

552
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,740
- We'll do it with you.
 - Yes.

553
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:36,480
♫  It's okay even if you're stopped, it's not the end  ♫

554
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,920
You told me to lay low, so why'd you bother?

555
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,850
Someone might pick a fight with you and

556
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,770
how could I leave you alone?

557
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,920
Thank you, Attorney Jeon.

558
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,140
Thank you.

559
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,280
Please take a look!

560
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,290
Please take a look here!

561
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,560
Please take a look!

562
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,960
Please take a look here!

563
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,960
- One day, we might be in her place.
 - Please take a look!

564
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,690
I'm saying this only now,

565
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,900
but how could two women decide to go to Chun Hwan Seo's house alone?

566
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,730
If you thought it could be dangerous, you should've notified the firm first.

567
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,910
I don't know.

568
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,750
At that moment, I was only able to think that I had to go.

569
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,210
How you try to solve things on your own all the time...

570
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,440
Please fix that.

571
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,700
Hey.

572
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:55,380
I thought I was loyal to my firm all those years, right?

573
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,980
But I was running for myself,

574
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,370
for my own sake, not the firm.

575
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:12,440
But why did I think I was sacrificing myself for my work and my home?

576
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:19,040
Seonbae, you know you're unlike yourself these days, right?

577
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,670
What am I usually like?

578
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,060
It came out just now. That's exactly it.

579
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,200
Th-That's who Cha Eun Gyeong is.

580
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,380
Though it's late, I approve of CEO Attorney Jeong Wu Jin.

581
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,040
To be honest, I approved you the moment I heard it.

582
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,160
Go and write the second season of Daejeong.

583
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,760
Not Oh Dae Gyu's Daejeong.

584
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,040
I'm talking about the new Daejeong led by Jeong Wu Jin.

585
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,280
 Please take a look here! 

586
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,250
Attorney Picket, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

587
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,090
She's seriously nuts.

588
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:41,520
- Gosh, she's unstoppable.
 - Why is she doing this? So embarrassing.

589
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,930
I told you, right?

590
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:46,100
She's a lot like somebody I know.

591
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,750
Team 3 can wrap it up and send it over.

592
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,960
- Okay.
 - That concludes this meeting.

593
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,880
- Thanks for your time!
 -  Thanks for your time. 

594
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,700
Thanks for your time.

595
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,930
Attorney Jeong.

596
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,450
Please take a look at the news.

597
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,950
 Though late, it was recently revealed that while representing Chun Hwan Seo, 

598
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,040
 the Daejeong Law Firm resigned the moment they found out 

599
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,940
 about his violent nature. 

600
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,180
 In addition, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong went to the prosecution in person 

601
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,480
 and made a report supporting  the late Ms. Yu Ji Yeong. 

602
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,590
 Experts' analysis say Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's report had an influence on 

603
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:41,310
 turning the charge from assault to murder. 

604
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,490
 In fact, cases where the indictment is changed 

605
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,060
 during a trial are rare, so interest is increasing. 

606
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,870
 People are supporting Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong for her courageous actions. 

607
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,370
 There is a lot of controversy surrounding Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong. 

608
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,370
 Please say a word regarding this. 

609
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:02,280
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong put her career on the line 

610
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,580
 to provide the prosecution with the necessary information to change the indictment. 

611
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,840
 If it weren't for Attorney Cha's report, 

612
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,720
 the defendant would've received a lighter sentence 

613
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,890
 for physical assault instead of murder. 

614
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:24,660
 Attorney Cha is the most courageous person I know. 

615
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,700
 Also, attention is focused on whether the murder charge will be applied to Chun 

616
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,930
 and how the Supreme Court will come down with the final decision. 

617
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,330
- Goodness gracious!
  - I'm Reporter Park Yu Na reporting. 

618
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,320
It's such a relief. What a relief.

619
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,520
 It must've felt so unfair. Sorry for doubting you... 

620
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,890
 Get on your knees and apologize... 

621
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,680
Attorney Cha, did you read the article?

622
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,670
I'm so glad.

623
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,910
Public opinion changed from criticism to positive.

624
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,770
It should've been like this from the start.

625
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,250
Thanks, Han Yu Ri.

626
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,200
I told you not to worry, but you just can't stay put.

627
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,840
I want to become a reliable partner you can depend on.

628
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,440
You're a good partner, Han Yu Ri.

629
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,180
Thank you.

630
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,870
By the way, you're such TV material.

631
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,720
You want to go on?

632
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,060
I'll introduce you.

633
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,790
No! I can't.

634
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,830
What do you mean? You were great!

635
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,060
- No?
 - No.

636
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:59,340
There's only one day left until the judgment for Chun Hwan Seo's case.

637
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,440
Everyone did a good job in each of their positions.

638
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,530
Actually, Attorney Cha requested this gathering.

639
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,850
Is there something special you'd like to say?

640
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,930
From now on, the two of you will take cases on your own.

641
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,440
I wanted to tell you this.

642
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,230
 - Sorry? 
 - Your prep files will still need reviewing,

643
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,330
but no more going to trials and forming litigation strategies together.

644
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,640
It's time to stand on your own, isn't it?

645
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,530
Then, we'll become true lawyers, right?

646
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,920
I'll do my best.

647
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,180
Sure.

648
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,980
 Judgment 

649
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:51,740
I sentence the defendant to

650
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,630
15 years in prison.

651
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,540
Hey, Judge.

652
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,200
Who f***ing bribed you, huh? Let go of me, you f***ers!

653
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,870
You accused an innocent person of being a murderer. You call yourselves human?

654
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,260
Let go! How much do you want?

655
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,740
I'll give you the money! Let's redo this.

656
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,610
How much were you paid?

657
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,390
All right! Look! I...

658
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,680
Your Honor! Your Honor...

659
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,320
Let me go! I'll give you money!

660
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,730
I'll get down on my knees! Please!

661
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,410
Let go of me! Let go!

662
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,190
- It's Cha Eun Gyeong!
 - They're here!

663
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,630
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong, you were Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's divorce attorney.

664
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,640
Why did you decline your right and give a disadvantageous statement regarding Chun?

665
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,950
I truly wanted to relieve the deceased from the injustice.

666
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:52,350
I believed there was a great public need.

667
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:57,480
I know very well how many victims still suffer from domestic violence.

668
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,710
Please say a word to those currently suffering from domestic violence.

669
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,300
Even as I speak,

670
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,490
someone out there is losing their will to live due to domestic violence.

671
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,460
Family should be a source of encouragement.

672
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,350
They shouldn't be a source of forceful oppression.

673
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:15,610
If your family tries to forcefully oppress you,

674
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,990
they're not your family.

675
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,950
Some criticize you for providing an unfavorable statement against your client.

676
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,580
What do you have to say about this?

677
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,320
It doesn't bother me at all.

678
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,410
I'm only deeply regretful I couldn't recognize the situation sooner

679
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,170
to prevent the defendant's actions to save the late Ms. Yu Ji Yeong.

680
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,510
 The sentence seems harsher than a usual ruling. Is this true? 

681
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,600
 Yes. The law only punishes after the crime occurs. 

682
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,050
 It cannot function to prevent the crime from happening. 

683
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,200
 However, the court's decision like this one 

684
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,390
 will function to increase punishment and prevent crimes in our society. 

685
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:54,190
I would like to express my respect and gratitude to the judicial branch.

686
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:58,040
A final word regarding this case, please.

687
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:20,510
 All of our attorneys and employees at Daejeong Law Firm 

688
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:28,020
 did our best to relieve the injustice done to the late Ms. Yu Ji Yeong. 

689
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:34,660
 I express my condolences to the victim who died tragically. 

690
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,510
How is she so cool?

691
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,180
Good work.

692
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,010
- Good job.
 - Thank goodness.

693
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,580
- Good job.
 - Good job, everyone.

694
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:08,090
- Great work.
 - You did really well.

695
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,590
Attorney Han?

696
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,170
Yes?

697
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,950
You worked really hard.

698
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,290
I really thank you.

699
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:31,170
You really shouldered the hard work, Attorney Cha.

700
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:34,210
You were really courageous.

701
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,290
I'm thinking about doing one more courageous thing.

702
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,990
What is it? Just give me the word. I'll help—

703
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,250
I'm going to leave.

704
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:51,400
What do you mean leave?

705
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,510
To where?

706
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,100
I will go independent from this firm.

707
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,510
So, you should become independent from me.

708
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:18,560


709
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,440
♫  Which one is the right way?  ♫

710
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,560
♫  But there's nothing more I can do  ♫

711
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,850
♫  I ... Just live on like that  ♫

712
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:37,530
♫  I know very well each and every day can be a new day for me  ♫

713
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,450
♫  I'm doing a good job  ♫

714
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:48,780
♫  Today, I told myself again, even clumsy steps aren't too late  ♫

715
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,770
♫  That was a small consolation  ♫

716
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:57,320
♫  Keep holding on, in the end, there will be a bright day  ♫

717
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,790
♫  Remember this moment when your dream came  ♫

718
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,500
 Good Partner 

719
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,800
 What is Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's "Spring Back" like? 

720
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,720
 A place where I can swiftly recover spring for my clients. 

721
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,750
 If you put some money in the inmate account, 

722
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,830
 I'll sign your contract next time! 

723
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,280
 I refuse. 

724
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,320
 I couldn't close a contract and just wasted my time. 

725
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,510
 What if I can't even pay the rent at this rate? 

726
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,230
 Would you like to pay a visit here? 

727
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:27,610
 She's the most competent lawyer I know. 

728
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:29,540
 Just leave it to me. 

729
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:36,950
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫
