(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

11
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:52,921
Wait. Aren't you late for work, Mom?

12
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:57,130
You don't have school today with it being the school's anniversary,

13
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,060
so I cooked for you.

14
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:00,061
No way.

15
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,761
Eat up so that I can go to work.

16
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,832
Sure.

17
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,111
Gosh.

18
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:12,941
This almost tastes like how Dad makes it.

19
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,311
- Really? - Yes. It's really good.

20
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:16,952
Make it like this from now on.

21
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,811
I'm over the moon.

22
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:21,420
Would I be exaggerating...

23
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,020
if I said that felt better than passing the bar?

24
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,191
- Yes. - I know, and I'm sorry.

25
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:28,262
- But... - Yes?

26
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:30,831
Do you think you can cook something else now?

27
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,331
Something else?

28
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,202
- Mom. - Yes?

29
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:44,311
Can I not go to Dad's this week?

30
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,882
Well...

31
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:50,051
About that...

32
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:56,482
That's a promise I made your dad which I should keep.

33
00:01:57,322 --> 00:02:00,720
The deal is between you two and not me,

34
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,021
so why should I comply?

35
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,361
Doesn't the law give children a choice?

36
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,861
Not even when I'm almost in middle school?

37
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:12,901
You make a compelling argument.

38
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,012
I feel uncomfortable around Dad because of what I said in court.

39
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,140
I know what he'll say to me,

40
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,442
and I don't want to hear it.

41
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:25,681
Right. Then,

42
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:29,181
I'll talk to your dad about this matter.

43
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,722
All right.

44
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,991
You know what?

45
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,102
Don't meet with your dad and take the week off.

46
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,542
You can do everything on your own now.

47
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,611
I don't need Dad anymore either.

48
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,442
He'll soon have a newborn to take care of too.

49
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,752
(Episode 10)

50
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,890
- This way. - The office space is huge.

51
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:11,692
- Mom, this is my office. - Goodness.

52
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,431
- This is my office. - It's so nice.

53
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:17,072
- Come this way. - What? Oh, sure.

54
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,241
Please come in.

55
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,611
In here, Auntie.

56
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,581
You saw her the other day.

57
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,211
This is my colleague, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

58
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,722
She's my mother.

59
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,621
- And she's... - Right.

60
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:43,262
Hello. I'm Han Yu Ri.

61
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:45,491
Mr. Jun, I'm sorry,

62
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:48,400
but my client for this morning will be coming in soon.

63
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:52,771
Actually, she's that client.

64
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,741
She's a friend of my mother's.

65
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,972
Ms. Han, I hope the consultation goes well.

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,281
Ms. Han, I hope things can work out nicely.

67
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,312
Mom, please.

68
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,852
Gosh, I didn't mean you and my son.

69
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:11,151
Please give my friend some sound advice.

70
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,890
I have work to do, so...

71
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,232
- I'll see you later, Auntie. - Right.

72
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,192
- Please take good care of her. - Sure.

73
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,172
May I ask why you wanted a consultation?

74
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,381
My husband gained all the honor one could...

75
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,182
while serving in the military,

76
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:40,481
and our children have found their purpose in life.

77
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,651
Meanwhile,

78
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,752
I've been stuck without being able to move forward.

79
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:51,062
And now, I want to figure out my life.

80
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:55,401
I see.

81
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:03,541
You're right. I understand where you're coming from.

82
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,341
However, you will be able to figure that out...

83
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:12,752
with your family without divorcing your husband.

84
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,452
There are people who find happiness after the divorce,

85
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:20,052
but many end up regretting their decision.

86
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,790
Ms. Park, can you leave the files...

87
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,762
and get us some water?

88
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,502
Give me some water.

89
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,971
This kid sure knows how to hit the ball.

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,802
Being a writer has always been a dream of mine.

91
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,340
I'm going to rent a studio and write a novel.

92
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:40,280
You, a novel?

93
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:43,341
And why do you need a studio when you can write at home?

94
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:44,651
Get me more water.

95
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:46,952
I can't believe he made the shot.

96
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:49,150
I'm going elsewhere.

97
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,590
Gosh, why are you suddenly getting all worked up?

98
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,052
I apologize, Ms. Han.

99
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:54,421
What is the matter with you?

100
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,122
I'm going elsewhere.

101
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,091
I want a different lawyer.

102
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,362
- Gosh, wait. - Did I perhaps...

103
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,872
do anything to upset you?

104
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,132
No.

105
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:09,202
But Ms. Han,

106
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,211
let me ask this.

107
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,312
What about my life?

108
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,981
Should I let my life fade away?

109
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:24,151
What...

110
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,121
What has gotten into her?

111
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:28,091
Ms. Han, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:32,961
(Case 10: A Messed Up Story or the Final Chapter)

113
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:45,471
For 32 long years, our relationship...

114
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,512
has solidified and hardened in a certain way,

115
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,182
and nothing can change it.

116
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,952
My husband claims to understand me,

117
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,752
but getting him his water...

118
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,421
will be my job for the rest of my life.

119
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:03,422
He only thinks that it's meant to be that way.

120
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:06,891
He doesn't order you around out of spite.

121
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,971
This can be solved by talking to each other.

122
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,172
Since it's your family, maybe you should be more understanding.

123
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,612
That's what makes it more terrifying, Ms. Han.

124
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:21,580
Hey, son.

125
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,381
Mom, do you remember what I wore yesterday?

126
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:24,751
Can you have it dry-cleaned...

127
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:26,382
and bring it to the hospital tomorrow?

128
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:29,382
But I'm meeting a friend for lunch tomorrow.

129
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,492
That can easily be pushed back.

130
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:34,521
This is the least you can do since you barely do anything at home.

131
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,632
Like water and air we take for granted.

132
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,331
That's what I am to my family.

133
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:45,171
But you know that no one can live...

134
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,271
without those two things.

135
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,101
There's what is known as empty nest syndrome.

136
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:53,172
You can feel lonely after your children grow up...

137
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,080
and leave the nest.

138
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,742
I'm over 60 now.

139
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,752
And no one...

140
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,521
can talk me out of this.

141
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:04,452
A divorce.

142
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,160
I understand Auntie Soon Rye though.

143
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,001
She devoted her whole life to her family,

144
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,872
so of course she'd want to figure out her life.

145
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,372
I get it too,

146
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,340
but it saddens me to see...

147
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,341
the rise in divorce among elderly couples.

148
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,511
Could she have come to me...

149
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:33,081
because divorce was the only way out for her?

150
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,251
Isn't that why she came here for a consultation?

151
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,221
I must say, I'm surprised by you.

152
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,292
You're one of those people...

153
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,162
who'd rather not marry and prioritize their career.

154
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,661
Not choosing to marry and divorcing after marriage...

155
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,131
are two very different concepts.

156
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,301
Just because I don't want marriage for myself...

157
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:55,101
doesn't mean I'll promote divorce whenever I can.

158
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:56,772
That's not what I meant.

159
00:08:57,272 --> 00:09:00,211
You value the meaning of one's life more than anyone I know,

160
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,511
so I thought you'd relate more to elderly ladies who seek a divorce.

161
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,952
I don't want marriage for myself...

162
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:14,621
because I know how precious and sacred a marriage is.

163
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,490
Before filing for divorce,

164
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,062
we, divorce attorneys, are the last people they meet.

165
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,572
That's why I'm more cautious...

166
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,802
when there isn't a clear guilty party.

167
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,711
Within that sacred safe haven,

168
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,312
one gets to dream...

169
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,912
while one has to suppress their needs. That's reality.

170
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:55,532
Yu Ri, I hope you didn't forget that we're meeting up today.

171
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:02,001
How does it feel?

172
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,611
Is it less burdening now that the investigation is over?

173
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,042
Yes.

174
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,412
I said everything that was on my mind,

175
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,581
so the judge will make the right decision.

176
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,822
You sure know how to play with your parents' hearts.

177
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,422
I was impressed.

178
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,052
Was I wrong to do so?

179
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,121
No, you slayed.

180
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,932
Out of all the subjects from cases I've seen...

181
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,532
I mean, that's...

182
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:30,702
A subject of a case is the one who is affected by the ruling.

183
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,001
I know that much.

184
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,611
Out of all the subjects from cases I've seen,

185
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,611
you're the smartest.

186
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,740
I heard that my parents would get one last visit...

187
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,851
from the family investigator.

188
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,981
Once that's done, it'll all be over, right?

189
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,022
Well...

190
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,721
Maybe we should sit down.

191
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,701
Unless they come to an agreement,

192
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,971
the process will take longer.

193
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:13,211
Divorce cases take a while.

194
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:16,542
Some take at least a year, while some last more than three.

195
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:22,282
I know it's exhausting, but hang in there.

196
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,322
I'll treat you to snacks often. All right?

197
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,321
Can it be over quickly...

198
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:29,522
if they agree to settle?

199
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,961
Well, yes.

200
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,361
However,

201
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:39,971
that doesn't happen often.

202
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,871
I start middle school next year.

203
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,111
What if news articles surface again around that time?

204
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,812
Right, you'll soon be starting middle school.

205
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,081
Then I'll do my best...

206
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,351
to end it before then.

207
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,292
Please let it be over soon.

208
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:06,662
I already told the court who I wanted to live with,

209
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,202
and I don't want to see my dad anymore.

210
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,971
Right. I'll do my best.

211
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,412
I'm always grateful.

212
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:22,610
For what?

213
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,211
My friends, their moms, and the housekeeper...

214
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,081
all look at me like they pity me.

215
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:29,751
But not you.

216
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:33,322
You didn't walk on eggshells around me nor pity me.

217
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,562
That's because I don't pity you.

218
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,692
The event itself is heartbreaking,

219
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,001
but I know you'll mature from going through all this.

220
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,442
How do I know that? I speak from experience.

221
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,301
(Law Firm Daejeong)

222
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:15,361
Come in.

223
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,961
Ms. Cha,

224
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,171
do you have time to spare...

225
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,731
before the meeting with the family investigator?

226
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:22,672
Sure. What's up?

227
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:25,071
There's a client who wishes to divorce her husband...

228
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,771
so that she can find herself...

229
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,442
even though he's not at fault.

230
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,641
That's the most common reason for divorce...

231
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,782
among ladies who get one in their latter years.

232
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:36,351
She wanted a mediation which is why I requested one,

233
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,422
but should I have done more to talk her out of it?

234
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:42,091
If this goes to court, she'll lose due to lack of grounds.

235
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:45,292
You did the right thing by requesting a mediation.

236
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:47,601
Talking her out of it? That's overstepping.

237
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,202
What have I always told you?

238
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,830
If the client is adamant about their decision,

239
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,871
it is our job as attorneys to see it through.

240
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,171
I'm worried that the rash decision...

241
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,542
could hurt the client...

242
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,241
and lead to regrets.

243
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,510
Any regrets will be their burden, not yours.

244
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,151
All we can do...

245
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:09,682
is end their suffering as soon as possible...

246
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,151
and get an adequate amount of assets in the divorce...

247
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,091
that can guarantee financial independence.

248
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,192
That reminds me.

249
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,402
I offered Kim Ji Sang 30 percent of your joint assets.

250
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,802
And Choi Sa Ra...

251
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,241
I handled her myself.

252
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:30,841
I see.

253
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,751
Also, Jae Hui wants this...

254
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,652
to be over.

255
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,981
Did she say that?

256
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,322
Yes.

257
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:48,091
She wants this to end as soon as possible...

258
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,261
so that you two can move on.

259
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:53,662
I see.

260
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:58,731
Ms. Cha, the elevator's here.

261
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,142
- Right. - I'll see you later.

262
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,072
Ms. Cha, good luck today.

263
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:16,751
I did as you asked,

264
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,652
so will you drop the lawsuit?

265
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,591
I'll hand in the paperwork today.

266
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:24,261
All right.

267
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,191
I'll get going, then.

268
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,731
How does it feel now that you're a mom?

269
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,101
Do you still trust Kim Ji Sang when he abandoned...

270
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,241
his own child?

271
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,442
I'm asking if you believe...

272
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,942
that the same thing won't happen to you.

273
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:50,380
You must think that memorizing law books...

274
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,351
makes you an expert on life.

275
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,322
But don't speak out of line when you know nothing.

276
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,631
You're right. I don't know much about life.

277
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,532
I'm still learning.

278
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:03,001
But I'm a divorce attorney,

279
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,601
so I know the statistics.

280
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,101
People may betray others once,

281
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,871
but they never betray just once.

282
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,211
Remember that.

283
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:48,981
Come in.

284
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:55,522
I'd never met...

285
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,351
a child like Jae Hui...

286
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,322
who was so reluctant to speak up.

287
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,761
I never forced or pressured her.

288
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,332
But...

289
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,001
she slowly began to open up,

290
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:11,801
and on the last day,

291
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,771
she clearly stated her decision.

292
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,342
Did she say who she wanted to live with?

293
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:20,811
Yes.

294
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:24,452
We never ask the child to choose outright,

295
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,021
but Jae Hui all but pleaded with me.

296
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:30,852
She said she wanted the suit to end soon.

297
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,092
I met Jae Hui today.

298
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,791
Jae Hui wants the divorce...

299
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,332
to be wrapped up before she starts middle school.

300
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:45,971
What did she say?

301
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:47,672
Jae Hui.

302
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:53,241
She doesn't want to see her father for a while.

303
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:57,852
And...

304
00:17:57,981 --> 00:17:59,882
Can I get straight to the conclusion?

305
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:02,582
I decided to live with my mom.

306
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:04,622
She wants to live with her mom.

307
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,521
I see.

308
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:16,231
Ma'am.

309
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,730
It was my mistake that she found...

310
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,070
the ultrasound picture.

311
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,771
But I can explain that to Jae Hui.

312
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:25,372
I was going to tell her when we met again.

313
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:28,611
Eun Kyung didn't send her to me claiming Jae Hui wasn't well.

314
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,442
I told you she wasn't well,

315
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:32,182
and that was an excuse.

316
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,152
- Did you hear that? - She said she couldn't stand you,

317
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,692
and I paraphrased that and said she wasn't well.

318
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:41,061
You'll explain? What will you say?

319
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,591
Will you say you had an affair with her mom's secretary...

320
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:45,332
and she'll have a half-sibling?

321
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,461
Not that again.

322
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,662
Are you pleased you have leverage on me?

323
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,571
Does it feel like you won?

324
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,541
Leverage?

325
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,541
I thought you were a good dad, at least.

326
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,611
Do you call a new life...

327
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,922
you'll bring into the world leverage?

328
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:11,352
Be honest.

329
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,091
You love how things are going.

330
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,122
You want to win at anything and beat everyone.

331
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,862
Kim Ji Sang. Get a grip.

332
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:20,761
We're Jae Hui's parents.

333
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,632
What matters more than winning or losing...

334
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:26,372
is the fact that Jae Hui is losing her father.

335
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,311
That's not the victory I wanted.

336
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,341
Don't lie.

337
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,011
This is what you hoped would happen.

338
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:37,710
You wanted revenge...

339
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,651
by taking my position as her dad.

340
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:40,780
You created this mess.

341
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,681
Was it my plan that Sa Ra got pregnant?

342
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,751
That's enough.

343
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,861
Jae Hui was hurt even more...

344
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,261
because she loved her dad.

345
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,290
As her father,

346
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,092
don't you think...

347
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:56,932
what you can do for her is to stop fighting her mother?

348
00:19:58,832 --> 00:19:59,832
Ma'am.

349
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,001
Let me talk to Jae Hui...

350
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,372
one last time.

351
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,211
I can't lose my child like this.

352
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,321
Even after we divorce,

353
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:25,331
don't touch my relationship with Jae Hui. That's a warning.

354
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,491
I was going to do my best to do that.

355
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,500
You're the one who threw that relationship away.

356
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:31,771
Watch what you say.

357
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,932
I'll protect her with my life.

358
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:35,541
Don't think this is over.

359
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,342
I'm so glad you'll protect her with your life.

360
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,741
Keep your word.

361
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,682
Wouldn't it...

362
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:45,412
have been nice if we could've ended it amicably?

363
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,321
"Amicably?"

364
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,432
It's what people often say when they part.

365
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,530
"Let's end it amicably."

366
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,231
(Petition for mediation)

367
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,172
Did you have to go this far?

368
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:18,811
Sometimes people say it because they're just exhausted.

369
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:22,952
Let's end it amicably.

370
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,921
We were married for 32 years,

371
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,422
and you want to take half and leave.

372
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,991
How could you do this?

373
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,692
You're so selfish.

374
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,602
I don't want to take you to court.

375
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,172
Let's wrap it up with a settlement.

376
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:41,902
What is this?

377
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,771
You hired Cha Eun Kyung to represent you, right?

378
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:47,011
Let's go see her tomorrow.

379
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,182
I want to hear how she reeled you in.

380
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:51,311
Okay.

381
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,652
Get me some more water.

382
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:01,960
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

383
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:05,761
If only an amicable divorce can ever exist.

384
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,061
Are there people who even accomplish something that hard?

385
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:14,271
Attorney Law forbids us from representing both parties.

386
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,841
We can't consult people...

387
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:19,842
with conflicting interests. Please leave.

388
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,382
There's no such thing...

389
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:22,912
as conflicting interests here.

390
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,352
My wife agreed to this too.

391
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:32,521
Very well, then.

392
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:43,862
Ms. Cha. I saw you on TV.

393
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,401
You can't think lightly of ruining other families just because...

394
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:49,342
you're getting a divorce yourself.

395
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:59,811
We only represent you in the legal process.

396
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:02,281
It's not our job to prevent a divorce.

397
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,020
Isn't that...

398
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:05,952
what you should've done before coming here?

399
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,791
My parents aren't like the crazy couples...

400
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:12,991
you'll have seen so far.

401
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:16,662
My mom changed a bit with menopause,

402
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:19,271
and she's just failing to overcome it.

403
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:21,171
I got back from my honeymoon today,

404
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:23,041
and Mom told me she wanted a divorce.

405
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:27,142
How flustered do you think I am as a newlywed?

406
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,281
I'm ashamed of what my husband will think too.

407
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,751
Okay, so...

408
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:39,452
If you want your mother to change her mind,

409
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:41,922
instead of driving her into a corner,

410
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:46,132
why don't you give her a chance to speak?

411
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:51,202
Ms. Lee. Your family desperately wants you to stay.

412
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:53,602
Can't you change your mind?

413
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:55,702
Divorce isn't the only solution.

414
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,142
Soon Rye.

415
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:02,612
I know you had a tough life.

416
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,442
I'll make it up to you.

417
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:07,781
Let's play golf and watch our health,

418
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:10,281
and live happily doing the simple things.

419
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:24,662
I don't like golf.

420
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,000
Will you stop acting like a child?

421
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,202
I don't like golf!

422
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:34,511
I ran the house as long as we were married.

423
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,682
When I said my wrists hurt,

424
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,011
you didn't even care.

425
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:43,082
What I like to do,

426
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:45,251
what I want to do.

427
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,892
Did you even stop to care?

428
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:50,592
Each time you moved bases,

429
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,392
I had to move with you to a place where I knew no one.

430
00:24:53,662 --> 00:24:56,932
I spent my whole life supporting you.

431
00:24:58,602 --> 00:24:59,902
Will you please...

432
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:04,442
let me go so I can live my own life?

433
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:08,642
Son.

434
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,182
How much longer must I be your slave?

435
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:13,511
Well?

436
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:14,952
Sweetie.

437
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,952
You asked me to raise your kid when you had one.

438
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:22,220
That's your duty as a mom, not mine.

439
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,092
- Mom! - Soon Rye.

440
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:26,731
This is so frustrating.

441
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:33,031
Kim Young Chul.

442
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:36,642
Get your own drinking water.

443
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,710
You're not a six-year-old.

444
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,842
You're in your 60s. Can't you get a cup of water?

445
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,881
You can...

446
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:45,912
get yourself a cup of water.

447
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:48,251
What?

448
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:49,582
Lee Soon Rye!

449
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:54,622
Yes. Lee Soon Rye.

450
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,362
That's my name.

451
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:02,702
I won't ask you to understand me completely.

452
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,332
But...

453
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:06,932
being labeled a selfish mom...

454
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,471
who's abandoning her family to run away?

455
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:14,942
That's not fair.

456
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,311
For whatever time I have left,

457
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:21,152
instead of being...

458
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:23,582
someone's wife or mother,

459
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:27,192
I want to look for...

460
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,922
the Lee Soon Rye...

461
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:34,362
whose dream was to write novels.

462
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,102
Can't I do that?

463
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,612
Hey.

464
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:54,152
Honey, wait...

465
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:42,731
I told you not to come here.

466
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:45,601
- Why not? - Why do you think?

467
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:47,201
If we're caught during the proceedings...

468
00:27:47,202 --> 00:27:50,142
The family investigator wrapped that part up today.

469
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:54,211
Yes, it's over. It's over now!

470
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,611
Jae Hui said she wanted to live with her mom.

471
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:57,711
Do you feel better now?

472
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,922
Yes. I feel great.

473
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:09,922
Baby. It's your turn.

474
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,761
Will Dad care about us now?

475
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:16,102
Choi Sa Ra. Get out.

476
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:17,702
Leave.

477
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,300
- You want me gone? - Go.

478
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,771
Leave this instant!

479
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,172
Is this what you're really like?

480
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:26,771
Is this how you treated Eun Kyung?

481
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:29,781
And you pretended to be a good husband and dad.

482
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,582
You deceived me.

483
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,211
What about you?

484
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,750
You went to an innocent kid...

485
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:37,652
and scarred her for life,

486
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:40,250
then acted as if nothing had happened?

487
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,961
I'm the one who was duped first.

488
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,461
You pretended to be the greatest man alive.

489
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:46,261
You're despicable.

490
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,932
I can say the same about you.

491
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,901
I thought you'd be different from Eun Kyung,

492
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,871
but you're the worst!

493
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:53,031
You piece of trash!

494
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:57,001
- What? - Eun Kyung and Jae Hui left you!

495
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:58,710
You didn't leave them!

496
00:28:58,711 --> 00:28:59,711
Say that again. What was that?

497
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:00,970
- You're trash. - Get out.

498
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:02,710
- You piece of trash! - Leave.

499
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:03,882
Leave!

500
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,381
(Doctor Hwang, Patient: Choi)

501
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:42,551
You miscarried.

502
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:45,791
It's hard to pinpoint the exact cause,

503
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,362
but in most cases it's a chromosome issue.

504
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:50,892
Well, then.

505
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:10,612
This is...

506
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:16,122
where it ends for us, isn't it?

507
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:21,862
It's possible...

508
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,392
the end was already decided for us.

509
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:32,071
You're being honest at last.

510
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,402
I should've said this sooner.

511
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:41,172
You're so cruel.

512
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:45,981
Were you ever...

513
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:50,051
on the same page with me even once?

514
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,061
You never thought of a future with me?

515
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,031
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,481
Leave.

517
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:23,422
Leave right now.

518
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,392
There you go.

519
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,791
Wouldn't it have been nice if we could've ended it amicably?

520
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:55,781
Jae Hui.

521
00:32:58,281 --> 00:32:59,682
- Who's that? - It's your dad.

522
00:33:02,852 --> 00:33:04,281
- See you. - Bye.

523
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:05,821
- Let's go. - Okay.

524
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,470
- Bye. - Jae Hui.

525
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:25,541
Dad!

526
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:27,040
- Kim Jae Hui. - What?

527
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,780
Don't your friends tease you for running to your dad at age 12?

528
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,082
Who cares?

529
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:34,050
Dad, do you remember you promised to take me out for pizza?

530
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:36,422
You bet. That's why I took the afternoon off.

531
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,521
What pizza do you want?

532
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,942
Where are we going?

533
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,642
Can we go to Dad's place to talk?

534
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:10,751
Okay.

535
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,721
Thank you.

536
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:17,392
I have something to say too.

537
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:34,971
Thank you for preventing the divorce at least.

538
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:39,511
I'll say it again. It wasn't me.

539
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,622
It was Ms. Lee's choice.

540
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:51,022
"Graduation from marriage" isn't a legally defined concept.

541
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:53,991
So in many cases, people call it "graduation from marriage,"

542
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,702
but it's a loss for the person who is financially unstable.

543
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,670
I believe...

544
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:01,332
a true graduation's only possible when assets are divided.

545
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:04,941
It was wise of you both to agree on that.

546
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,071
As long...

547
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:09,682
as I can get her back,

548
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,511
I'll do whatever I'm told.

549
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,191
You've reached a settlement. I'll read it for you.

550
00:35:22,562 --> 00:35:23,562
Okay.

551
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,630
You agree to separate residences,

552
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,931
and you agree that there is no obligation...

553
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,531
to live together.

554
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:32,731
Your assets will be split evenly...

555
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:34,732
between the two parties involved.

556
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:36,941
Did you...

557
00:35:37,272 --> 00:35:40,171
include the clause I asked for?

558
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,971
It's coming up next.

559
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:46,312
Kim Young Chul can meet Lee Soon Rye two times a month,

560
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:48,982
and Lee Soon Rye will cooperate with this.

561
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:52,321
How about the clause I mentioned?

562
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,551
That's coming up next.

563
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,861
You will work on recovering your relationship for two years.

564
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,561
In the case that Lee Soon Rye...

565
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,691
wants a divorce after this two-year period,

566
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,962
Kim Young Chul will agree to this.

567
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,432
Yes.

568
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,812
Please sign here.

569
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,550
These clauses are just promises.

570
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,212
They're not legally enforceable.

571
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:24,251
However, the division of assets,

572
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:26,651
and the agreement to live separately from now on...

573
00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:30,022
will have legal consequences if you get a divorce in the future.

574
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:33,962
I hope you can work on this...

575
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:36,401
and become a couple that are like friends.

576
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,642
I really hope for that too.

577
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:44,941
Ms. Cha.

578
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,372
Is there more I need to know...

579
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:49,741
to get her back?

580
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,412
I think you know now.

581
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:56,982
Listen...

582
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:02,191
to Ms. Lee Soon Rye more.

583
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,191
She sat in the passenger seat her whole life.

584
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:07,261
Let her take the wheel now.

585
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,002
Thank you, Ms. Cha.

586
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:18,971
I think he understands me a bit now.

587
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,441
And since we promised each other,

588
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,582
I'll try my best for two years,

589
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,852
as you said.

590
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:30,821
Things ended amicably.

591
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,751
Where is the water cooler?

592
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,261
Oh, where is the water cooler?

593
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:43,760
It's over there.

594
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,471
Thank you. One moment.

595
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,202
Oh, my goodness.

596
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:52,002
Kim Young Chul finally brought his wife water after he turned 60.

597
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,611
Lee Soon Rye showed herself for the first time.

598
00:37:57,881 --> 00:37:59,912
And I stopped a divorce for the first time.

599
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,952
Today, we all did things that we normally don't do.

600
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,021
When we did things that we normally don't do,

601
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:09,091
I could see a future for their relationship.

602
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:13,392
Jae Hui, aren't you hungry?

603
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:15,932
Should I make you an omelet?

604
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:29,111
You like my omelets.

605
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:31,312
It's okay.

606
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:33,852
I'm going to ask Mom to make it for me later.

607
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:39,622
Mom doesn't know how to make omelets. I'll make it for you.

608
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,991
Mom is good at it too now.

609
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:46,062
Really?

610
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:51,761
Jae Hui.

611
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,531
The investigator told me everything.

612
00:38:57,941 --> 00:38:59,372
Things must've been tough for you.

613
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,841
Because of problems between adults.

614
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:03,941
No.

615
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,452
It wasn't because of problems between adults.

616
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:11,022
It was tough for me because you lied to me.

617
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:16,522
You lied to me every day for a year.

618
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:24,531
I'm sorry.

619
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:28,702
I'm so sorry.

620
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:35,741
A while ago,

621
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,482
Mom left me at Aunt Sa Ra's...

622
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:42,151
for a little bit to do homework.

623
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,991
I fell asleep for a moment,

624
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:54,962
and then I heard your voice.

625
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:57,130
What if she wakes up?

626
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,261
It's okay.

627
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:29,962
It seemed you stopped seeing her at some point.

628
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,832
I was relieved because I thought it was over.

629
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,872
I thought to myself that I would never tell Mom.

630
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,571
Because Mom would get hurt.

631
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:46,312
But that wasn't the end.

632
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:03,832
It was just that the lies got bigger.

633
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:08,732
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

634
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:10,772
I did such a terrible thing.

635
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:12,812
You had a chance at the arboretum,

636
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:15,712
and she came to your house several times,

637
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,111
but you didn't say anything.

638
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,761
When I saw the ultrasound picture,

639
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:36,432
I decided to think that I no longer had a dad.

640
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,901
Jae Hui. It's not like that.

641
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:43,301
She wasn't pregnant.

642
00:41:43,741 --> 00:41:45,971
There's no baby in Aunt Sa Ra's belly.

643
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:47,671
I checked.

644
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:49,542
I ran here to tell you that.

645
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:53,551
I don't trust you anymore.

646
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:55,781
It's true.

647
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,352
Aunt Sa Ra was mistaken.

648
00:41:59,122 --> 00:42:00,352
Do you want me to show you now?

649
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,030
Jae Hui. Please live with me, my princess.

650
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:07,931
I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.

651
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:08,932
No.

652
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,332
I won't live with you.

653
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:14,932
Those who did wrong should be punished.

654
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,712
The biggest punishment for you...

655
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,712
- What is this? - Read this, Dad.

656
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:27,812
I studied in Toronto, Canada, man.

657
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:32,420
- I think English is so fun. - Really?

658
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:34,050
When I grow up, send me to a school in the US.

659
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,150
I want to go to New York University.

660
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,961
No. Why are you punishing me?

661
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:41,131
I can't live a day without seeing you.

662
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:45,761
Don't go!

663
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:48,401
Not getting to see me will hurt you most.

664
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,841
Jae Hui.

665
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:56,881
I'm sorry. I...

666
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,151
I was mistaken.

667
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:04,551
I thought Mom was taking you from me.

668
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:06,721
But it wasn't true.

669
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,562
I...

670
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,091
I made you run away.

671
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:14,962
I want to leave.

672
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:18,301
What can I do?

673
00:43:20,202 --> 00:43:21,671
End the case quickly.

674
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:25,071
Stop hurting me and Mom.

675
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:27,471
If you're punished, accept it.

676
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:30,341
Okay.

677
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:33,182
Okay.

678
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:38,982
Okay.

(Nighttime Service)

680
00:43:56,642 --> 00:43:57,642
Hi, Mom.

681
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:00,841
I reserved a seat on the bus.

682
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:02,712
I don't think I'll arrive until early in the morning.

683
00:44:03,781 --> 00:44:05,341
Don't wait up for me and go to sleep.

684
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:19,591
(1 selected)

685
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:02,301
- Did you have fun with Dad? - Yes.

686
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:04,502
Good job.

687
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:07,411
From now on, don't set separate visitation days.

688
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:09,642
Meet him whenever you want, okay?

689
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:12,812
Go put your bag down.

690
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:18,981
Mom. The meat.

691
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,691
The meat? Oh, my.

692
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:25,562
It burned.

693
00:45:26,232 --> 00:45:28,361
This is basically charcoal.

694
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:30,360
No.

695
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,261
What are you talking about? You can eat this piece.

696
00:45:32,872 --> 00:45:34,201
What other things...

697
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:36,671
- Number three. - was I not doing, no,

698
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,271
was I not able to do?

699
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:41,312
- T, E. Like this. - Like this?

(Seoul Family Court)

701
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:52,122
What can I do?

702
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:53,622
End the case quickly.

703
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,821
Stop hurting me and Mom.

704
00:45:56,522 --> 00:45:58,091

(Plaintiff)

706
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:07,832
The defendant agrees to give the mother custody.

707
00:46:12,142 --> 00:46:13,212
Is that true?

708
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,272
Thank you.

709
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:18,441
You both went through a lot with the family investigation.

710
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:20,880
The matter of custody is the hardest to settle on.

711
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:21,912
You made a good decision.

712
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:26,220
I won't set particular visitation days.

713
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:28,892
I'll consult with Jae Hui whenever she wants.

714
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:30,421
That sounds good.

715
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,431
Since you're a famous person, you can't hide...

716
00:46:33,432 --> 00:46:36,400
or not let the defendant see his child...

717
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:37,631
after the divorce.

718
00:46:38,002 --> 00:46:39,471
Can we trust you?

719
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:43,042
I'm going to let my kid go to her dad whenever she wants.

720
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,712
As long as he continues to try...

721
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,781
until she can forgive him.

722
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,392
I'm going to heal Jae Hui's wounded heart.

723
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:02,221
That's why I'm agreeing to this settlement.

724
00:47:06,232 --> 00:47:09,761
Now, we need to talk about the division of assets.

725
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:14,332
Tell us your proposal first.

726
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:17,101
Out of four million dollars under your name,

727
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:19,711
send the defendant two million, which is exactly half,

728
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,042
and let's call it a day.

729
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,982
Half is too much.

730
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:28,151
Attorney Han. We gave up custody.

731
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:30,650
In that case, we could normally get more,

732
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:33,220
but we're only asking for half...

733
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:35,150
to end things amicably.

734
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:36,462
We can't agree to that.

735
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,321
Raising a child costs even more money.

736
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:41,432
What kind of logic is that?

737
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:43,932
It makes more sense for us to take more.

738
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:45,400
This is a courthouse.

739
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:47,732
If so, let's wait for the ruling, then.

740
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:50,502
Okay. Let's do so.

741
00:47:54,912 --> 00:47:57,912
I suggest you step out and discuss this a bit more.

742
00:48:12,462 --> 00:48:13,892
Let's just give him the money and end it here.

743
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:16,662
Half does belong to him.

744
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:21,071
Ms. Cha. You can't.

745
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:23,601
You said the salary for Jae Hui's nanny...

746
00:48:23,602 --> 00:48:27,011
and Jae Hui's educational expenses would be several thousand a month.

747
00:48:28,111 --> 00:48:29,610
Because Kim Ji Sang doesn't have a job,

748
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:31,482
he won't be able to pay that much in child support.

749
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:34,150
We need to get at least 60 percent.

750
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:35,451
That's the right balance.

751
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:36,452
It's okay.

752
00:48:37,221 --> 00:48:38,321
Let's just end it.

753
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,122
That way,

754
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:44,462
I can see him as Jae Hui's dad from now on.

755
00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:00,711
If we don't adjust our proposal...

756
00:49:00,712 --> 00:49:03,280
and hang on until the ruling, you could get half,

757
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:04,781
so you can't give in.

758
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:07,610
It's okay. Please ask for 30 percent and wrap things up.

759
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,482
We can't do that.

760
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:12,551
You were married for almost 15 years. That's too little.

761
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:15,590
You already gave up custody.

762
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:17,522
A man should be more aggressive.

763
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:21,761
It's because we have Jae Hui between us.

764
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:23,231
I can earn the money again.

765
00:49:23,232 --> 00:49:26,131
I know you're emotionally weak because you went through a lot,

766
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:27,872
but just trust me and hang on.

767
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:30,642
I said I wanted to end it.

768
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,571
Are you doing this to get a bigger contingency fee?

769
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,812
As an attorney, you should listen to your client.

770
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,352
So sensitive.

771
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:44,921
Everyone on this case is sensitive.

772
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,022
Gosh. I should just end things here.

773
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:08,441
(Defendant, Kim Ji Sang)

774
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:21,952
(Defendant, Kim Ji Sang)

775
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:28,661
I can't believe I'm celebrating a wedding anniversary.

776
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:30,101
- It's thanks to you. - Thank you.

777
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:31,731
You can do it, my cool wife!

778
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:32,801
We can do it!

779
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:47,281
(Defendant, Kim Ji Sang)

780
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:54,022
(Plaintiff, Cha Eun Kyung)

781
00:50:54,691 --> 00:50:56,191
There, there.

782
00:50:58,591 --> 00:50:59,662
My gosh.

783
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:01,361
Mommy.

784
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:04,001
There, there.

785
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:05,631
Honey. I think we need to hurry.

786
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:07,232
Let's see.

787
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,731
Isn't that too hot?

788
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,340
Jae Hui! Your food is here!

789
00:51:11,341 --> 00:51:13,312
It's time to eat!

790
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,582
(Plaintiff, Cha Eun Kyung)

791
00:51:32,662 --> 00:51:33,761
(Congratulations on your graduation!)

792
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,932
Pose for the camera.

793
00:51:36,962 --> 00:51:38,462
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

794
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:40,701
- Got you. - Hold on!

795
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:42,070
I won!

796
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:43,702
One, two, three.

797
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:46,101
- One, two, three. - That turned out nicely.

798
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,772
- I did a good job, right? - You're so good.

799
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:54,151
(Plaintiff, Cha Eun Kyung)

800
00:51:56,111 --> 00:51:57,682
(Judge)

801
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:02,151
Now your divorce is finalized.

802
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:05,261
Is there anything you'd like to say?

803
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,281
I'm sorry,

804
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:27,452
Eun Kyung.

805
00:52:47,702 --> 00:52:48,900
Do you appreciate me at all?

806
00:52:48,901 --> 00:52:50,240
Let's stop it.

807
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:52,400
Do you call this living well? Do you call this a family?

808
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:54,071
I can't even tell whether you're a mom or not.

809
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:55,811
Do you really have to do this?

810
00:52:55,812 --> 00:52:57,781
Let's please stop. I'm sick of it!

811
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:04,522
I no longer see you as my wife, the woman I love,

812
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,991
or Jae Hui's mom.

813
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:09,991
Perhaps...

814
00:53:11,392 --> 00:53:12,662
Perhaps,

815
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:15,892
maybe...

816
00:53:16,962 --> 00:53:20,602
I wanted an apology from them.

817
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:33,381
Let's raise Jae Hui well.

818
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,421
To see the look in their eyes,

819
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:47,832
I could tell how desperately...

820
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:49,562
they wanted an apology...

821
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:53,202
and how desperately...

822
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:55,732
they wanted to apologize.

823
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:40,281
The agreement they made that day...

824
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:44,381
wasn't an unstable side dot...

825
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:46,551
that was full of strangeness or regrets,

826
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,691
but it could be a starting point...

827
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:54,631
to be better parents.

828
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,102
What are you doing?

829
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:35,471
Let's go.

830
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:37,471
Oh, okay.

831
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,071
Wait for me, Ms. Cha.

832
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:55,292
- Jae Hui. - You're home.

833
00:55:55,892 --> 00:55:57,662
- Are you working on your homework? - Yes.

834
00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:01,662
Let me see. Anything you're struggling with?

835
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:02,761
I know everything.

836
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:25,921
I...

837
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:28,691
don't want to see Dad for a while.

838
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,721
Okay.

839
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:47,571
Ms. Cha, you had a long day today.

840
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,871
Get me something good next time.

841
00:56:49,872 --> 00:56:51,011
We should have a get-together.

842
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:52,682
It's Yu Ri.

843
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,551
Don't mind her.

844
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:56,412
Mom.

845
00:56:56,982 --> 00:57:00,151
You need to thank Yu Ri big time, you know?

846
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,252
She was your attorney after all.

847
00:57:04,022 --> 00:57:05,022
Yes.

848
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:10,531
- I'm heading upstairs. - Okay.

849
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:25,502
("The Little Prince")

850
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,812

851
00:58:42,091 --> 00:58:43,661
Ms. Cha, you're here.

852
00:58:43,662 --> 00:58:45,792
- Ms. Cha. - Sit down.

853
00:58:47,062 --> 00:58:48,090
Gosh.

854
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:51,231
It was your idea to gather,

855
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:52,801
but how can you be late?

856
00:58:53,732 --> 00:58:54,732
Sorry.

857
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,501
The star always appears the last.

858
00:58:57,502 --> 00:59:00,071
And tonight, the star is Attorney Cha.

859
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:02,440
- Here. - What is that?

860
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:03,481
Ta-da.

(Attorney Cha Eun Kyung Divorce Party)

862
00:59:05,941 --> 00:59:08,682
Ms. Cha, you've gone through so much.

863
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:13,380
Gosh.

(Attorney Cha Eun Kyung Divorce Party)

865
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,292
- How about a toast? - Sounds good to me.

866
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:21,990
- Good work. - Good work.

867
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,261
Thank you.

868
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:30,470
Ta-da.

869
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:33,001
Attorney Cha's divorce party.

870
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,772
- What is it now? - Let's celebrate.

871
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:38,780
A divorce is not something to celebrate.

872
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:40,550
Why not?

873
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:42,880
It's the start of a new life. You've gone through so much.

874
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:44,682
From now on, you must only be happy.

875
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,991
It ended earlier than expected. It is something to celebrate.

876
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:50,892
Ms. Han, congratulations on completing a big case.

877
00:59:53,062 --> 00:59:55,531
Wasn't it tough to work on a VVIP's case?

878
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:01,031
You know it.

879
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:04,171
I'm the one who needs to celebrate.

880
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,801
If it prolonged any longer, I would've lost all my hair.

881
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,511
- My goodness. - Look at you.

882
01:00:08,941 --> 01:00:11,781
Ms. Han can't multitask.

883
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:15,752
Anyway, why am I happy that this case is over?

884
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,622
Let me pour you a glass.

885
01:00:19,352 --> 01:00:20,690
When we see our clients,

886
01:00:20,691 --> 01:00:23,292
we expect them to be relieved after the long lawsuit,

887
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:25,792
but a lot of people actually struggle even more after that.

888
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,732
You might go through that too.

889
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:32,760
When that happens, don't hesitate to call us.

890
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:34,901
So we'll gather and grab a drink together.

891
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:36,901
Thanks, but no thanks.

892
01:00:38,171 --> 01:00:40,671
We shouldn't hang out after work.

893
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:42,471
I have friends too.

894
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:52,421
Is Jae Hui alone at home?

895
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,490
You should get home now.

896
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:57,162
Right. You had a long day.

897
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:59,062
We can't keep you for too long.

898
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:01,191
You should get to Jae Hui.

899
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:02,732
Thanks. Thanks, everyone.

900
01:01:03,131 --> 01:01:04,462
Get home safe.

901
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,202
We should talk before you go.

902
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:09,530
Sure.

903
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:11,041
Okay. We should get going first.

904
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,670
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

905
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:13,772
Get home safe.

906
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:24,122
Do you have something to say?

907
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:30,792
Ms. Han Yu Ri.

908
01:01:34,162 --> 01:01:35,162
Yes.

909
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,932
Thank you so much...

910
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:40,901
for taking good care of my case.

911
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:44,171
Thanks to you,

912
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:47,441
I was able to get divorced.

913
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:03,022
It was a good choice to choose you...

914
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,191
as my divorce attorney.

915
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:22,272
You have...

916
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:27,781
also...

917
01:02:30,252 --> 01:02:31,921
gone through so much.

918
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,332
You said...

919
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,662
your job and family are your life.

920
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:46,631
My job and my family...

921
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:49,031
are my life.

922
01:02:51,941 --> 01:02:53,142
From now on,

923
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:55,171
instead of being...

924
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:57,712
an attorney and a mom,

925
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:02,381
you should also...

926
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:04,582
look for yourself.

927
01:03:14,732 --> 01:03:16,162
Are you dropping the honorifics?

928
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:26,272
I feel so proud...

929
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:28,671
to hear that I was helpful.

930
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,182
Thank you.

931
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:33,852
You weren't just helpful.

932
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:36,911
I can't even imagine what it would've been like...

933
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:38,221
without you.

934
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:43,622
Thank you so much for your work.

935
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:48,232
I'll see you later.

936
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:53,901
I'll let you slide...

937
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:56,832
on dropping the honorifics only for today.

938
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,082
The last page.

939
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:09,381
When you flip the last page,

940
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:13,952
everyone gets a hope that they'll be able to start a new chapter.

941
01:04:15,491 --> 01:04:16,921
An attorney may be...

942
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:21,062
someone who helps their client open a new page...

943
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:22,691
in their first chapter after the last page.

944
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:36,471
I want to go on a trip with you.

945
01:04:37,982 --> 01:04:39,412
Shall we? Do you want to?

946
01:04:39,812 --> 01:04:41,182
- Really? - Sure.

947
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:42,852
Check the map.

948
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:46,780
- To the sea? - The sea too.

949
01:04:46,781 --> 01:04:47,792
Okay.

950
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:49,851
The beach?

951
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,062
- I like it. - Yes?

952
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:06,941
- Hello? - Come to the office.

953
01:05:16,452 --> 01:05:17,522
Cha Eun Kyung.

954
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:20,821
Fire her.

955
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:25,522
Where are we...

956
01:05:27,332 --> 01:05:29,162
Heading to?

957
01:06:22,182 --> 01:06:24,622
(Good Partner)

958
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,482
Attorney Cha is gone,

959
01:06:26,982 --> 01:06:28,352
but her vacancy doesn't show.

960
01:06:28,491 --> 01:06:30,861
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

961
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:33,932
How can an attorney have an affair with someone's wife?

962
01:06:34,392 --> 01:06:36,392
What on earth are you doing?

963
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:39,361
It's Ms. Han's first time to take the case alone.

964
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:42,202
I wish Attorney Cha was here.

965
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,241
What do I do?

966
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,511
It seems no one needs me.
