00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,300
 Good Partner

00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,380
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,060
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:34,980


5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,040
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,610
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,490
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,100
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,910
Aren't you late for work, Mom?

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,940
You said you're not going to school today because it's the school anniversary,

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,830
so I made some dishes for you to eat.

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,250
- Hurry up and eat. I need to go to work.
 - Okay.

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,070
It's almost the same as the ones Dad used to make now.

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,440
- Really?
 - Yes, it's really delicious.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,730
Make it like this from now on.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,260
Whoa, I'm really happy.

17
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,250
Would I be exaggerating to say I'm happier than when I passed the bar?

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,680
- You are.
 - Yes.

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,710
- Also...
 - Yes.

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,110
isn't it time to try something else?

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,900
Something else?

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,150
- Mom.
 - Yes?

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,990
Can I not go to Dad's place this week?

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,670
Well...

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,150
that's a promise I made to your dad, so it has to be kept.

26
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,910
It's not a promise I made to Dad.

27
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,940
It's between you and Dad, so why do I have to keep it?

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,220
How about the children's right to decide?

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,760
I'll be in middle school soon.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,820
Now that I hear you, you're really right.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,610
I feel uncomfortable meeting Dad because of what I said in court.

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,140
It's obvious what Dad will say when I meet him.

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,190
I don't even want to hear it.

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,230
I see. Then, I'll talk to your dad about it.

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,500
Never mind.

36
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,050
Just don't meet Dad and take a break this time.

37
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,740
You can do everything by yourself like this, Mom.

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,330
I don't need Dad anymore, either.

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,540
Dad needs to raise a baby soon, too.

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,610
 Episode 10 

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,790
- Come this way.
 - The place is huge.

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,030
Mom, this is my office.

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh, my! It's wonderful.

44
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,430
This way, please.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,620
Please come inside.

46
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,160
You can come inside, Auntie.

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,610
You saw her last time, right?

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,430
This is my colleague, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

49
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,540
And this is my mother.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,120
And this is—

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,740
Y-Yes.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,050
Hello, my name is Han Yu Ri.

53
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,790
By the way, Attorney Jeon, it's almost time for my morning consultation.

54
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,480
So, today's client is this lady right here.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,870
She's my mother's friend.

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,370
Please give her a good consultation, Attorney Han.

57
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,080
Attorney Han, I'll leave it to you, too.

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,050
Mom!

59
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:09,350
I mean, I was talking about my friend, not my son.

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,010
Then, I've got to get back to work. See you later, Auntie.

61
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,090
- I'll leave them in your care, Attorney Han.
 - Yes.

62
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,070
What brings you here for a consultation?

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,000
My husband received all the honors he could get as a soldier.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,420
My children also achieved their dreams.

65
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,220
However...

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm always the only one in the same place.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,000
I'd like to find my life now.

68
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,810
You're right. You can definitely feel that way.

69
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,640
However, I'm sure you can find a way

70
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,630
inside the family without getting divorced.

71
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,530
There are people who become happy after divorce,

72
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,000
but there are also many who regret it.

73
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,570
Ms. Park, give me the papers and please bring us some water.

74
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,580
 Give me some water. 

75
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,170
 Wow, this fellow is good. 

76
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,430
 Since I was young, my dream has been to become a writer. 

77
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,180
 I'm going to rent a studio and write a novel. 

78
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,010
 What do you mean by writing a novel? 

79
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,340
 Why do you need a studio? You can just write at home. 

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,460
 Give me more water. 

81
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,620
 Can't believe he made it in. 

82
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,330
I want to go somewhere else.

83
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,850
H-Hey, why are you all worked up out of the blue?

84
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,150
I'm sorry, Attorney Han. What's the matter?

85
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,150
I said I'm going somewhere else!

86
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,570
I want to get a different attorney.

87
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,880
H-Hey!

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,890
D-Did I offend you in any way?

89
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,880
Not at all.

90
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,960
By the way, Attorney Han...

91
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,960
what about my life, then?

92
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,860
Is it okay for me to just disappear like this?

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,050
Oh, my. What's gotten into her? I'm sorry, Attorney Han.

94
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,900
 Case 10: The dead-end or the last act 

95
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,200
It's a relationship that has solidified over 32 long years,

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,160
so it won't easily change.

97
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,210
My husband says he understands me.

98
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,310
But I'll have to bring him water until the day I die.

99
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,460
It's just that he took that for granted.

100
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,750
It's not that he had ill intentions, right?

101
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,940
You can work it out through talking.

102
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,040
Please try to understand him a bit since you're a family.

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,400
Do you know that's more frightening?

104
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,310
- Hi, Son—
 -  Mom, you know the clothes I wore yesterday? 

105
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,680
 Dry clean them by tomorrow and 

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,340
bring them to the hospital by lunchtime.

107
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm getting together with a friend for lunch.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,450
Gosh, you can postpone that, can't you?

109
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,380
 Geez, you're not even doing anything. Isn't this too much? 

110
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,360
 Water and air that you take for granted. 

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,410
That's what I've become at home.

112
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,060
You also know we can't live without water and air.

113
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,010
It's called empty nest syndrome.

114
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,080
After you send off your children after raising them,

115
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,850
you could have those thoughts.

116
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,020
I'm past 60 now.

117
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,220
No matter what anyone says, I'm going to go through with it.

118
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,280
The divorce.

119
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,900
I understand Auntie Soon Rye, though.

120
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,840
She spent her whole life for her family.

121
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,730
I'm sure she wants to find her life now.

122
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,520
I can understand her, too.

123
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,840
But I'm sad to see the number of gray divorces going up.

124
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,340
Did she come because she couldn't find a solution other than divorce?

125
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,910
I'm sure that's probably why she came this far.

126
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,910
But Attorney Han, I'm surprised.

127
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:44,060
Because you choose to stay single, wanting your career more than anyone.

128
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,980
Choosing to stay single and divorce are completely different concepts.

129
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,310
You think I'd divorce everyone just because I don't want to get married?

130
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,100
No, that's not what I meant.

131
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,490
Since you tend to support an individual's choice when it comes to lifestyle,

132
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,540
I thought you'd understand ladies who'd want to get gray divorces.

133
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,260
The reason I choose to stay single is

134
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,650
because I know how precious a fence marriage is to a person.

135
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,000
We're the last people they see before deciding to divorce. The divorce attorneys.

136
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,950
That's why I become even more cautious when there's no cause for divorce.

137
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,400
Someone nurtures their dream within that precious fence

138
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,760
and another suppresses it in our reality.

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,630
 
  Unni, you didn't forget our meeting today, right? 

140
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,070
How is it going?

141
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,820
Are you relieved that the fact-finding is over?

142
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes. I said everything I wanted to say.

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,010
So the judge will decide properly, right?

144
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,690
You're so little, but you sure played your parents like a fiddle, didn't you?

145
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,450
You were something else.

146
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,450
Was I wrong to do that?

147
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,030
No, you did a great thing!

148
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,820
Out of all the responsible people I've seen—

149
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,530
So, what I'm saying is...

150
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,770
Responsible person. The party involved in a litigation or subject to judgment.

151
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,830
I know it, too.

152
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,440
You were the smartest person I've seen in a litigation, Kim Jae Hui.

153
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,360
I heard Mom and Dad have one last fact-finding left.

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,820
After that, everything will be over, right?

155
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,600
Should we sit down for a second?

156
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,350
Unless there's a settlement, it'll take a bit longer.

157
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,530
A divorce suit is quite long, actually.

158
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,550
The shortest ones last a year, and they can last up to three years.

159
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,510
I know it's tough, but let's hang in there.

160
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,450
I'll treat you to delicious food from time to time, okay?

161
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,530
If there's a settlement right now, will this be over right away?

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,070
That's right.

163
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,700
But settlements fail more often.

164
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,990
I'm going into middle school next year.

165
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,870
What if the news articles spread again?

166
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,720
You're already going to middle school, huh?

167
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,190
I'll do my best, so this ends before then!

168
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,020
Please hurry up and end it.

169
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,240
I already said whom I want to live with and

170
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,070
I don't even want to see Dad anymore.

171
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,940
Yes. I'll do my best.

172
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,380
Eonni, thank you for everything.

173
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,700
- For what?
 - My friends, their moms, and Auntie...

174
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,020
They all looked at me with pity.

175
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,170
But you're the only one who didn't.

176
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,150
You didn't pity me at all and treated me the same.

177
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,880
That's because I don't pity you.

178
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,450
I'm sure it was rough,

179
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,850
but I know you're going to come out stronger, Jae Hui.

180
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,320
You know why?

181
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,380
Because I was the same.

182
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,160
 Daejeong Law Firm 

183
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,740
Yes?

184
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,200
Attorney Cha, do you have some time before you go to fact-finding?

185
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,480
Yes. What is it?

186
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,880
There's a client who wants divorce just to get herself back

187
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,790
when her spouse has no cause for divorce.

188
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,770
That's why most moms decide to get a gray divorce.

189
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,200
She wanted a divorce mediation, so I applied for it.

190
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,430
But should I have convinced her more?

191
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,950
Even if this goes to trial, she might lose because the cause for divorce is lacking.

192
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,290
Applying for divorce mediation was a good call.

193
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,350
Convince? That's where you start being too nosy.

194
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,560
I told you all the time, right?

195
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,570
If the client's decision is firm,

196
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,570
it's the representative's role to make it happen.

197
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:00,020
I just feel bad that the client might get hurt and regret a hasty decision.

198
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,230
Even if she regrets it, that's on her.

199
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,810
All we can do is end their suffering as soon as possible

200
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,810
and get them a lot in the division of property so they can be financially stable afterward.

201
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:19,420
Also, I offered Kim Ji Sang 30% in the division of property.

202
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,980
And Choi Sa Ra was...

203
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,570
I took care of Choi Sa Ra on my end.

204
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,340
Okay.

205
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,140
And Jae Hui wants to end it quickly.

206
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,180
Jae Hui told you that?

207
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes. She wants to end it quickly

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,960
and move forward with her mom.

209
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,300
I see.

210
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,260
Oh, it's here, Attorney Cha.

211
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,050
- Yes.
 - Take care.

212
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,990
Attorney Cha, good luck today!

213
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
Go now.

214
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,530
I did as you told me to, so will you withdraw the plaint now?

215
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,630
I'm going to withdraw the complaint today.

216
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,990
Okay. Now, then.

217
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,390
How does it feel to become a mother?

218
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,910
Can you still trust Kim Ji Sang who betrayed even his own child?

219
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,820
I'm asking if you think such a thing wouldn't happen to you.

220
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,740
You must think you know life just because you memorized some book of laws.

221
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,550
But don't speak out of line when you know nothing.

222
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,770
Yes. I don't know life.

223
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,780
I'm still in the process of learning.

224
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,090
But I'm a divorce attorney,

225
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,710
so I know very well the stats on divorce.

226
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,270
There are people who betrayed once,

227
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,850
but there's no one who betrayed only once. Keep that in mind.

228
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,660
Please come inside.

229
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,030
Out of all the children I met, Jae Hui was the most reluctant one to open up about her feelings.

230
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,790
Jae Hui was the most reluctant one to open up about her feelings.

231
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,180
I didn't force her at all, either.

232
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,260
However, she seemed to open up slowly and

233
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,840
finally stated her position firmly on the last day.

234
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,620
Did she say whom she wants to live with?

235
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,840
Yes. The court doesn't ask those questions directly.

236
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,190
But Jae Hui told me first as if she were pleading with me.

237
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,780
Saying she wants to end the litigation quickly.

238
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,030
I met Jae Hui today.

239
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:41,470
She said she wished that the case would be over before she went to middle school.

240
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,260
What did she say?

241
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,300
Jae Hui said...

242
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,150
she doesn't want to see her father for a while.

243
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,970
Also...

244
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,130
 I can just tell you my decision, right? 

245
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,110
 I decided to live with Mom. 

246
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,580
she said she wants to live with her mom.

247
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,000
Officer, it's indeed my fault that she got to see the ultrasound picture.

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,040
However, I can explain all of that to Jae Hui.

249
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,550
I was going to tell her everything when I met her this time.

250
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,380
But her mom didn't send her, making an excuse saying she didn't feel well—

251
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,930
Saying she was not feeling well was an excuse.

252
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,010
- Look at this.
 - She actually said she doesn't even want to see your face.

253
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,900
But I sugarcoated it and said she was not feeling well.

254
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,410
Explain? What are you going say to her?

255
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,190
Will you tell her you had an affair with Mom's secretary and got her pregnant with Jae Hui's younger sibling?

256
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,590
That again?

257
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,780
You're holding a big weakness over my head, huh?

258
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,420
Do you feel like you've won it all now?

259
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,210
Weakness?

260
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,280
I still thought you were pretty good as a father.

261
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,900
You think a new life is a weakness for you?

262
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,630
Be honest.

263
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,990
I'm sure you're happy about it.

264
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,320
You have to win everything to have it your way.

265
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,950
Kim Ji Sang, wake up.

266
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,210
You and I are Jae Hui's parents.

267
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,900
The fact that Jae Hui is losing her dad is

268
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,110
more important than winning or losing.

269
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,180
That's not the win I wanted.

270
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,300
Don't lie.

271
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,240
You were wishing it'd turn out this way.

272
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,590
You wanted to take away my place as Jae Hui's dad to get your revenge.

273
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,540
You made this happen!

274
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,460
Did I plan this and get Choi Sa Ra pregnant?

275
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,620
Please stop.

276
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,690
Jae Hui loves her dad. That's why she's hurt that much more.

277
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,680
What you can do for Jae Hui as her dad

278
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,750
is to stop your fighting with Jae Hui's mom, don't you think?

279
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:02,870
Officer, I'll be back after talking to Jae Hui just one more time.

280
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,150
I can't lose my child like this.

281
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,320
Even after the divorce, don't mess with my relationship with Jae Hui. This is a warning.

282
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,170
I was going to do my best to do that.

283
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,280
You're the one who threw out your relationship with Jae Hui.

284
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,720
Watch what you say.

285
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,980
I'll protect Jae Hui with my life.

286
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,390
So don't think this is over.

287
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,370
I'm glad you'll protect her with your life.

288
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,180
Make sure you keep that promise.

289
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,250
This is why it would've been nice to end things on good terms in the first place!

290
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,530
"On good terms"?

291
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,780
 The catchphrase of breakups... 

292
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,560
 Let's end things on good terms. 

293
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,650
 Request for Mediation 

294
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,910
Did you have to go this far?

295
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,780
 Sometimes, it's what you say because you're too exhausted. 

296
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,680
Please end things on good terms.

297
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,820
We've lived together for 32 years,

298
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,850
but you want to take half the assets and become strangers?

299
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,990
How can you do this to me?

300
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,410
You're selfish.

301
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,340
I don't want to go to trial, either.

302
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,140
Please agree to end it with mediation.

303
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,600
What the heck is this?

304
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,960
You said your attorney is Cha Eun Gyeong, right?

305
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,240
Let's go to her office tomorrow first thing.

306
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,060
I'd like to hear what she said to lure you.

307
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,020
Sure.

308
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,460
Give me some more water!

309
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,190
 It'd be so nice if we could end things nicely. 

310
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,090
 Does anyone actually even achieve such a feat? 

311
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,380
Representation of both parties is prohibited by the Attorney's Code of Ethics.

312
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,880
We can't consult both people in a party with opposing interests.

313
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,430
- Please go home.
 - Opposing interests?

314
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,190
There's no such thing.

315
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,130
My wife agreed, too.

316
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,030
Sure, then.

317
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,870
Attorney Cha, I saw you on TV.

318
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,350
Just because you're divorcing, you can't treat it lightly when it comes to breaking up some one else's family.

319
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,940
We only provide legal representation.

320
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,730
Preventing divorce isn't our job.

321
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,870
Isn't that what you should've done before things came to this?

322
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:10,880
My parents don't have a dead-end relationship like other couples you've seen before.

323
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,010
My mom changed a bit during menopause

324
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,180
and she just hasn't recovered from it.

325
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,140
I came back today from my honeymoon

326
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,700
and my mom said she's getting a divorce.

327
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,120
I'm so stunned since I just got married.

328
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,260
I'm ashamed to face my husband.

329
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,590
If you want to change your mother's mind,

330
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,760
why don't you give her a chance to talk

331
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,530
instead of cornering her like this?

332
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:50,740
Ms. Lee Sun Rye, your family is so earnest. Please reconsider.

333
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,470
Divorce isn't the only answer.

334
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,760
Jeong Sik's mom, I know you've had a tough time.

335
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,590
I'll compensate you for everything.

336
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,940
Let's take care of our health by going to golf together

337
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,370
and live a simple life like that. Okay?

338
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,470
I don't like golf.

339
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,780
You're being so childish—

340
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,990
I said I don't like golf!

341
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,370
Whenever I said my wrists hurt from doing housework my whole life,

342
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,990
did you even pretend to listen?

343
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,740
Did you even have any interest in what I like

344
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,950
or what I wish to do?

345
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,540
Whenever you changed army posts, we moved to places where we knew no one.

346
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,430
I spent my whole life looking after you.

347
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:02,300
Let me live my life now. Please!

348
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:09,220
Hey, Son, how much longer must I be your maid?

349
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,310
Daughter, you asked me to raise your baby when you have one, right?

350
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,040
That's your responsibility to shoulder, not mine.

351
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,820
- Mom!
 - Jeong Sik's mom!

352
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,480
Gosh, so frustrating...

353
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,500
And, Mr. Kim Yeong Cheol!

354
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,060
Please drink water after you pour it for yourself!

355
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,370
It's not like you're a six-year-old. Can't you get your own water when you're past 60?

356
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,910
Please go get your own water!

357
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,320
What? Lee Sun Rye!

358
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,490
Yes, Lee Sun Rye.

359
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,750
My name is Lee Sun Rye.

360
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,140
I won't ask you to understand everything about me.

361
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:08,270
However, it's so unfair to be misunderstood as a selfish woman, who's abandoning her family

362
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,630
and running away.

363
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:21,810
For the remainder of my life, instead of someone's mom or wife,

364
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,110
I want to discover...

365
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:32,000
Lee Sun Rye who wanted to become a writer.

366
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,950
Are you saying I can't?

367
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,220
Jeong Sik's mom!

368
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,950
I told you not to come in here, didn't I?

369
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,040
- Why?
 - Why else? If we live together during custody—

370
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,550
The fact-finding ended today anyway.

371
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,580
Yes, it's over. It's all over!

372
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,460
Jae Hui said she wants to live with her mom.

373
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,840
Are you satisfied now?

374
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,560
Yes, I'm satisfied.

375
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,320
Baby, it's your turn now.

376
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,370
Daddy will take a look at us now, right?

377
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,950
Hey, Choi Sa Ra, get out. Leave.

378
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,830
- Telling me to get lost again?
 - Get out. Get out of here!

379
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,460
Is this who you really are?

380
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,900
You were like this to Cha Eun Gyeong, too, right?

381
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,100
And you fooled me, acting like you were a good husband and a good dad.

382
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,940
What about you? You went to an innocent child and scarred for life!

383
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,060
And you shamelessly met me as if nothing happened?

384
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
I was deceived first.

385
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,950
Acting like you're the best man in the world! You're despicable.

386
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,880
That's the same for me.

387
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,700
I thought you'd be different from Cha Eun Gyeong.

388
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,600
But you're the worst of them all!

389
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,070
You trash!

390
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,990
- What?
 - Cha Eun Gyeong and Jae Hui abandoned you!

391
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,500
You didn't abandon them!

392
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,290
- Say that again. What did you say?
 - You trash.

393
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,590
- Get out. Get out of here.
 - Trash! You're trash!

394
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,800
Get out of here!

395
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,290
It's a miscarriage.

396
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,040
It's hard to pinpoint the cause of miscarriage,

397
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,750
but you can assume it's mostly due to aberrations.

398
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,220
Now, then.

399
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,080
This seems...

400
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,890
to be the end for us, right?

401
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,430
Perhaps...

402
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,380
the end might've been already decided in the beginning.

403
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,770
You're finally honest.

404
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,280
I should've told you in the first place.

405
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,750
How cruel.

406
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,850
You've never once

407
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,060
felt the same way I did at all?

408
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,940
You never thought about our future, huh?

409
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,070
Leave.

411
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,370
Leave right now.

412
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,710
 It would've been nice to end things on good terms in the first place! 

413
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,320
Jae Hui!

414
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,650
- Who is it?
 - Huh? It's your dad.

415
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,550
- Bye.
 - Bye.

416
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,350
- Let's go.
 - See you.

417
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,350
- Bye.
 - Jae Hui!

418
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,840
Dad!

419
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,620
Kim Jae Hui, don't your friends tease you for running into your dad's arms? A fifth grader?

420
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,990
Why does that matter?

421
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,770
Dad, you didn't forget we're getting pizza today, right?

422
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,240
Of course not. That's why I only saw patients in the morning.

423
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,250
What kind of pizza do you want?

424
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,780
Where are we going?

425
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,480
Can we go to Dad's place for a short talk?

426
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,300
Let's do that.

427
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,350
Thank you.

428
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,230
I have something to tell you, too.

429
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,960
Still, thank you for stopping the divorce.

430
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:40,380
Let me tell you again that it was Ms. Lee Sun Rye's choice, not mine.

431
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,060
Gray divorce isn't a policy regulated by law.

432
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,910
That's why most people call it "gray divorce,"

433
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,240
but the one without financial power loses out more.

434
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,540
A true gray divorce is possible only if you divide up your assets in advance.

435
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,850
And it's wise for both of you to have agreed to this.

436
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:10,380
I'll do everything I'm told to do if I can have her back.

437
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,460
- I'll read you the agreed terms.
 - Yes.

438
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,500
Both parties agree to live separately and

439
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,490
accept that there is no obligation to live together as a married couple.

440
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:32,620
The assets will be split equally between the two parties.

441
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,670
Excuse me. You didn't forget the clause I asked you to add, right?

442
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,490
It's coming up now.

443
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,900
Kim Yeong Cheol can meet Lee Sun Rye twice a month.

444
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,280
Lee Sun Rye will cooperate with this.

445
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,070
What about the clause I wanted?

446
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,640
That one's coming up, too.

447
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,790
After doing their best to restore their relationship for two years,

448
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,010
if Lee Sun Rye wishes to get a divorce two years later,

449
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,230
Kim Yeong Cheol must agree to do so.

450
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,970
Yes.

451
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,540
You both can sign here.

452
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,300
Those clauses are only promises and aren't legally compelling.

453
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,700
However, the fact that you divided the assets and started living separately

454
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,780
will have legal meaning if you get a divorce in the future.

455
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,400
I hope you do your best and become best friends who are married.

456
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,680
I sincerely hope that happens as well.

457
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,540
Attorney Cha, is there anything more I should know in order to get her back?

458
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,190
I'm sure you know now.

459
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,680
Your wife ...

460
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,680
Rather, pay attention to what Ms. Lee Sun Rye says.

461
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,250
Since she sat in the passenger seat all her life,

462
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,110
let her grab the steering wheel.

463
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,680
Thank you, Attorneys.

464
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,420
I think he seems to understand me a bit now.

465
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,840
And since I promised, I'll also try my best for the next two years as you said.

466
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,660
It ended on good terms.

467
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,270
- Where's the water—
 - Aigoo!

468
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,010
Where can I get the water?

469
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,560
I-It's over there.

470
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,830
Oh, yes. Hold on.

471
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,160
My goodness.

472
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,290
 Kim Yeong Cheol got her water only after he was past 60, 

473
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,640
 and Lee Sun Rye also spoke up for the first time, 

474
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,890
 and I stopped a divorce for the first time as well. 

475
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,820
 Everyone acted out of character today. 

476
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,950
 Being out of our usual character showed a future to our relationships. 

477
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,600
Aren't you hungry, Jae Hui?

478
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,890
Do you want some omelet?

479
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,060
You like my omelet the most.

480
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,610
I'm fine.

481
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,860
I'll ask Mom to make me some later.

482
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,510
Gosh, your doesn't know how to make omelet. I'll make you some.

483
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,010
Mom's good at it now.

484
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,500
Really?

485
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,690
Jae Hui...

486
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,460
I heard everything from the family fact-finding officer.

487
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,280
It was tough, huh?

488
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,780
Because of the adults' issues.

489
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,590
No.

490
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,510
Not because of adults' issues.

491
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,120
I had a hard time because you lied to me.

492
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,510
You've been lying to me every day for a year.

493
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,050
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,650
I'm really sorry.

495
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:40,230
A while back, Mom left me at Aunt Sa Ra's place to do my homework one day.

496
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:52,710
I had fallen asleep for a moment and heard your voice.

497
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,890
 - What if Jae Hui wakes up?
 - It's okay. 

498
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,630
You seemed to have stopped meeting her at one point.

499
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,260
So I thought it had ended and was relieved.

500
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,060
I thought I should never tell Mom about it all my life.

501
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,610
Because Mom would get hurt.

502
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,090
But that wasn't the end, was it?

503
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,670
Your lies just grew bigger.

504
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,170
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

505
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,640
I've done an awful thing to you.

506
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,400
You had a chance at the arboretum

507
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,590
and I came to your place many times as well.

508
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,110
But you didn't tell me to the end.

509
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,640
After I saw the ultrasound picture,

510
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,430
I decided I'll be fatherless from now on.

511
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,530
Jae Hui, th-that's not true. She said she wasn't pregnant.

512
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,200
Aunt Sa Ra doesn't have a baby.

513
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,810
I confirmed it.

514
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,660
That's why I came to tell you.

515
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,220
I don't believe you anymore.

516
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,980
I swear!

517
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,800
Aunt Sa Ra was mistaken.

518
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,370
W-Want me to confirm it for you right now?

519
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,810
Jae Hui, live with me, my princess.

520
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,790
I'll make it up to you time and time again.

521
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,790
No. I won't live with you.

522
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,930
You need to be punished if you did something wrong.

523
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,640
The greatest punishment for you is...

524
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,200
 Dad, read this part. 

525
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,600
 I studied in Ottawa, Canada, man. 

526
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,100
 - English is so much fun.
 - Really? 

527
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,910
 Send me to a college in the U.S. when I grow up. I want to go to New York University. 

528
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,830
 No, no, no! Why would you punish me? 

529
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:39,650
 I can't live a day without seeing my daughter. 

530
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,760
 Don't go. Don't go! 

531
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,500
not being able to see me.

532
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,140
Jae Hui, I'm sorry. I was...

533
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,660
I was wrong.

534
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:04,510
I thought your mom was taking you away from me, but that wasn't it.

535
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,080
I... I made you run away.

536
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,740
I'm leaving.

537
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,250
What can I do?

538
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,680
End the suit quickly.

539
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,700
Stop giving Mom and me more hard times.

540
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,410
Get punished if you deserve it.

541
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,860
Okay.

542
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,710
Okay.

543
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,950
♫  Where am I?  ♫

544
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,700
Okay... 
 ♫  I can't figure it out  ♫

545
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,470
♫  But I never breakdown  ♫

546
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,170
♫  If you could lose your way  ♫

547
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:53,470
♫  Don't be afraid, I'll send you the moonlight  ♫

548
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,310
Yes, Mom.

549
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,010
I got a seat on the bus.

550
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,530
I think I'll arrive in the early morning.

551
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,290
Don't wait for me, and go ahead and sleep.

552
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,840
 Honey ♥
 Would you like to delete contact? 

553
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,870
♫  Restless all night  ♫

554
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,320
♫  I'm used to it now, merely  ♫

555
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,230
  Peaceful dawn  

556
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,680
♫ The moment approaches before we know it ♫

557
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,970
♫  Whispering into the dark  ♫

558
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,990
♫  Waiting for dawn to arrive  ♫

559
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:54,390
♫  Feels like this night is endless  ♫

560
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,280
♫  Where am I?  ♫

561
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,760
How was the meeting with your dad?

562
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,260
Good.

563
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,820
All right. Good job.

564
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,200
From now on, let's not have set visitations.

565
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,520
You can meet him when you want to. Okay?

566
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,720
Put your backpack away and come.

567
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,490
♫  Don't be afraid. I will send you the moonlight  ♫

568
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,990
M-Mom, the meat!

569
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,520
The meat? O-Oh, my!

570
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,480
♫   Keeping talks with the moon  ♫

571
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,100
It's burnt.

572
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,840
Mom, this is just charcoal.

573
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,700
N-No, they're not. You can eat this.

574
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,940
 I wonder what other things... 

575
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,180
 I haven't— rather, I couldn't do? 

576
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,420
 Seoul Family Court 

577
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,090
 What can I do? 

578
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,940
 End the suit quickly. 

579
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,330
 Stop giving Mom and me more hard times. 

580
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,160
 Get punished if you deserve it. 

581
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,980
 Plaintiff 

582
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,590
The defendant said he'll let the mom take custody.

583
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,090
Is that true?

584
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,630
Thank you.

585
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,910
Both of you must've gone through a lot with the fact-finding.

586
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,890
Custody is the hardest part to settle. You did great.

587
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,070
We won't set a specific frequency for visitations and will

588
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,130
compromise each time based on Jae Hui's opinion.

589
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,570
Yes, let's do that.

590
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,620
Since you're a famous person, you can't hide

591
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,840
or keep the child away after the divorce, okay?

592
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,920
Can we trust you?

593
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,100
I'll let the child go see her dad whenever she wishes.

594
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,760
As long as her dad

595
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,850
doesn't stop trying until she forgives him.

596
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,920
I'll make sure Jae Hui's wound heals.

597
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,180
That's why I'm agreeing to settle.

598
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,340
All right, now. We have to talk about division of property.

599
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,900
First, tell us the mediation proposal you brought with you.

600
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,480
Give him two billion won, which is half of Ms. Cha Eun Gyeong's net worth, four billion won,

601
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,900
and let's end things once and for all here.

602
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,990
Half is too much.

603
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:25,150
Attorney Han, we handed over the custody, didn't we?

604
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,400
In that case, we're supposed to ask for more.

605
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,930
But I only asked for half, so we can end things on good terms.

606
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,760
That won't work for us.

607
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,180
Raising a child costs even more money.

608
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,510
What kind of absurd logic is that?

609
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,870
It makes sense for us to take more.

610
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,480
This is a court of law.

611
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,820
Let's go to trial, then.

612
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,440
Yes, let's do that.

613
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,120
Both parties, please go outside and talk it out more.

614
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,780
Let's just give it to him and end it.

615
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,670
Half of it does belong to him.

616
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,420
Attorney Cha, you can't.

617
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,920
You said you spend millions of won a month on Jae Hui's nanny and education alone.

618
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,820
Kim Ji Sang is jobless, so he won't be able to pay that much in child support.

619
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,240
We need to bring 60% to balance things out.

620
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,590
It's fine. Just end it.

621
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:42,340
That's the only way for me to look at him as Jae Hui's dad from now on.

622
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,590
Instead of mediating here,

623
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,080
we'll get half if we hold out and go to trial,

624
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,880
so, don't give in.

625
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,050
It's fine. Please just end it with about 30%.

626
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,870
That's nonsense.

627
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,660
The marriage lasted almost 15 years, and you're saying 30%?

628
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,520
You even gave her custody. What kind of a man lacks so much fighting spirit?

629
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,920
Because we have Jae Hui between us.

630
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,980
I can make more money.

631
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,020
It seems you're weak because you've gone through a lot.

632
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,010
But just trust me and hang in there.

633
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,850
I said I'll just end it.

634
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,490
Are you doing this to get more contingency fee?

635
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,840
Listen to your client if you're my representative.

636
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,650
So sensitive.

637
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,800
Everyone in this case is sensitive.

638
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,990
Gosh, I'll just end it here.

639
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,100
 I get to celebrate a wedding anniversary, thanks to you. 

640
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,620
 - Thank you. 
- My great wife. Fighting! 

641
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,260
 Fighting!

 It's Mommy. 

648
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,830
 Yes, it's okay. 

649
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,480
 Honey, I think you'll have to hurry up a bit. 

650
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,430
 - Isn't the water too hot?
 - Jae Hui, it's all done! 

651
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,110
 Were you hungry, Jae Hui? 

652
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:16,120

656
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,770
 One, two, three! 

657
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,500
 - Checkmate.
 - W-Wait! 

658
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,130
 Yes, I won! 

659
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,960
 One, two, three! 

660
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,140
 - One, two, three!
 - It came out nice. 

661
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,560
 - I took a good picture, right?
 - Yes. 

662
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,080
 Han Yu Ri 

663
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,750
 Judge 

664
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,920
All right. Your divorce has been finalized now.

665
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,250
Do you have anything to say for the last time?

666
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,970
I'm sorry, Eun Gyeong.

667
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,920
-  Are you even thankful for me? 
 -  Let's not start this. 

668
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,130
 Is this what you call a good life? Is this even a family? 

669
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,320
 I can't even tell if you're a mom. 

670
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,570
 Must you go this far? 

671
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,880
 Just quit it! I'm sick of this! 

672
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,280
 You are no longer either a wife or a woman, 

673
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,810
 or Jae Hui's mom to me. 

674
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,210
 Maybe... 

675
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,490
 Maybe... 

676
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:18,480
 I also wanted their apology from the beginning. 

677
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,340
Let's raise Jae Hui well.

678
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,270
 Looking at their eyes, 

679
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:47,030
 I could tell how desperately she must've wanted an apology and 

680
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:53,750
 how badly he must've wanted to apologize. 

681
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,310
 So I thought that day's agreement 

682
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:44,820
 wasn't an insecure point full of discomfort or regret, 

683
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:52,430
 but rather a starting point to become better parents. 

684
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,640
What are you doing?

685
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,020
Let's go.

686
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,320
Yes.

687
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,820
Attorney Cha, wait for me!

688
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,300
Jae Hui.

689
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,730
You're home, Mom.

690
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,470
- Are you doing homework?
 - Yes.

691
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,570
All right. Do you need any help?

692
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,530
I know them all.

693
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:26,560
I don't want to see Dad for now.

694
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,880
 
  Attorney Cha, great job today. 

695
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,870
 Please buy me something delicious next time. 

696
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,500
 We need to have a team dinner. 

697
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,260
It's Eonni Yu Ri, huh?

698
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,250
Don't worry about it.

699
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:57,490
Mom, you know you have to thank Eonni Yu Ri properly, right?

700
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,070
She's your attorney.

701
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,190
- I'll go upstairs first.
 - Okay.

702
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,540
 The Little Prince 

703
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,560
Whoa, you're here, Attorney Cha!

704
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,490
Attorney Cha!

705
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:50,650
Gosh, how can you come so late to a gathering you started?

706
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,420
- I'm sorry.
 - The star always shows up last.

707
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,390
Tonight's star is Attorney Cha, you know.

708
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,310
- All right.
 - What the heck is this now?

709
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,720
Ta-da. 
  Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong Divorce Celebration Party 

710
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:06,530
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong, great job hanging in there.

711
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,360
My gosh... 
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong Divorce Celebration Party 

712
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,210
All right. Shall we have a toast?

713
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,390
Of course!

714
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,990
- Great work.
 -  Great work. 

715
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:29,740
Ta-da. Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong Divorce Celebration Party!

716
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,490
What the heck is this now?

717
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,610
Divorce isn't something to brag about.

718
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,240
Aigoo, why can't you brag about it?

719
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,670
You're living a new life now. Great work.

720
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,640
You've got to live happily from now on.

721
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,140
I mean, it's something to celebrate since it ended sooner than expected.

722
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,830
Attorney Han, congrats on a major win.

723
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,440
The VVIP case was something else, right?

724
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,220
You know, huh?

725
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,360
I should be the one to be congratulated.

726
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,650
If the suit lasted longer, I would've lost all my hair.

727
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,690
You see, Attorney Han can't really multitask.

728
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:13,430
But why am I so happy this case is over?

729
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,550
All right. Let me pour you one.

730
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,230
We think our clients will feel so relieved after a long suit ends,

731
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,760
but you know many of them have a tougher time from that point.

732
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,490
You can have those feelings, too.

733
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,550
Whenever you do, feel free to just call us.

734
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:31,960
We can all gather like this for a drink.

735
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,020
I'm thankful, but I'll have to decline.

736
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,810
Let's play separately outside of work.

737
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,610
I have friends, too, you know.

738
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,860
Jae Hui's home alone, right?

739
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,250
She should get going now.

740
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:56,640
Right, she had a long day. We can't keep her too long.

741
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,480
Hurry up and go home to Jae Hui.

742
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,940
Thanks. Thank you.

743
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,520
Please get home safe.

744
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,310
Attorney Han, see me for a second before you go.

745
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,870
- Okay!
 - All right. We'll get going first.

746
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,440
- Yes. We'll go ahead, then.
 - Please get home safely.

747
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:22,390
Do you have something to tell me in private?

748
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,690
Attorney Han Yu Ri.

749
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,990
Yes?

750
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:38,760
Thank you so much for taking good care of my case.

751
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:45,570
My divorce ended well, thanks to you.

♫  I'm also a little afraid  ♫

753

♫  I'm afraid of everything hidden  ♫

754
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:04,180
It was a great decision to choose you to take my case.

you also...

759
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:29,760
did really well.

♫  If that's what happened  ♫

761

You said work and home are your life, right?

762
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,650
 Work and home are my life. 

763
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:55,530
Instead of just an attorney and a mom,

764
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:02,270
I hope you'll also find Cha Eun Gyeong in your life going forward.

01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:29,100
Thank you.

771
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,720
You weren't just helpful.

772
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,340
I can't even imagine what I would've done without you, Attorney Han.

773
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,380
You did really well.

774
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,940

 The dead-end.

 After flipping the last page, 

781
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:12,210
 there's hope anyone can open the first page to a new chapter. 

782
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:19,690
 An attorney perhaps helps a client open to the first page after the last page of a dead end.

I want to go on a trip with you, Mom.

01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,640
Shall we? Should we do that?

787
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,640
- Really? 
- Yes.

788
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,860
Look at the map.

789
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,750
- To see the ocean?
 - Let's go see the ocean.

790
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,700
Okay.

791
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,390
- Or the beach?
 - Great.

792
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:49,030
Great?

793
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:04,840

01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,150
 will we be headed now? 

798
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:38,950


799
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,990
♫  Which one is the right way? ♫

800
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,760
♫  But there's nothing more I can do  ♫

801
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,440
♫  I ... just live on like that  ♫

802
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,220
♫  Each day to me  ♫

803
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:59,040
♫  could be a new day  ♫

804
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,990
♫  I know that very well   ♫

805
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:06,700
♫  Today, you told me again   ♫

806
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:10,310
♫  It's never too late to walk slowly   ♫

807
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:13,310
♫  That was a small consolation  ♫

808
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:16,130
♫  Keep holding on,   ♫

809
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:18,870
♫  In the end, there will be a bright day  ♫

810
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:21,830
 Good Partner 

811
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:25,340
 Even without you, things will run smoothly 

812
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,000
 as if you were never here. So, don't worry, Attorney Cha. 

813
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,220
 That f***ing attorney had an affair with someone else's wife! 

814
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,550
 What are you doing right now? 

815
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,800
 It's the first time you're going at it all alone, Attorney Han. 

816
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,740
 It'd be great if Attorney Cha were here. 

817
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:41,840
 What should I do? 

818
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,320
 It seems no one needs me. 

819
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:53,020
♫  But it's still hard  ♫ 
  ♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫
