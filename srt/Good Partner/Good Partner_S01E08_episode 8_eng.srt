1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,180
 Good Partner 

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,360
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,300
 In Session 

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,880


5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,050
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,480
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,420
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,040
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,080
 Seoul Family Court 

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,940
Let me ask the defendant first.

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,480
What's the reason you must raise the child?

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,990
When you're at fact-finding,

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,630
you must badmouth the mom as much as possible.

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,050
All kinds of small things, too.

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,020
They can't be disproven anyway, so just let it all out.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,070
I raised Jae Hui all alone.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,040
Her mom was mad about her work, so she came home past midnight every day.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,020
- Excuse me, Kim Ji Sang.
 - She has never attended

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,790
her school entrance ceremonies or graduations.

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,150
What are you saying?

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,580
I went to her kindergarten graduation and elementary entrance ceremony.

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,650
She hasn't graduated from elementary yet.

23
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,000
- How dare you lie?
 - Excuse me, Attorney Cha.

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,810
Plaintiff, I'll listen to the defendant first.

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,380
I also studied basic knowledge about childcare, too.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,530
Recently, when she began her first period, I bought her pads.

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,020
You can tell how bad it was, right?

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,480
Is this true, Plaintiff?

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,390
Yes, that part is true.

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,900
But is it an important part of parenting?

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,330
It's not worth listening to.

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,420
I'll be the one to decide that, Plaintiff.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,670
Is there anything else you want to say, Defendant?

34
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,450
If I can say more, I felt bad that her mom wasn't around on the child's birthday,

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,880
so I personally baked a cake and threw a party.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,460
And having to do all parenting alone and the loneliness...

37
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,340
You'd never know it unless you went through it.

38
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,100
Do you have anything to say to rebut this, Plaintiff?

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,140
I was...

40
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,570
financially responsible for the child for the most part—

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,670
For the child?

42
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,260
It was for yourself.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,760
Did you neglect your family for your child's livelihood?

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,040
Of course.

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,400
- Of course, it was for you and Jae Hui—
 - What a nice excuse.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,580
Getting acknowledged and promoted at work,

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,070
and meeting with rich VIPs about their cases

48
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,370
asa more important than your daughter's birthday.

49
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,820
The child cried herself to sleep while waiting for her mom.

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,950
And that's how thirteen years passed!

51
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,500
 She cried herself to sleep again. 

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,700
 She barely sees you once a day. What kind of mom are you? 

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,420
 You're busier these days. 

54
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,710
 Just do what you need to do. 

55
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,290
 As you always have. 

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,410
 We're lovers, but I never considered remarrying. 

57
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,440
 I've already failed at marriage once. Would I want to marry again? 

58
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,840
 Just quit it! I'm sick of this! 

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,220
 Know your place! 

60
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,150
I'll protect you.

61
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,830
You're also a working mom, right, Officer?

62
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,300
Yes, I am.

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,690
Is there any mom who focuses on work because

64
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,670
promotion and sales are more important than her child's birthday?

65
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,480
My only motivation was that

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,840
I had to do that job so I could provide an easier life for my daughter in the future.

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,270
As he said, I admit I was

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,730
negligent to my family in the process.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,550
I'll take care of my child properly from now on

70
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,870
and make sure she grows up into a good adult.

71
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,410
That can never be.

72
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,940
Jae Hui is the only person I have left from my years of marriage.

73
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,940
This woman did everything she wanted.

74
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,190
She has a career and money.

75
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,690
I can never let her have Jae Hui.

76
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,800
Seonbae.

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,340
I had a hearing here.

78
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,650
- Did you just now finish?
 - Yes.

79
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,850
- Going back to the office, right?
 - Yes.

80
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's go together in my car.

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,270
Sure.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
It was hard, right?

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,980
 Episode 8 

84
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,960
It's all going to pass.

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,770
Both you and the Director—

86
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,200
I mean, Kim Ji Sang will be able to live only for Jae Hui

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,240
I hope so.

88
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,250
Thanks.

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,650
I'm surprised he can claim custody

90
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,010
even after what he did.

91
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,870
Do you want some positivity?

92
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,930
There are plenty of people who fight not wanting custody in many cases.

93
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,740
Why not consider it he's refusing to give up on being her dad?

94
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,640
Is that right?

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,060
I thought it might make you feel better.

96
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,070
Let me ask you for a favor.

97
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,770
The official was also a working mom

98
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,440
and she seemed to relate to Cha Eun Gyeong more.

99
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,470
Your daughter will soon be in middle school.

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,200
So, her opinion matters the most now.

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,020
The family fact-finding official will meet with Jae Hui.

102
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,700
, Jae Hui's the one with the final say here.

103
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,270
What do I have to do, then?

104
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,850
In my opinion, you have to think of Choi Sa Ra as a sacrificial pawn.

105
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,120
A sacrificial pawn?

106
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,320
Did you emphasize your financial role and that

107
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,940
she's a female entering adolescence?

108
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,100
As you know, the same sex parent is better during adolescence.

109
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,390
I covered all the territory.

110
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,070
It's up to Jae Hui now.

111
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,180
The home environment study starts soon.

112
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,730
You said Kim Ji Sang decorated a room to Jae Hui's taste.

113
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,320
You need to hurry up and get to it, too.

114
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,900
What does Jae Hui like?

115
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,050
She's not childish enough to choose based on that.

116
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,780
Attorney Cha.

117
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm not saying to gift Jae Hui with stuff to ask her to choose Mom.

118
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,140
I'm saying you should express how much interest Mom has in Jae Hui.

119
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,050
That's a great idea.

120
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,730
How do you know that when you've never been a mom?

121
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,440
I haven't been a mom, but I've been a daughter.

122
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,200
- Hey.
 - What's the case you need me to take?

123
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
You can explain, Attorney Han.

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,230
Oh, yes. It's a child custody case.

125
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,260
The fact-finding report said

126
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,810
the child is more affectionate toward his father.

127
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,010
We've won more or less this case, right?

128
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,570
Yes, you're right. We fought so hard for one year.

129
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,780
He's a high schooler who has a great relationship with his dad.

130
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,410
He said he wants to live with his dad in fact-finding, too.

131
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,950
There's a high chance his mom will give up in court.

132
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,070
You just need to close the case.

133
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,990
Everyone's trial dates overlap.

134
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,870
Okay. I'll go tomorrow.

135
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,560
- Thank you.
 - Thank you, Attorney Jeong.

136
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,200
The child expressed a desire to live with his dad during the fact-finding.

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,630
What do you think about mediating and settling now, Plaintiff?

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,960
Y-Your Honor, there's evidence we'd like to submit.

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,200
Sure, go ahead.

140
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,180
 DNA Test Results 

141
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,940
 Park Ji Hwan and Park Seo Jin aren't biologically related. 

142
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,810
The custody litigation lasted more than a year and

143
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,720
now you say the defendant isn't the biological dad?

144
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,390
Did the plaintiff purposely hide this fact, or did she just find out?

146
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,950
She was aware but couldn't bring herself to tell the dad.

147
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,570
But the biological father showed up and said he'd file a paternity lawsuit.

148
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,830
So, the plaintiff would like to end this custody litigation quickly.

149
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,850
If he's not a biological parent, there'd be no reason to continue the custody litigation.

150
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,880
- Defendant's representative?
 - Yes, we also just received the report today.

151
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,840
So, we'll make the preparations and respond.

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,930
All right. Have the discussion, and the next court date will be for mediation.

153
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,860
- What?
 - She knowingly deceived him for eighteen years.

154
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,510
 They said he's not his son. 

155
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,070
It's painful, but what do we do?

156
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,470
We'll have to end the custody case and file for alimony.

157
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,230
Good job.

158
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,150
I'll call the client and tell him.

159
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,140
Since I was there, I'll try to wrap it up nicely.

160
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,810
 Thanks, Jeong Wu Jin. 

161
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,800
- I'll count on you.
  - Okay. 

162
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,590
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong told me you're a great attorney.

163
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,150
I see.

164
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,990
There's...

165
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,680
an issue we didn't expect.

166
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,440
I was told it's about to wrap up.

167
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,690
Is there a problem by chance?

168
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,120
I think you'll be quite shocked when you hear this.

169
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,260
Did the mom refuse to give up?

170
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,130
My goodness.

171
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,980
Seo Jin said he wants to live with me, for goodness' sake!

172
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,780
Attorney Jeong, please be frank with me.

173
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,240
I've seen all kinds of crap for the past year, so nothing surprises me anymore.

174
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,600
They said Seo Jin...

175
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,880
isn't your biological son, Mr. Park Ji Hwan.

176
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,550
What was that?

177
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,770
Seo Jin's mom submitted a DNA Test Report and

178
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,510
your DNA doesn't match your son's.

179
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,310
Is that how far she's taking this to win custody now?

180
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,170
She's really hitting rock bottom.

181
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,270
I'm sure it was fabricated.

182
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,390
I checked with the other party's attorney about its validity.

183
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,590
They said you can test it yourself if you can't believe it.

184
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,810
What do you mean?

185
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,380
D-Does that make sense?

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,340
Whose son is my Seo Jin, if not mine?

187
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,620
Seo Jin's personality is the same as mine, and

188
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,450
he even looks the same, Attorney Jeong.

189
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,380
Isn't something wrong here?

190
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,660
If he's not my son, whose son is he, then? Huh?

191
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,900
 Case 08: This is how you become a father 

192
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,670
 We'll go ahead. See you tomorrow! 

193
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,790
To be honest, wasn't it boring today?

194
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,210
Did you doze off, too?

195
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,370
I don't even remember what happened from the middle.

196
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,360
 My Everything 

197
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,420
- Are you done with the academy?
 -  Yes. 

198
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,480
What did the court say?

199
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,030
Did the fact-finding official convey what I said to Mom?

200
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,990
 Mom must've been shocked, right? 

201
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,730
Don't worry too much, Son.

202
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,370
 Whatever the conclusion is, 

203
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,550
you'll continue to see both Mom and Dad.

204
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,440
Who could possibly separate us?

205
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,420
Dad, when are you going home?

206
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,020
 Can I come over to play some games? 

207
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,150
Of course.

208
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,240
 Okay, I'll be there. 

209
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,050
- What's this?
 - Come on. Get up! Get up now!

210
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,690
- Back up. Uppercut!
 - Flying kick. Flying kick!

211
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,620
- Flying kick! Flying kick! Flying kick!
 - Upper cut!

212
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,020
 KO 

213
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,270
- I won again.
 - I lost again.

214
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,380
It's boring because I keep winning now.

215
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,200
Get better, please.

216
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,860
I let you win because you're my son.

217
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,480
I need to get going now.

218
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,420
I hope the trial ends quickly so I can live with you.

219
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,110
Did I say I'll let you play games every day if you live with me?

220
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,880
Brush your teeth before you go. You ate chocolate.

221
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
You've been saying that for eighteen years.

222
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,550
I'll do it even if you don't tell me to now.

223
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,290
The talk went well, right?

224
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,150
He seemed to love his son even more than I expected.

225
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,700
We've never had a case like this one, either.

226
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,750
Let's get a verdict with the highest alimony ever.

227
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,550
Let's do that.

228
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,090
It's not something money can compensate for,

229
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,760
but that's our job.

230
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,310
I'll submit the motion to request alimony,

231
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,030
and the repayment of child support paid so far.

232
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,180
Also, request repayment of legal fees he spent for a year on a custody case

233
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,580
over someone else's son.

234
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,330
It's a world where people abandon their own children.

235
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,510
He raised someone else's child with so much devotion.

236
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,810
He needs to be compensated adequately.

237
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,180
 You have to think of Choi Sa Ra as a sacrificial pawn. 

238
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,410
 A sacrificial pawn? 

239
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:52,090
What kind of a judge would give custody to a guy who's living with his mistress?

240
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,690
Also, what kind of a daughter would go to a dad who had an affair with a lady she knows?

241
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,480
Distance yourself from Choi Sa Ra as much as possible.

242
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,190
About what I told you last time...

243
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,600
When you asked me if we'll live together after I divorce—

244
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,890
I heard the answer then, so you don't need to explain it further.

245
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,050
It's not too late to think about it

246
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,490
after your divorce is taken care of.

247
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,140
No, you and I are in different situations.

248
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,440
I don't think it's right to confuse you by not being clear with you.

249
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,970
You said you only want to date me.

250
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,550
You have no interest in marrying me.

251
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,500
You came to tell me that?

252
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,360
I think you said enough last time.

253
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,920
After going through fact-finding once,

254
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,500
I don't have the energy to care about other things.

255
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,870
I've got a visitation with Jae Hui this week, and

256
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,680
I'll still be Jae Hui's dad even after I get the divorce.

257
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,040
I'd like you to stop talking about those things for a while.

258
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,950
What about our baby, then?

259
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,660
Are you saying Jae Hui will receive her dad's care

260
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,690
and our baby can be abandoned?

261
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,370
"Our baby"?

262
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,190
I'm pregnant.

263
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,100
What?

264
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Eight weeks.

265
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,770
No way.

266
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,820
Are you sure?

267
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,090
- Are you ready?
 - Yes.

268
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,070
You're spending only one night, and you'll study?

269
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,640
My homework. There's a hard question that I'm going to ask Dad about.

270
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,630
Oh, is that so?

271
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,870
You don't like it?

272
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,470
What do you mean?

273
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,850
You haven't had the time to have fun with Dad.

274
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,970
I was worried you'd only be studying there.

275
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,800
So, someone from the court is coming to Dad's place, right?

276
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,430
Yes.

277
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,140
Just relax.

278
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,810
You can say whatever you want.

279
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,380
- It's Dad. I'll get going.
 - Okay.

280
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,980
 Dad! 

281
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,050
A trial revealing he's not your son?

282
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,740
I think these cases are the most difficult ones.

283
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,630
Non-legitimation suit.

284
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,670
Just the title makes you sad, doesn't it?

285
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,060
D-Don't you think so, Attorney Jeong?

286
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,290
You're right. It's denying he's your biological son.

287
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,620
It does break your heart.

288
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,090
Oh, hello, Attorney Cha.

289
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,610
I attached Park Ji Hwan's DNA testing result and

290
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,950
- filed the complaint for a non-legitimation suit. 
- Okay.

291
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,170
The fee for the additional case was paid, right?

292
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,600
Yes, I confirmed the payment.

293
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,200
She's as cold as ever. For such a sad suit like this...

294
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,810
Moo...*
("Suit" and "cow" are homophones in Korean)

295
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,880
Anyway, thank you.

296
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,340
Please take care of this case, Divorce Team 2.

297
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,330
- Yes.
 - Yes.

298
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,760
- Dad, give me a coin.
 - I'll throw you in.

299
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,410
You get wet, too!

300
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,470
Awesome!

301
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,970
All right. One, two, three. One, two, three.

302
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,340
One, two, three!

303
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,770
Whoa, your legs are 3 meters long.

304
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,840
All done here.

305
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,020
Since we came around this time last year, it's been about a year.

306
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,130
Did you know I brought you here

307
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,390
every year during the flower festival since you were one?

308
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,050
Yes.

309
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,180
But why did we always come here?

310
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,190
It feels like our memories are growing together

311
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,410
when I come to the same place as you grow older.

312
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,930
 - Daddy!
 - Sweetheart! 

313
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,420
 Aigoo, there you go. 

314
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,720
 Let's go! 

315
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,400
 What a good girl. 

316
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,680
Ms. Kim Jae Hui, is it fun to ride the merry-go-round at your age?

317
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,790
- Yes!
 - Really?

318
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,870
I prefer these things over always looking for a new thing.

319
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,490
True. You always liked old things.

320
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,520
That's why you rarely throw things out.

321
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,080
I've never seen you get tired of something you like.

322
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,590
You're right.

323
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,390
Mom's doing well, right?

324
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,000
She acts strong and fine every day.

325
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,150
It's the same deal.

326
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,690
Jae Hui.

327
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,620
Even if you live with me, you can see Mom as much as you want.

328
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,120
So don't worry about Mom too much.

329
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,430
 Drop off Jae Hui tomorrow and come with me to the gynecologist. 

330
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,440
Rest in your room, Jae Hui.

331
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,030
I'll bring you some strawberry juice.

332
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,560
Jae Hui.

333
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,370
This is the fact-finding official.

334
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,250
- Hello.
 - Hi.

335
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,900
This is Jae Hui's room, huh?

336
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,760
Please come in.

337
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,230
We'll talk just the two of us.

338
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,820
You can take a break outside for a moment.

339
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,310
Oh, yes.

340
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,460
Thank you.

341
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,460
 - Please sit.
 - Thank you. 

342
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,740
First off, it'd be right to explain to you what I do.

343
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,450
The court wants to know what kind of relationship

344
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,870
your mom and dad have with you

345
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,240
as your parents and where the best environment is for you, Jae Hui.

346
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,100
And I have the duty to confirm these things.

347
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,720
In the end, you came to ask me questions like,

348
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,270
"Do you like Mom or Dad more?"

349
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,750
No, it's not like that.

350
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,790
Mom and Dad won't live together anymore,

351
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,000
but as your parents, they'll still—

352
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,220
I've heard that more than enough now.

353
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,600
I plan to talk honestly only after the adults are honest with me first.

354
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,040
Jae Hui, do you want me to read you a book?

355
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,050
It's fine.

356
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,700
Goodnight.

357
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,370
 I was financially responsible for the child for the most part— 

358
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,830
 It was for yourself. 

359
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,870
 The child cried herself to sleep while waiting for her mom. 

360
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,080
 And that's how thirteen years passed! 

361
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,590
♫  Whispering into the dark  ♫

362
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,770
♫  Waiting for dawn to arrive  ♫

363
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,260
♫  Feels like this night is endless  ♫

364
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,300
 It is the time you have spent on your rose 

365
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,860
 that makes your rose so important. 

366
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,100
 But you must not forget it. 

367
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,620
 But you must not forget it. 

368
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,760
You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.

369
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,460
You're responsible for your rose.

370
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,960
I like this part the most.

371
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,090
You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.

372
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,740
You're responsible for your rose.

373
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,290
Whoa, me, too.

374
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,930
You know you're the rose to me, right?

375
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,220
Read me some more.

376
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,340
Hey, Kim Rose, you read it now.

377
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,850
I've been reading this book for more than ten years now.

378
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,040
Let me graduate, please.

379
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,520
No, I want you to continue to read this to me forever.

380
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,480
It's more fun, and I sleep better.

381
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,610
Really? Okay, then. I'll keep reading it for you until you get a sibling.

382
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,900
 You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. 

383
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,770
 You're responsible for your rose. 

384
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,860
 Dear Jae Hui ... 

385
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,660
 this is how you waited for me every night. 

386
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:25,160
♫  Where am I? I can't figure it out  ♫

387
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,850
♫  But I never break down  ♫

388
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,560
♫  If you could lose your way  ♫

389
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:41,780
♫  Don't be afraid, I'll send you the moonlight  ♫

390
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:49,640
♫  Keeping talks with the moon  ♫

391
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,350
 You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. 

392
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,300
 You're responsible... 

393
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,470
 You're responsible... 

394
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,000
-   for your rose. 
 -  for your rose. 

395
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,350
You're back.

396
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,690
Oh, that—

397
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,450
It was so dusty!

398
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,250
I took it down for a second to wipe it.

399
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,660
Let's hurry up and get ready for school. I'll drop you off.

400
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,100
- Get changed.
 - Okay.

401
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,380
I told you not to come here. What if someone sees—

402
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,230
I don't care if they see me or not.

403
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,070
It was nice to spend the night with Jae Hui after a long time, right?

404
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,520
You must've had a lot on your mind.

405
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,710
- Good job.
 - I can't go to the hospital.

406
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,710
They said to bring the dad.

407
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,140
Who goes to a gynecologist in the middle of a custody case?

408
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,060
You're starting to wear me down. Why are you so inconsiderate?

409
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,920
You spent two entire days with Jae Hui,

410
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,990
but you won't see our baby getting ready to come into the world?

411
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,440
How can they be the same?

412
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,890
How are they different?

413
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,980
All lives are equal, but the situations are different.

414
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,240
I don't want a fight.

415
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,800
Fine.

416
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,120
Let's just say I won't make these demands until the suit ends.

417
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,640
What happens after it ends, then?

418
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,340
I told you. I'm not getting married, and I'll live with Jae Hui.

419
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,550
I thought I made it clear.

420
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,500
Just because you don't marry me, it doesn't mean you're not the dad.

421
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,350
I'm sorry.

422
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,380
I also need some time to think. However,

423
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,730
it won't happen right now.

424
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,690
If we fail to get custody of Jae Hui,

425
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,470
our baby can live with his dad, too, right?

426
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,660
Well, I'm sure that will never happen.

427
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,590
But if Jae Hui ends up living with her mom, let's think about it then.

428
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,530
Since we filed a non-legitimation suit,

429
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,820
your paternal relationship will be wrapped up, too.

430
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:46,030
And we'll do our best to make sure you get the child support payments back.

431
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,810
Attorney...

432
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,830
I want to withdraw this suit.

433
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,150
I asked to see you today to tell you this.

434
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,280
Sorry? Y-You can't.

435
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,230
If you don't straighten out your paternal relationships,

436
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,850
you have to leave the inheritance for your son later

437
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,880
and Seo Jin's mom might request child support after the divorce, too.

438
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,190
I think your judgment is a bit blurred by your emotions right now.

439
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,380
Everything you said is right.

440
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,630
I also know you're looking out for me.

441
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,070
But I was the one deceived by that woman.

442
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,740
It isn't my son's fault.

443
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,850
No one said it was Seo Jin's fault.

444
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,890
We're saying you should protect yourself.

445
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,110
I'm doing this also to protect myself.

446
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,110
It's because...

447
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,760
if I even have the paperwork done,

448
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,440
saying Seo Jin isn't my son...

449
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,330
I don't think I can live. I'm sorry.

450
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,990
No, Mr. Park Ji Hwan.

451
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,700
I still don't think this is right. You must think carefully.

452
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,140
You must think rationally here.

453
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,330
You'll have to pay child support when he's not your child—

454
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,850
No! He's my son.

455
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,970
I don't care about her taking my money for child support.

456
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,180
Thank you for giving me time to talk.

457
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:39,600
By chance, did you get pregnant?

458
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,700
- You saw it, huh?
 - Didn't you purposely leave it there so I see it?

459
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,320
N-No, it's not like that!

460
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,990
I also think about you a lot.

461
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,510
Why would you think about me?

462
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,080
That's because we're close.

463
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,250
Aren't you being too much to me here?

464
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,950
I'm still in elementary school.

465
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,710
Come on. You're all grown up.

466
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,510
It seems your mom and dad treat you like a kid.

467
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,730
You'll be in middle school soon.

468
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,360
But I think you're all grown up now.

469
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,820
I even helped my mom with her business at your age.

470
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,840
Is that child...

471
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,060
my dad's child?

472
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,630
Yes. He's your younger sibling.

473
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,800
You'll be a good eonni (older sister) to Sarang (Love), right?

474
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,080
Sarang?

475
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,800
Does my mom know about this, too?

476
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,330
No, if your mom found out, she would be very hurt,

477
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,590
the lawsuit will drag on, and there'll be news articles, too.

478
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,580
Did you even apologize to my mom?

479
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,780
Jae Hui, I'm sorry.

480
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,870
The adults are at fault.

481
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,230
But you got a lot of love from Dad.

482
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,610
And your mom really needs you, too.

483
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:03,260
Can you please tell the fact-finding official that you want to live with your mom?

484
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,090
I'm so sorry.

485
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,070
I asked if you apologize to my mom, not me!

486
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,460
   
 Jae Hui, where are you? 

487
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,720
 On my way home. 

488
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,880
Jae Hui.

489
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,530
- Hello.
 - Hey.

490
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,170
What are you doing here?

491
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,490
Did you come alone?

492
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,650
I was just passing by.

493
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,860
Want me to get your mom for you?

494
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,290
I can really go alone. You can leave.

495
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,390
I know you're a smart one, Jae Hui.

496
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,410
But I'll still see you get on the bus.

497
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,970
Where are you going? Home or academy?

498
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,900
I don't know where to go.

499
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,960
You have to go home.

500
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,940
Which home?

501
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,260
My mom's or my dad's?

502
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,590
When I was about your age,

503
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,470
I also had complicated matters at home.

504
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,720
So, I think I might know how you feel.

505
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,870
So, did those complicated matters get resolved?

506
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,690
Of course.

507
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,150
They all passed by.

508
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,230
But I am still reminded of them at times.

509
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,210
 Daejeong Building 

510
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,980
Get home safely.

511
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,140
Hello?

512
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,340
Let me.

513
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,880
I'm sorry, Attorney Jeong...

514
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,190
for asking you to come at this hour.

515
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,710
I just had no one else to talk to.

516
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,550
Yes, I understand.

517
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,630
Who could you possibly talk to about such matters?

518
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,070
You can lay it out on me.

519
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,930
Dad!

520
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,100
Hello.

521
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,880
You must be Seo Jin.

522
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,580
Yes.

523
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,140
- I came because I hadn't heard from him in a while.
 - I see.

524
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,520
The study room is nearby.

525
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,650
I always ate the tonkatsu Dad made here for dinner

526
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,100
or as a night snack and went home.

527
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,800
- He said he was drinking with you tonight.
 - Oh gosh.

528
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,380
You get along with your dad.

529
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,650
My dad has high blood pressure, so he shouldn't drink this much.

530
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,320
There isn't anything wrong, right?

531
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,380
Of course not. Nothing's wrong.

532
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,250
Aigoo, it's my son. When did you come?

533
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,050
Dad! Wake up.

534
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,730
We're almost home.

535
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,200
Aigoo, my son is the best.

536
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,070
Don't go anywhere.

537
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,130
I won't.

538
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,150
What's gotten into you today, Dad? The attorney's with us, too.

539
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,830
Today's the visitation day.

540
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,220
I'll sleep over.

541
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,110
Don't go anywhere. Don't go anywhere.

542
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,500
Do you resemble your dad a lot, Attorney?

543
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,880
No.

544
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,070
We look nothing alike.

545
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,070
I see.

546
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,350
My dad and I are spitting images, right?

547
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,510
Yes. You're a spitting image.

548
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,600
Here we go. Today is—

549
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,780
- Omaek. (Dried squid and beer)
 - Whoa.

550
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,090
That's right. Great job. It's squid and beer.

551
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,830
Do you remember how I told you about Kim Ji Sang's affair for the first time?

552
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,550
Right, right. You said it's about your friend's friend.

553
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,320
Attorney Han, you're really a poor liar.

554
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,030
- Do you know what you said back then?
 - Huh?

555
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,140
What did I say?

556
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,270
 If my future wife should ever cheat on me, 

557
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,580
 it's over right away. 

558
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,590
 Why live with her? There are plenty of women out there. 

559
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,190
You said there are plenty of women out there.

560
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,950
Gosh...

561
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,840
That was only a few months ago, but my opinion about those matters

562
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,850
changed a bit.

563
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,060
What did Mr. Park Ji Hwan say?

564
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,270
He said he wants to live as Seo Jin's dad as long as possible.

565
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,720
Do you still find divorce cases fun, Attorney Jeon?

566
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,760
Did you know you're a bit contagious, Attorney Han?

567
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,990
I'm already infected with the obsession virus.

568
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,320
It was tough for you, too, right?

569
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,620
That's why I called you over like this instead of going straight home.

570
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,530
Before doing this work, I thought a divorce was where

571
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,130
one person was at fault and

572
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,010
the other person decides to break up,

573
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,150
not much different from a breakup in dating.

574
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:29,210
However, it wasn't just a breakup between a man and a woman.

575
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,760
You know, the "best interest of the child" that comes out in our textbook?

576
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,040
The principle stating one must prioritize the child's happiness.

577
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,850
Watching Mr. Park Ji Hwan today, I just realized what it meant.

578
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,600
Fighting.

579
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,140
- Fighting.
 - Cheers.

580
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,010
 Thank you for your time! 

581
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
What does Mr. Park Ji Hwan want to do?

582
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,660
He wants to withdraw the non-legitimation suit.

583
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,640
I totally understand not wanting to

584
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,370
separate on paper when he raised his son himself.

585
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,900
But after the statute of limitations expires two years later, he can't sue her again.

586
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,070
Shouldn't we try to convince him strongly?

587
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,700
I think it's meaningless to tell him more about legal standards now.

588
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,820
Let's forget about the non-legitimation suit.

589
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,890
We can make sure he doesn't lose on alimony and child support.

590
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,820
I'll leave it up to your judgment, Attorney Jeong.

591
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,310
I got it.

592
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,180
- We'll be back.
 - Take care.

593
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,420
- Please take care.
 - Take care.

594
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,190
 Mediation Room 

595
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,580
 Plaintiff 

596
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,930
I've worked at the court for over a decade, but I've never seen this before.

597
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,400
Please give an explanation, Plaintiff.
  Plaintiff 

598
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,880
I'm sorry.

599
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,410
Don't you think you should apologize to the defendant, not the mediator?

600
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,990
I'm sorry.

601
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,030
How can you do this?

602
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,590
Did you see that bastard throughout our marriage?

603
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,700
Were you all a lie?

604
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,480
It was just once.

605
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,670
Once? You say once?

606
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,620
So, once is okay?

607
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,360
You even got the DNA testing done. Why did you continue the custody battle for a year?

608
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,370
Were you trying to conceal your wrongdoing by using Seo Jin and me?

609
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,680
Were you even going to send Seo Jin to me if I won?

610
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,530
Can you still call yourself Seo Jin's mom? Huh?

611
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:55,370
It was also very hard for me to keep lying.

612
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,240
Why are you saying you'll raise my child?

613
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,600
Isn't he also my child?

614
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,580
Seo Jin wants to live with me!

615
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,450
Think about Seo Jin!

616
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,060
I couldn't do it any longer.

617
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:13,510
When you asked me for a divorce,

618
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,710
I thought it was because of my shortcomings.

619
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,950
Since I'm just a bum who fries tonkatsu.

620
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,560
Let's just say you can do that to me.

621
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,310
But how can you do that to Seo Jin? How could you?

622
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:40,900
The Defendant must've been in enough pain from the fact he was deceived,

623
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,960
but he's only been worried about Seo Jin the entire time.

624
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,100
He decided not to impose any legal measures to prevent

625
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,850
Seo Jin's shock from finding out about this later.

626
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,910
Seo Jin's mom.

627
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,230
Please keep this a secret from Seo Jin for the rest of his life.

628
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,840
That's the only thing I want.

629
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,420
Please just...

630
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,160
let me live as our son's dad.

631
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,530
 Chief Mediator 

632
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,270
I'd like to propose an offer to the Plaintiff.

633
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,280
Though we can't take the custody,

634
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,290
let's settle on having no limitations on the frequency or dates of visitations.

635
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,570
We can't do that.

636
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,200
He's not even the biological father. Let's keep it at two times a month.

637
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,190
Did you forget how he withdrew the refund of the child support request and

638
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,980
the non-legitimation suit when he's not the biological father?

639
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,580
And if you limit the frequency of visitations now...

640
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,140
It's eighteen years.

641
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,850
He raised his son with love for eighteen years.

642
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,200
Let's settle on having Seo Jin's dad be able to

643
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,130
see Seo Jin as often as he wishes.

644
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:10,480
Thank you so much for making it possible for me to keep seeing my son.

645
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,420
Not at all.

646
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,410
You're father and son.

647
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:20,670
Seo Jin would've come often to see his dad on his own, even if it weren't for us.

648
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,970
Yes. His mom also gave up on the division of property,

649
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,440
so it's the same as getting a refund for child support.

650
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,630
Thank goodness for small favors.

651
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:36,880
Yes. I'm going to live the rest of my life as Seo Jin's father

652
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,270
and do my best so Seo Jin doesn't find out about this secret.

653
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,730
- Aigoo, I-I'll get going.
 - Okay.

654
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,620
Yes, Son!

655
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,500
Yes. Where are you?

656
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,350
Right, you're sleeping at Dad's place today.

657
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,210
Is there anything you want to eat?

658
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,530
All right. See you.

659
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,950
You were great today.

660
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,140
Aigoo, good work.

661
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,780
Good job.

662
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,010
Good job.

663
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,700
Aigoo, not at all.

664
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,560
I'm going to take off first today.

665
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,780
It's fact-finding.

666
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,190
All right. Take care.

667
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,310
Seonbae!

668
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,870
Huh?

669
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,910
It'll all be okay, so don't worry too much.

670
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,280
Thanks.

671
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,850
 Attorney Jeon Eun Ho 

672
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,650
- Attorney Jeon.
 - Yes.

673
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,600
How did Mr. Park Ji Hwan's case end?

674
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,880
Well, it ended nicely.

675
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,160
But why am I feeling kind of sad today?

676
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,250
You did really well.

677
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,290
 Attorney Jung Wu Jin 

678
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,940
Your room's so pretty, Jae Hui.

679
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,390
Did your mom decorate it?

680
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,420
Yes.

681
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:52,580
Mom and Dad are both busy filling up my rooms with things I like all of a sudden.

682
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:57,660
It feels like getting ten years' worth of Christmas presents at once.

683
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,490
You're really humorous, Jae Hui.

684
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,520
Well, do you think you'll be able to tell me how you feel today?

685
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,920
I can tell you just the conclusion, right?

686
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,850
Oh, I-I was going to ask if you'd like something to drink.

687
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,570
I see...

688
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,530
It's done.

689
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,460
You finished early.

690
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,750
There was no need to make it long.

691
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,370
Oh, really?

692
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,880
That's great, then.

693
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,110
I'll get going now.

694
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,120
- Yes, thank you.
 - Bye, Jae Hui.

695
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,210
- Thank you for the ride.
 - Sure.

696
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,000
By the way, Attorney Cha, did something good happen?

697
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,330
What good can possibly happen in the middle of a custody suit and fact-finding?

698
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,240
Exactly.

699
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,130
But why do you look happy?

700
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,260
I said I'm not.

701
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:36,980
The fact-finding report said Jae Hui has been continuously refusing to share her feelings so far.

702
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,670
Could it be she said she'll live with her mom? Did she?

703
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,380
I only have a guess, too.

704
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,290
But it seems Jae Hui decided to live with me.

705
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,540
She said she's glad it's over.

706
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,140
Jae Hui actually asked me, to be honest.

707
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,900
She asked if the trial would end if she told the fact-finding official

708
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,150
she wants to live with you.

709
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,900
Really?

710
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,730
My guess must really be correct, then.

711
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,720
It's certain.

712
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,950
She'll be in middle school soon, so her opinion will matter a lot.

713
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,790
You won't have to worry about custody now.

714
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:25,360
Be at ease during the final fact-finding now.

715
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,420
Thanks, Attorney Han.

716
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:34,300
Wh-Why does it feel so awkward?

717
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,400
Telling me to decorate the room with things Jae Hui likes...

718
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:47,060
Rather, telling me to express how much I care about Jae Hui helped a lot.

719
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,790
Jae Hui seemed relieved after the last home environment analysis.

720
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,940
Is it okay for me to know what you talked about with her?

721
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,760
Jae Hui didn't speak up during the first fact-finding.

722
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,790
She kept saying I needed to be honest for her to be honest as well.

723
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,960
 I plan to talk honestly, 

724
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,360
 only after the adults are honest with me first. 

725
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,390
When we meet children during fact-finding,

726
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:25,590
children sometimes claim that adults are lying.

727
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:34,640
Could it be because it's hard to accept that their parents are divorcing?

728
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,500
No.

729
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,150
Children say that if their parents force them

730
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,660
to believe something different from what they know.

731
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,630
What do you mean by that?

732
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,200
Jae Hui knows everything.

733
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,260
Yes, well...

734
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,140
- regarding her dad's affair, I—
 - No.

735
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:06,230
She said she knew her dad had an affair with Auntie Sa Ra before her mom did.

736
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:16,050
 Attorney Cha, Jae Hui is totally Little Cha Eun Gyeong. 

737
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,630
 Y-You knew all about it, Attorney Cha? 

738
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,630
 I mean— I thought you didn't know— 

739
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:24,200
 You thought I wouldn't know? I wouldn't? 

740
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,760
Please take a look.

741
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,070
 The child was already aware of the defendant cheating with Choi Sa Ra before the plaintiff knew. 

742
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,530
I wasn't a baby anymore.

743
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,880
But I guess Dad and Auntie Sa Ra thought I'd never know.

744
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,780
You're here?

745
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,470
Where's Jae Hui?

746
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:00,070
She fell asleep while doing homework.

747
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,010
- What if Jae Hui wakes up?
 - It's okay.

748
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,940
 He lied to me in front of my face. 

749
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,000
 I've never seen you get tired of something you like. 

750
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,020
 Even if you live with me, you can see Mom as much as you want. 

751
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,370
 So don't worry about Mom too much. 

752
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,900
I even gave him a chance, but he kept lying to the end.

753
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:06,330
Also, it's very difficult for me to speak up about this one.

754
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,800
Wh-What is it?

755
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,120
Please tell me everything.

756
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,880
She said she has a half-sibling now.

757
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,680
It seems she saw an ultrasound picture at her dad's place.

758
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,250
- What did you say?
 - Jae Hui asked me to keep it a secret from her mom.

759
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,310
How can she hide this from me?

760
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,040
In fact...

761
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,200
How come you didn't tell your mom, at least?

762
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,570
Mom also keeps lying to me to protect me.

763
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,390
I want to protect her efforts.

764
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,220
Because I don't want to be a burden.

765
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,740
 Just like how every parent loves their children in their own ways, 

766
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:09,510
 every child might also be trying so hard every moment 

767
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,190
 to protect the way their parents love them 

768
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:16,840
 and their sincerities. 

769
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:23,400
 Could that be the way children love their parents? 

770
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,510
 Who is it? 

771
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,430
 Who is it? 

772
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,590
Who are you—

773
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:24,930


774
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,080
Father.

775
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,460
♫  A peaceful dawn,   ♫

776
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,720
♫  The moment approaches before we know it  ♫

777
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,760
♫  Restless all night  ♫

778
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,380
♫   I'm used to it now, merely  ♫

779
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:52,310
♫  Whispering into the dark  ♫

780
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:00,590
♫  Waiting for dawn to arrive  ♫

781
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,810
♫  Feels like this night is endless  ♫

782
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,290
 Good Partner 

783
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:18,470
 She's our client, but Jang Seon Ah is really an evil woman. 

784
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,950
 I said the guy hit on me first. 

785
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:24,270
 I think I'll need a sincere apology to live. 

786
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:28,230
 She said she'd rather get a forced apology from you than money. 

787
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,450
 You need to pull yourself together even more at times like this. 

788
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,140
 I don't think I deserve to be a mother. 

789
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,400
 To what extent do I get involved?
