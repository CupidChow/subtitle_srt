11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,899
Who is it?

12
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,600
Who is it?

13
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,839
I said, who is it?

14
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,209
What are you doing? How dare you?

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,449
Ms. Cha.

16
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,449
You better tell me the truth.

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,020
Are you pregnant?

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
I am. So what?

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,130
You're pretty much divorced.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,929
Did you tell...

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,600
Jae Hui about it?

22
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,398
Did Jae Hui say that I told her?

23
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,399
Answer me!

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,240
Did you tell her?

25
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,740
Jae Hui found out on her own.

26
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,140
She said when she went to her dad's house,

27
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,050
she saw the ultrasound picture.

28
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,119
When she went to her dad's house,

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,850
she must've seen the ultrasound picture.

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
Hey.

31
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,020
How do you know that?

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,059
Did you meet her again?

33
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,229
She called me first.

34
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,769
She deserves to know.

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,539
That she's getting a sibling.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Let me go.

37
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:25,049
You shouldn't have messed with my daughter.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,578
You should've left her alone!

39
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,579
Let me go.

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,119
- Do you have a death wish? - Unhand me.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,149
I'll kill you.

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,919
- Come here. - Unhand me.

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,489
- Come here. - Unhand me.

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,430
No. My baby.

45
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,359
Go away.

46
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,810
She learned that her dad was...

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,250
having an affair with Aunt Sa Ra...

48
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,250
before you did.

49
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,259
Dad is having an affair with Aunt Sa Ra, isn't he?

50
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,560
Did you watch the news?

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,190
It's never Aunt Sa Ra.

52
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,698
I knew you'd say that.

53
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,960
It really isn't.

54
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,630
Does it get easy to lie when you become an adult?

55
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,910
(Case 09: A Half Apology)

56
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,180
- Thank you. - Thank you.

57
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,889
Get ready for the shoot.

58
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,930
Okay.

59
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,079
The next story.

60
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,280
"Hello. I'm eight months pregnant."

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,810
"I think my husband is cheating on me."

62
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,249
"To bring this to the surface,"

63
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,449
"I can't handle it when I'm pregnant."

64
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,519
"To let it slide, it's torture every day."

65
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,389
The end of the story.

66
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,960
Ms. Cha, does it happen often?

67
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,589
Yes, that's very common.

68
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,600
Well...

69
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,629
Especially in the early or late stage of pregnancy,

70
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,599
the doctors advise couples...

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
to avoid sexual intercourse.

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,339
Those who fail to control it...

73
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,910
often cheat on their spouses.

74
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,109
But their babies are coming soon.

75
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,410
How is that possible?

76
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,679
I'm shocked that it's common.

77
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,119
Any advice for those who are going through this?

78
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,390
It shall pass.

79
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:00,369
Oh, no.

80
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,879
Ms. Cha.

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,280
People will see you.

82
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,979
Let's go to Yu Ri's house.

83
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,789
Good job.

84
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:25,489
I'm proud of you.

85
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,760
I couldn't have done that.

86
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,229
You need to do that to avoid getting sick at heart.

87
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,129
What am I...

88
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,640
What am I going to do about my daughter?

89
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:38,840
What's wrong?

90
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,280
Did she find out?

91
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,979
She knew all along.

92
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,249
Oh, my goodness.

93
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,119
Kids that age are very sensitive.

94
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:07,070
The fact that she couldn't even tell that secret to her own mother...

95
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,419
I feel so bad about that the most.

96
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,119
I...

97
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,460
I guess I don't deserve to be a mom.

98
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:31,090
That's not true. Don't say that.

99
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,460
The one that doesn't deserve to be a parent is her dad.

100
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
It's not your fault.

101
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,439
You must pull yourself together especially in times like this.

102
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,869
Don't let them sway you.

103
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,850
- I... - Yes?

104
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,090
I have to go.

105
00:06:58,549 --> 00:06:59,549
Okay.

106
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,960
Thank you.

107
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,929
Ms. Cha.

108
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,799
Yes?

109
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,999
One thing is clear.

110
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,330
It all passes.

111
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,010
By all means necessary,

112
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,780
you must protect the most precious being in the world.

113
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,650
That's what I want to say.

114
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,519
The person in the story will find it...

115
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,618
- That day, what I saw wasn't... - very helpful.

116
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,619
This is Attorney Cha Eun Kyung.

117
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,959
Attorney Cha Eun Kyung but my client who filed for a divorce,

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
("All About Divorce")

119
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,390
Jae Hui's mom.

120
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,998
I hoped the divorce process...

121
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,429
wouldn't harm Attorney Cha Eun Kyung.

122
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,299
And I sincerely rooted for Cha Eun Kyung the mother...

123
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,609
to be confident again.

124
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,910
That's awesome.

125
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:58,850
Jae Hui.

126
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,350
- I'm on the phone. - Sorry.

127
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,749
I know.

128
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,419
Really?

129
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,090
That's crazy.

130
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,890
So what did you do?

131
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,260
How can you do that? You need to tell me.

132
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,900
- That looks so good. - Of course.

133
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Here. Try it.

134
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,270
Pork belly and soju here are the best.

135
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,878
The date for Choi Sa Ra's compensation...

136
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,580
for an affair is coming soon.

137
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,379
What are you planning to do?

138
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,290
Lawyers your age let the law have control over them.

139
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,358
You need to take advantage of it, not let it sway you...

140
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,859
to be the real attorney.

141
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,259
I'm trying to figure out what Ms. Cha really wants.

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,659
Instead of letting the law sway my decisions,

143
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:53,070
I'm trying to think of a way to use the law to our advantage.

144
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,440
Not because she's my boss,

145
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,470
but as her attorney, I want to give my client exactly what she needs.

146
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,978
To do that, you must eat a lot more. So you can keep your spirits up...

147
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:05,479
and work hard. You know?

148
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:09,050
Besides, she's not just any client. She's Ms. Cha.

149
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,619
On top of that, if you can get exactly what Ms. Cha needs,

150
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,019
that will make you a top-tier attorney. You know?

151
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
Thanks.

152
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,600
In my eyes, Kim Ji Sang was a dirtbag husband.

153
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,769
But up until now, I gave him credit for being a good father.

154
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,139
That's what I thought after meeting Jae Hui.

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,080
But...

156
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,709
- I was wrong. - Gosh. What are you talking about?

157
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,779
He's not a good father.

158
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,509
He cheated on his wife and got a woman pregnant.

159
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,450
That's the plot for a trashy soap opera.

160
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,720
He betrayed not only his own wife...

161
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:45,290
but also his daughter.

162
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,590
He shouldn't have gone that far.

163
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,700
Cheers.

164
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,869
- Cheers. - Hang in there.

165
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,269
That's not my fault.

166
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,210
He tried to seduce me first.

167
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,439
If anyone has to pay compensation,

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,340
the one who started this should pay.

169
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,649
Everyone would've fallen for him when he put on his charms like that.

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,119
You're an adult who has free will.

171
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,959
It's not like he tried to take advantage of a minor.

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,159
"He seduced me first, so I'm innocent."

173
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,358
Is that the argument you want me to make?

174
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,060
Yes. You got it.

175
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,430
That's it.

176
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,269
It doesn't matter who seduced whom first.

177
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,009
Dating a married man makes your relationship an affair.

178
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
Ms. Han.

179
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,840
How did you pass the bar?

180
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,479
- What? - Why can't you understand me?

181
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,220
I didn't have an affair.

182
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,590
He committed illicit sexual acts under false promises of marriage.

183
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,649
I'm the victim here.

184
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,529
That law has been abolished.

185
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,599
Dating a married man is illegal.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,699
You're obligated to pay compensation.

187
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,769
Why is that a crime?

188
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,800
The adultery law was abolished.

189
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,369
Didn't you know that?

190
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,470
She knew the adultery law was abolished...

191
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,009
but didn't realize the law on false promises of marriage was too.

192
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,940
Darn the selective knowledge.

193
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,979
If you're not going to do what I want, why would I buy you?

194
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,519
I'm not some object you can buy.

195
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,388
I'm not up for sale.

196
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,389
Whatever.

197
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,790
I'm here to meet with Ms. Cha.

198
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,759
Can you get her for me?

199
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Gosh, seriously.

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,540
Are you the victim?

201
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,109
Why are you getting all worked up again?

202
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,778
She won't admit...

203
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,779
to her wrongdoing the whole time the trial goes on.

204
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,790
And...

205
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,489
it might be too much for you to represent her in court.

206
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,489
She doesn't understand why she's obligated to pay compensation.

207
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
This isn't my first rodeo.

208
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,868
What do you think is the likelihood of encountering affair partners...

209
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:14,570
who acknowledge their wrongdoing?

210
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,570
Are you still that naive after meeting Kim Hui Ra?

211
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,239
What about Choi Sa Ra?

212
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,710
It's not a case you have to take on.

213
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,519
You read the family investigator's report.

214
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,590
I did.

215
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,459
Why don't you turn this one down?

216
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,959
If you want to be picky with your clients,

217
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,159
open up your own firm later.

218
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,859
This firm belongs to the CEO, not you.

219
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,970
Ms. Cha. Are you sure you can handle it?

220
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,869
Don't forget who I am.

221
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,009
Don't worry about me.

222
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,149
Which part of the complaint makes you feel wronged the most?

223
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,690
It says that I seduced him.

224
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,229
That's not true.

225
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,060
He told me that he was getting a divorce soon.

226
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,199
You could fall for it if he was a good liar.

227
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,269
Right?

228
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,369
The one who lied is at fault, right?

229
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,379
You fell for your husband's lie too, didn't you?

230
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,849
But lying about an impending divorce...

231
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,378
and deceiving you that he was unmarried...

232
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,379
are two different things.

233
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,249
The former will constitute as an affair.

234
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,590
They are different.

235
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,888
He lied to you that he was getting a divorce soon.

236
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,619
But nonetheless, he clearly let you know he was married.

237
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,359
That can't be an excuse.

238
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,960
Are you sure you guys are on my side?

239
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,100
How could my own attorneys try to make a victim look guilty?

240
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,310
You also deceived his wife.

241
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,139
How come you think you're the only victim?

242
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,979
Let me explain.

243
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,550
First of all, his wife provided cause.

244
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,290
Let's be honest. He wasn't the only one at fault in this marriage.

245
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,190
You provided cause for it.

246
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,600
How did you two meet?

247
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,200
I met him when I went to open a phone account.

248
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,739
Can't you just do it for me?

249
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,139
If you want to open a phone account for your family member,

250
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,680
you must bring their ID card and the family relation certificate.

251
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,310
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:48,489
Sa Ra?

253
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,259
Hello. I'm Kim Ji Sang. I heard a lot about you.

254
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
Hello.

255
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,859
We've never met. I'm sorry to trouble you.

256
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
No.

257
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm sorry that my wife asked you to run a personal errand.

258
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:04,369
Here's the family relation certificate.

259
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:15,619
That jerk was determined to seduce me.

260
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,618
(Daejeong)

261
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,659
Gosh. Director Kim.

262
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,290
Hello, Sa Ra. I figured that Eun Kyung might be busy.

263
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,999
Yes, go ahead.

264
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800
What's wrong? Are you sick?

265
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,629
My wife must have given you too much work.

266
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,269
Did you get sick due to overworking?

267
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,710
Stop by the hospital later. You must.

268
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:40,879
Okay.

269
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:45,979
You can see how unfair this is now that you heard the whole story.

270
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,489
So you're saying he pretended to text you by mistake...

271
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,889
which ended up reassuring you about the divorce, correct?

272
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Yes.

273
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,159
I thought their marriage was over before I got involved.

274
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,800
It was enough for me to think that he was practically single.

275
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,170
Director Kim, should I get a divorce?

276
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,399
(Secretary Choi Sa Ra)

277
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,710
- Hello. - Director Kim.

278
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,310
Don't you see?

279
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,810
Since you were certain, you went to a motel with him that day.

280
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,378
Yes.

281
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,878
He told me he was getting a divorce, so I didn't think much of it.

282
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,518
But he kept bringing you to motels and didn't get a divorce, right?

283
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,919
He told me that he was trying to settle.

284
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,719
He said he might have to file a lawsuit.

285
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,659
He kept stalling time.

286
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:32,358
But I saw photos...

287
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,300
of their weekend trip on social media.

288
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:39,229
Look.

289
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,040
I guess he only needed to get laid.

290
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,170
No.

291
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,109
That jerk...

292
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,680
loved me a lot.

293
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,710
He probably still does.

294
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,149
But he just can't leave his wife because she's so scary.

295
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,220
So that's how you think.

296
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
So...

297
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,198
do you think it's unfair that they didn't get a divorce?

298
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,770
You bet!

299
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,769
I dated him because he said he was getting a divorce.

300
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,299
I truly loved him. But because he didn't get a divorce,

301
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,740
that makes me a victim.

302
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,080
So that's your logic.

303
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,709
A victim...

304
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,020
His wife is a complete wacko.

305
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,550
How could anyone not cheat on a woman like her?

306
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,689
I don't want to pay a dime.

307
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,290
I can't pay compensation because it's not fair.

308
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,990
You'll help me, right?

309
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,770
If you didn't want to pay a dime,

310
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,369
you shouldn't have had an affair.

311
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,208
Well, you don't think your wrongdoing...

312
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,439
will get wiped away by hiring an attorney, right?

313
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,850
You're my attorney.

314
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,179
Should you be saying that I'm in the wrong?

315
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:06,250
Legally speaking,

316
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,658
she was explaining to you it was impossible to end the lawsuit...

317
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,230
without at least paying some compensation.

318
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,659
Gosh. I really don't have any money.

319
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,600
So even if the ruling says I have to pay compensation, I won't.

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,099
I can't.

321
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,939
Let them do whatever they want. I'm broke anyway.

322
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,310
Your time is up.

323
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,179
Why don't we stop here for today?

324
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,290
Come in.

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,628
(Attorney at law, Jung Woo Jin)

326
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,030
Mr. Jung.

327
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,699
Yes. What's this about?

328
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,740
Ms. Cha...

329
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,840
is very emotional.

330
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,510
She's not like herself.

331
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,448
What can I do...

332
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:11,590
to calm her down as her attorney?

333
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,590
I know just the trick.

334
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,719
Not because I'm a more experienced attorney...

335
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:18,530
but because I've known her longer.

336
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,129
What's the trick? Can you tell me?

337
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:27,639
Tteokbokki.

338
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,969
Pardon? Tteokbokki?

339
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,209
Did you say tteokbokki?

340
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,540
(Railroad Diner)

341
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,780
So you know this diner too.

342
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,750
Listen to her while having tteokbokki.

343
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,490
Even if she gets lost,

344
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,819
she'll come back to her place...

345
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,730
all on her own before you know it.

346
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,129
Did you have a chance to talk to Jae Hui yesterday?

347
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,669
Telling the investigator about it must have liberated her.

348
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,409
She was giggling and talking to her friends like her old self.

349
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:13,850
So I didn't have it in my heart to bring that up again.

350
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,790
I need to...

351
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,020
reveal Choi Sa Ra's pregnancy at the trial.

352
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,330
We don't have enough evidence to prove it.

353
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,100
Should we use Jae Hui's statement...

354
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,099
to get the court order to confirm...

355
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,500
Choi Sa Ra's pregnancy with her hospital?

356
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,100
Let's hold off for now.

357
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,939
Right now, what matters the most is Jae Hui's feelings.

358
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,290
What about you?

359
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,859
What could we do to make you feel better?

360
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:03,958
Please teach me what I should do to bring a win for my client...

361
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:04,969
for cases like this.

362
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,800
I'm your attorney, after all.

363
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:09,699
I'm not sure.

364
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,909
If you want to get a lot of money for alimony,

365
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,719
I'll negotiate with the opposing counsel.

366
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:27,688
If you want to leak it to the media and end their social lives,

367
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:29,290
I'll meet with a reporter right away.

368
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,429
Just like you taught me, I'll accommodate to...

369
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,730
and follow my client's wishes.

370
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,840
Thanks, Yu Ri.

371
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,780
I'll always look for the best way to help you...

372
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,609
to keep it balanced,

373
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,419
just like you said.

374
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,629
Let's eat.

375
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,659
Okay.

376
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,550
Hey, Choi Sa Ra!

377
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,760
Don't yell at me.

378
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,590
Our baby is listening.

379
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:43,799
Did you think Jae Hui would pick her mom...

380
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,399
if you told Jae Hui about this?

381
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,169
I didn't know you could stoop so low.

382
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,699
You're right. I told her.

383
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,909
I'm a mother who must protect her child too.

384
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,039
Then did you think...

385
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,280
you'd get your way and start a family with me?

386
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,649
Of course we should. You're the dad.

387
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,719
Too bad, Sa Ra.

388
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,919
You won't get your way.

389
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:10,520
What will you do, then?

390
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,730
Will you give up on both kids?

391
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,659
I don't think Jae Hui will say she'll live with you.

392
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:21,969
Get lost.

393
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:25,609
What...

394
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,240
- did you say? - As of this moment,

395
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,209
don't show yourself again.

396
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,609
I told you our baby's listening!

397
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,080
Can you prove it's my baby?

398
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,590
Don't call me again.

399
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,999
- Is that her? - Cha Eun Kyung?

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,010
- Isn't that the lawyer? - Gosh, it is.

401
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,639
Jae Hui.

(Infinite Solution Math Academy)

403
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:07,850
This is my mom.

404
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,719
She's a lawyer, like I said.

405
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,419
- Hello. - Hello.

406
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,919
I'm Jae Hui's friend, Min Seo.

407
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,520
She talked a lot about you.

408
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,820
That you're famous and appear on TV.

409
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:18,959
I see.

410
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,158
Sa Ra, Da Hyun.

411
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,398
- Bye. - Goodbye.

412
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,428
- Bye. - See you tomorrow.

413
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,459
See you again.

414
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:25,969
- Mom. - Mom.

415
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,070
Jae Hui.

416
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,570
I'll take that.

417
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,780
What are you doing?

418
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,149
I'll come by more often, when I can.

419
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,519
Other moms come before their kids go to another academy...

420
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,119
and hand-feed them snacks.

421
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,060
I'm grown up now, but I wanted to do that.

422
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,159
You don't have to come often. Just sometimes.

423
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,240
I start middle school soon,

424
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,709
so you won't have to come as often.

425
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:11,879
I heard you know everything.

426
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:15,419
All adults are the same.

427
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,250
She said she'd keep it a secret.

428
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,219
It was hard, wasn't it?

429
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,929
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,030
I won't see Aunt Sa Ra anymore.

431
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,128
Don't worry about anything...

432
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,600
and tell me everything from now on, okay?

433
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,310
But...

434
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:41,010
if Aunt Sa Ra has the baby,

435
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,209
will it be my legal sibling?

436
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,990
Let's go.

437
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,469

This is from Jang Seon A's opposition.

443

(My husband and I...)

447
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,899
"I was convinced my husband was having an affair,"

448
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,800
"but I was pregnant and afraid to open Pandora's box."

449
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:15,669
"Let's think only of the baby I'm carrying."

450
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,639
- "'It can't be.'" - "It can't be."

451
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,040
"It can't be," I told myself as I avoided the issue.

452
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,080
You're home.

- Oh, my gosh. - Goodness.

454
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,520
Well done. You haven't eaten, have you?

455
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,290
- No. - Hang on.

456
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,490
Goodness.

457
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,490

Who is it?

460
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,080
A troublesome client.

461
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,040
They always call late at night.

462
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,648
I felt the woman...

463
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:03,020
penetrate deep into my husband's life.

464
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,649
Did you get home safely?

465
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,119
Yes. I loved the atmosphere of the place we went to.

466
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,090
Is this our first day as a couple?

467
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,739
The doctor says I need more insulin.

468
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
The number went up.

469
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Really?

470
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,270
Yes.

471
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:34,919
I'm so tired today.

472
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,949
When are you not tired?

473
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,718
We haven't done it in two weeks.

474
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,959
I have diabetes, high blood pressure,

475
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,419
and a huge belly, and you still say that?

476
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,458
Not many men are as good...

477
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,030
to their pregnant wives as me.

478
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,030
Says who?

479
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,699
Forget it. Is pregnancy a privilege?

480
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,709
Unlike what my husband said,

481
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,679
in my case,

482
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,879
pregnancy incapacitated me.

483
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,750
My priority was to have a smooth birth,

484
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,549
so I decided to...

485
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,590
gather evidence after I had the baby.

486
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,149
Then one day, when I was almost full-term...

487
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:15,389
- Honey. - What?

488
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,590
I heard we can't do it for a while after you give birth.

489
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,359
Can we do it today?

490
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,730
Can't you wait at least until after the birth?

491
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,869
We came all the way here.

492
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,270
Wait.

493
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,399
Can you take your hands off my belly?

494
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,439
Sorry. Someone's calling.

495
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,639
Hello?

496
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,010
Yes, that's me.

497
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
What?

498
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:42,449
You're who?

499
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,790
Hey.

500
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Who are you?

501
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,090
What's wrong?

502
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,290
Your...

503
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,100
Your lover's in the hotel lobby.

504
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Honey.

505
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,769
Are you okay?

506
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,109
- What should I do? - Hey.

507
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,280
After I gave birth,

508
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
he begged.

509
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,149
He begged me to sort it out.

510
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,249
He said he dated her because I couldn't...

511
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,750
satisfy him while I was pregnant.

512
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,260
I wanted an apology,

513
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,230
so I met the defendant after I gave birth.

514
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,358
- All I heard... - You failed to...

515
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,829
was that I was an assailant who didn't take care...

516
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,299
- of my husband... - I'm the victim here.

517
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,899
and that she was a victim.

518
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,840
I know she's our client,

519
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,750
but I just don't think this is right.

520
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,879
Jang Seon A is a nasty piece of work.

521
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,119
She wanted an apology.

00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:30,619
She will have a half-sibling.

524
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,889
How could you hide this from me?

525
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,100
She wanted an apology.

00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,750
(Seoul Family Court)

528
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:04,060
Come in.

530
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,310

533
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,919
He brings home one or two grand a month.

534
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,050
We can't afford to hire an attorney.

535
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,119
"We?"

536
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:37,760
See? You're a con artist duo.

Please keep quiet.

540
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:51,199

542

You're a real fraud.

00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:20,469
Did you see the look in her eyes?

548
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,540
I swear they con people for a living.

549
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,939
She wants hundreds of thousands?

550
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:27,509
I couldn't believe what I heard.

551
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,580
Ms. Jang.

552
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,139
Yes?

553
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,879
Can you do as I say?

554
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,889
I apologize for the disruption my client caused.

555
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,290
She acted that way...

556
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,229
because she was infuriated by the fact that the plaintiff's husband...

557
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,859
deceived her by saying he would get a divorce.

558
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,760
She's well aware of what she did wrong.

559
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,138
I'm not sure.

560
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:57,800
(Defendant)

561
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,010
I don't believe that.

562
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:09,719
How about...

563
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,460
receiving a sincere apology instead of alimony?

564
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,089
Right here.

565
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,460
She wanted an apology.

566
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,869
I can say with certainty that hundreds of thousands...

567
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,270
won't make you feel better, as you said.

568
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,610
You should get an apology instead.

569
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:48,449
If I could erase the memory...

570
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,029
If my baby...

571
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,299
could be born again...

572
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,500
from a happy mom and not this mangled one...

573
00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:15,110
You know how I feel, don't you?

574
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:19,350
You're going through the same thing.

575
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,199
(Defendant)

576
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:38,469
I'm very sorry.

577
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:43,739
Do you mean that?

578
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
Yes.

579
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,679
I did you wrong.

580
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:56,989
Ms. Jang.

581
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,429
Live with the guilt of what you did to her and her child.

582
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,299
Your foolish actions...

583
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,100
stripped a child of its right to be loved by both parents,

584
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,210
and traumatized the plaintiff for life.

585
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,940
Don't ever forget that.

586
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,440
Do you understand?

587
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Yes.

588
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,810
I'm sorry.

589
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,730
(Arbitrator)

590
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,440
Ms. Cha, you were awesome.

591
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,709
- What do you mean? - You put on a show...

592
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,750
so I wouldn't have to pay up. You're a real professional.

593
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,819
Don't be mistaken.

594
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,850
That wasn't a show.

595
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,389
I don't have to pay alimony, and my record's clean.

596
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,619
This must be why people say you're good.

597
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,629
A drama character said you shouldn't...

598
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,259
scrimp when hiring a lawyer.

599
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,059
You have my seal of approval.

600
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,400
Don't go too far.

601
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,170
Are you a psychopath?

602
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,000
Okay, fine.

603
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,940
She's just like my high-school ethics teacher.

604
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,779
Do you think I got you off because I was good at my job?

605
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,279
Didn't you?

606
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,888
You said you could do anything...

607
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,349
if you didn't have to pay,

608
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,419
and the plaintiff said she'd rather get a forced apology...

609
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,159
than take your money.

610
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
I noticed that and facilitated an agreement.

611
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,560
So don't thank me.

612
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,029
I hope your apology meant something.

613
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,670
Now go.

614
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,110
Okay.

615
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,069
I just don't get Park Chan Seong's wife.

616
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,639
She suffered so much when she was pregnant,

617
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,909
but she ended up forgiving her husband...

618
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,420
and not taking any money from his affair partner.

619
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,549
We won, and that's that.

620
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,089
Both parties got what they wanted,

621
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,060
so let's call it a win on both sides.

622
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,699
I heard it costs a lot to raise a child.

623
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,569
If I were her, I'd take...

624
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,940
some of her money than a fake apology.

625
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,940
It's possible that...

626
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,610
a fake apology was a bit better than dirty money.

627
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,389
- Hello? - Ms. Han.

628
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,929
Park Chan Seong wishes to be connected.

629
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,770
- Sure, put him through. - Just a second.

630
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,040
- Yes, this is Han Yu Ri. - Ms. Han.

631
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,179
I heard she apologized to my wife.

632
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,339
Thank you.

633
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,109
One might think...

634
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,380
that you're innocent in all this and aren't the guilty party.

635
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,150
You said it like you're the victim.

636
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:23,790
Ms. Han, I feel wronged.

637
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,959
When my wife refused to have sex with me,

638
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,690
- that girl approached me... - And seduced you?

639
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,790
Exactly.

640
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Gosh.

641
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:32,699
You two are exactly the same.

642
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:35,270
But it's true. She seduced me first.

643
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:38,540
I advise that you of all people...

644
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,770
sincerely apologize to your wife.

645
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,810
And raise your child well. Goodbye.

646
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,190
Raise your child well?

647
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:04,099
Saying that to someone who wasn't your client or the opposing one...

648
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,670
is inappropriate, to say the least.

649
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:09,469
All I wanted...

650
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,270
was for him to feel a little bit of remorse...

651
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:17,639
and finally be a good father and husband.

652
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,678
Darn.

653
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,520
It was foolish of me to hope for that.

654
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,190
Why am I this foolish?

655
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,230
You're not a fool.

656
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:38,929
What?

657
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,339
There's a good chance that what you said...

658
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,639
is right.

659
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,449
What did I say?

660
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,130
I appreciate what you did.

661
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,730
The last thing I wanted was that minx's money.

662
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,799
I was aware of it.

663
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,270
Well...

664
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,710
That woman, Jang Seon A.

665
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,750
How was she in your presence?

666
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,810
What do you mean?

667
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:31,819
Was she not sorry for any of this?

668
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:35,189
That's not true.

669
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,130
Everyone gets defensive when in court.

670
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,089
Just think of it that way.

671
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Right.

672
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,600
- But... - Yes?

673
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,810
May I ask why you're not divorcing him?

674
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,279
Because I want...

675
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,319
his heartfelt apology.

676
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,830
I see that he hasn't apologized yet.

677
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,860
He has.

678
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:17,199
However,

679
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,369
I don't want him to apologize just because...

680
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:23,469
he doesn't want to be divorced and out of our child's life.

681
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,040
An apology from the heart.

682
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:29,739
I need one in order to move on.

683
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,580
You should also receive one as well.

684
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,150
Sure.

685
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,860
Maybe...

686
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,670
Maybe...

687
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,110
it was...

688
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,509
an apology from them that I wanted.

689
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,750
That might be why...

690
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,750
I was reluctant to divorce him.

691
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:02,639
(Railroad Diner)

692
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,710
- That was delicious. - Tell me about it.

693
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:09,138
- Welcome. - Hello.

694
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,210
- Gosh, hello. - You're here.

695
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,409
- Mr. Jun, you're here too. - Right.

696
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:14,409
Gosh.

697
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:16,819
It's not like Yu Ri is just over the drinking age,

698
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,650
but she drank more than she could handle.

699
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,830
Mr. Jun, can you make sure Ms. Han gets home?

700
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Yes, of course.

701
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,659
- Yu Ri. - What?

702
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,500
Get up. Let's go.

703
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,099
- What? - Come on.

704
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,698
- I... - Here we go.

705
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:39,838
- But I... - We'll get going.

706
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,569
- Get home safely. - Watch your step.

707
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,810
Goodness.

708
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,310
My gosh.

709
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,520
Unbelievable.

710
00:45:55,049 --> 00:45:56,659
During the decade we've been colleagues,

711
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,330
you never once asked me to join you for drinks.

712
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,729
But here you are asking for help...

713
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,230
only because Yu Ri was drunk.

714
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,799
Thanks for coming.

715
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:08,830
Sir, can I get an extra glass?

716
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,040
Sure.

717
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:20,778
(World's No.1 convenience store)

718
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:21,980
Drink this.

719
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,460
The offender went around saying she's the victim...

720
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:35,259
and didn't even pay for any damages.

721
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,500
After striking a halfhearted apology...

722
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,130
and deceiving the court and the victim,

723
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,940
she went on her way.

724
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,969
Meanwhile, Choi Sa Ra thinks her pregnancy is to be proud of...

725
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,610
and shamelessly told Jae Hui the first second she got.

726
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,719
Those monsters.

727
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,019
Why are you getting emotionally immersed in your cases?

728
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,819
Just look at yourself. Shouldn't you save your energy?

729
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:11,330
Ms. Cha said to me earlier...

730
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,600
that she wanted an apology...

731
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:21,610
from Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra.

732
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:30,020
An apology?

733
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,089
That's the only thing us attorneys can't provide.

734
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:37,819
Oh, no.

735
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,889
I know you worked hard on this case.

736
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,100
I don't know...

737
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:51,739
if I'm doing a good job as her attorney.

738
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,610
How much am I supposed to do for her?

739
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,900
You seem to be drunk.

740
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,670
That should be your last drink.

741
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:29,380
I have...

742
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:33,210
been doing a lot of things I haven't done before.

743
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,449
I've been cleaning up after Yu Ri,

744
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,989
divorcing my husband,

745
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,190
and cooking for Jae Hui.

746
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,699
You should see how picky...

747
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:54,199
that little mouse is with her omelet.

748
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,509
You know you're having it rough.

749
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,650
Have I been having it rough?

750
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,319
Only you never seem to realize it.

751
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:29,569
I'm always clueless about everything.

752
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,210
I announced a divorce of the century...

753
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,440
and claimed I'd put on an entertaining show.

754
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,489
But I have no idea about what I want...

755
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,489
or what Jae Hui wants.

756
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,330
I know nothing.

757
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,630
Taking a look into your own heart.

758
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,409
That's what you should've done first.

759
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:14,009
A divorce show? Promoting the firm?

760
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:18,819
Forget about that.

761
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:21,989
Only think about yourself.

762
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,360
You must know...

763
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,560
that it's what's best for Jae Hui too.

764
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:30,699
Yes.

765
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,929
You're right.

766
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:38,739
I didn't know that either.

767
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,009
A little longer.

768
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,440
Hang in there a little longer, Eun Kyung.

769
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:21,949
What was that?

770
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,350
I'll call you a cab.

771
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
Oh, right.

772
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,750
What time is it?

773
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:34,690
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

774
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,330
Ms. Cha, can you meet me outside?

775
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:45,698
I always have breakfast.

776
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:47,439
- No wonder you're late. - Good morning.

777
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,610
- I skip mine. - What?

778
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,779
It's Choi Sa Ra.

779
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,009
It's Choi Sa Ra. Sir, it's Choi Sa Ra.

780
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,110
- Seriously? - No way.

781
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,710
- Unbelievable. - What a joke.

782
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,080
Why is she here?

783
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:57,719
She has some nerve.

784
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:00,019
- Who's here? - No way.

785
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,150
Is she out of her mind?

786
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,420
- Isn't that Choi Sa Ra? - Ms. Cha's coming out.

787
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,860
- Unbelievable. - Tell me about it.

788
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,540
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

789
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,560
- What is the meaning of this? - What I did was wrong.

790
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,699
I'm sorry.

791
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,069
What do you think you're doing?

792
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:56,679
- Get out of here this instant. - I wanted to apologize.

793
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,210
I wronged you...

794
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:04,350
and Jae Hui.

795
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,350
Why now?

796
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,360
Are you terrified of karma now that you're pregnant?

797
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,830
Or is this a show to negotiate a lower settlement?

798
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,699
It's nothing like that.

799
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:24,600
To build a good life with my child,

800
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,069
I knew I had to apologize.

801
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:29,880
I see.

802
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:32,739
This is to lessen your guilt.

803
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,319
I have nothing to say to you,

804
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:40,889
so leave.

805
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,739
Was this your doing?

806
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:37,009
Rather than one's dirty money,

807
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,110
you said...

808
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,779
you preferred a fake apology.

809
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,249
Did you tell her I'd settle for less...

810
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,449
if she apologized?

811
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,790
No.

812
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,259
No deals were made.

813
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,869
I spoke to Choi Sa Ra...

814
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,670
who was a mother-to-be...

815
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:08,509
and not as just another woman.

816
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,279
Apologize to Ms. Cha.

817
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,250
That's what you came to say at this late hour?

818
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:17,520
If you want to be a proud mother to that child,

819
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:21,790
apologize to her from the heart.

820
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:29,900
You did good.

821
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Thanks.

822
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:47,250
Hang in there a little longer.

823
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,719
We're almost done.

824
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,819
She may not have meant it,

825
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,400
but I can at least tell Jae Hui...

826
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,799
that I received an apology and that I'm all right.

827
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,429
She doesn't have to worry about me...

828
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:12,339
and can lean on me like the child she is.

829
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,639
At least I can tell her that.

830
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:23,520
Thank you.

831
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,060
The simple notion...

832
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,690
that is to apologize for wrongdoings and seek forgiveness...

833
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,159
is lost on us as adults.

834
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,468
I honestly didn't cheat on my wife.

835
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:43,299
My wife suffers from delusional jealousy.

836
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,939
We loved with all our hearts and are not ashamed.

837
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,009
I want custody of our child.

838
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,838
Look who's calling the kettle black.

839
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:50,839
Where's your proof?

840
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,408
How is that a crime? I'm the victim here.

841
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,179
Are you still childishly angry with me?

842
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:01,449
We also forget that we don't have forever to deliver our apologies.

843
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,718
(Han Myeong Jong)

844
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:06,889
Did my dad...

845
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:11,560
even want to apologize to us?

846
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,270
You got some eggshell in there.

847
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:20,739
Got it.

848
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,279
Don't I seem like an expert at this?

849
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,750
As if.

850
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,420
All right.

851
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,299
- Mom. - Yes?

852
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:51,739
I'm sorry.

853
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,920
Children blame themselves for other people's wrongdoings,

854
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,860
and adults blame others for their misconduct.

855
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,330
There are terms and conditions attached to apologies from adults,

856
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,529
and none are from the heart.

857
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:22,969
No.

858
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,380
I'm the one who's sorry.

859
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:07,750
Even a halfhearted apology...

860
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:13,750
can be a lifeline to someone desperate.

861
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,460
That, I learned.

862
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,169
(Good Partner)

863
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,940
She doesn't want to see her father.

864
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,469
I don't need Dad anymore.

865
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,779
- You're despicable. - It's over.

866
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,210
It's over now!

867
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,678
What matters more than winning or losing...

868
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,850
is the fact that Jae Hui is losing her father.

869
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,779
Those who did wrong should be punished.

870
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,150
Jae Hui wants the divorce to be wrapped up.

871
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,460
If only an amicable divorce can ever exist.
