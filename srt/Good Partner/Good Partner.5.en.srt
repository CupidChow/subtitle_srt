That Cha Eun Kyung won't settle?

34
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,500
Yes, it seems she wants to prolong the fight.

35
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,000
Han Yu Ri may be representing her,

36
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,069
but I'm sure Jung Woo Jin is pulling the strings.

37
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,739
Of course.

I knew it.

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,590
They could've started things first.

41
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:32,719
The two of them have been on...

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,289
countless business trips to other cities.

43
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,729
I doubt they went that far.

44
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,100
Eun Kyung thinks it's a waste to set aside time for meals.

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,758
She wouldn't have had the time for an affair.

46
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,858
How could nothing have happened...

47
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,298
between two colleagues of the opposite sex...

48
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,069
while working together for over a decade?

49
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,970
The word has already spread around the office.

50
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,810
Are you hinting that you know something?

51
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,239
Just tell me what you know.

52
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,780
I'm saying it feels wrong to be the guilty party...

53
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,880
when they could've started their affair first.

54
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,660
Of course it's unfair.

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,590
We're expected in court soon,

56
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,660
and we can't sit around doing nothing.

57
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,000
There wasn't an affair.

58
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,639
You never cheated on your wife. Sure.

59
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,940
Also, I don't know...

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,139
if I should be telling a reporter this but...

61
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,579
What is it?

62
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,078
Cha Eun Kyung and her colleague...

63
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,519
Are you saying there's something between them?

64
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,259
He's more like her office husband.

65
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,229
On TV, she talked about how happy her marriage was.

66
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,100
I guess that was all a lie.

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,739
We haven't been intimate for over three years.

68
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,500
Her other relationship could've started around then.

69
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,879
Darn.

As if a cross-bill is of great urgency.

73
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,059
I want a cross-bill filed right away.

74
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,770
Only that way will the public think...

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,999
that both parties are guilty in some capacity.

76
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,469
All right, fine.

77
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,869
I'll get on it right away. Are you happy now?

78
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,878
Just because she worked for Cha Eun Kyung,

79
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,410
she thinks she's on the same level as Cha.

80
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,020
What a nuisance.

(Episode 5)

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,270
To my office.

83
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,799
- Good morning. - Hold on.

84
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,299
- Romance is inevitable. - Gosh.

85
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,840
- Morning. - Good morning.

86
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,739
- Good morning. - Good morning.

87
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,830
Woo Jin, I'm sorry.

88
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,629
Why are you apologizing?

89
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,429
Because of me, you're caught in a dirty scandal.

90
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,499
Are you apologizing on behalf of Kim Ji Sang?

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,469
Are you doing that for him...

92
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,269
since you're not technically divorced yet?

93
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,010
You're right. This isn't my fault, but...

94
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,280
Still, this all happened because of me.

95
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,618
Is this guilt by association?

96
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,350
Stop adding fuel to the fire.

97
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,359
Forget the apology...

98
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,390
and just tell me if there's anything I can do.

99
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,160
Like a press conference.

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Are you insane?

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,069
All I have to say is that I'm not your office husband...

102
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,939
and that people are cruel to those handsome.

103
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,010
Are you afraid of what our staff will think?

104
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:17,650
It's just...

105
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,320
I'll come up with a countermeasure, so don't worry.

106
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,890
I wouldn't worry.

107
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,359
- Darn. What a day! - I'll clean that up.

108
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,788
- Let me. - No, I'll do it.

109
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,259
- Get back up. - Let me do it.

110
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,330
Just...

111
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,200
I said I had it.

112
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,129
What's up with me today?

113
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,570
Let me see.

114
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,210
Cha Eun Kyung, don't tell me you...

115
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,939
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

116
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,350
Seriously?

117
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:59,850
What are you two doing?

118
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,400
It's not what you think. My hand...

119
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,039
Don't get any wrong ideas, Yu Ri.

120
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,139
Please tell me it isn't true.

121
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,340
You too?

122
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,350
Are you here because of the news article?

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,549
What news article?

124
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,020
Are you saying there's more to this?

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,359
(Cross-bill)

126
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:44,229
Ms. Han, Mr. Oh is asking for you.

127
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:53,679
(Plaintiff's extramarital affair)

128
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,780
Seriously?

129
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,689
You must have an idea as to why I summoned you.

130
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,460
It must be about Ms. Cha.

131
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,059
Well,

132
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,058
both parties must be throwing stones...

133
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,799
hoping that they make contact.

134
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,770
If there's even a one percent chance of Cha Eun Kyung having...

135
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,340
an office...

136
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,739
What was it again?

137
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:27,039
An office husband, sir.

138
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,579
Is there a chance that she could have...

139
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,549
such a relationship with Jung Woo Jin?

140
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,979
No. I haven't been at the firm very long,

141
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,450
but as someone who has seen them in close proximity,

142
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,889
there's absolutely no way.

143
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,859
Being an attorney at law,

144
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,960
you must know that nothing is absolute.

145
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,470
The Ms. Cha I know...

146
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,908
focuses her energy on winning her cases...

147
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:01,479
and earning more money for the firm.

148
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,540
That's all she cares about.

149
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,879
And as for Mr. Jung...

150
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,479
She trusts him as a colleague and friend.

151
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,190
Nothing should happen that hurts the reputation of this firm.

152
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,090
Don't just take their word for it...

153
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,560
and actually dig into the facts.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Of course.

155
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,769
I'm sure the rumor is false,

156
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,340
but I'll check.

157
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,369
I'll let you get back to work, then.

158
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,289
- Yes? - Ms. Cha,

159
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,529
please meet me at the VIP conference room.

160
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,330
Why are you summoning me when you can come to my office?

161
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,800
Ms. Cha... I mean...

162
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,070
In this case where you are the plaintiff,

163
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:01,840
I am your attorney and you are my client.

164
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,710
I'd like to define our relationship as such.

165
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,940
I see you've grown a spine.

166
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,950
Before we think of a countermeasure,

167
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,450
there's something I must confirm...

168
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,789
as your attorney.

169
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,859
Confirm?

170
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,059
- Don't tell me... - You and Attorney Jung Woo Jin.

171
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,589
- Han Yu Ri, you... - You're saying...

172
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,560
there wasn't an affair.

173
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,899
Watch your words.

174
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,570
That's not even worth answering.

175
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:34,570
You're the one who told me...

176
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,200
not to trust or believe everything.

177
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,069
That's what every cheater says.

178
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,139
That's how they describe their spouses.

179
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,180
You don't believe it, do you?

180
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,519
What a joke.

181
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:56,118
Do you want me to describe my relationship with Woo Jin?

182
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,528
Them filing a cross-bill...

183
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:01,699
could mean that they have some sort of evidence.

184
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,300
How can there be evidence when it isn't true?

185
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,969
Why are you taking it out on me...

186
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,499
when it was your first client who fooled you?

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,670
I believe I'm only asking the necessary questions.

188
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,609
Han Yu Ri.

189
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,749
As my attorney,

190
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:22,449
you should be thinking about what we can do...

191
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,549
to squash that ridiculous cross-bill and them spreading that dirty rumor.

192
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,820
So what is all this?

193
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,589
As taught by you,

194
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,258
I'm doing my due diligence by checking the facts.

195
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,159
So please just answer my question.

196
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,340
It's not true.

197
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,139
There's nothing between us.

198
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,190
I only asked that as an attorney caring for her client.

199
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,589
Did it warrant such hostility?

200
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,690
You asked that for my sake?

201
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,159
It seems as though I hired the wrong attorney.

202
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,398
I'm trying my best.

203
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,170
Don't blindly say you're doing your best.

204
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,369
Get out there and think of a countermeasure as my attorney.

205
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,009
Unbelievable. My gosh.

206
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,850
Darn!

207
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,369
Let me see.

208
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,579
(Cha Eun Kyung)

209
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,778
(Kim Ji Sang)

210
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:02,978
(Choi Sa Ra)

211
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,090
(Jung Woo Jin)

212
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,999
(Office husband?)

213
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:27,009
(Infidelity)

214
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,479
(Infidelity)

215
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,180
Gosh.

216
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,050
(Infidelity)

217
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,560
Ms. Han, have you eaten yet?

218
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,560
I'm not sure if I should be...

219
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,399
letting you buy me a meal considering the situation.

220
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,609
I guess it could be awkward for you.

221
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,180
But there's nothing for you to worry about,

222
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,850
so enjoy your meal with ease.

223
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,449
You both say it isn't true and that I shouldn't be concerned.

224
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,190
Are you going to brush it off like that?

225
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,259
This isn't a simple matter.

226
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,989
The rumor... I mean,

227
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,060
the news articles are being circulated,

228
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:24,430
and this could hurt Ms. Cha's chances in court.

229
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,440
You're right. You're absolutely right.

230
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,239
That's why I asked you to a meal. To plan our next action.

231
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:43,779
First of all, I want to know about your relationship in detail.

232
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,489
I'm a victim in this case as well,

233
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,060
but an explanation?

234
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,999
Sure. Since you're representing Eun Kyung,

235
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,300
I should tell you about us.

236
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,600
Well...

237
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,070
Eun Kyung...

238
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,909
Hold on. Are you saying this lady lawyer...

239
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,450
is taking my case rather than you?

240
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:12,779
Why?

241
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,519
Well, that's...

242
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,388
There isn't an attorney at this firm...

243
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:18,920
who has more experience with divorce cases than I do.

244
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,790
You must trust me.

245
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
But...

246
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,488
How can a woman go toe-to-toe with a man in court?

247
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,859
I wouldn't go toe-to-toe with him.

248
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,029
I'd have the upper hand.

249
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,930
At a time when we didn't have many female attorneys,

250
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:37,810
Eun Kyung shattered the glass ceiling above her.

251
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,509
And I witnessed that from a front-row seat.

252
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,180
(Defendant)

253
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,950
Let's settle amicably for 10,000 dollars.

254
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,050
Who does that settlement benefit?

255
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,149
There's no way she will settle for that.

256
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,518
Ms. Cha, why are you being difficult?

257
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,789
The ruling will state she gets an alimony of 10,000 dollars,

258
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,559
so it'll be economical for all of us if you just settle...

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,998
If we take it as far as to you giving a ruling,

260
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,499
you will write...

261
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,368
that the defendant's habitual physical abuse...

262
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,670
led to their marriage being wrecked.

263
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:11,040
To my client, having that in writing...

264
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,040
is more economical than reducing her time in court.

265
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Are you kidding me?

266
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,979
As if there's a man who doesn't knock his wife around.

267
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,549
Yet, you dare keep saying that it was assault.

268
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,919
Your Honor, you heard him.

269
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,148
The perpetrator is raising his voice in court.

270
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,589
How is it just to wrap up this case...

271
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,289
with only 10,000 dollars and no written ruling?

272
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,320
(Judge)

273
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,659
Darn it.

274
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,459
(Judge)

275
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,658
We will make a ruling.

276
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,529
She had only been practicing for about three years,

277
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,540
but it seemed as though she was born to be an attorney.

278
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,810
Since then, I only had the utmost respect for her.

279
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,939
That still hasn't changed.

280
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,779
You were incredible earlier in court.

281
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,080
Yelling at the defendant is one thing,

282
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,619
but you also cut off the judge while he spoke.

283
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,350
It doesn't seem wise to make an enemy out of one.

284
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,359
He tried to force us to settle.

285
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,690
A settlement.

286
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,060
Both parties should be in agreement for that to happen.

287
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,698
How dare he order me around?

288
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,999
Maybe the judge was only trying...

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,168
to have you two reach an agreement.

290
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,369
That's your problem.

291
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,270
Sorry?

292
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,139
You're too much of a softie.

293
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,138
Attorneys should only think...

294
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,509
about what is beneficial to their clients.

295
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,010
Who cares what the judges think?

296
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:26,579
Well...

297
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,148
That's your own opinion.

298
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,320
Meanwhile, I also have my own.

299
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,260
What I say is always right.

300
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,060
Keep that in mind.

301
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,560
Sure, Eun Kyung.

302
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,189
Let's drink.

303
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,859
Out of respect and admiration,

304
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,929
I cheered her on by her side.

305
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,469
She was always so busy, and all I could do...

306
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,009
was to bring her some coffee.

307
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,040
Come in.

308
00:17:58,179 --> 00:17:59,609
Eun Kyung, your coffee.

309
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,750
- Leave it there. - Here.

310
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,580
That coffee...

311
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,050
forced her to take a break.

312
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,060
At times, she seemed too exhausted...

313
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,859
and lonely.

314
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,329
By the looks of it,

315
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,000
you're thinking about pulling another all-nighter.

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,029
It took me three hours...

317
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,570
to read the records of this case once.

318
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:21,639
I'm now just getting to the notes.

319
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,609
Hold on. Slow down, will you?

320
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,770
- I bet you skipped dinner. - Jung Woo Jin.

321
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,639
Can you please leave?

322
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,809
You always say you won't be done by tomorrow,

323
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,449
but then get it done somehow.

324
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,419
Now that you know what you're capable of,

325
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,290
you can set aside some time to eat meals.

326
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,619
(Railroad Diner)

327
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,060
You always have the basic gimbap.

328
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:47,290
Nothing is served more quickly.

329
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,729
I propose you have tuna gimbap, at least.

330
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,869
Oh, right.

331
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,570
Since you're here...

332
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,770
Here.

333
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,709
What is this?

334
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,540
On a busy day,

335
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,679
she suddenly said...

336
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,310
that she was getting married.

337
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,949
(Kim Ji Sang, Cha Eun Kyung, We're getting married.)

338
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,590
What is...

339
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,030
Why are you so surprised?

340
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,699
This doesn't make sense.

341
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,070
The fact that I'm getting married doesn't make sense?

342
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,599
You only eat the gimbap that is the quickest to make.

343
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,408
When did you have time to date?

344
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:32,510
Oh, right.

345
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,740
Did I not tell you that I went on a blind date three months ago?

346
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,079
- That doctor? - Yes.

347
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,049
Why are you getting married three months after meeting him?

348
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,979
I don't have time. Just getting married quickly...

349
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,719
is more efficient than having a long relationship.

350
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,949
Are you sure you know enough about what kind of person he is?

351
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,859
Yes. We're two years apart, and as you know, he's a doctor.

352
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,359
He's just normal.

353
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:53,060
No, not things like that.

354
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,859
Is he well-suited for you?

355
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,198
He's perfect for me.

356
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,500
First, he can cook.

357
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,668
Do you know how ridiculous your answer is?

358
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,939
You're going to come, right?

359
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,169
Let's get going.

360
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,080
You should get married soon too.

361
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Shall we go?

362
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,918
She got married in the same way she concentrates...

363
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,730
- Thank you. - and goes through legal documents.

364
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,359
Despite being a divorce lawyer, she was a bad judge of character.

365
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:31,770
Kim Ji Sang...

366
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,969
is trying to drag Eun Kyung down no matter what it takes.

367
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,409
So don't be swayed too much.

368
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,139
So you're saying...

369
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,909
you have always admired Ms. Cha...

370
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,949
and that you still admire her now, right?

371
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,350
That's right.

372
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,959
Kim Ji Sang knows that.

373
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,290
Gosh. What a shameful person.

374
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,169
Mr. Jung.

375
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,010
From this moment on,

376
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,709
please don't let anyone sense those feelings.

377
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,149
What feelings?

378
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:29,760
Your feelings of deeply liking Ms. Cha.

379
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,270
I thought...

380
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,399
I explained everything to you.

381
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,909
Did you not understand what I was saying?

382
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,639
You said you were a victim, right?

383
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,609
It's true that you're a victim.

384
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,549
Because of a baseless accusation,

385
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,389
you were denounced by the public.

386
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,560
But instead of being furious about being wrongly accused,

387
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,230
you're only worrying about Ms. Cha.

388
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,469
Do you need me to explain further?

389
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,609
Of course, I'm worried.

390
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,810
I told you that I admired her.

391
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,919
I don't think I can eat this meal.

392
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,590
You said we should come up with a plan together, right?

393
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,520
I don't think I can do that.

394
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,689
Ms. Han.

395
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,699
I can see very clearly that you care for Ms. Cha.

396
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,530
I'll trust that you'll stand back and not do anything...

397
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,270
that could be disadvantageous for Ms. Cha.

398
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,879
I hope you don't think I'm overstepping here.

399
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,209
I'm telling you to think of me,

400
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,480
not as a younger lawyer, but as Ms. Cha's attorney.

401
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,689
Ms. Cha told me...

402
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,459
I should always do things...

403
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:18,070
for the benefit of my clients.

404
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,459
Did you see the article?

405
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,858
- Yes, I did. - So crazy.

406
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,499
I thought they were suspicious. I guess I wasn't the only one.

407
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,730
Of course. Who didn't know that?

408
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:54,899
Know what?

409
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,540
Mr. Jung likes Ms. Cha. Isn't it obvious?

410
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,139
Be careful with what you say.

411
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,679
If someone hears you, they could sue you for defamation.

412
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:06,709
Mr. Jung is totally protecting Ms. Cha.

413
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,679
Gosh. I'm so jealous of Cha Eun Kyung.

414
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,919
If I were her, I would jump ship right away.

415
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:14,319
It's a ridiculous rumor.

416
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,919
How could you talk as if it was true?

417
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,159
I've never seen them do anything inappropriate.

418
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:22,958
I'm sure they didn't seem like it.

419
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,000
Because it's Jung Woo Jin's one-sided love.

420
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,668
I'm going to root for Mr. Jung.

421
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,969
- I hope it works out for them. - Me too.

422
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,270
Oh, right.

423
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,240
Did you know that Choi Sa Ra called out of work today?

424
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,079
- She must be the mistress, right? - I think so.

425
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,109
I think she called out of work because she got in trouble.

426
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,850
- How suspicious. - Stop it. What if someone hears?

427
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,449
It's fine.

428
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,439
Director Kim. I'll get straight to the point.

429
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:11,350
Please work until the end of the day and leave the hospital.

430
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,138
(12 years ago)

431
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:39,310
What kind of dad quits work to raise their baby?

432
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,709
There's no law saying children should be raised by women.

433
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,240
My daughter needs me, so I should stay by her side.

434
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,649
You should be fully invested at this point in your career.

435
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,480
At this rate, you won't be able to grow more as a doctor.

436
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,949
Doctors are skilled laborers.

437
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,419
If you don't keep practicing, you'll get rusty.

438
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,869
Hello, Ms. Cha.

439
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,208
I made Jae Hui's favorite omelet,

440
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,010
but she barely ate any of it.

441
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:21,448
You can go now. Thank you for your work.

442
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,580
I'll get going, then.

443
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,899
Jae Hui asked if you two...

444
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,629
were getting divorced.

445
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,169
- So? - I think it's time...

446
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:42,699
you told her.

447
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,379
Jae Hui.

448
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,189
What? I'm doing homework.

449
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,290
I have something to tell you.

450
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,030
Are you busy?

451
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,100
I just need a moment.

452
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,830
I have a vocabulary test tomorrow.

453
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,869
I need to memorize 60 English words before I go to sleep.

454
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
And I only have an hour and a half before I have to go to bed.

455
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,310
You're very busy. But...

456
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,439
I really have to tell you this.

457
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:26,679
Can you tell me tomorrow?

458
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,149
Okay.

459
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,359
All right, then.

460
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,780
Oh, my.

461
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,550
You don't eat things like this at home, do you?

462
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,790
The housekeeper has cooked it before.

463
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,290
Oh, is that so?

464
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,929
The issue isn't the crab stew itself.

465
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,628
A married couple should sit at the table together, eat,

466
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:17,929
and talk to each other.

467
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,300
Gosh. Cha Eun Kyung should've just stayed single.

468
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,040
She doesn't deserve to be married.

469
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:28,780
- It's getting cold. Let's eat. - Okay.

470
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,448
- Do you know that? - What?

471
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:43,859
That it was the first time you spoke badly of Cha Eun Kyung.

472
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,990
Me? I don't think so.

473
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:48,959
You've never...

474
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,570
directly said that she didn't...

475
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,629
deserve to get married.

476
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,240
Really?

477
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,240
We can't back down now.

478
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,040
I decided not to be afraid.

479
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,080
Let's stay strong.

480
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,879
Yes. Don't worry anymore.

481
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:09,850
They won't have the capacity to attack us for the time being...

482
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,290
because they're all busy handling the story of her affair.

483
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,919
I'll try meeting with Attorney Han.

484
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:22,230
She must've understood that it'll be better to just settle.

485
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:26,000
We even filed a cross-bill. Do you think they'll really settle?

486
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:30,000
Most settlements start with the filing of a cross-bill.

487
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,869
Since we showed them that we won't back down easily,

488
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:35,240
they could give up.

489
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:43,850
It's weird for us to be sitting here drinking coffee together.

490
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:45,449
How interesting.

491
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:47,219
Why did you call out of work?

492
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,759
You filed a cross-bill and talked to the press...

493
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,820
without any evidence.

494
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:54,129
You acted rashly, and you couldn't handle it. Isn't that right?

495
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,899
Without any evidence?

496
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,469
You must not know because you're new at the firm,

497
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,570
but there have always been rumors about them in the office.

498
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:07,609
You didn't think random rumors spread by employees...

499
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,780
would count as evidence, did you?

500
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,619
Are you trying to see whether or not I have evidence?

501
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:22,260
I'll figure out how to prove what I've said,

502
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,919
so you don't need to care.

503
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,990
You must know that you'll be in trouble...

504
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,629
if we sue you for defamation.

505
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,869
You should study the law more.

506
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,809
I've never unnecessarily said any of those things,

507
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,369
so what defamation are you talking about?

508
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,010
I merely submitted a document to the court.

509
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,379
The reporter just did his job.

510
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,219
You think you're a real lawyer.

511
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,290
You really have no fear.

512
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,589
Do you think you can handle the public?

513
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,090
As for the public,

514
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:04,300
it'll hurt Ms. Cha more since she's a public figure.

515
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:09,469
As Ms. Cha's attorney,

516
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,810
you should convince her to go for a settlement.

517
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,169
Are you trying to tell me what to do?

518
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,480
I've told you many times,

519
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:20,510
but my client has no intentions of settling at all.

520
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,719
Seeing as how you specifically said, "my client,"

521
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,689
you must have a different opinion.

522
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,290
Isn't it also good for you to wrap up the case quickly?

523
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,029
For Ms. Cha too.

524
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,358
She'll have to give him half of her assets anyway.

525
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,658
If she wraps things up quickly,

526
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:40,429
it'll be good for her and Jae Hui.

527
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,409
In truth, you want things wrapped up before rumors start to spread.

528
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:49,509
But you're talking as if it's for the benefit of others.

529
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,310
How shameless and cowardly of you.

530
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,080
Ms. Han.

531
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:57,980
As her lawyer,

532
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,550
think carefully...

533
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,990
about what'll be best for your client.

534
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:14,530
Keep coming after me, and I'll fight to the end.

535
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,419
Gosh.

536
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,570
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

537
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,669
Oh, Ms. Cha.

538
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,770
Have you thought of any countermeasures?

539
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,909
I just met Choi Sa Ra.

540
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,320
I'm sure she asked for a settlement.

541
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,780
Yes.

542
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,419
I would like you...

543
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:12,189
to strongly consider a settlement.

544
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,129
Why would I?

545
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,060
I told you already, Ms. Cha.

546
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,070
You're too full of your desire for revenge.

547
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,439
If you keep going that way, you'll have to give him your assets,

548
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,609
the reputation you've built up will plummet,

549
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,510
and Jae Hui...

550
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,480
will get even more hurt.

551
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,719
Is it not that you're scared?

552
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,989
Just as you taught me,

553
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,389
I thought about this excluding my personal feelings.

554
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:50,858
And the lawyer part of me doesn't want to recommend...

555
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:53,869
that my client continue this suit, which has an obvious outcome...

556
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:57,698
and will only cause more headaches from the fights it will cause.

557
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,939
It's very easy for a law firm employee of ten years...

558
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:03,409
to gaslight a first-year attorney, isn't it?

559
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,550
Ms. Cha.

560
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,178
You know this isn't about that.

561
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,418
I told my lawyer several times...

562
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:12,489
that I will not settle.

563
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,089
Bring me a different countermeasure.

564
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,960
I'll think on it more.

565
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,199
Gosh.

566
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,409
That girl.

567
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,319
- Knock-knock. - Hey.

568
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,330
Han Yu Ri is being so brazen.

569
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,568
Kids these days don't thank you...

570
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:01,198
for giving them an important title. They just stop listening to you.

571
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,068
What's wrong with that? Instead of being submissive...

572
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:05,270
to higher-ups, like we did back in the day,

573
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,409
she says what needs to be said. I like that.

574
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,839
So?

575
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,079
You just let her interrogate you and leave...

576
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,279
without even eating?

577
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,049
I told her that I admire you very much.

578
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,060
The misunderstanding has been resolved.

579
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,960
She's persistent.

580
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:27,730
She's very persistent.

581
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,299
Does she go to some school?

582
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:33,230
There must be a school that teaches her how to irritate me.

583
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:34,500
Eun Kyung.

584
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,940
I think you can trust Ms. Han with this.

585
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,770
How can you say that after how she treated you?

586
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,739
You're so kind.

587
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,610
You're too nice.

588
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Yes?

589
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:11,469
These are the files for your case in the countryside.

590
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:13,409
Pardon?

591
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:22,080
(Gwangju Family Court Suncheon Branch, Ruling)

592
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,679
What?

593
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,250
"Sodae-ri?"

594
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,190
Where is this? And what is this case?

595
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:30,488
Didn't anyone tell you...

596
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,989
that you had a business trip in the countryside?

597
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,330
What?

598
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,658
Ms. Cha said it would be...

599
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:40,670
a good learning experience for the new lawyers.

600
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,968
The new lawyers?

601
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,170
Because you don't drive well,

602
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,068
Ms. Cha told Mr. Jun to go with you.

603
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:50,238
What? It's okay. I can go on my own.

604
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,178
I told Mr. Jun,

605
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,350
and he said he'd go with you.

606
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,259
Is she getting revenge on me for telling her to settle?

607
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,299
Is she the queen of revenge or what?

608
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,610
Oh, over here.

609
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,659
- Long time no see... - Let's go in my car...

610
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:41,060
- What? - What?

611
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,299
- You... You first. - I was saying...

612
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,000
We could go in my car.

613
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,400
No, get in. Let's go.

614
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,920
- Put your seatbelt on. - Okay.

615
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,678
Sodae-ri? Where is that?

616
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,810
I've never heard of it before.

617
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,210
We've been driving for quite a while.

618
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:37,179
Will we be able to go back before today?

619
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,549
I know. What if we have to stay here tonight?

620
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,389
I don't think there's even a motel in this area.

621
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,060
A motel...

622
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,758
Round Three is on me.

623
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,029
Let's go for PB.

624
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,130
(Motel Eunyu)

625
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:01,509
- Play... - Do you want to listen to...

626
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,839
- Yes. - Okay.

627
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,790
(South Jeolla Province)

628
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,130
(Sodae-ri Supermarket)

629
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,170
Excuse me. Hello.

630
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,868
Do you know...

631
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,810
where 557, San, Sodae-ri is?

632
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,040
I think it's over the hill somewhere.

633
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,540
- That way? - Yes, it's far.

634
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,909
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

635
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:43,779
- It's 557, San, Sodae-ri? - Yes.

636
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,019
- That way? - Yes.

637
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,588
Show them the way.

638
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:48,149
- That's the way. - Yes.

639
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,158
Do you know where 557, San, Sodae-ri is?

640
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,329
- Do you know? - What?

641
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,330
- That way? - Yes.

642
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:54,658
- Okay. - Keep going straight.

643
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,999
- Thank you. - Thank you.

644
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,029
- You're welcome. - Bye.

645
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,839
Excuse me.

646
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,908
I'm looking for 557, San, Sodae-ri.

647
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,639
It's not this way. It's on the other side.

648
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,339
It's far from here.

649
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,850
- Thank you. - Thank you.

650
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:16,949
It's far from here?

651
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,020
No, we'll find it soon.

652
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,758
People would never guess...

653
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,429
this is what a large law firm makes their employees do.

654
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,029
We have to report this to the Employment and Labor Office.

655
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,500
We can't. We received the per diem.

656
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,500
What? We did...

657
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:51,850
- Thank you. - Yes.

658
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,219
- Are you okay? - Yes.

659
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,589
What a fool.

660
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:01,460
You still stick around with Cha Eun Kyung...

661
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,460
when people are calling you her office husband?

662
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,330
Get a grip.

663
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,330
We've never crossed the line before.

664
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,298
We didn't do anything for you to blame us.

665
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:13,638
Hey, Cha Eun Kyung may be a talent at work,

666
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,369
but she's the worst woman a man could get.

667
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,940
No wonder her husband cheated on her.

668
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,049
What do you like about a divorcee with a child?

669
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,679
How dare you...

670
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,819
- fall for a woman like her? - Stop it.

671
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,619
What a fool.

672
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,350
You're not waiting for her to get divorced, are you?

673
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:32,219
Are you showing that you were raised with no mom?

674
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:36,060
Do you think you have the right to say that to me?

675
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,770
Don't pretend like you care about me now.

676
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,239
Look back at yourself.

677
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,239
The right?

678
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,040
What about you?

679
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,080
Do you think you have the right to inherit this company?

680
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,779
I warned you many times.

681
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,179
There's nothing good about losing my favor.

682
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,190
You're letting me down more and more.

683
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:13,469
I'll leave now.

684
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,000
That prick...

685
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,980
- Hello. - Hello.

686
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:29,619
We're looking for Go Yu Sun.

687
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:32,988
We're from Law Firm Daejeong.

688
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:33,989
Yes.

689
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,360
Gosh, so bitter.

690
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
My goodness.

691
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,529
What is this? The arrowroot extract?

692
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,169
(Marriage Registration)

693
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,408
(Go Yu Sun)

694
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:55,509
So you registered your marriage again?

695
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,149
Who keeps their marriage registration in a frame?

696
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,419
I've never seen it in my life before.

697
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,449
I hear you.

698
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,250
It's okay to fight and reconcile.

699
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:08,650
We don't mind as long as we get our pay.

700
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,989
You know it's 30,000 dollars, right?

701
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:13,560
We can't pay you.

702
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,229
We agreed to pay you...

703
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,130
if we got divorced.

704
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,330
- But we're back together. - We're back together.

705
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,170
We have no reason to pay you.

706
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,940
We proceeded with her lawsuit diligently.

707
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,880
And we got you the division of assets.

708
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,080
And your reunion happened after that.

709
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:38,948
We can only pay you if we got divorced.

710
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,818
But we didn't get divorced.

711
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,048
You did get divorced.

712
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:43,718
You remarried the same person.

713
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,830
So you need to pay us now.

714
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:48,690
Honey.

715
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,130
Stay still. It's true that it's our fault.

716
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:54,629
What's so wrong about a couple in love...

717
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,000
living together?

718
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,269
People don't even get married anymore.

719
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,238
The country should award us.

720
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,509
- My goodness. - Sir.

721
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,940
Attorneys like us don't like to deviate from the topic.

722
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,749
People these days only pursue sexual relationships.

723
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,949
They don't take responsibility to the end.

724
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,850
What a world we live in.

725
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:16,190
We've been in love for 20 years.

726
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,699
By the way, we went under due to debt.

727
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,799
We have no money.

728
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,239
Wait a minute.

729
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,310
You never stopped...

730
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,209
loving each other for 20 years,

731
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,350
yet you filed a divorce. You're in debt,

732
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,690
yet you registered your marriage again?

733
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,619
Did you pretend to get a divorce?

734
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,929
It's often called false divorce.

735
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,000
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

736
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,569
He was struggled to pay off the debt...

737
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,670
that he didn't even have time to eat.

738
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,580
I filed a lawsuit...

739
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,009
to survive alone.

740
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,119
Yes, I know.

741
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,819
I should be in prison. I'll pay for my wrongdoing.

742
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,119
He didn't do anything wrong. Please.

743
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:24,719
Why would you?

744
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,330
She was only following what I told her to do.

745
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,199
She didn't know anything. All she did was to follow me.

746
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:32,298
If you're going to report anyone, report me.

747
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:33,429
Don't say that.

748
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Have you forgotten that we're one?

749
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:38,698
You can't do that.

750
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,469
If you go to prison, I'll follow you.

751
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,710
You fool.

752
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
I'm never going to let that happen.

753
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,479
- No. - Take me.

754
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,449
No, it was me. The false lawsuit.

755
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,190
All right. Enough with expressing your love.

756
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,159
You want to let your crime slide?

757
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:58,318
This is never acceptable.

758
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,988
How can you say that?

759
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,329
That's my line.

760
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,630
- What? - Oh, stop it!

761
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,239
We were only trying to protect our family.

762
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:10,739
Please.

763
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,540
He knows what he did wrong.

764
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,839
So please show us mercy.

765
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,049
Honey.

766
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,850
- Does this make any sense? - Ma'am.

767
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:32,860
I'm sorry.

768
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:36,230
This is all we can give you.

769
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,730
Please take it.

770
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:45,339
Thank you.

771
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:49,509
You see...

772
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:51,739
In my whole life,

773
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:55,480
I never stopped...

774
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,489
loving him, not even for a single day.

775
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:03,619
Not a single day.

776
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,489
I'm so sorry for lying to you.

777
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,069
I'll pay the price.

778
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,299
So please...

779
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:22,679
I'll go to prison.

780
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:33,790
False divorce, lawsuit fraud.

781
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:36,920
To think that such things actually happened.

782
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,730
We didn't get paid after all, by the way.

783
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,658
When we get to work tomorrow,

784
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:45,159
let's sue for default on payment.

785
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,869
You're busy these days, so I'll type it up.

786
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:51,699
Hey, Mr. Jun.

787
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,909
Can we not do that?

788
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
What?

789
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:58,579
Let's report back...

790
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,479
that they had no assets to seize.

791
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,580
No one will care.

792
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:03,179
Why should we do that?

793
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,850
I met all kinds of people since I became an attorney.

794
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:11,719
And...

795
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,389
it was the first time I met people who fought for their love.

796
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,130
"Yes."

797
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:23,139
"That's what it means to be married."

798
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,469
"Even if they must deceive others together,"

799
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:30,880
"they do not deceive each other." That's how I felt.

800
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:41,948
- Here you go. - Thank you.

801
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:43,059
- Enjoy. - It looks so good.

802
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,159
- Thank you. - Sure.

803
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,060
Ma'am.

804
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,799
- Can we have a beer too? - Sure.

805
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,729
The black bean noodles and beer are considered an expense.

806
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,170
Noodles and beer.

807
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,439
- Here you go. - Thank you.

808
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,540
Thank you.

809
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,079
Are you sure we can drink beer?

810
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,080
Don't worry. I have a plan.

811
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,080
You get some beer.

812
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,389
I get some water.

813
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:14,850
What's going on?

814
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,419
I drink but not you?

815
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,190
I have to take you safely home.

816
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,560
Right. You have to drive.

817
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:25,699
Cheers.

818
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,699
To a good day.

819
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,880
- It looks amazing. - Let's eat.

820
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,380
Gosh.

821
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,889
- It's lovely. - It's so good.

822
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,190
I feel better now.

823
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,810
Hey.

824
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:09,679
Believe it or not,

825
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,580
it was a first for me.

826
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,179
What was?

827
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,089
That night.

828
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,000
For me too.

829
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:41,469
So...

830
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,310
I think...

831
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,650
- We... - We...

832
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,920
We were both drunk.

833
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,289
And since it was a first for us both,

834
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,060
let's just consider it a reasonable experience.

835
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,569
I don't want things to get awkward at work.

836
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,798
I really like discussing cases with you...

837
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:14,210
and gossiping about Ms. Cha behind her back.

838
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,670
It's great fun.

839
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,250
I keep realizing...

840
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,049
we really are a lot different.

841
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,230
I'd had another idea since we walked down that slope.

842
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,089
Actually,

843
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:39,159
I'd wanted to say this in the car on the way here.

844
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:45,069
Say what?

845
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,580
That we could get together.

846
00:51:57,279 --> 00:52:00,449
Forget about dating or being colleagues.

847
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,719
As Han Yu Ri and Jun Eun Ho,

848
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,589
we could casually get to know each other.

849
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,139
When it comes to couples,

850
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,549
that kind of relationship can't be casual.

851
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:32,819
As our client said earlier, it comes with a responsibility.

852
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,589
So I decided...

853
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:40,790
marriage won't play a part in my life.

854
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,730
Deciding not to marry...

855
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,469
is different from not dating, don't you think?

856
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,029
You can date even if you're against marriage.

857
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,040
Sorry, Mr. Jun.

858
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,909
I'd like this...

859
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,880
to be...

860
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:06,389
the last time we touch on the topic.

861
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:08,889
And to me,

862
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,219
finding my place is more important.

863
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,659
What does that mean anyway?

864
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,130
You studied and passed the exam to be a cool attorney.

865
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,569
This is our first year.

866
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:25,468
We're rookies...

867
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,869
with lots to learn that get chewed out every day.

868
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:31,439
We can help each other get through it...

869
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,710
in a way that betters us both.

870
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:39,650
Do I have to keep going?

871
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,028
Okay.

872
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:53,069
If you want to stay as friends, I get it.

873
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,639
Thanks.

874
00:53:58,299 --> 00:53:59,710
But remember this.

875
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,009
I like you.

876
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,190
I'll...

877
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,389
find my own way back.

878
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:22,258
I have to come up...

879
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,158
with a plan for Ms. Cha by tomorrow.

880
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:25,899
We're in the middle of nowhere. I'll take you home.

881
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,900
No.

882
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,699
No. It's okay.

883
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,110
See you.

884
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,019
(To West Seoul)

885
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,130
- Is it not time yet? - No.

886
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,529
Silly me.

887
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,099
Let's sit down.

888
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,100
Come on.

889
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,199
Here you go.

890
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:03,540
There.

891
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,239
I'll sit here.

892
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,080
Goodness.

893
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:11,839
We're on time.

894
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,150
- Was that heavy? - Thanks.

895
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,588
- Is it 4pm? - Yes.

896
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:22,619
That's fine.

897
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:31,899
In my whole life,

898
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,869
I never stopped loving him, not even for a single day.

899
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:37,940
Not a single day.

900
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,569
What is love?

901
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:44,839
So what are my parents going to do?

902
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,049
- What? What do you mean? - Their divorce?

903
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,579
You said you wouldn't get divorced.

904
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,019
I gathered it to avoid a divorce.

905
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,819
I wanted to use the proof to stay married.

906
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,250
Is love...

907
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,489
the pain and torment somewhere in between love and attachment?

908
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,770
After time, if I keep this job...

909
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:08,329
Just let me divorce you.

910
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,429
I won't divorce her.

911
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:10,869
I will accept it.

912
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,600
I'll accept it too.

913
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,839
The lawsuit. I'll drop it.

914
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,810
All those people.

915
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:18,310
But remember this.

916
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,480
I like you.

917
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:24,650
And love. Will a day come when I understand?

(Law Firm Daejeong)

919
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,730
A bigamous common-law marriage?

920
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:42,029
Yes.

921
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,169
Attorneys are familiar with the notion,

922
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,239
but the public is not.

923
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,310
It will go massively viral.

924
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,939
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth?

925
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,339
Keyword for a keyword.

926
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:54,480
Ms. Han. Did you ever see something like this?

927
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,048
A living example...

928
00:56:56,049 --> 00:56:58,079
of something you saw in the case studies.

929
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,420
Choi Sa Ra and Kim Ji Sang.

930
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:01,290
A bigamous common-law marriage.

931
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,088
When I read about it,

932
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:04,860
I thought such people didn't exist.

933
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,259
But they're under my nose.

934
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:09,460
A bigamous common-law marriage...

935
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:11,198
Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra...

936
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,329
brought up "office husband" to go viral in a way...

937
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,329
that would harm your image.

938
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:19,238
So we should do the same and bring up...

939
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,770
"bigamous common-law marriage?"

940
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,069
Yes.

941
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,408
Obvious words like "affair" and "cheating"...

942
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:28,880
might cause a brief stir, but they're easily forgotten.

943
00:57:29,049 --> 00:57:30,448
Legal terms appeal to...

944
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:32,819
the public's intellectual curiosity as well.

945
00:57:37,759 --> 00:57:38,860
I like it.

946
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,329
I think it would be best if the reporter who wrote about...

947
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,460
the office husband wrote about this too.

948
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,770
Only then will people stop aiming fire at you.

949
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:51,799
You're pretty good.

950
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,670
I should send you out of town sometimes.

951
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,178

Ms. Cha. Can you please not?

953
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,048
So Kim Ji Sang really did...

954
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,790
have an affair with the secretary?

955
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:13,159
You know the number of hits means more than the facts.

956
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:15,830
Plus, what reporter can stick only to the facts?

957
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,900
Even if you can't stick only to the facts,

958
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,169
shouldn't you report facts too...

959
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:24,270
so you can stick around instead of going down as a piece of trash?

What? Yesterday?

964
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:07,679
I told you about the camp.

965
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:10,679
If Dad's not around, you should've come instead.

966
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,650
I was the only one who had neither parent there.

967
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,420
Right.

968
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,819
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

969
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,730
Wasn't the helper there?

970
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:27,730
If she was, does that mean you didn't have to come?

971
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,239
No.

972
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,610
That's not what I meant.

973
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,380

983
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
What?

984
01:00:24,961 --> 01:00:26,618
Does a bigamous common-law marriage mean...

985

- he went between the two? - The poor woman.

will come for the first hearing of her divorce trial.

People assumed she sued for divorce...

1004
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,928

She's coming out.

1020

Ms. Cha, there was speculation and commotions,

1021
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,138
and this is your first hearing.

1022
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,738
How does it feel?

1023
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:58,838
People are wondering...

1024
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:00,138
if you both cheated.

1025
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:02,048
Could you put the records straight?

1026

1027
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:11,060
I don't want to fight in front of the whole country.

I sincerely request you respect our privacy and boundaries.

1029
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,460
However, I want my case...

1030
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:22,528
to serve as a good precedent...

1031
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:25,039
for those who suffer at home.

1032
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,209
In other words, I'll do my best...

1033
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,210
to leave a judicial precedent that will benefit others.

1034
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:32,579
Everyone's talking about...

Could you explain?

1039
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,519
A bigamous common-law marriage...

1040
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,658
is when one who is legally married...

1041
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:48,158
lives with someone else...

1042
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:50,190
and forms a common-law marriage.

1043
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:52,559
It's a common-law marriage...

1044
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,000
not protected by law.

1045
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,830
- You mean... - Yes.

1046
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:57,969
That's right.

1047
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,699
It's having two families.

1048
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,940
When did you find out your husband was seeing someone else?

1049
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:16,150

(Good Partner)

1052
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,519
The defendant raised her so far,

1053
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,519
so the defendant should get custody.

1054
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,520
Custody was the main argument.

1055
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,718
It looks like Ji Sang is actually thinking of taking Jae Hui.

1056
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:27,730
We'll live here? The two of us?

1057
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:30,130
Don't I get a say?

1058
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:32,000
Did you see Kim Jae Hui?

1059
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,360
I didn't say much.

1060
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,000
Jae Hui asked how I knew her dad.

1061
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,600
You irked me in a way you shouldn't have.
