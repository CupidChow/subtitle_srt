 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,090
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:34,880


5
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,040
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,630
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,490
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,030
 Child actors were filmed in a safe environment. 

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,300
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong is here with us again today, 

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,580
 and she'll resolve your family problems once and for all. 

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,300
 Hello, I'm Cha Eun Gyeong, your attorney. 

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,250
Yes. Attorney Cha, you know how in the dramas,

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,570
there are cases where people around a person

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,930
find out about the spouse's affair before they do.

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,760
Does it also happen in real life?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,130
 Six months ago 

17
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,480
 Letter of Appointment 

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,910
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to join our law firm.

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,580
We'll look forward to both of your performances going forward.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,500
Don't mention it. I'll be in your care.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,170
The quality of Daejeong's future medical cases will go up a notch now.

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,780
 Episode 3 

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,370
Do you need something, Jae Hui?

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,020
No, I just want some water.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,980
Jae Hui!

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
- Aigoo, Jae Hui. 
- Hello.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,950
- Hey, Jae Hui, long time no see!
 - Hi, Jae Hui.

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,810
- How are you? 
- You grew so much

29
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,370
Jae Hui, it's a celebration for Dad today. You won't mind some noise, right?

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,980
Yes, I don't mind it.

31
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll get going now.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,180
- Yes, sure.
 - What a sweetheart.

33
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,140
All right. Director Kim Ji Sang, who became Daejeong Law Firm's medical advisor,

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,130
should give us a word now.

35
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,500
Yes, well, I'm all over the place, working at the hospital and taking care of Jae Hui.

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,400
But I'm worried I took on another job. I'll try my best.

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,870
Congratulations. Let's have a toast.

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,220
 Congrats. 

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,340
So, how did you suddenly become our medical advisor?

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,700
Did you suggest it, Seonbae?

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,920
CEO was troubled by the quality of our medical cases,

42
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,660
so I proposed the idea to the CEO first and told him about it.

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,270
That makes the Director a man with two offices now, huh?

44
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,860
The advisory office at the law firm, and the doctor's office at the hospital.

45
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,780
Well, wouldn't we meet at least once more if we work in the same office?

46
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,100
Aren't you being too loving?

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,920
What a silly thing to say.

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,610
All of your glasses are empty, huh?

49
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,160
Shall we have one more round of drinks?

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,980
- Yes.
- Of course, I'll have one more.

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,750
But we don't have enough alcohol, huh?

52
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,760
- Why? There's no more?
- Yes, there's no more alcohol.

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,200
Ma'am, please take a look inside the fridge!

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,880
Thank you.

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
There's no more. I'll go out and buy some.

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,560
No, I can make the trip.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,770
You will?

58
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,710
She probably doesn't know where to go. I'll be right back.

59
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,600
Yes, you should go instead, Honey.

60
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,650
- I'll be right back. 
- Okay.

61
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,020
Attorney Cha, let me pour you a drink.

62
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,720
- I'll help him since it'll be too much to carry alone. 
- Okay.

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,630
- It was a lot of work to prepare this, right? 
- Not at all.

64
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,690
Should we have a toast with those who are here?

65
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,840
- I love it!
 - Let's go.

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,690
 Yes, there are way too many. 

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,920
 You deny it even if you notice something suspicious, 

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,800
 telling yourself it could never happen and being defensive. 

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,650
 So, you sometimes find out after the people around you do. 

70
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,590
How's the car now that you've driven it a few days?

71
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,450
First of all, I like how there's no noise.

72
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,430
I think sedans are better for me than sports cars.

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,990
Yes, since you're sensitive to noise.

74
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,300
But I'll have to study it because it's got so many functions.

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,850
I like how the screen is wide.

76
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,970
What's this? It's got this function, too? Who's this?
  

77
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,240
- Leave it!
 -  A message from Director Choi. "Where are you?" 

78
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,990
 The discovery of an affair usually starts with, "Where are you?" 

79
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,540
"Where are you?" may not sound like much,

80
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,490
but it's a very intimate phrase used between people who share their daily lives together.

81
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,920
Who is it?

82
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,750
Oh, it's my hospital director

83
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,550
since I'm still not back even after lunchtime.

84
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,320
I see.

85
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,390
 Director Choi 

86
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,880
Sa Ra, why do you take so long at the court these days?

87
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,700
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,480
There's always traffic on the way back, and my lunch break overlaps.

89
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,190
So, I just ate lunch and came back in.

90
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,180
You can leave.

91
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,910
 If you haven't secured certain evidence of your spouse's affair, 

92
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,330
 is it right to feign ignorance? 

93
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,010
 Yes, you can never let them know while you're collecting evidence. 

94
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,440
 You must hold back until you secure the perfect evidence. 

95
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,660
Director Kim isn't here right now.

96
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,720
He asked me for documents regarding his contract.

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,950
Please give this to him for me.

98
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,870
He'll be here in about 10 minutes, though.

99
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,340
I guess he's at lunch?

100
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,090
Oh, didn't you know?

101
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,320
Director Kim only sees patients in the afternoon these days.

102
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,580
You're right. I forgot.

103
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,950
 Kim Jin Cheol, Director Kim Ji Sang 

104
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,770
 Jeong Hye Won, Han Sang Tae, Kim Gyu Hui 

105
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,590
By the way, didn't Director Choi work here?

106
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,810
None of our directors have a last name "Choi."

107
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,150
Why do you ask?

108
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,640
It's nothing.

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,360
 You see loose links here and there in your daily life. 

110
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,990
 Yes. 

111
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,520
Is Jae Hui's phone with you?

112
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,920
 Yes, she left it in my car when we went to the museum yesterday. 

113
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,710
You should've been more careful.

114
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,580
How can you say that when you couldn't even see Jae Hui's face over the entire weekend?

115
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,190
 I left it in my office at the law firm this morning. 

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,920
You can give it to her.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,760
Okay.

118
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,350
 Cafe Marrige 

119
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,550
 Cafe Marrige 

120
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,260
 There's a moment... 

121
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,520
 when all those loose links get connected at once like a puzzle. 

122
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,370
 Whoa, that's scary. 

123
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,510
 Please tell our listeners what to do if that moment comes. 

124
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,500
 You must stay rational. 

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,910
 Don't get worked up and do anything you'd regret. 

126
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,440
 Director Kim Ji Sang 

127
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,890
-  Hey.  
- Did you take her phone to Jae Hui?

128
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,060
 I can't because I've got consultations back to back. 

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,260
You said you'd bring it to her earlier.

130
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,770
I'm busy.

131
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,850
 For example, dragging the adulterers by their hair 

132
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,230
 or damaging your own home. 

133
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,170
 Things you'd get blamed for in reverse. 

134
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:42,160
 I see. Dear listeners, if you happen to experience this, 

135
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,000
 I hope you'll stay rational throughout. 

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,480
Is there any last word of advice you have for us?

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,630
A spouse's adultery

138
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,650
can happen to anyone.

139
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,030
Please don't lose your composure,

140
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,800
and make it out of the tunnel of pain successfully.

141
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,650
 Case 03: Strangers who became family. 

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,230
Y-You knew all about it, Attorney Cha?

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,180
What are you doing now, coming to my house in the middle of the night?

144
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,120
I mean

145
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,900
I thought you didn't know—

146
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,440
You thought I wouldn't know?

147
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,780
No way. You're not going to get a divorce?

148
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,440
No, I won't.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm not going to do it, so you don't need to make a fuss over it, either.

150
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,570
How can you let those people get away with it?

151
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,650
If it were me, I would file the complaint right this moment

152
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,250
and let their workplace and the world know!

153
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,030
What will I get by doing that?

154
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,160
Getting a divorce and division of property,

155
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,070
does it get resolved if I get merely 20 million won in alimony?

156
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,860
Because that's all you can do

157
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,050
by legal means where adultery isn't a crime anymore.

158
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,720
Your one-dimensional thought process is truly amazing.

159
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,310
Drive out a secretary who's been taking care of my business for ten years

160
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,200
and a father who's been taking care of my child for 13 years.

161
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,130
Is it right to just go home with the 20 million won,

162
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,840
which isn't even close to what I make a month?

163
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,530
If that's all you can do right now,

164
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,210
you should at least do those things.

165
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,110
Attorneys your age are dragged around by the law.

166
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,760
You become a real attorney if you use the law instead of getting pushed around by it.

167
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,970
Still, two people closest to you betrayed you, Attorney Cha.

168
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,630
How can you just do nothing?

169
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,690
Right, adultery.

170
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,000
An illegal act.

171
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,450
It's not even a crime anymore. So, what about it?

172
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,930
Are you saying you're okay?

173
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,480
My work and home are busier than ever, and I need them.

174
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,040
Not your work or your home.

175
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,750
What about your life?

176
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,070
Work and home...

177
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,530
are my life.

178
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,720
You're really going to leave?

179
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,730
I told you all along.

180
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm not going because it's our wedding anniversary.

181
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,820
I'm going to convince her to divorce me.

182
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,120
How can I believe that?

183
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,220
They say a married couple's fight is futile.

184
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,420
A married couple's fight?

185
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,910
We aren't a couple anymore, so what couple's fight?

186
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,000
You won't eat with Cha Eun Gyeong, right?

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,210
You called me over for soybean paste stew so that I wouldn't eat with her, didn't you?

188
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,080
You got me.

189
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,770
I'll call you.

190
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,370
Is it our 14th anniversary?

191
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,280
We really didn't get to celebrate our anniversaries all this time.

192
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,670
Why on earth won't you reply?

193
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,760
- Reply to what?
 - I sent you the text.

194
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,330
How do you want to go about the divorce?

195
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,350
I came because you'd keep delaying it if I didn't talk to you in person.

196
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,840
I see.

197
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
Divorce?

198
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,750
What's the cause of divorce you're talking about?

199
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,770
Even if I tell you, we'll only argue.

200
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,540
Let's stop going around in circles and end it amicably.

201
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,340
You're saying I was negligent to my family, right?

202
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,890
Me?

203
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,620
Negligence doesn't even come close.

204
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,620
I was playing family all alone.

205
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,420
I don't want to talk anymore, so please just agree to settle.

206
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,630
I'll pay closer attention to Jae Hui.

207
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,150
If this were bad enough for a divorce, no families would be intact.

208
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,950
That's exactly the cause of divorce.

209
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,920
The difference where a situation

210
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,200
that's so hard I want to die is so trivial to you.

211
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,550
That's your cause of divorce?

212
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,550
If we get a divorce, the entire country will know.

213
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,250
Must you really take it that far?

214
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,320
That's the reason in the end, right?

215
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,590
Your reputation matters more to you even now, right?

216
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,570
If we get that divorce,

217
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,870
what difference will it make?

218
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,090
Forget it. Back to square one.

219
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,870
Sit.

220
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm not your subordinate.

221
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,540
Listen up. There's only one discussion I want to have.

222
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,720
What is it?

223
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,110
File for divorce, division of property, and custody.

224
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,650
The stuff you know best about.

225
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,310
Break it down, and let me know.

226
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,940
What do I need to do to change your mind?

227
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,050
Do I just have to quit work and stay home?

228
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,600
Stop overreacting.

229
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,380
I never even wished stuff like that from you.

230
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,810
What is it, then?

231
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,430
I said I'll do as you say!

232
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,110
It seems you're mistaken about something.

233
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,200
You're no longer a wife, a woman,

234
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,950
or Jae Hui's mom to me.

235
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,740
Let me know when you're ready.

236
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,340
 I'll make more money and buy you a watch I couldn't get you for the wedding. 

237
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,850
 Just spending time together like this is the best. 

238
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,980
 Ta-da. 

239
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,890
 You look at your watch a lot. 

240
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,400
 So, think of me once in a while when you do. 

241
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,370
 Daejeong Law Firm 

242
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,420
 Another great month where everyone worked hard. 

243
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,050
 Great work! 

244
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,970
Please keep up the good work next month.

245
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,290
 Yes! Thank you for your time! 

246
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,880
- Thank you. 
- Good work.

247
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,720
All right. Attorney Han, you can take these with you.

248
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,370
So, Attorney Han is taking new case consultations from now on, right?

249
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,630
I was worried because we were getting a lot more of them lately.

250
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,130
Welcome.

251
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,000
We're dividing up what Attorney Cha used to do alone among three people.

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,630
You've made the list, right?

253
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,510
Of course! I even placed comments on the list while organizing.

254
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,860
That's right. Here you go, Attorney Han.

255
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,540
Thank you.

256
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,390
 Consultation List 

257
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,980
Attorney Han, if you have any questions on consultations, you can ask anytime.

258
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,890
There's nothing particularly different for new case consultations.

259
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,360
So be confident. Okay?

260
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,580
Yes, thank you.

261
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,630
Attorney Han, we charge 300,000 won per hour for consultations. You didn't know, right?

262
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,180
- What? Really?
 - Yeah.

263
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,400
I charge 300,000 won?

264
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,920
It'd be the value of the major law firm title you have,

265
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,420
not you as the individual, right?

266
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,170
We know very well, even if you don't remind us so harshly.

267
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,780
I also know our partner attorneys charge 500,000 won per hour.

268
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,270
By the way, what does "JS" stand for?

269
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,930
They're special markings I made.

270
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,730
It stands for jin-sang*.
(Blacklist of rude clients/customers in Korean)

271
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,830
Attorney Jeon, there are better phrases like "Subject to special management."

272
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,170
I'll try using that next time.

273
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,660
What's your standard for marking someone as JS?

274
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,960
My standard for JS, huh?

275
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,000
What does jinsang mean?

276
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,620
Okay. First off, here's number one.

277
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,690
 Loneliness 

278
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,060
People who come because they're lonely when they don't want a divorce.

279
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,090
And here's number two.

280
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,730
People who treat us like thieves, saying our fees are too expensive.

281
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,930
And here's number three. Nitpicks.

282
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,950
People who keep picking at your words,

283
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,030
but don't understand when you actually explain.

284
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,640
And lastly, we've got indecision.

285
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,210
People who are indecisive are very difficult.

286
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,430
Knowing these things will help you a lot later.

287
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,310
And also, it's our company policy not to give more than five consultations.

288
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,970
You must abide by that rule.

289
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,180
I didn't know there was a limitation policy.

290
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,400
But aren't the people free to decide how many consultations to receive?

291
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,240
This is a law firm, not a therapist's office, where you pay an hourly rate.

292
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,520
People get more than five consultations mostly because they can't decide to divorce.

293
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,930
It's to clarify that attorneys provide legal representation,

294
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,530
but they're the ones who must decide to get a divorce.

295
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:03,830
Why do newbies get the list of people who come in for their fifth consultation?

296
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,170
A neat disposal?

297
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,400
It means you should send them back nicely.

298
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,380
Those people are likely to take back

299
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,920
their decisions many times, even if we start the litigation.

300
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,640
So, it's not appropriate for large law firms to take their cases.

301
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,540
I think it's indeed difficult for everyone

302
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,190
to decide to get a divorce.

303
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,340
But I don't really understand the five-time limit.

304
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,760
Attorney Han, there's no need for you to understand.

305
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,120
You just have to obey. Okay?

306
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,880
- Please wrap things up here.
  - Yes. 

307
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,080
Have a good day!

308
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,420
Yes.

309
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,230
Attorney Cha, a fifth consultation client, is here.

310
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,470
Attorney Han will be doing the consultation.

311
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,650
Please take her.

312
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,110
Yes, I got it.

313
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,380
Attorney Cha, do you need anything else?

314
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,170
No, I looked because you look pretty today.

315
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,730
I see. Thank you.

316
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,170
I guess you've got a date?

317
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,670
Yes, I've got plans this evening...

318
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,740
with my boyfriend.

319
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,290
You had a boyfriend?

320
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,760
I didn't know.

321
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,490
You didn't know, huh?

322
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,090
I'll introduce him when I get a chance.

323
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,170
Okay. You can go now.

324
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,290
 You're no longer a wife, a woman, 

325
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,960
 or Jae Hui's mom to me. 

326
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,250
Aren't we talking to Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?

327
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,080
Since you've met Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong four times,

328
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,690
it's good to get a second opinion from a different attorney this time.

329
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,850
- Is that so?
 - Of course.

330
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,070
Since every attorney has a different opinion, it'll help you more.

331
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,700
How do you do?

332
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,720
Hello, Attorney.

333
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,080
Today is my fifth time.

334
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,750
So it's the last time, right?

335
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,580
Yes, that's true according to our company policy.

336
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,590
I'm paying my money for the consultation, so why won't you let me?

337
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,220
I know, right? Please come inside.

338
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,040
A recording?

339
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,370
Yes, if you don't record it,

340
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,570
no one will believe your father commits verbal abuse every time he drinks.

341
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,380
You said he's gentle as long as he's sober.

342
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,510
How can I record my own husband?

343
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,550
That's a bad thing to do.

344
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,540
I came all the way here,

345
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,950
but I'm still not sure if getting a divorce is the right thing to do.

346
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,380
As long he doesn't drink, for a man his age...

347
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,160
It's true Dad treats me pretty well.

348
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,410
The problem is he doesn't want to quit drinking!

349
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,290
Mom, please stop it now.

350
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,660
You even take medication because you can't sleep from the stress.

351
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,120
Why can't you muster up the courage?

352
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,760
It's your dad!

353
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,830
You need your dad to walk with you at the wedding!

354
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,480
Stop saying it's for my sake!

355
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,340
That's all an excuse.

356
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,700
So, will you divorce him after I get married?

357
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,470
Now, now. Please calm down.

358
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,180
Ma'am, the thing you fear...

359
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,530
Is it your husband or the divorce?

360
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,800
My daughter's getting married soon.

361
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,520
If her wedding is called off because of my divorce, I can't live.

362
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,620
Also, how many years do I have left to live at my age?

363
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,430
Why should I be labeled as a divorcee?

364
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,210
Your daughter already said she's fine.

365
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,690
And, a divorcee, you say?

366
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,760
There's no such thing these days.

367
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,060
People will say I abandoned my family

368
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,840
when they don't even know my situation.

369
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,810
That's so unfair.

370
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,010
So you're saying because of people who don't even know your story,

371
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,270
you're going to endure thirty more years from now, right?

372
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,920
I think he has quite a few assets because our few houses went up in value.

373
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,000
But he won't tell me.

374
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,140
When I ask him about it, he just gets furious and yells at me

375
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,900
not to have funny ideas.

376
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,510
You should end your marriage that's just full of fear.

377
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,370
I can live without that man,

378
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,930
but he can't even cook rice without me.

379
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,390
Aigoo! Gosh, he won't starve to death.

380
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,150
He won't starve to death, for sure.

381
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,280
He'll live on cup noodles, get sick, and kick the bucket.

382
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,120
If you divide the property, you can take half of what he has.

383
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,690
Also, there won't be anyone cursing or looking down on you all day.

384
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,460
So you'll be at peace.

385
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,920
Will it... really be that way?

386
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,540
Mom, Dad's not even human.

387
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,130
So, please live your life now.

388
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,490
How long will you let Dad walk all over you?

389
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,970
I'll help you take a step forward.

390
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,850
All right.

391
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,350
If you sign here, it's the end.

392
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,260
We'll take care of everything from that point on.

393
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,640
Just let me lead you.

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,700
I told you to wrap up the fifth consultation client, and you bothered to take her case?

395
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,870
Yes, Mother couldn't seem to decide, so her daughter and I...

396
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,040
It's Ms. Park Jin Suk, not "Mother."

397
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,220
You're not Ms. Park Jin Suk's daughter, are you?

398
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,350
But I'm glad you noticed her daughter will pay for her legal fees.

399
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,930
Knowing where the money will come from is key.

400
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,680
Her daughter was the key to her heart, not the money.

401
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Feeling guilty thinking she's abandoning her family even after all that sacrifice...

402
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,600
Her child is the only one who will free her from that feeling.

403
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,300
I'll make sure to tell the CEO you signed the contract for your first case.

404
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,410
You've earned your keep.

405
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,790
It's true that deciding to divorce is up to you,

406
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,660
but I realized someone has to lead your heart along.

407
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,210
Lead, my foot.

408
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,260
She knew today was the last consultation,

409
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,650
making her sign the contract since she won't have anyone to complain to.

410
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,580
This is why a company's system is important.

411
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,310
Would anyone decide to divorce because of our company system?

412
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,520
Yes, Ms. Park Jin Suk.

413
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,400
I say she'll withdraw her compliant during the trial.

414
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,700
If I take care of her by her side, she'll be able to stay strong.

415
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,050
She can't go back to that hell again.

416
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,520
So, did you tell her to just trust you again?

417
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,500
I told her to let me lead her.

418
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,110
Are you the hero of justice?

419
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,940
Attorney Han, let's be honest here.

420
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,730
You just wanted to teach him a lesson.

421
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,100
He needs to be taught a lesson.

422
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,940
Rather than that, it's more important to know whether she can really live alone.

423
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,490
Divorce isn't for everyone.

424
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,010
Are you saying there's a qualification for divorce?

425
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,600
Of course, there is.

426
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,760
Someone like Ms. Park Jin Suk could never

427
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,820
live alone because she's too fragile, even if she gets a fortune in the division of property.

428
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,820
What about you, Attorney Cha?

429
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,780
You meet the qualifications for divorce.

430
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,440
So suddenly?

431
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,720
Is it also because of the social pressure for you?

432
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,080
Put the trash in the trash can.

433
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,940
You need to live every day of your precious life to its fullest.

434
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,450
Even if you throw trash away, food waste goes into the food waste bin.

435
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:38,760
Reusable items go in the recycle bin after a good wash.

436
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,250
It's not all that simple.

437
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,910
You've done recycling before, right?

438
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,950
Yes, I live alone.

439
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,750
Is that so? I see.

440
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,600
- Attorneys!
 - Hey.

441
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,910
Did you eat?

442
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,920
We did.

443
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,680
What did you have?

444
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,800
Are you going to the court today?

445
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:18,410
 Yu Ri, someone I know from church said they can introduce you to a good man. 

446
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,730
 I'll set up the date. Okay? 

447
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,730
 Since you got a job, you need to start seeing a man. 

448
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,900
Gosh, seriously.

449
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,140
Did you have a good lunch?

450
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,240
- Yes.
 - You're back.

451
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,370
Attorney Han, did you have coffee?

452
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,380
Yes, I did.

453
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,990
- Let's have one more. 
- What?

454
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,270
- Outside.
 - W-Why?

455
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,450
To get some exercise, too.

456
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,430
So, you took the case? What did Attorney Cha say?

457
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,830
She said, "Why bother?"

458
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,560
How annoying.

459
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,230
Attorney Han, can I ask you one question, purely out of curiosity?

460
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,270
Why don't you ever do what the company tells you?

461
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,000
- Me?
 - Yes.

462
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,120
Do you have a rebellious spirit you couldn't resolve when you were young?

463
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,690
No! I don't have anything like that.

464
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:06,060
I'm just following my attorney's conscience every moment.

465
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,220
Conscience, huh? Respect.

466
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,690
You live a really tiresome life.

467
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,670
Cha Eun Gyeong is the one who lives a tiresome life.

468
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,930
Can't she just give a compliment for once?

469
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,120
Gosh, how's she any different from Park Jin Suk?

470
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,570
Why? Attorney Cha said she won't get a divorce?

471
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,050
She said she won't!

472
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,820
Does it make sense for a divorce attorney to live with a man

473
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,070
who cheated on her out of fear of the social stigma?

474
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,210
Isn't she embarrassed?

475
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,100
Attorney Cha isn't the type to be afraid of the social stigma of getting a divorce.

476
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,700
Well, couldn't it be because of her child?

477
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,690
You also knew that I was talking about Attorney Cha?

478
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,590
Me? I had no idea.

479
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,630
I just cast a leading question, and you took the bait, Han Yu Ri.

480
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,530
Wow, so that happened to Attorney Cha, huh?

481
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,410
If I had a wife like Attorney Cha,

482
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,300
I'd make her my queen and serve her.

483
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,330
Attorney Jeon, you'll keep the secret, right?

484
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,560
Excuse me. I'm also an attorney, okay?

485
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,030
Isn't confidentiality a legal duty?

486
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,330
- You mean it, right? 
- Of course!

487
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,330
I guess you sleep fine even with two cups of coffee.

488
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,040
I pass out the moment my head—

489
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,050
Wait, how did you know this is my second cup of coffee?

490
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,860
- Leading question. 
- Aigoo.

491
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,190
I just had a quick blind date during lunch.

492
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,350
I got caught. How embarrassing.

493
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,900
Why didn't you meet in the evening?

494
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,870
I have to get off work on time

495
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,690
and have chimaek* with you in the evening.
(Fried chicken and beer.)

496
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,130
Attorney Jeon, do you really like me?

497
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,750
I really like you.

498
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,770
Love your colleague, love your country. Right?

499
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,120
Let's be friends for a long time.

500
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,370
Stop being so clingy.

501
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,950
Why? Let's work together forever. Don't quit, okay?

502
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,790
N-No.

503
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,540
It's okay. You don't need to put them on.

504
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,860
Attorney Han,

505
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,820
I'm the only one who will wipe his butt when he gets old and sick.

506
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,090
So, I'm not sure if I can abandon him like this.

507
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,060
Did you marry him to wipe his butt when he gets old?

508
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,040
Didn't you marry him to be happy?

509
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,640
My daughter is also on my side.

510
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,740
He'll be completely alone.

511
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,580
He brought it upon himself.

512
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,150
Still, I just wonder who'd take care of him when he gets old.

513
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:01,000
You're not the only one with responsibility and duty.

514
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,070
Do you think the defendant will take care of you when you get sick?

515
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,950
My gosh...

516
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,150
He made you sick, in fact.

517
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,350
Only if I hadn't told him about meeting you.

518
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,420
I think it's kind of right to stop now while I can.

519
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,960
If you're that worried, give my number to your husband

520
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,740
and tell him to talk to me.

521
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,550
And you can just block your husband's number.

522
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,490
Please do it right now.

523
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,770
Can I really do that?

524
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,780
Of course.

525
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,380
 Husband  
  I'm not going home. 

526
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,660
 You can talk to my attorney now if you want to contact me. 

527
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,350
He'll go crazy if he can't even reach me.

528
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,760
It's fine.

529
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,740
I told you to trust me and let me lead you.

530
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,400
This is Park Jin Suk's past consultation notes you mentioned.

531
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,440
Thank you.

532
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
 010-0825-5183 

533
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,990
Who's this?

534
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,770
Yes? Hello?

535
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,080
 Hey, are you happy to live like that, lying to people? 

536
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,680
- What did you say?
 -  What was that thing called? 

537
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,860
You wrote a complete fiction in the thing called a complaint!

538
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,880
Excuse me, it's not fiction.

539
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,130
That's the sorrow in Park Jin Suk's heart.

540
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,490
Did you see me cursing at my wife?

541
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,680
Do you have proof?

542
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,840
 And all my friends beat up their wives once in a while! 

543
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,330
 But they aren't even sorry. 

544
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,910
- I even say I'm sorry, and I buy her presents—
 -  Aigoo. 

545
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,200
Do you want an award or something?

546
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,640
I'll sue you for false accusations!

547
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,890
 How dare a woman run away from home without preparing her husband's dinner? 

548
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,270
No one in this world will prepare dinner for someone like you.

549
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,610
You should've done better!

550
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,840
Tell Park Jin Suk to come home right now. I won't let her be!

551
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,440
 Ms. Park Jin Suk will never go home again. 

552
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,960
I'll make that happen.

553
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,490
 Hey! If you don't quit this right now, I'll kill myself! 

554
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,360
You said you'll kill who?

555
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,850
I said I'll kill myself!

556
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,550
Attorney Jeong!

557
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,150
Aren't you going home, Attorney Han?

558
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,370
I still have a lot of work to do.

559
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,940
I heard you took a new case.

560
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,990
Good job. It's not an easy thing to do.

561
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,510
Attorney Cha said I shouldn't have taken the case.

562
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,230
- Thank you.
 - Gosh...

563
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:03,560
Why are people unable to decide to divorce in such ridiculous situations?

564
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,420
Do they lack courage that much?

565
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,100
They're probably afraid, not that they lack courage.

566
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,110
Because even the strongest person fears being alone.

567
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,460
Man, you're quite dependable.

568
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,040
Fighting.

569
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,610
Yes, fighting.

570
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,630
- Hang in there.
 - Yes, please take care.

571
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,940
Yes. Thank you.

572
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,150
Oh, yes. About that, yesterday...

573
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,580
Yes, yes. Yes, please wrap it up that way.

574
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,380
Okay.

575
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,800
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

576
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,440
- Yes.
 -  Seonbae, are you done with the radio? 

577
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,840
 Yes. Why? 

578
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,810
Please buy me a drink.

579
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,370
Jeong Wu Jin asked me to buy him a drink, huh?

580
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,020
You used to buy me a drink here after giving me a good scolding before. Right?

581
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,400
Did you even listen when I scolded you?

582
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,430
You used to say yes, yes,  but did not actually listen in the end.

583
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,460
You remember it completly opposite.

584
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,270
I pretended not to listen,

585
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,700
but I engraved everything you said in my heart.

586
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,450
I was just trying to put my tiny pride forward back then.

587
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,310
You're the one giving me an earful every day now,

588
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,180
saying I've got a bad temper.

589
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,810
I'm just telling you to be gentle to the kids.

590
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,850
If they quit again, you're the one who will be scolded by the CEO.

591
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:20,980
Am I someone who's afraid of others' opinions?

592
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,610
Yes, you're afraid.

593
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,190
Hey, you know Han Yu Ri accepted her first case, right?

594
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,100
Yeah, I know.

595
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,580
It looked like she was going to quit soon.

596
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,600
If I think about it, she's just like you-know-who when she was new.

597
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,690
Me?

598
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,460
Me?

599
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,200
What are you saying? We're totally different.

600
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,620
By the way, why did the Director suddenly quit being our advisor?

601
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,690
Are things not good between you two?

602
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,210
What are you saying? He's just busy.

603
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,200
Seonbae, you don't express your feelings at work or home, right?

604
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,720
What's the use in doing that?

605
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,870
We'd only burden each other.

606
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,310
You should do it somewhere, at the very least.

607
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,780
It's lonely to live like that.

608
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,980
Attorney Jeong, you've never been married.

609
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:43,330
You could say a married couple's relationship has more at stake

610
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,830
than coworkers' and friends'.

611
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,690
So, there's also a need to exist functionally rather than emotionally,

612
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,060
because it's a long-term relationship.

613
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,280
But you'll have a hard time as a result.

614
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,720
Why would I have a hard time?

615
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,410
Where did that come from suddenly?

616
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,560
Seonbae.

617
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,460
You know I want to help you, right?

618
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,030
What's gotten into you?

619
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,300
Mind your own business.

620
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,100
What's this?

621
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,620
Could it be she lives here?

622
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,500
 One Space 

623
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,020
She really lives in the same place.

624
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,200
Geez!

625
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,890
- Yu Ri- My goodness!
 - O-Oh, my!

626
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,790
- M-Mom!
 - Why?

627
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,800
Y-You didn't even call.

628
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,970
I brought some greens side dishes.

629
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,570
Gosh! I rarely eat at home.

630
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,100
You'll eat if there are side dishes.

631
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,280
That's how your Dad always was.

632
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,900
He said to make sure you're fed well

633
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,280
because that's the most important job for me.

634
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,680
Mom, that's gaslighting.

635
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,390
Why is your most important job feeding me?

636
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,290
Try to think critically now.

637
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,990
Think critically, my foot. He was right.

638
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,660
Don't you hate him for backstabbing you while saying those things?

639
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,770
I thought he only worked his butt off to feed his family,

640
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,460
but I'm glad now since he got to stab me in the back before he died.

641
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,350
Something happens to your brain when you get married, right?

642
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,900
What's wrong with my brain?

643
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,760
Just go.

644
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,210
Ma'am, we meet again.

645
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,390
Seriously. We meet again.

646
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,490
Attorney Han.

647
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,530
We met once last time.

648
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,290
I found out she works at your office while we were chatting last time.

649
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,760
What an interesting connection.

650
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,690
I know, right?

651
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,220
- Connection, my foot.
 - Your boyfriend isn't here today.

652
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,230
He was so tall and handsome.

653
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,420
Both of you seem so kind that you don't need law.

654
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,160
 They live recklessly even with the law. 

655
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,010
I think he'll be working late tonight.

656
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,790
I'll make beef brisket soybean paste stew using the recipe you told me last time.

657
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,820
- Yes.
 - The snail soybean paste stew was delicious.

658
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,360
Gosh, I'm glad.

659
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,950
Aigoo, go ahead.

660
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,810
Stop looking at your phone and come eat.

661
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,930
- Mom.
 - Yeah?

662
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:49,430
Please don't go around making friends with just anybody.

663
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,190
What do you mean, anybody?

664
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,500
She's your coworker and neighbor.

665
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,850
Did you forget our neighbor was actually Dad's mistress?

666
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,140
Aigoo, the soup cooked so nicely.

667
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,570
No way.

668
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,810
You're not pitying Dad, are you?

669
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,370
You're the pitiful one, not Dad.

670
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,910
You're the victim.

671
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,460
Victim and offender...

672
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,390
Is everything a courtroom in your eyes?

673
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,400
Even outside of court, a victim is a victim, and an offender is an offender.

674
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,690
So delicious.

675
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,730
By the way,

676
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:40,270
why did you try not to divorce Dad when he cheated on you?

677
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,340
Just because.

678
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,210
Because of me?

679
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,640
I was hesitant that your studies would suffer because of me.

680
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,300
I also tried to understand your dad.

681
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,170
- Wait, Mom. Look at it this way, then. 
- Try this.

682
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,240
The causality is wrong here.

683
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,060
You're saying I'd suffer because of your decision to divorce,

684
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,360
not because of Dad, who cheated on you?

685
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,640
How can you think that way?

686
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,060
Mom, it's so frustrating for me! Seriously.

687
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,510
Why can't people just get a divorce for crying out loud?

688
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,030
I'm more frustrated by you.

689
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,600
Try having your own kid later.

690
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,060
Did you study that hard to become an ambassador for divorce?

691
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,930
Are you saying divorce is bad and that it's a social evil with no end?

692
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,890
Sure! You can keep living in Joseon by yourself, then.

693
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,650
I can't live in Joseon.

694
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:47,940
I'm a divorcee. A modern divorcee.

695
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,850
Well, why do you keep ignoring my texts, Ms. Modern?

696
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,480
Because I've got my reasons.

697
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,240
I'm going to set it up, okay?

698
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,660
I'll change the passcode for the lock, okay?

699
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,580
You got a job now, so you should hurry.

700
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,790
All right! Fine! Fine!

701
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,760
"Fine"? You said that yourself, okay?

702
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,090
 Client Park Jin Suk  
 Have some rolled omelet, too.

703
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,620
M-Mom, hold on.

704
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,960
Yes, Ms. Park Jin Suk. Did something happen?

705
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,200
Hi, Attorney Han.

706
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,210
Is it okay for me to continue doing this?

707
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,000
- What?
 -  I mean... 

708
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,240
 he's begging me to drop the case, saying he'll never drink again. 

709
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,740
Do you believe that?

710
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,670
N-No, no, no, it's a bit different this time.

711
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,400
He always cursed when he got drunk and begged when he got sober.

712
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,880
But he's begging while he's drunk this time.

713
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,640
-  What's he saying this time? 
- Y-Yes?

714
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,580
He wants me to come make him food.

715
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,970
 He said he'll really quit drinking. 

716
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,850
So I wonder if I should go make him some soup, at least.

717
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:06,250
So, you're going to go back to cook food again?

718
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,590
Don't believe a word.

719
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,950
He's never eaten food other than what I made him.

720
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,310
 Gosh, I'm sick of this. 

721
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,350
Don't decide anything for now.

722
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,410
I'll see you tomorrow.

723
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,470
Why are you doing this to me?

724
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,950
Hurry up and eat.

725
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,790
Park Jin Suk!

726
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,400
 Emergency Center  
 I told you he might kill himself!

727
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,720
Mom!

728
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,210
It's not the attorney's fault.

729
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,200
Did she force you to file the complaint?

730
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,250
I'm so sick of this.

731
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,200
An unlucky wench like me can't even get a divorce.

732
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,600
I knew this would happen.

733
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,540
That's why I said I'm not going to do it!

734
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,950
What kind of nonsense is this?

735
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,060
The attorney was trying to help us.

736
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,910
Shut it!

737
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,030
I don't want to see you.

738
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,910
Leave. Go away. Aigoo, get out of here!

739
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,730
Let go! Aigoo, I'm sick of this.

740
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,500
I'm sick of this.

741
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,700
How was the hospital visit?

742
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:11,830
What should I do with the case now?

743
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,900
Just leave it for now.

744
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,910
If he dies, Estate Law will take it over and process it.

745
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:21,900
If he doesn't die, you can withdraw it according to what she says.

746
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,360
Did something like this happen to you, too?

747
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,470
Of course.

748
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:32,400
As an attorney, you'll see a lot of people who kill themselves after receiving a complaint.

749
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,480
But it's not the attorney's fault.

750
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,810
Do you think so?

751
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,200
Is it the prosecutor's fault if you kill yourself after receiving an indictment?

752
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,030
Is it the tax official's fault if you die after receiving a tax collection notice?

753
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,020
It's not, is it?

754
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,700
Convincing a hesitant client to decide to divorce

755
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,440
with your shallow sense of duty and pathetic sense of justice?

756
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,330
You shouldn't have done that.

757
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,720
Do you also think I instigated her to get a divorce?

758
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,160
I didn't say you instigated her.

759
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,460
Then, what should I have done instead?

760
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,830
Please tell my mom to get a divorce.

761
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,660
I never say such things.

762
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,190
A divorce attorney doesn't decide if you should divorce or not.

763
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,980
Try to separate your personalities.

764
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,890
Attorney Han Yu Ri and the human, Han Yu Ri.

765
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,820
Attorney Han Yu Ri can't say what the human Han Yu Ri thought in her head.

766
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,200
S-Separate personalities...

767
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,800
It should've started with Ms. Park, and not you, wanting to teach her husband a lesson.

768
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,210
Attorney Han?

769
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,930
Yes.

770
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:16,200
I did my best to console you here. Okay?

771
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:53,180
If he receives the complaint, what do you think he'll do?

772
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,890
We'd only know after having sent it. Right?

773
00:52:55,890 --> 00:53:00,920
Then, if I leave that house, what will he do?

774
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,020
Well, he'd think you're breaking up for real.

775
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,180
Then, what if I fail to bring all my belongings? Can I get them later?

776
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,230
Well, some people cooperate.

777
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,350
It'd depend on the person.

778
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,950
All right, now. That's enough—

779
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,680
In that case, if my in-laws find out, will they call me?

780
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,800
With the division of property, what happens to the water purifier that's not paid off yet?

781
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,020
Do I have to pay for it?

782
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,040
Well, they might call you or not.

783
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,880
And the one who was paying for the water purifier can continue paying.

784
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,540
- I-If-
 - All right, now! What if...

785
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,910
you get a divorce right now, how much will you get?

786
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,040
How much can I get?

787
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,230
Zero.

788
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,720
There's no property to divide here, in my opinion.

789
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,640
I told you my husband inherited three billion won.

790
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,250
Please listen up now. You said he inherited it about a month ago, right?

791
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,060
And you've been married for two years.

792
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:52,340
If the court says they can't divide the inheritance because your marriage is too short?

793
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,030
- What?
 - I won't divorce him, then!

794
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,590
Then, you shouldn't get a divorce.

795
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:01,330
Then, what do I need to do to get half of that?

796
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,200
For half...

797
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,910
I'll see you after twenty years.

798
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,800
What? T-Twenty years?

799
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,200
- Wait, how could that be? 
- Wait.

800
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,970
- If you have more questions, you can call here. 
- Okay.

801
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,590
I have another consultation right after, so you'll have to go now.

802
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:19,650
I'm so sorry.

803
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,120
Did you eat yet? There's a great tteokbokki place nearby.

804
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,450
Well, if you're fine...

805
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,810
Please call me if you've got a question.

806
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:29,110
- T-Twenty years... 
- Yes. Please take care.

807
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,610
What?

808
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,320
Let's go get some ice cream.

809
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,080
Ice cream?

810
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,840
If, if, if!

811
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,180
I hated "if" phrases during English classes, either.

812
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,440
So what did you do?

813
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,850
What do you mean? Eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

814
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,870
"If" for an "if" and asshole for an asshole.

815
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,110
It's easy.

816
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,920
I envy you.

817
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,390
Why isn't it so easy for me?

818
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,880
It's because you empathize so well, Attorney Han.

819
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,850
You keep thinking in the other person's shoes.

820
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,650
It's hard, isn't it?

821
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:37,930
When he called me and said he'd kill himself...

822
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:42,010
should I have done something to prevent it?

823
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:46,150
He's bad for calling and threatening suicide. What could you have done?

824
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,920
He wouldn't...

825
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,910
end up dying, right?

826
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,580
Don't worry too much about it.

827
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,910
People like him are likely just putting on a show.

828
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,710
You were like a seonbae just now.

829
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,770
That means a lot.

830
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,520
 Client Park Jin Suk 

831
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,730
Say ah... ah...

832
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,050
I'm not eating!

833
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,600
You need to eat to get discharged.

834
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,630
Why do I have to lie in a hospital bed?

835
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,280
What do you mean? Whose fault is this? Aigoo!

836
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,900
Just eat, you troublemaker.

837
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,280
Whose fault do you think? It's your fault! Geez!

838
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,060
What are you doing?

839
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,500
Aigoo, Attorney Han.

840
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,500
It's nothing.

841
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,740
He's just being difficult.

842
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,900
I can now see I was worried for nothing!

843
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,960
- Hurry up and apologize. 
- That hurts!

844
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,820
Attorney Han.

845
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:12,990
I'll...

846
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:17,170
 I say she'll withdraw her complaint before trial. 

847
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,170
withdraw my case.

848
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,040
What a pathetic life I have.

849
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,820
As if I can get a divorce.

850
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,520
You shouldn't say that.

851
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,160
I think divorce is for people who are better than me.

852
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:41,760
I sincerely hope your husband will change from this.

853
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,630
Attorney Cha!

854
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,320
Here.

855
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,830
How did you come?

856
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,780
Ms. Park Jin Suk, you're going through some tough times.

857
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,250
Aigoo, how did you come all the way here?

858
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,890
Ms. Park Jin Suk decided to withdraw.

859
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,970
Don't hope your husband will change from this.

860
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,960
It'll probably happen again after some time passes.

861
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,180
 Huh? What's this? 

862
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,430
That shitty man.

863
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:23,500
Come back to us after you've made up your mind.

864
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,210
We'll do our best with your case

865
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:30,330
regardless of the number of consultations. All right?

866
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,970
Thank you so much, Attorney Cha.

867
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,540
You even gave me a full refund.

868
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,590
How about you get our couple's consultation?

869
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,190
I'll introduce you to alcoholism consultation, too.

870
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:45,790
You even get a discount if you pay for five consultations at once.

871
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,810
I see. Thank you.

872
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,910
Well, then. Please take care.

873
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,650
Yes.

874
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,860
I said to eat, for goodness' sake.

875
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:18,070
You told me to send her back, but why did you bother to make a sales pitch?

876
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,900
Despite a serious incident like attempted suicide,

877
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,230
the same situation will repeat itself.

878
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,840
At that point, she's bound to decide and divorce him.

879
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,740
There comes a moment...

880
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,270
where you just accept it.

881
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,600
A moment where you only look ahead.

882
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,180
 I said your husband is having an affair. 

883
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,300
-  I'm aware. 
 -  No way. You're not going to get a divorce? 

884
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,920
 What will I have left by doing that? 

885
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,670
 My work and home are busier than ever, and I need them. 

886
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,260
 He made you sick, in fact. 

887
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,830
 Only if hadn't told him about meeting you. 

888
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,810
 I also tried to understand your dad. 

889
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,820
Attorney Cha!

890
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:10,110
What exactly is a husband and a wife?

891
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,490
 What a pathetic life. As if I can get a divorce. 

892
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,490
How can you feed your tormentor?

893
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,170
 My daughter is getting married soon. 

894
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,180
 I was hesitant... 

895
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,090
 If her wedding is called off because of my divorce, I can't live. 

896
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,680
 that your studies would suffer because of me. 

897
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,840
How can you endure it and live for your child's sake?

898
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:36,630
Strangers who became family.

899
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,020
 Daejeong Law Firm 

900
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,190
Huh?

901
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,630
What is it now?

902
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,830
I'm sorry, Attorney Cha.

903
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,440
I don't think I can work in the Divorce Team anymore.

904
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,850
What's this out of nowhere?

905
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,370
Is it because of the attempted suicide?

906
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,530
I don't want to live my life

907
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,250
while distinguishing Attorney Han Yu Ri from the human Han Yu Ri.

908
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,540
Are you going to pick at my words?

909
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:06,130
As for me... to deal with divorce cases,

910
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,500
I tend to distinguish the victim and the offender too clearly.

911
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:15,430
Are you angry you couldn't get Park Jin Suk to divorce, or

912
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:18,880
is your ego bruised because the case turned out the way I predicted it?

913
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,230
It's neither.

914
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:28,460
I made up my mind because I can't see my future.

915
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:33,530
Fine, leave. Do whatever you want to the end. Go, then.

916
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,230
Also, Attorney Cha...

917
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,170
What else?

918
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:48,070
Director Kim eats dinner at Chief Choi's house.

919
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,740
I think they might even be living together.

920
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,270
How do you know that, Attorney Han?

921
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,980
She lives in the same apartment building as me.

922
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:34,480
Attorney Cha, regarding Chief Choi,

923
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:40,940
I did it because I wanted to be on your side, not because I wanted to be nosy.

924
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,520
You can leave.

925
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,500
 One Space Apartment ... 

926
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,000
- No, I'll carry it. 
- No, I can do it.

927
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,370
I'll do it for you.

928
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,940
- Did you get hurt? 
- It was a prank.

929
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,480
You startled me, seriously.

930
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:07,250
Aigoo, I'll carry them for you.

931
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,270
- Do it together.
 - Please carry this.

932
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:12,170
- This—
 - Jae Hui, were you going to help, too?

933
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,730
You're all grown up, huh?

934
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:17,440
- I said we should do it together.
 - Aigoo, I got it.

935
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,290
- All right!
 - Gosh. Let's go.

936
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,030
What is it?

937
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,820
Nothing.

938
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:24,140
 There comes a moment where you just accept it. 

939
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,250
 A moment where you only look ahead. 

940
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:45,200
 Daejeong Law Firm 

941
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:00,980
Attorney Cha?

942
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:04,010
Your shallow sense of duty and pathetic sense of justice...

943
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,570
I love them.

944
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:06,390
Sorry?

945
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,970
You said you want to teach him a lesson, right?

946
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:10,260
I'll let you do that.

947
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:17,570
Could it be you really went to the apartment?

948
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,060
I didn't accept your resignation letter.

949
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,510
You take my case, Attorney Han.

950
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:38,360


951
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,320
♫  Facing challenges I persisted  ♫

952
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:46,100
♫  Learning to navigate heavy day  ♫

953
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,970
♫  But, it's still hard  ♫

954
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:53,780
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫

955
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,510

♫  will also blur  ♫

957
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,160
♫  Keep holding on  ♫

958

♫  In the end there will be a bright day  ♫

 Good Partner 

961
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,170
 Since when did you know? 

962
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:17,820
 Adulterers always ask that. I guess they just have to know, huh? 

963
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:21,830
 There's a rumor that Sa Ra is the other woman. 

964
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,400
 So, what will Mom and Dad do? About the divorce. 

965
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:30,330
 If I reveal how selfish and what kind of a mom you were, will you be okay? 

966
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:35,000
 Attorney Cha! Is the rumor that's going around true? 

967
