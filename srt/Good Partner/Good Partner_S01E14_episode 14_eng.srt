 Daejeong

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,000
 In session | Plaintiff

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:34,970


5
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,000
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,390
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,230
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,020
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,740
I'm thinking about doing one more courageous thing.

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,100
What is it? Just give me the word. I'll help—

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,580
I'm going to leave.

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,500
What do you mean leave?

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,020
I will become independent from this firm.

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,510
So, you should become independent from me.

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
Yes.

16
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,100
It's still not too late.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
Must you leave?

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,060
Do you know what labor and marital relationships have in common?

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,890
What is it?

20
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,790
Thinking they were my everything.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,810
So, do you feel light-hearted now that you're quitting both of them?

22
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,960
Of course. Absolutely light-hearted.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,890
I'll support CEO Jeong Wu Jin's new beginning.

24
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,720
I'll arrange the ultimate farewell party

25
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,750
for Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

26
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,620
No. I want to be supported for a new start, not the end.

27
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,610
Okay. I understand.

28
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,840
Thank you for everything, Jeong Wu Jin.

29
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,720
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

30
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,230
♫  Which one is the right way?  ♫

31
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,630
Thanks.
 ♫  But there's nothing more I can do  ♫

32
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,930
♫  I just live on like that  ♫

33
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,700
Assistant Manager Kang, how did Ppo Ppi's surgery go?

34
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,510
You knew about that?

35
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,180
I'm Cha Eun Gyeong.

36
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,890
Did you think I wouldn't know?

37
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,290
- It's been great working with you.
 - Likewise.

38
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,450
Manager Ahn, has it been about fifteen years since we met?

39
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,510
It's been fourteen years and seven months, Attorney Cha.

40
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,450
You were always like this, Manager Ahn.

41
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,110
You always caught all the details I missed.

42
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,320
You know I really relied on you, right?

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,410
Thank you, Attorney Cha.

44
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,340
Thank you.

45
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,440
I felt so bad for not being able to attend your father's funeral.

46
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,220
My Jeju trial spanned two consecutive days at the time.

47
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,140
You still remember that?

48
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,600
It's okay.

49
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,690
I knew you had a trial when I saw the court schedule.

50
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,890
In return, you sent me hefty condolence money.

51
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:52,570
I was always grateful you knew my schedule better than I did.

52
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,610
Thank you for your work.

53
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,880
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow   ♫

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,530
It's almost your baby's first birthday, right?

55
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,940
Yes, two weeks left.

56
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,660
You'll get more sleep after the first year.

57
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,300
I noticed you were always sleeping face-down during lunch.

58
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,790
I felt bad for you.

59
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,610
Thank you for your kind words.

60
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,770
Good job.

61
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,960
Thank you for everything.

62
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,700
- It's been a pleasure.

69
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,110
I'm off.

70
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,220
Attorney Cha.

71
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,070
Yeah.

72
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,590
I want to follow you.

73
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,560
You can't.

74
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,510
I don't think this is right, no matter how I look at it.

75
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,850
You dedicated your life to this company and even got a divorce.

76
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,650
How could you just leave in vain like this?

77
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,560
Attorney Han.

78
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,540
You think I got a divorce because of this company?

79
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,990
No. My relationship with that man only amounted to that.

80
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,150
And I already got compensated for everything.

81
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,080
Financial compensation, reputation in society, and...

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,990
a junior colleague like you, Han Yu Ri.

83
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,450
Then, please take me with you.

84
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,650
I still have a lot more to learn from you.

85
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,260
Attorney Han, remain here and soak everything up.

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,340
And let's meet as partners someday, not as an employer and employee.

87
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,320
All right?

88
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,330
Come here.

89
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,500
I'll get going.

90
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,750
 The end of the most important relationship in our lives 

91
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,940
 comes suddenly when we least expect it. 

92
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,680
 However, the end result of something I've done on my own 

93
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,770
 is beautiful, no matter what anyone says. 

94
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:26,230
 And now I know that an end also means the start of a new beginning.    Daejeong Law Firm 

95
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,970
 So, farewells aren't just painful. 

96
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,720
The common space is nice, too. Plenty of natural lighting.

97
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,540
It's quite high up.

98
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,550
The space is quite generous and warm.

99
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,930
It's a good deal.

100
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,490
It's exotic and modern because of the wooden interior.

101
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,840
There's a lot of interest in this one.

102
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,540
- You can come this way.
 - Okay.

103
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Please welcome CEO Attorney Jeong Wu Jin for his inauguration speech. 
  DAEJEONG 

104
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,640
Thank you.

105
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,820
The reason Daejeong Law Firm was able to get to where it is today

106
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,870
is thanks to former CEO Oh Dae Gyu

107
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,590
and the incredible employees who gave their all.

108
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,670
I'll do my best and support you all, so Deajeong Law Firm

109
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,580
can become a company that does essential work in the world.

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,150
I ought to replace this.

 CEO Attorney Jeong Wu Jin 

114
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,430
- Congratulations, CEO Jeong.
 - Thank you.

115
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,400
You really aren't going to move your office?

116
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,630
Yes. I'll just stay here.

117
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,360
You can leave the CEO's Office for advisors.

118
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,930
- Still, you're the CEO, and this is too— 
 - No.

119
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,780
I like this office.

120
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,070
Because this is where I began.

121
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,280
I'm happy you're staying here, CEO Jeong.

122
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,310
Thank you.

123
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,660
- Senior Manager Ahn.
 - Yes.

124
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,920
Please tell Attorneys Han and Jeon to come to the conference room.

125
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,550
Yes, got it.

126
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,560
I plan to make personnel changes for Daejeong's new start.

127
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,310
I wanted to hear your opinions.

128
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,620
Personnel changes?

129
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,550
Attorney Jeon, Divorce Team was your first pick since you were hired, huh?

130
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,200
Do you still feel the same?

131
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,660
Yes, I like the Divorce Team, CEO Jeong.

132
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,570
I still have a lot to learn.

133
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,420
I'd like to stay here.

134
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,470
You don't even need to think about it?

135
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,810
I'd be grateful.

136
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,900
You'll be happy with this?

137
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes.

138
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,730
Attorney Han, your first pick is the Corporate Team, right?

139
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,300
Yes.

140
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,030
But when I saw you come out on the news last time,

141
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,720
you'd be good at public interest cases, too.

142
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,960
What do you think about moving to the new team, the Social Contribution Team?

143
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,610
You can also go to the Corporate Team if you'd like to do that instead.

144
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,650
What would you like to do?

145
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,760
First off, thank you for the great offer, CEO Jeong.

146
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,320
Could I give it some thought and give you an answer?

147
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,340
Of course. Take your time and let me know anytime.

148
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,220
Thank you.

149
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,620
Do you remember coming here on your first day of work?

150
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,150
Of course, I remember.

151
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,700
I was puzzled you asked me to eat dinner on my first day. "What is this?"

152
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,320
But you got an order from above

153
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,170
and brought me here to take special care, huh?

154
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,910
It was so shocking.

155
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,630
Aren't you Attorney Han Yu Ri?

156
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,950
Yes, I am.

157
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,190
I'm a big fan, Attorney Han.

158
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,550
What? A-A fan?

159
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,250
I saw you holding a picket in front of the court.

160
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,940
I thought all attorneys were cold, but you're so kind.

161
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,670
Because you told the victims to take courage on the news,

162
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,760
my cousin went to a shelter for domestic abuse victims.

163
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,390
Thank you so much.

164
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,310
Could we please take a picture with you?

165
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,490
- A-A picture?
 - Just one.

166
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,660
Should I take it for you?

167
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,270
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

168
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,920
I'll take a few in a row.

169
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,120
There. Take a look.

170
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,090
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

171
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,580
I wish you good luck.

172
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,440
- Keep it up! Attorney Han.
 - Thank you.

173
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,930
See, Attorney Han? I told you you'll become an at-fluencer.*
(short for attorney influencer)

174
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,870
It feels so awkward. Way too awkward.

175
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,210
Let's have a toast.

176
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,380
At-fluencer!

177
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,950
Jeong Wu Jin? Why did he bother sending me this?

178
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,780
 I can't bring you coffee anymore, so use this instead. 

179
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,940
 Seonbae, your coffee. 

180
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,380
 Congratulations on going independent, Seonbae. From Jeong Wu Jin. 

181
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,650
Mom!

182
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,540
You're here?

183
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,060
It's all complete now.

184
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,640
I love that I can walk here.

185
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,960
Right?

186
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,750
Come here after school to have snacks with me before you go to the academy.

187
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,780
And I can go to all of your school events now.

188
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,220
- Really?
 - Yes.

189
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,230
I'm so excited.

190
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,300
Don't you have a room for me?

191
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,670
There.

192
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,660
What's this? It's a playroom.

193
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Am I a kid?

194
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,520
Many moms hold their kids during consultations because

195
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,730
they couldn't find a sitter.

196
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,350
That's why I made it.

197
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,360
So, it's not my room, then.

198
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,550
Well, it's not your room,

199
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,940
but it does have your seat.

200
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,140
And there's a job for you, too.

201
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,190
When I'm doing consultations,

202
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,780
you can play with the kids if there are any, right?

203
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,500
Mom, I'm a minor.

204
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,310
You know it's against the labor law, right?

205
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,740
Little Cha Eun Gyeong.

206
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,770
Yes, I'm Little Cha Eun Gyeong.

207
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,400
You want Big Cha Eun Gyeong to buy you something yummy?

208
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,820
- Really?
 - Yes.

209
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,490
Let's go.

210
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,420
Will this really be enough?

211
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,820
Yes. I like tteokbokki.

212
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,520
Kim Jae Hui really is my daughter.

213
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,710
Eat slowly.

214
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,870
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?

215
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,070
Oh, yes.

216
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,700
This is for you.

217
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,920
Thank you.

218
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,750
Take care.

219
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,010
 Hongim Detention Center, Inmate Number 3978 

220
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,420
A detention center?

221
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,010
 Hello, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong. 

222
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:08,000
 My name is Park Yeong Jin, Number 3978. I'm in jail for fraud. 

223
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,330
 I got a divorce complaint from my wife, so I need to appoint an attorney. 

224
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,390
 As you can tell, I can't go outside for consultations. 

225
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,600
 Could you please come visit me once? 

226
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,700
 I'll sign the retainer right away if you bring it with you. 

227
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,890
You can go inside now.

228
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,380
I'm going in alone, right?

229
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,360
- Yes.
 - Yes.

230
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
How do you do?

231
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
How are you?

232
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,420
You said you got a divorce complaint?

233
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,290
I mean, she needs to take care of her husband if he gets locked up.

234
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,670
How could a wife send him a divorce complaint?

235
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,110
Well, it's her first time, so it can happen.

236
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,850
What do you mean the first time?

237
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,010
I took care of my wife in jail until last year.

238
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,870
Isn't this too harsh of a betrayal?

239
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,390
- Sorry?
 - When my wife was locked up,

240
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,600
I visited her every week and put money into her inmate account.

241
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,980
But she sent me the complaint right away when I got locked up.

242
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,960
This isn't an equal marriage life, is it?

243
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,390
O-Oh, I see.

244
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,220
I really didn't know she'd betray me like this when she knows me best.

245
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,630
My wife and I met at a CS club.

246
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,880
- CS?
 - Yes.

247
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,890
Are you talking about customer service?

248
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,380
A chool-so* club.
 ("Released from prison" in Korean.)

249
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,830
CS. Chool-so.

250
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,220
So, there's a club where those released from female jails

251
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,330
and male jails meet up.

252
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,630
I see.

253
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,670
I brought the retainer you mentioned.

254
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,780
You can sign.

255
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,760
Attorney Cha, could you come just one more time next week?

256
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,860
If you put some money into my inmate account,

257
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,180
I'll sign the retainer right away next time you come.

258
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,260
I won't take your case.

259
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,970
Don't ever send me another letter.

260
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,670
Wait— Attorney Cha...

261
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,120
He didn't even sign the retainer and wasted my time.

262
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,440
This is nuts.

263
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,320
Would I be able to pay the rent at this rate?

264
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,440
I need to get a combination lock or something.

265
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,590
My goodness.

266
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,100
 Congratulations on your business. Wish you great success. 

267
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,750
Ta-da!

268
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,270
My goodness!

269
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,890
How did you know about this place?

270
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,710
Wait, I wanted a tour of the office.

271
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,410
I barely managed to close up.

272
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,580
I'll invite you next time. Come back then. Thanks.

273
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,420
- Then, can you buy me some meat?
 - Huh?

274
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
How did you know about my office? You even brought a planter.

275
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,930
I looked you up in the Bar Association.

276
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,910
You already registered your business.

277
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,510
You're incredible, Han Yu Ri.

278
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,740
Attorney Han, give me the tongs.

279
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,590
It's okay. I'll do it.

280
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,760
I said, give it to me!

281
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,270
Gosh, seriously.

282
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,080
I'll grill the meat so you get the check.

283
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,670
Sorry?

284
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,990
You have a higher salary than I do now.

285
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,500
So buy me this meal.

286
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,710
Attorney Cha! You're exaggerating, aren't you?

287
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,790
I got a letter from the detention center, so I ran straight over

288
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,090
thinking I'd make this month's rent. But I couldn't sign him on.

289
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,750
Thank goodness you didn't follow me, Han Yu Ri.

290
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,210
Attorney Cha, do you know you look a bit different today?

291
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,620
Why? Do I look pathetic without the glory of a grand law firm?

292
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,780
No. You look honest and at ease.

293
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,820
And...

294
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,330
We've put our ranks aside, didn't we?

295
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,560
Eat up.

296
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,820
Gosh, this looks good.

297
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,830
Thanks for the meal!

298
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,850
- I'll dig in.
 - Let's be clear about who's paying.

299
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,790
I'm stuffed.

300
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,290
My hubae* ( junior ) even treated me.

301
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,570
That's a first.

302
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,710
You're just starting out now.

303
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,090
You'll become more and more prosperous.

304
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,990
Gosh, I did hear the outside world is cold.

305
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,670
But it's colder than I expected.

306
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,900
Did you get a business card yet?

307
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,560
Yeah.

308
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,230
Here.

309
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,020
 Spring Back Law Firm 
 "Once winter passes, spring will return." 

310
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,100
 Spring Back, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

311
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,330
What is Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's "Spring Back" like?

312
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,930
A place where litigation is the last option

313
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,010
and settlement is the top priority.

314
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,720
A place where I can swiftly recover spring for my clients.

315
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,100
To compare it to a hospital,

316
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,800
they wouldn't treat you excessively

317
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,270
and would provide only necessary treatments.

318
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,900
Yes.

319
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,270
Well, Attorney Cha.

320
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,460
CEO Jeong asked me...

321
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,040
 What do you think about moving to the Social Contribution Team? 

322
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,570
 You can go to the Corporate Team if you'd like to do that instead. 

323
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,760
what I think about transferring teams.

324
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,180
Can you give me a proper prescription?

325
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,150
I'd like to hear your advice.

326
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,810
Attorney Han.

327
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,520
Yes!

328
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:47,000
You know, you're the only one who knows the answer, right?

329
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,460
 Case 14: The Art of Fighting 

330
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,990
Have you been well, Attorney Cha?

331
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,590
- Congratulations on opening your own firm. 
- Thank you.

332
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,810
How did you know about this place?

333
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,790
I came looking for you because I want a divorce.

334
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,530
You look like you finally made up your mind.

335
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,070
Yes. Please give me the contract.

336
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,750
Okay.

337
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,260
 If I take care of her by her side, she'll be able to stay strong. 

338
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,110
 She can't go back to that hell again. 

339
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,660
 So, did you tell her to just trust you again? 

340
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,690
 I told her to let me lead her. 

341
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,150
 Convincing a hesitant client to decide to divorce 

342
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,900
 with your shallow sense of duty and pathetic sense of justice? 

343
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,190
 You shouldn't have done that. 

344
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,870
 Then, what should I have done instead? 

345
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,590
Ms. Park Jin Suk.

346
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,290
Yes.

347
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,870
What do you think about working with Attorney Han Yu Ri instead of me?

348
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,820
You don't have an appointment today, so you can't.

349
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,140
My husband kicked me out!

350
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,980
Oh, please. I beg of you!

351
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,860
He says I'm not his wife when we've lived together for 26 years!

352
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,320
I'm begging you!

353
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,440
Attorney Han...

354
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,450
What's going on?

355
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,330
You're the lawyer on TV, right?

356
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,310
Please hear my story!

357
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,420
Oh, I'm sorry. It wouldn't be meaningful to give you advice here.

358
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,200
I got kicked out with absolutely nothing.

359
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,310
He gambled away all the money I earned and

360
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,890
I'm about to lose the one thing I have left!

361
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,770
Please, I'm desperate! Please do me this favor!

362
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,910
Please, I beg of you!

363
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,600
It seems like your situation is urgent.

364
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,200
How about you try going to this office?

365
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,360
 Spring Back, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

366
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,250
She's the most incredible lawyer I know.

367
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,700
She'll help you with her wise ways.

368
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,910
 Spring Back, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

369
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,450
Yes?

370
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,410
Attorney Han, your scheduled client is here.

371
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,400
Attorney Han, it's been a while.

372
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,730
Ms. Park Jin Suk...

373
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,020
I came to get a divorce.

374
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,480
Are you certain this time?

375
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,940
Of course. Absolutely, for real this time.

376
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,300
If possible, I want to live my life well.

377
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,830
Hurry up and get me a contract.

378
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,060
Gosh, I'm insane.

379
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,330
I handed over a case to Han Yu Ri when I couldn't afford to help others.

380
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,190
Insane. Absolutely insane.

381
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,700
Excuse me. Is anyone here—

382
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,770
Is this a law firm?

383
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,980
Yes!

384
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,070
- Are you closed?
 - No. Come on in.

385
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,720
Okay.

386
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,420
Okay, this way.

387
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,360
Have a seat.

388
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,660
I'll get some tea.

389
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,760
It must be urgent since you're here at this hour.

390
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,520
What brings you here?

391
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,270
My husband kicked me out.

392
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,540
 To make a living, I worked in the fields, in a restaurant, 

393
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,220
 or cleaning buildings. There isn't anything I haven't tried doing. 

394
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,890
Hey.

395
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,220
Today's your payday, right?

396
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,250
Where's your bag?

397
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,010
How do I live if you take that, too?

398
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,670
 He'd gamble away everything when I worked myself down to the bone. 

399
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,160
 I survived off of just rice and kimchi. 

400
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,070
 The flowers are blooming.  
   . 

401
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,800
It started with 10,000 won, 20,000 won.

402
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,180
Then the stakes gradually increased.

403
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,310
 I had my doubts, but you lost it all. 

404
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,440
-  In the end, he even lost our house. 
 -   I'm sorry about this. 

405
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,990
Does that mean you have no assets at all right now?

406
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,670
A few years ago, my mother-in-law left us some land when she passed away.

407
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,020
 So, you're saying someone wants to buy this for 1 billion won (~ &amp;753,000 USD)? 

408
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,140
 It wasn't even worth 100 million won when my mom was alive. 

409
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,600
 That's what I said. Were you lied to all your life? 

410
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,870
 All the landowners in this area 

411
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,950
 became rich overnight thanks to the redevelopment. 

412
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,030
 What do you say? You want to sell? 

413
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,110
 Why would I sell it? 

414
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,650
 I can increase the value ten times. 

415
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,430
 No, Honey! Stop it! 

416
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,160
 Hey, where's my seal? 

417
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,510
 You can't sell that land. 

418
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,940
 You knew about it, didn't you? 

419
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,130
 - Know what?
 - Your expression says it all. 

420
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,680
 How wicked are you? 

421
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,570
 It's not just yours! 

422
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,630
 If you want to sell it, give me my share first! 

423
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,460
 - Finally showing your true colors, huh?
 - Honey... 

424
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,470
 Save a thief from the gallows, and he'll cut your throat. 

425
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,470
 You call yourself my wife? 

426
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,290
 - Where is it? Where's my seal? 
- Honey! 

427
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,750
 - Stop it!
 - Where is it? 

428
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,390
 Hey! I provided for you for 26 years! Of course, I'm your wife! 

429
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,930
 Geez, I let an old hag live with me, and look at this... 

430
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,790
 - Oh, my goodness!
 - Get out! 

431
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,430
Gamblers continue to gamble until they've nothing left.

432
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,520
They usually have nothing to divide when you try to divorce them.

433
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,070
You did yourself a favor by coming when he's still got the land, at least.

434
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,210
You can divorce him if his gambling is proven, putting the blame on him.

435
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,330
But Attorney Cha,

436
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,010
I couldn't get my marriage certificate.

437
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,940
The marriage certificate... For 26 years?

438
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,550
He probably didn't sign it to kick me out like this.

439
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,300
Aigoo, I'm the fool!

440
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,590
You didn't sign the marriage certificate?

441
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,040
That's actually very good news.

442
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,510
You can't get a divorce without it, no?

443
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,960
I can't get any money, either.

444
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,320
Ms. Jeong Mal Suk,

445
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,970
you'll be laughing all the way from here on out.

446
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,730
Huh?

447
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,010
 Professionals shouldn't say such things so easily. 

448
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,210
 Are we god or something? 

449
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,520
 Just trust in me. 

450
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,160
Just trust in me.

451
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,610
    There is  a provisional seizure on the land. 

452
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,660
 It says the creditor is Ms. Jeong Mal Suk. 

453
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,810
 Are you preparing to get a divorce? 

454
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,970
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

455
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,090
  
 - Talk to my attorney instead of me.  
 - Is she crazy?

456
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,850
 Spring Back Law Firm 
 "Once winter passes, spring will return." 

457
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,020
Has she gone mad?

458
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,090
What the heck is this?

459
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,180
You did this, huh?

460
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,930
It's called a provisional seizure.

461
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:51,630
It's a temporary legal order preventing you from selling as you wish the land in your name.

462
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,020
What kind of bullshit is that?

463
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,850
This is my land. Why can't I do what I want with it?

464
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,120
Look here. There's a thing called the title.

465
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,630
Don't you know? You're an attorney.

466
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,960
You didn't care about ownership when you gambled away Ms. Jeong Mal Suk's money.

467
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,640
But the title matters to you now, huh?

468
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,560
During marriage, regardless of the title the couple's properties,

469
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,370
all are considered mutually owned.

470
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,190
Wow, glad to hear that.

471
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,130
You said "during marriage" just now, right?

472
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,900
Jeong Mal Sook, that f***ing thief.

473
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,060
I didn't sign the marriage certificate because I knew she'd do this.

474
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,300
That bitch left this out, right?

475
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,300
My job became very easy because you didn't sign the marriage certificate.

476
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,580
What are you saying?

477
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,550
If you sign the marriage certificate, it becomes a legal marriage.

478
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,170
So, proving the cause of divorce is strict.

479
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,400
And when you're in a short common-law marriage, proving itself is tricky.

480
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,580
But you were in common law marriage for 26 years.

481
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,190
There's more than enough evidence since you lived together for such a long time.

482
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,390
So, it's a very easy case for an attorney.

483
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,660
How can the laws be like this?

484
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,890
You're totally robbing me!

485
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,000
This is a settlement offer.

486
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,620
If we go to trial, the estimated verdict will cost you 500 million won. (~$375,700 USD).

487
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,250
- 5-500 million won?
- But Ms. Jeong says she'll settle for 300 million won. (~$225,500 USD)

488
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,970
 Settlement Offer 

489
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,500
Seriously. Whoa, you're such a comedienne.

490
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,930
I heard about the job you're dedicating yourself to.

491
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,730
Should your wealth grow through that endeavor...

492
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,290
In other words, what do you think will happen

493
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,740
if you get to own two billion won  ?

494
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,850
Well, what's going to happen?

495
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,510
If you own more assets,

496
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,590
you'll naturally have to give more money to Ms. Jeong as well.

497
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,800
And the verdict might cost you one billion won, not 500 million won.

498
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,510
Will you waste your money fighting for the sake of fighting,

499
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,020
or will you save money through a logical solution?

500
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,390
The 300 million won settlement offer is effective until 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

501
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,280
Please take your time to think about it.

502
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,200
 Client Park Jin Suk 

503
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,380
Could it be...

504
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,340
another...

505
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,500
It can't be, right?

506
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,920
Yes, Ms. Park Jin Suk.

507
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,400
 Attorney Han, I'm sorry, but... 

508
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,800
 I don't want to get a divorce. 

509
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,450
Ms. Park Jin Suk, what's the matter this—

510
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,610
No, this won't do.

511
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,330
Where are you? Let's meet right now.

512
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,710
Ms. Park Jin Suk!

513
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,830
Why did you come all the way here? You're busy.

514
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,020
I mean, what's going on here?

515
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,830
Third-stage uterine cancer?

516
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,460
Come on. Take a seat.

517
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,070
They said they wouldn't know until they opened me up.

518
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,570
They'll give me surgery if it seems doable or

519
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,370
stitch me back up if it doesn't seem possible.

520
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,670
But what's the use in divorcing?

521
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,680
I might end up dead anyway.

522
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,050
Where's Mr. Kim Jong Bok?

523
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,120
No way.

524
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,420
He didn't come?

525
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,020
Not even once.

526
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,670
I told him I was sick and

527
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,450
he told me to stop making a big deal.

528
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,230
I didn't even tell him it's cancer

529
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,220
because I know what he'll say.

530
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,970
He'll only give me a harder time for nothing.

531
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:43,170
That's why you need to settle things with divorce.

532
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,170
I don't know. I'm tired.

533
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,110
Isn't it better to die with a clean title,

534
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,040
rather than dying after becoming a divorcee?

535
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,420
 It's your fault! Geez! 

536
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,210
 He made you sick, in fact. 

537
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,440
The future is bleak.

538
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,530
Things like hope and the will to live...

539
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,720
must've all been luxuries for me.

540
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,370
I told myself...

541
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:33,690
that I'd never try to convince anyone to divorce.

542
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:40,970
But you decided on your own this time, Ms. Park Jin Suk.

543
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:46,050
Should I do it after I get better, then?

544
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,510
I'm just...

545
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,760
too exhausted, and it's hard.

546
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,550
I'll make sure to resolve it for you.

547
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,150
Just focus on getting better, Ms. Park Jin Suk.

548
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,640
 ­Spring Comes Back 

549
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,020
He said he won't pay, right?

550
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,650
Yes.

551
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,720
But he'll pay you, though.

552
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,300
I'm sure you know very well since you lived together.

553
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,420
Gambling addicts are deluded they'll become very rich in the near future.

554
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,690
I gave him an offer he couldn't refuse.

555
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,150
I'm sure he's tallying up the numbers by now.

556
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,370
Anxious it might be a bigger loss

557
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,900
to divorce after becoming a rich person,

558
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,800
he'll eventually conclude he must end it even if he has to borrow money.

559
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,320
I don't think he'll pay me so easily.

560
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,150
He looks down on me a lot.

561
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,820
Even if he looks down on you,

562
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,630
he won't be able to look down on his losses.

563
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,960
You've done your best to make a living,

564
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,420
but you've only been downtrodden instead of getting rewarded,

565
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,730
so you must live a life of reward and rest from now on.

566
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,090
Would I really get to live like that?

567
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,570
I want to get myself a room first.

568
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,180
I lived on rice and kimchi for 26 years.

569
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,010
But the study dorms only have rice and kimchi, too.

570
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,250
Have faith in me and wait on him.

571
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,850
 All right. Here we go. I'm in, too. 

572
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,020
What are you doing? You need to raise the stakes.

573
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,470
Gosh, you're embarrassing me. Can't you tell?

574
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,130
You said your mom's land is worth one billion won.

575
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,200
Did you lose it already?

576
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,730
No, it's still there.

577
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,880
But they won't give me the loan.

578
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,800
Because my wife placed a provisional seizure or something.

579
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,530
What a shame.

580
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,580
We'll be playing a big game today.

581
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,760
With that money, you'll probably double it right away, Oppa.

582
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,130
 I heard about the job you're dedicating yourself to. 

583
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,300
 Should your wealth grow through that endeavor... 

584
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,390
 In other words, what do you think will happen 

585
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:41,500
 if you get to own two billion won, not one billion won? 

586
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,080
 If you own more assets, 

587
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,780
 you'll naturally have to give more money to Ms. Jeong as well. 

588
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,750
 And the verdict might cost you one billion won, not 500 million won. 

589
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,700
If I deposit the money,

590
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,410
what will happen to the provisional seizure?

591
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,400
I'll lift it the moment you make the deposit.

592
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,380
 Will you waste your money fighting for the sake of fighting, 

593
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,180
 or will you save money through a logical solution? 

594
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,490
 The 300 million won settlement offer is effective until 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. 

595
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,250
 Please take your time to think about it. 

596
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,830
Hey...

597
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,390
- Attorney Han.
 - Yes.

598
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,410
So, did you give the CEO an answer?

599
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,780
Huh? About what?

600
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,800
About moving to a different team.

601
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,730
No, I'm still thinking about it.

602
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,030
You're still thinking, huh?

603
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,160
How about we grab a beer?

604
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,330
How does pizza and beer sound?

605
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,990
I'm sorry.

606
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,830
I have an important mediation case I must take care of today.

607
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,430
This late at night?

608
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,030
Yes.

609
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,110
All right. Hang in there.

610
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,220
- Thanks.
 - Sure.

611
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,970
Are you really interested in moving to a different team, too?

612
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,090
I like working on divorce cases. I like it, but...

613
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,750
I think this is an important decision for my career.

614
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:39,510
I also think it's about time I seriously question what I really excel at.

615
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,830
Do you remember me?

616
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,960
What is it now?

617
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,360
Will you go to my wife and encourage her to divorce me?

618
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,600
You get off work on the dot. What got you to ask me to buy you a drink?

619
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,590
What's the matter?

620
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,110
Well, it's nothing special, really.

621
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,700
You became the CEO, and

622
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,730
Attorney Cha left as well.

623
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,920
And Attorney Han is also thinking a lot about moving teams, too.

624
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,170
I was wondering if I'm the only one who's stagnant.

625
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,480
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

626
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,330
Not at all. Don't say that.

627
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,910
As the CEO, I'm thankful to have people talk to me like this in advance

628
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,740
instead of quitting after agonizing over it alone.

629
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,980
Daejeong is the only one with a divorce team among the major law firms.

630
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,700
That's why I only applied to Daejeong.

631
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,630
Oh, you did?

632
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:20,140
Man, I'm proud as the founder of the Divorce Team.

633
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:28,670
But honestly, I think it's not too late to work on divorce cases after experiencing other fields.

634
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:34,110
I wonder if I decided on my specialty too soon in my career.

635
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:39,070
Well, most people experience a thing or two first

636
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:43,150
and then finally realize what it is they want.

637
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:49,640
But in my opinion, you tend to realize what you want quite quickly.

638
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,980
Isn't that right?

639
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,030
Do you think so?

640
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,750
Huh?

641
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,860
Hold on now.

642
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,420
That man really said he'll agree to settle for divorce?

643
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,320
I told him going to trial will only worsen your health

644
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,920
and he accepted it.

645
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,330
He wouldn't just accept that.

646
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,080
So what do I need to do?

647
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,990
Do I just need to go to the hospital and feed her and stuff?

648
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,220
Please think about what it is Ms. Park Jin Suk wants.

649
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,180
Also...

650
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,970
please listen.

651
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:01,990
This time, he listened carefully to your story, Ms. Park Jin Suk.

652
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:15,120
You've gone through so much thus far.

653
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,080
Gosh, Attorney Han...

654
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:28,210
I've met more than a dozen divorce attorneys so far.

655
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:34,570
But I've never seen one as kind as you.

656
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:38,560
I'm sure you're the only one

657
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,210
who can convince that man.

658
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,860
Thank you so much.

659
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,990
I really appreciate it.

660
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,830
I'm more thankful for you.

661
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,670
Thank you for coming back to me.

662
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:02,120
I felt really bad after the last time.

663
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,450
Attorney Han...

664
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:11,750
I'll go through treatments and really live a good life.

665
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,390
Yes.

666
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,480
You better live to be 100 years old.

667
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,250
Aigoo, why live to be 100? So silly...

668
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:29,030
I'll be rooting for your precious life as well, Ms. Park Jin Suk.

669
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,150
Thank you so much.

670
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,860
Thank you so much.

671
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,570
Thank you so much.

672
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,810
I knew this would happen.

673
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:46,660
He'd rather lose it all through gambling. He'd never pay me.

674
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,510
We still have two more minutes.

675
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,190
Have faith in me and wait.

676
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:10,360
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, ten million...

677
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,260
 Deposit: 300 million won 

678
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,530
I told you to have faith in me.

679
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,740
My goodness. He really gave me this much money.

680
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,520
How on earth did you do this?

681
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,200
He got caught in a trap.

682
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,180
Did you lay a trap, Attorney Cha?

683
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,970
No, it's a trap Kim Chang Seob created it himself.

684
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,130
The trap of lies denying his spouse and

685
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,620
the trap of delusion, thinking he'd make more money.

686
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,940
I only showed him the way to the traps he laid down himself.

687
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,680
The settlement happened quickly, thanks to that.

688
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,190
Thank you so much.

689
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,660
How can I repay you? I'd do anything for you.

690
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,970
Then...

691
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,030
would you like to have dinner with me?

692
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,210
I've seen these things only in dramas.

693
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,030
It's my first time in my life.

694
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,500
You said you only ate rice and kimchi.

695
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,280
So, I wanted to buy you once.

696
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,930
What do you mean? I should be buying you.

697
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,490
Ms. Jeong Mal Suk, you got your portion of the assets,

698
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,080
so you need to send me the attorney's fee.

699
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,950
Of course.

700
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,940
I got kicked out without a penny.

701
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,160
But you were merciful and said I can pay you later.

702
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,230
I was so thankful for that.

703
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,090
- Please help yourself.
 - Yes.

704
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,980
They're too pretty to eat.

705
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,870
It feels so weird, but it's so delicious!

706
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:57,210
If it weren't for you, what would I have done?

707
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,020
At first, I went to Daejeong.

708
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:03,340
The place inside an enormous building.

709
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,260
But the attorney there told me to go see you, Attorney Cha.

710
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,570
I'm so thankful for that attorney, too.

711
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,930
Who was it from Daejeong?

712
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,510
The one who looks smart and kind and came out on TV.

713
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,270
Han Yu Ri. Yes.

714
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,490
I see.

715
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,860
- Let's eat now.
 - Yes.

716
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,000
- I can't waste any.
 - Take your time.

723
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:06,240
but she told me to go to Attorney Han Yu Ri.

724
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,390
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong did?

725
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,580
 What do you think about working with Attorney Han Yu Ri instead of me? 

726
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,530
 Sorry? 

727
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:19,220
 In your previous lawsuit, she really wished to get you divorced. 

728
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,930
 She'll know your story best. 

729
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,420
 She also communicated with Mr. Kim Jong Bok in person before, 

730
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,840
 so she can try for a settlement. 

731
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,210
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong said you'd be able to reach a settlement

 - Yes.

I'll remain on the Divorce Team.

May I ask why?

759
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,670
Because I want to save my client's precious time

760
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,000
and recover their smiles.

761

I think that's what I'm best at.

762

 What direction do you want our Divorce Team to go in the future? 

763
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,430
 A team that saves someone. 

764
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:43,040
 A divorce team that opens up new lives, not putting an end to them. 

765
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,320
Geez, you really are the same.

Nothing.

 Hongim Detention Center

Gosh, I didn't think you'd ever return.

773
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,170
I told you not to send me any letters.

774
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:24,000
I really had no intention to con you at the time.

775
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,570
I wanted to speak with my wife one more time before appointing an attorney.

776
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,540
I'm sorry if I offended you.

777
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,160
All right.

778
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,230
I'll let you fool me one more time.

779
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,540
Why did you want to see me today?

780
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,930
I spoke with my wife for the last time,

781
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,900
and I just couldn't change her mind.

782
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,000
So, I'm just going to divorce her.

783
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,450
Then, let's wrap it up nicely with a settlement instead of fighting.

784
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,770
Okay, I'll sign the contract.

785
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,690
And...

786
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,950
can you meet with these people?

787
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:13,110
- Who are they? 
 - You're quite famous behind bars, too.

788
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,410
This place is crawling with people who want a divorce.

789
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,840
They all were served with complaints.

 2655, 1004 

791

All right.

792
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,900
I'll consult with them one by one.

793
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,910
I'll get settlements if possible since their situations are all difficult.

794
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,090
Yes, thank you.

795
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,350
- Sure.
 - Thank you.

796
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,900
Sign here.

797
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,310
- Damn!
 - Honey, Honey!

798
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,750
How did you—

799
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,360
Are you tailing me now?

800
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,910
No, I'm not.

801
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:57,180
I went to the law firm and followed you as you left.

802
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:01,050
Honey, I'm in big trouble.

803
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:03,630
You know that land? I bet it in a game and—

804
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,360
You lost everything, didn't you?

805
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,690
- Honey.
 - Go away.

806
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,760
- Move!
 - Wait, Honey. Honey!

807
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,080
Honey!

808
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,430
- Hello.
 - Honey!

809
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,030
Wait, Honey. Hold on. Honey!

810
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,830
Wait, Honey! Seriously!

811
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:23,000
F***! Honey...

812
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,880
 - Congratulations!
 - Congrats. 

813
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:36,450
All you big law firm lawyers came to my humble office.

814
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,420
Thank you. Thank you!

815
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,220
Come on, what do you mean, humble?

816
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,740
It's fabulous.

817
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,280
Yes, and every lawyer's dream is to become independent like this.

818
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,010
- Attorney Jeon.
 - Yes?

819
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:51,820
Did you just say you want to go independent in front of your boss?

820
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:55,130
CEO Jeong, my tongue slipped. My mistake!

821
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,870
I'll have to let you go.

822
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,410
 Spring Back Law Firm
 "Once winter passes, spring will return." 

823
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,630
- Attorney Cha. 
- Yeah.

824
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,190
Give me a moment.

825
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,880
Sure.

826
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,850
Was it your plan?

827
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:13,220
Sending Ms. Park Jin Suk to me.

828
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,960
"Plan" seems a bit grand.

829
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:22,870
Thank you for allowing me personally to complete Ms. Park Jin Suk's divorce.

830
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:27,000
I saw the direction I should go, thanks to you.

831
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,180
That's great.

832
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,200
And why did you send Ms. Jeong Mal Suk to me, Attorney Han?

833
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,990
Because you were worried you couldn't pay your rent.

834
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,550
I'm just kidding.

835
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:48,880
Ms. Jeong Mal Suk seemed to need your negotiation technique the most.

836
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:54,850
Well, did you use your fighting technique to its fullest as well?

837
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:58,020
I don't have any special technique.

838
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,800
I just try my best.

839
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:06,850
The technique of realizing what you're fighting for and what matters more.

840
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,080
You have that, Attorney Han.

841
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,620
I know it the best.

842
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,810
Thank you.

843
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:19,640
When an attorney steps up a bit more and brings forth a settlement,

844
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:24,270
our clients get to save their precious time, right?

845
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,010
Yes.

846
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:30,530
Let's review over and over again what attorneys can do

847
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,130
before things need to go to trial.

848
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:39,220
Wait, is it "Spring Back" because we should look back at each case like

849
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,240
how spring comes back each year?

850
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,000
 "Once winter passes, spring will return." 

851
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,580
I thought it meant spring comes after winter passes.

852
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,090
It's both.

853
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,360
You're one smart cookie.

854
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,110
Let's clean up.

855
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,610
Okay!

856
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,210
   You two failed to settle. 

857
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,470
Let's go to trial, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

858
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:22,660
Yes, I'll see you in court, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

859
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:33,960


860
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,380
♫  Keep holding on   ♫

861
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,020
♫  In the end a bright day will come   ♫

862
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,070
♫  Remember this moment  ♫

863
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,080
♫  when your dream came  ♫

864
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,760
♫  When you're tired,  ♫

865
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,390
♫  It's okay even if you stop  ♫

866
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:55,260
♫  It isn't the end  ♫

867
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:59,860
♫  It's going to be the start for you  ♫

868
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,740
♫  Sometimes you can take a break and look back  ♫

869
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:09,670
♫  You can hide in that time for my sake  ♫

870
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:16,490
♫  Feel free to pause, please take a break  ♫

871
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:19,550
 Good Partner 

872
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,370
 She wants to do it every day. How can I live like this? 

873
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,320
 You're a sex addict! 

874
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,790
 An 80-year-old grandpa would be better than that! 

875
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,600
 You mean erectile dysfunction, right? 

876
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,290
 I'm your opposing attorney, not your subordinate, Attorney Cha. 

877
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,500
 Did you meet Attorney Han Yu Ri? 

878
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,620
 She came as the opposing attorney. 

879
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,240
 Throwing it all out there since it hasn't been proven? 

880
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,310
 Is that how I taught you? 

881
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,930
 Then, can you prove it, Attorney Cha? 

882
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,350
 That's why I'm here. 

883
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,060
 Let's go to trial, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong. 

884
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,320
♫  when your dream came  ♫

885
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,750
♫  When you're tired  ♫
