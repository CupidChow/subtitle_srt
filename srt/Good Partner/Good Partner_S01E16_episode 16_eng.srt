1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,360
 Good Partner 

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,450
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,120
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:34,820


5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,010
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,600
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,580
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,080
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,300
 1 year later   
 You really didn't have to drop me off.

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,430
- Go in.
 - Okay. Bye-bye!

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,170
- Jae Hui, call me later!
 - Okay.

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,650
CEO Cha.

13
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,790
The CEO Attorney personally attends trials?

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,300
And you, Seonbae? Aren't you also a CEO?

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,150
I guess so.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,970
I heard Spring Back is doing well these days.

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,040
You're not still living off kimbap while working, are you?

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,800
There's a reason I referred Attorney Jeon to you.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,270
To learn WLB*? 
 (Work-Life Balance)

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,430
Of course, you should.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,370
I have another trial. Get going.

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,740
Don't skip your meals.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,410
Okay, take care.

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,550
Hello.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,190
Attorney Han, hello!

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,120
Hello.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,350
- Hello!
 - Hello.

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,150
Hello!

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,400
Hello.

30
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,150
- Yes?
 - Attorney Han.

31
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,720
The orientation for the new attorneys is ready.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,240
Oh, I'll be right there.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,890
Okay.

34
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,440
Hello, Attorney Han.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,490
We don't have many years between us. You don't have to be so polite.

36
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,960
Please sit comfortably.

37
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,030
I'm really happy to be working with a star attorney.

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,020
You were my idol even before I got hired to work here.

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,810
Welcome to the Divorce Team.

40
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,660
You're not disappointed to take on divorce cases as soon as you become a lawyer, are you?

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,320
How could I be disappointed?

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,740
I always wanted to become a divorce attorney.

43
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,900
I look forward to the cases I'll be taking on.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,410
I'll do my best.

45
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,840
That's good to hear.

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,390
Most new attorneys don't want to take on divorce cases.

47
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,710
 Am I really a new hire for the Divorce Team? 

48
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,290
 What do I need to do to transfer to the Corporate Team, then? 

49
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,480
By the way, do you have a car?

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,210
What about a watch?

51
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,280
I don't have one.

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,230
A car and watch are must-haves for attorneys.

53
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,980
You'll be really uncomfortable without them.

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,570
We have a lot of regional trials

55
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,540
and it's rude to keep checking the time on our phones in front of our clients.

56
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,400
All right?

57
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,780
 Buy a car first. Buy a watch, too. 

58
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,650
 To an attorney, time is life. 

59
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,430
 But if you keep checking the time on your phone, 

60
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,900
 that's not good etiquette for the client. 

61
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,840
I'll make sure to wear a watch.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,440
As for a car...

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,320
I think I'll be fine using public transportation.

64
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,660
Sure.

65
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,420
 Daejeong 

66
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,700
 Attorney Lee Han Na 

67
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,280
 Final episode 

68
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,780
Aren't you tired from driving me home every night on your way home?

69
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,890
- Why don't we justâ€” 
 - Come on.

70
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,880
We only get to see each other briefly on our way to and from work.

71
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,090
Don't say that.

72
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Sorry. I've been so busy, haven't I?

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,430
No, it's all right.

74
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,730
But it should get better with a new hire, right?

75
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,440
Yeah.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm always grateful to you, Attorney Jeon.

77
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,620
What I know for sure

78
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,670
is that nothing in life goes according to plan.

79
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,940
Just like how I became a divorce attorney and met you.

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,140
But I like it.

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,250
 Daejeong Law Firm 

82
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,090
Jeong Wu Jin.

83
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,960
You're here.

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,140
 27 years ago 

85
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,110
Jeong Wu Jin?

86
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,060
- Yes.
 - All right. Let's get along.

87
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,520
You can call me "Aunt" from now on.

88
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,430
It's my first time seeing you in your office.

89
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,360
You're impressive, Jeong Wu Jin.

90
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,570
Wu Jin.

91
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,150
Yes.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,940
Help me break it off with your dad.

93
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,860
I'm sorry for asking you to do something like this.

94
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,210
But it doesn't make sense for me to ask somewhere else, does it?

95
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,430
Are you certain about your decision?

96
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,850
Yes.

97
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,260
It seems like we can't even hold a rational conversation now.

98
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,640
Submit a complaint right away.

99
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,470
I feel really bad for you.

100
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,880
It's okay. Don't be.

101
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,520
I'll ask our ace attorney to take good care of your case.

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,810
 Daejeong 

103
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,510
Did you ask for me, CEO Jeong?

104
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,260
Attorney Han...

105
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,330
She would like to divorce Advisor Oh Dae Gyu.

106
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,710
Please take good care of her.

107
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,440
Advisor Oh Dae Gyu?

108
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,500
I'll leave it in your hands.

109
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,280
Yes.

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,600
I understand. Please come this way.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,540
May I ask why you chose Daejeong?

112
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,510
I thought it might prompt him to swiftly end the relationship.

113
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,730
It'll be troublesome for him if he rejects the divorce.

114
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,390
If his firm takes the case, he'll cut it short out of embarrassment.

115
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,060
I know how that man thinks.

116
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,540
I see.

117
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,690
Have you tried reaching a settlement?

118
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,480
There's no point in trying to settle.

119
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,750
He'll keep insisting he's right, so I don't want to attempt talking to him.

120
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,560
It's been three years since we've seen each other.

121
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,310
I want to end it now.

122
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,220
All right, I understand.

123
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,900
I don't want to run into him, so I'll get going.

124
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,260
Oh, yes.

125
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,040
What are you doing here?

126
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,650
You said a settlement starts with a complaint.

127
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,290
I came here to file a complaint. Why?

128
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,960
Did you forget this is my company?

129
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,930
It's my son's company.

130
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,140
It doesn't make sense to go elsewhere.

131
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,740
My son is the CEO here.

132
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,160
I should at least save on legal costs.

133
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,730
I don't know how much you'd give me anyway.

134
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,610
This woman! Are you out of your mind?

135
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,410
Stop right there!

136
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,970
Attorney Han, what did that woman say?

137
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,020
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,450
I'm Ms. Park Ae Yeon's legal representative.

139
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,830
What? You entered a contract with her?

140
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,400
Who would allow you to submit a complaint against me in my own firm?

141
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,280
CEO Jeong gave me the order.

142
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,870
Hey, Jeong Wu Jin. What are you doing right now?

143
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,910
Daejeong is sending me a complaint?

144
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,330
How is this any different from a son sending his father a complaint?

145
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,630
She raised me.

146
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,280
I can't tell her to go elsewhere.

147
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,690
You know a lot of lawyers.

148
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,990
You can appoint a lawyer from somewhere else.

149
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,460
What? You ungrateful punk!

150
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,180
Now is not the time to be prideful.

151
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Aunt, who spent decades waiting for her husband at home.

152
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,850
Please try to understand her just for once.

153
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,570
I haven't done anything wrong.

154
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,360
Why should I be the only one to understand her?

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,570
There's no use in regretting after the divorce.

156
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,200
It's entirely possible due to the separation period.

157
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,490
I was her human ATM.

158
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,020
I was nothing but a money-making machine to her!

159
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,330
Looks like you'll get the divorce.

160
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,660
That's what the gray divorce couples always say.

161
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,050
Hey!

162
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,630
I know you worked hard.

163
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,950
But insisting that your wife understand all that is unacceptable.

164
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,220
Aunt also made sacrifices for her family. It's the same.

165
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
When did I ever insist that she understand?

166
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,430
I thought she would get over it by now.

167
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,280
Who knew she would demand a divorce?

168
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,710
You suggested separation first.

169
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,560
I thought that would make things better.

170
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,680
You...

171
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,030
 Â­Spring Back Law Firm 

172
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,910
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

173
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,700
CEO Oh?

174
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,100
My wife is asking for a divorce.

175
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,480
- Sorry?
 - She even hired Daejeong.

176
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,520
My company!

177
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,860
Have you ever witnessed anything like this?

178
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,030
I'm absolutely speechless.

179
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,960
I heard you resigned.

180
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,990
Even so, what kind of nonsensical betrayal is this?

181
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,780
So what brings you here, CEO Oh?

182
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,630
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

183
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,030
Please take my case.

184
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,700
You absolutely cannot lose.  Put those Daejeong ingrates in their place!

185
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,670
 Last Case: Good, Partner 

186
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,750
Next, we'll begin...  
  Today's Court Hearings Directory 

187
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,040
Divorce Case 2025DH8723.

188
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,190
Plaintiff, Park Ae Yeon, and Defendant, Oh Dae Gyu.

189
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,660
Legal representatives, please come forward.

190
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,130
Please have a seat.

191
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,420
As the legal representative of the plaintiff, Park Ae Yeon,

192
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,310
Attorney Han Yu Ri from Deajeong Law Firm is present.

193
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,690
Yes.

194
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,990
As the legal representative of the defendant, Oh Dae Gyu,

195
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,960
Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong from Spring Back Law Firm is present.

196
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,650
Yes.

197
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,640
All right, please present the complaint statements.

198
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,390
 Â­Defendant 

199
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,640
The plaintiff raised the defendant's child with devotion

200
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,650
and lived her life supporting the defendant.

201
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,330
The defendant has not only failed to appreciate the plaintiff's sacrifice

202
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,430
but has taken it for granted.

203
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,570
The plaintiff argues the marriage deteriorated to the point of divorce

204
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,190
because the defendant neglected their family

205
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,560
and treated the plaintiff unfairly.

206
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,200
Your Honor, that's absurd!

207
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,450
The defendant has not yet submitted a response.

208
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,810
What is your position?

209
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,740
If you have any criteria to propose regarding the division of assets,

210
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,950
I'll schedule the next hearing as a settlement conference.

211
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,410
The defendant is not in favor of divorce.

212
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,270
Are you opposed to the divorce?

213
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,760
Yes.

214
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,770
I knew he'd do that.

215
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,470
It's been over three years since we lived separately.

216
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,790
He just wants to make my life miserable!

217
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,730
The defendant has been financially responsible for the household for about thirty years.

218
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,840
He may not have been able to spend much time with the plaintiff,

219
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,350
but the claims that he neglected the family or treated them unfairly are unfounded.

220
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,400
Your Honor, I was merely her human ATM!

221
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,000
If you were an ATM, I was a maid.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,160
For decades, I cleaned up after a man who didn't lift a finger at home.

223
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,030
I even fed, clothed, and devotedly raised his child

224
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,930
from another woman, but you weren't even thankful.

225
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,890
Why don't you be a little more honest?

226
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,420
You think I'm useless since I don't make money anymore, right?

227
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,560
You jerk. As the saying goes, "It takes one to know one."

228
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,890
Forget everything. If you don't give me half, this will end in a ruling.

229
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,000
Money, money, money! This is why I feel like an ATM.

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,550
Did I have Wu Jin from an affair?

231
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,040
The woman I dated before we got married suddenly showed up, saying

232
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,230
saying he was my child. What could I do?

233
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm sick of this! That nonsense again?

234
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,850
That's not what I was talking about.

235
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,750
Have you ever once told me, "Thank you"?

236
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,660
What? Be honest!

237
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,830
You exploited Wu Jin as my weakness to your advantage!

238
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,040
When did I ever?

239
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,960
How could you say that about your child?

240
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,350
Now, now!

241
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,320
- CEO Oh?
 - That's enough.

242
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,690
This is a court of law.

243
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,680
This is infuriating.

244
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,460
You ungrateful...

245
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,880
What? What are you glaring at?

246
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,910
You think you're the best, don't you?

247
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,560
"Ungrateful"? Look who's talking!

248
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,370
- This womanâ€”
 - Seriously!

249
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,400
Aunt, let me escort you.

250
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,090
- All right.
 - Attorney Han, see you at the office.

251
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,520
Yes.

252
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,090
She thinks she's all that!

253
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,890
CEO Ohâ€”

254
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,480
Well, the two seem to have a lot to say.

255
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,890
Let's arrange a meeting for them to talk before our next hearing.

256
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm off.

257
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,860
Yes, I'll get in touch with you!

258
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,360
CEO Oh!

259
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,200
I think you two need to talk privately rather than go through the court.

260
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,890
We'll help ensure you have a productive conversation.

261
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,230
What conversation?

262
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,120
Just see this through to the end, Attorney Cha.

263
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,100
I don't mean to be impertinent,

264
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,710
but you still seem to have lingering feelings for her.

265
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,450
What?

266
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,780
It's not like that!

267
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,610
That woman knows how to push my buttons.

268
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,360
This might be your final chance.

269
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,540
Will you be okay with arguing without any communication,

270
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,380
even if it ends with a ruling?

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,260
Dear, this is no small matter.

272
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,320
That was tough, wasn't it?

273
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,730
So, I don't have to be present for the next hearing?

274
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,550
Typically, after the first hearing,

275
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,840
you have to attend if a settlement conference is scheduled.

276
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,860
Is a settlement conference different from a court trial?

277
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,230
I'm allowed to say whatever I want to?

278
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,670
Yes.

279
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,830
You have a lot you want to say, right?

280
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,950
Maybe it's because I've held in what I've been wanting to say.

281
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm going to speak my mind in the end.

282
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,470
You should.

283
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,530
But if you end up reaching a ruling,

284
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,450
you might not receive up to 50% of the assets.

285
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,620
It doesn't matter if it's not 50%.

286
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,480
He kept claiming all he did was earn money.

287
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,940
"Then, at least give me all that money," is what I'm saying.

288
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,040
You know what kind of life I led.

289
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,330
I lived solely as that man's wife.

290
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,820
How could he not acknowledge that all this time?

291
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,660
Exactly.

292
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,220
You really went through a lot.

293
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,560
You did a great job today, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

294
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,560
As the company CEO and family to the client,

295
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,750
I feel so reassured.

296
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
Thank you.

297
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:26,180
I had no idea you had that kind of backstory.

298
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,680
You'll probably handle it well on your own,

299
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,640
but please recognize the client's true feelings until the end.

300
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,210
Even family members have trouble doing that.

301
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,980
All right. I understand.

302
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
- Hey, Attorney Jeon.
 - CEO Jeong!

303
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,660
- Getting off work?
 - Yes.

304
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,880
- Are you working hard?
 - You bet I'm working hard.

305
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,220
- You're looking even better.
 - Gosh.

306
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,850
I've been working overtime.

307
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,660
I miss Daejeong.

308
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,720
But I think this is considered to be on the dot.

309
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,220
No, it isn't! What are you saying?

310
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,620
All right. Hang in there.

311
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,210
- See you next time.
 - Okay.

312
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,100
- Take care.
 - Bye!

313
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,370
Hey.

314
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,550
Thank you.

315
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,210
Thanks for coming when you're busy.

316
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,750
If you call me, of course, I should.

317
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,100
It's nice drinking the coffee you brewed.

318
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,490
I also wanted to hear your opinion, Attorney Jeon.

319
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,920
Regarding what?

320
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,520
CEO Oh Dae Gyu.

321
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,930
From what I can see, he has zero desire to divorce.

322
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,120
Am I misreading him?

323
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,680
I keep calling him for the terms of the settlement,

324
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,190
but he keeps dragging it out.

325
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,280
CEO Oh, have you thought about the terms of the settlement?

326
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,840
 Attorney Cha, give me more time to think about it. 

327
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,990
- All right.
  - Okay. 

328
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,460
CEO Oh, have you thought about the terms of settlement?

329
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,740
In my opinionâ€”

330
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,800
Attorney Cha, something urgent came up. I'll call you back.

331
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,050
- CEO Oh!
  - I'll think about it and call you back. 

332
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,740
Helloâ€”

333
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,560
What do you think, Attorney Jeong?

334
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,840
I agree with you.

335
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,290
He's quick to get angry when he's sorry

336
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,870
and raise his voice when he's lonely.

337
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,430
He's the typical patriarchal husband.

338
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,960
Is that right?

339
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,950
What about Ms. Park?

340
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,500
She doesn't say it outright,

341
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,150
but I think she's very frustrated.

342
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,850
I wonder if it's mediation that she's seeking.

343
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,800
I see.

344
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,990
I'll think about what I can do for them.

345
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,130
Thank you.

346
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,210
You're always thanking me.

347
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,820
 Daejeong Law Firm 

348
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,450
I believe everyone here knows that if strong emotions still linger,

349
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,280
having a rational conversation will be difficult.

350
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,520
So, we arranged a meeting for you to talk for the last time.

351
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,340
Yes. First of all, we've drafted the proposed content into a document.

352
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,120
I'll pass it along since it could lead to a possible agreement

353
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,410
if you review it.

354
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,980
She's willing to proceed with the divorce without going to trial for 2 billion won.

355
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,780
If you end up going to trial, it'll be over 4 billion won.

356
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,420
I think it is an acceptable offer for the defendant.

357
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,740
I see.

358
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,920
 If it's not out of lingering feelings, 

359
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,960
 are you seeking dismissal because of the money? 

360
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,600
 Because you don't want to divide the assets? 

361
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,770
 Is this your first rodeo? Of course, that's the reason! 

362
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:13,260
 Then, if they suggest a lower amount than if you were to go to trial, 

363
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,200
 - I guess you'd immediately seal the deal.
 - Of course! 

364
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,610
 I wouldn't think twice if it was 2 billion won. 

365
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,290
 They keep talking about 4 or 5 billion won. 

366
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,160
 That's why I don't want to divorce. 

367
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,430
That's within the range my client was expecting.

368
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,170
Let's wrap things up.

369
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,310
That's a relief.

370
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,200
Then, let's sign it and submit it to the court.

371
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,570
Agreed.

372
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,070
CEO Oh? Please sign here.

373
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,260
- CEO Oh Dae Gyu?
 - Give me a minute, Attorney Cha!

374
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,310
How could you accept the initial amount from the other party right away?

375
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,130
You should try to lower the amount.

376
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,840
Is this why I appointed a lawyer?

377
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,810
Why are you suddenly changing your mind?

378
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,670
- Why don't youâ€” 
 - Stay put, Attorney Cha!

379
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,450
If that's how you're going to play, I can ask for more.

380
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,720
I can also pursue a lawsuit.

381
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,960
- Go ahead!
 - Fine.

382
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,190
You always treated me like a maid at home. Of course, you think it's a waste.

383
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,550
Have you ever once thought of me as your wife?

384
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,150
What about you? Did you consider me your husband?

385
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,420
Not some money-making machine?

386
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,820
You want to say you worked hard to earn money for your family

387
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,320
and would like to be recognized, right?

388
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,220
Then, just say that. Why are you beating around the bush?

389
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,820
What are youâ€”

390
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,390
 Yes, Attorney Cha. 

391
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,880
 Attorney Han, are you free to talk? 

392
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,280
 Yes, what is it? 

393
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,830
 Regarding the division of assets, 

394
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,870
 CEO Oh suggested 2 billion won. 

395
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,300
 Really? She asked for 2 billion won, too. 

396
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,620
 In that case, a settlement should be possible. 

397
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,900
 If they don't sign right away, even though the amounts match, 

398
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,660
 that's lingering feelings. 

399
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,050
 Then, instead of giving counsel, 

400
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,440
 let's translate for them. 

401
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,190
 Translate? 

402
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,050
You didn't even come home using work as an excuse.

403
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,420
You have no conscience.

404
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,230
She means the time she spent raising the child,

405
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,140
managing the household and waiting for her husband was very lonely and difficult.

406
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,780
Exploit the fact that you raised someone else's child for a lifetime, why don't you?

407
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,810
He felt deeply grateful and sorry toward Ms. Park, enough to think she was exploiting,

408
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,610
but he was never able to express it all this time.

409
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,150
What are you two doing right now?

410
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,910
We're translating.

411
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,580
If you're going to translate, do it right!

412
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,290
I gave up my life to maintain my family and do house chores.

413
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,620
And he calls that exploitation.

414
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,040
How on earth does that translate to "sorry and thank you" for me?

415
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,230
He's the actual exploiter.

416
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,030
Isn't it true that most couples have a tendency to want to appear good

417
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,490
and receive praise from each other,

418
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,950
often turning the other into a "super exploiter"

419
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,480
while seeing themselves as a "super victim"?

420
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,200
 Settlement 

421
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,710
Before making a decision,

422
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,350
as a couple, I hope you reflect on whether

423
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,880
you've been focused on insisting on your own position

424
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,630
rather than listening, understanding, and considering each other's perspectives.

425
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,060
 Â­Settlement 

426
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,400
What are you doing right now?

427
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,130
Thank you, and I'm sorry for everything, Ae Yeon.

428
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,130
- What?
 - I said thank you.

429
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,460
Thank you for everything.

430
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,530
The reason I was able to go out and work

431
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,460
was all thanks to your sacrifice.

432
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,140
I'm so thankful and feel bad that you had to raise our Wu Jin.

433
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,230
But I was foolish

434
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,730
and old-fashioned that I never told you how I felt.

435
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,690
This could be my last chance.

436
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,450
I'm so...

437
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,490
foolish.

438
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,460
Thank you...

439
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,420
and I'm sorry.

440
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,350
No...

441
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,940
No.

442
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm the same.

443
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,710
I know you went through so much.

444
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,270
I'm aware our lives were good, thanks to you.

445
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,440
But...

446
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,390
I felt so hurt

447
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,390
and lonely.

448
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,480
I was always...

449
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,790
alone for 30 years.

450
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,050
Shall we go?

451
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,170
Where are we going?

452
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,390
You said you wanted King crabs, Honey.

453
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,600
I'm buying, so let's go.

454
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Aigoo, how long will I have to listen to you boast

455
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,470
that you fed and provided for me

456
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,610
after buying me something expensive?

457
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,210
Just get in the car.

458
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,600
Father.

459
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,200
Y-Yeah.

460
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,020
A moment, please.

461
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,290
You should open the door for her now.

462
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,200
Have a good time.

463
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,520
Take care, Mother.

464
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,470
All right, Woo Jin.

465
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,670
I'll see you at home.

466
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,220
All right.

467
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,280
Thanks for today.

468
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,220
Lawyers aren't responsible for reconciliation.

469
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,150
Claim additional compensation.

470
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,150
Let's sit down.

471
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,010
CEO Oh...

472
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,050
had eyes full of regret since the moment he came to my office,

473
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,510
but he kept being stubborn for no reason.

474
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,130
I'm sure my mother was the same.

475
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,550
She was separated due to her pride,

476
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,910
but she kept asking about Father's well-being.

477
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,220
We set up Han Yu Ri and Jeon Eun Ho.

478
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,060
And we also reconnected CEO Oh Dae Gyu and his wife.

479
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,400
We're doing a lot of good things.

480
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,200
Seriously. We did a lot of good things.

481
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,670
Jeong Wu Jin.

482
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,180
It must've been really tough for you.

483
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,900
You don't have anything else you're hiding from me, do you?

484
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,370
I don't.

485
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,400
I'll be your friend.

486
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,000
- Weren't we friends already?
 - Hey.

487
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:27,910
 Spring Back Law Firm 
 "Once winter passes, spring will return." 

488
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,380
 Spring Back Law Firm 
 "Once winter passes, spring will return." 

489
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,710
- Hello, Attorney Cha.
 - Hello, Attorney Cha.

490
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,060
Hello. Let's get to work.

491
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,930
â™«  But there's nothing more I can do  â™«

492
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:05,430
â™«  I ...  just live on like that  â™«

493
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,180
â™«  Each day to me could be a new day  â™«

494
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,620
Hello. This is Spring Back Law Firm.

495
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,800
Okay.

496
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,680
Thank you.

497
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,410
- CEO Jeong.
 - Yes.

498
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,200
It's rough for you lately, right?

499
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,030
I need to work hard to protect Daejeong.

500
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,720
You'll also protect the Divorce Team, right?

501
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes! I'll do my best. Fighting.

502
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,360
Fighting.

503
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,420
I'll get going.

504
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,020
Attorney Han Yu Ri.

505
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,510
Yes.

506
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,840
I don't think I got to thank you properly.

507
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,420
Thank you so much for taking care of this case so well.

508
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,920
â™«  It's going to be the start for you  â™«

509
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,870
What are you reading so intently?

510
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,720
Shall we continue reading at home now?

511
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,350
Yes.

512
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,170
 My Little Prince 

513
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,910
- Jae Hui.
 - Yes?

514
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,040
About the arboretum that you and your dad went to every year...

515
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,640
Yes. Why?

516
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,280
You know there's a festival there soon, right?

517
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,350
I do.

518
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,020
Just tell me anytime if you want to go with Dad. Okay?

519
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,650
Mom, should we order some delivery at home?

520
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,380
- Kimbap and tteobokki?
 - No, chicken and tteokbokki.

521
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,200
Okay.

522
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,340
- I have to make a call.
 - See you tomorrow. Take care!

523
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,650
 Little Cha Eun Gyeong 

524
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,840
Jae Hui!

525
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,560
Eonni, could I see you right now?

526
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,310
Of course. Where should I go?

527
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,590
How can you insist it's love in court?

528
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,020
But I thought it was love.

529
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,100
Anyhow, last week...

530
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,910
If we keep getting more work like this...

531
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:43,260
I don't know if you'll even have time to go on dates with Attorney Han.

532
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,580
Office Manager, how did you know I'm dating Attorney Han?

533
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,920
If one of the associate attorneys leaves after hanging out together,

534
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,660
it's almost always they're together.

535
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,850
We were the only ones who thought we didn't get caught.

536
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,450
You were saying you wanted to get married all the time.

537
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,780
So, is it going well?

538
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,410
Well, I'm happy enough that I can be by her side.

539
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,180
Oh, my. You're quite the romanticist, huh?

540
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,810
Attorneys your age get so many calls from matchmakers.

541
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,900
So, I thought you'd get married real soon.

542
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,200
Marriage itself isn't what matters. Who you marry is more important.

543
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Some couples barely last a year after getting married,

544
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,800
and some couples last decades while dating.

545
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,700
- Isn't it all like that?
 - Whoa.

546
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,620
- Please take care.
 - Take care.

547
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,830
- I'll be in your care.
 - Thank you for your time.

548
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,120
- Please take care.
 - Have a good day.

549
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,560
Jae Hui, you look so great in your uniform.

550
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,510
You're already in middle school.

551
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Are you concerned about something? Why did you want to see me?

552
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,690
My mom asked me

553
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,590
what I think about starting to meet with Dad now.

554
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,330
I wanted to hear your thoughts.

555
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,540
I felt you'd understand me since we're in the same boat.

556
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:20,130
Well, this feels quite strange.

557
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,220
Is this like a meeting of children whose dads messed up?

558
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,480
Yes, that's what this is.

559
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,690
Unless it happened to you, you'd never understand.

560
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,530
He committed such a serious mistake.

561
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,270
I don't want to forgive him easily.

562
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,590
Jae Hui, this might not make sense to you,

563
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:54,500
but meeting and forgiving Dad might be two different issues.

564
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,950
How are they different?

565
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,360
Meeting him and having a fun time like before while laughing...

566
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,230
That'd mean I forgave him.

567
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,010
I completely understand you decided not to meet Dad because

568
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,410
you want to punish him.

569
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,620
But you can't be punished as well, Jae Hui.

570
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,230
You didn't do anything wrong.

571
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,850
You miss Dad, right?

572
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,990
I had thought I'd meet my dad after I forgave him.

573
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,590
 Late Han Myeong Jong 

574
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,930
But I couldn't see him in the end.

575
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,850
However...

576
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,100
I was a bit regretful.

577
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,730
I should've met him and resented him to his face.

578
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,910
- Could it be...
 - Yes.

579
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,220
He passed away.

580
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,530
It must've been tough for you.

581
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,020
Just do as you wish, Jae Hui.

582
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,000
Don't think too much about this.

583
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,830
If you need more time, you can meet him later.

584
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,070
- Do you think my mom means it?
 - Huh?

585
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,620
Telling me I can go meet Dad.

586
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,090
Hey, of course!

587
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,120
Of course, she sincerely means it.

588
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,640
I can guarantee you.

589
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,590
Don't you think Mom's acting strong again?

590
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,590
I'd be really sad if I were her.

591
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,040
I know about that the best.

592
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,180
Your mom sincerely hopes you'll do as you wish more than anyone, Jae Hui.

593
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,020
All right. It looks about done now.

594
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,150
It looks delicious. Shall we eat?

595
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,270
- Your plate, please.
 - Okay.

596
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,200
Thank you, Attorney Han.

597
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,880
Yes.

598
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,230
 Jae Hui's dad 

599
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,260
- It's been a while.
 - Yes.

600
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,810
Nothing's wrong with Jae Hui, right?

601
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,700
You fought so fiercely for custody back then.

602
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,880
Why won't you mention visitations at all?

603
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:03,430
I contemplate ten times a day whether I should contact Jae Hui first.

604
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:08,780
But I figured it was only right to wait until Jae Hui reached out to me first.

605
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,450
Jae Hui is 14 years old.

606
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,670
Do you think Jae Hui can initiate what her dad has trouble doing?

607
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,460
Jae Hui misses her dad, too.

608
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,750
Do you really think so?

609
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,390
I contacted you first because you two might be distant for good at this rate.

610
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,320
Thank you.

611
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,290
Why don't you slowly start seeing her next week?

612
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,780
I don't know if it's because some time passed,

613
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,420
but Jae Hui laughs a lot lately.

614
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,800
Will Jae Hui want to see me?

615
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,650
She probably can't forgive her dad.

616
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,330
She might not be able to forgive you.

617
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:11,190
But whether you're forgiven or not isn't important.

618
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,930
What matters is Jae Hui shouldn't lose her dad.

619
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,280
- Mom.
 - Hey, Jae Hui you're here.

620
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,600
Give me one second. I'll finish up soon.

621
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,060
Okay.

622
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,870
What did you talk about with Yu Ri?

623
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,030
You don't need to know. It's a secret.

624
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,710
Jae Hui...

625
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:59,000
I met your dad today, and he really misses you.

626
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,620
Do you want to visit his house sometime next week?

627
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,590
Just hang out with him as if nothing ever happened?

628
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,930
You two were so close.

629
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,740
It might be a little awkward at first,

630
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,320
but you'll have fun in no time.

631
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,200
You're able to do that?

632
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,700
- Can I be honest with you?
 - Yes.

633
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,990
From now on, I'll always be honest with you.

634
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,470
I don't think I can ever forgive him.

635
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:01,530
But for you, whether you forgive him or not is up to you.

636
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,290
Just meet him as your dad.

637
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,490
Because in this world he's your one and only dad.

638
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,400
 Daejeong Law Firm 

639
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,130
How could you add one more zero to the complaint?

640
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,640
Because the cause of the claim stated 1 billion won instead of 100 million,

641
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,910
I heard the defendant caused quite an uproar in court.

642
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,650
They broke down in tears, saying it was an amount

643
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,140
they couldn't earn in a lifetime.

644
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,880
How could you demand 1 billion won from someone

645
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,810
whose assets don't amount to 200 million?

646
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,860
Never again should a typo like this appear on a complaint.

647
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,010
This is a legal document.

648
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,420
I'm very sorry, Attorney Han.

649
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,600
Please correct the amount and resubmit it.

650
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,970
You can go now.

651
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,910
Yes, I understand.

652
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,010
By the way, Attorney Han...

653
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,820
Yes.

654
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,440
The case you were assigned yesterday...

655
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,340
The case of Mr. Kim Myeon Hwan and his five mistresses?

656
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,360
Yes.

657
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,670
Is something wrong?

658
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:51,170
I had a few questions while I was drafting the paperwork for that case.

659
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,130
It's a case with five defendants,

660
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:59,280
but is it right for one firm to represent all of them?

661
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,970
All six came to us because Defendant 1 said she'd pay everyone's legal fees

662
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,940
because she felt bad for five other mistresses

663
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,580
who received a complaint because of her.

664
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,600
Yes, I'm aware of that, but...

665
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,910
it feels ethically wrong to me.

666
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,840
Sorry?

667
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,920
Each defendant might make a different claim

668
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,570
and I have some doubts about

669
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,370
whether it's appropriate for one office to handle a case

670
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,810
where their interests are in direct conflict.

671
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,850
My previous firm never handled a case this way.

672
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,910
Your previous firm?

673
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:43,860
Aren't you a rookie attorney?

674
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,790
I worked as a paralegal at a law firm for five years

675
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,130
before attending law school.

676
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,430
Nonetheless, that matter should be handled by CEO Jeong.

677
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,040
To win the cases that were assigned to you,

678
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,710
you just need to diligently argue and prove your points.

679
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,020
You can go now.

680
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,690
Yes.

681
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:31,000
Attorney Cha, we have a new hire.

682
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,310
But I'm totally lost as to how I should teach her.

683
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,440
I'm not confident with questions like this.

684
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,620
Didn't you hear two new hires quit before you started?

685
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,560
You survived me because you're Han Yu Ri.

686
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,360
What? What are you talking about?

687
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:56,320
You taught me to like the divorce cases I once hated.

688
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,470
Well, what kind of character is she? Lay it on me.

689
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,610
 I look forward to the cases I'll be taking on. 

690
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,080
 I'll do my best. 

691
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,800
She's very clear-minded.

692
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,140
 It feels ethically wrong to me. 

693
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,140
And she's ethical.

694
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,700
She worked as a paralegal at a law firm for five years

695
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,010
before becoming a lawyer.

696
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,230
But...

697
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,850
 I think I'll be fine using public transportation. 

698
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,640
 I have some doubts. 

699
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,330
 My previous firm never handled a case this way. 

700
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,580
I guess you can say she has strong convictions?

701
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:40,900
But that oddly angers me.

702
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,720
That's totally Han Yu Ri.

703
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,180
What?

704
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,770
 I'm certain it's not an affair. 

705
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,020
 I'll get it denied. 

706
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,640
 The court mustn't overlook this, either. 

707
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,730
 He needs to be taught a lesson. 

708
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,350
You're right.

709
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,050
I'm sorry for everything, Attorney Cha.

710
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:15,400
This is what it means to be in someone else's shoes, huh?

711
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,710
Well, I don't have any advice for you.

712
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,350
Because I know you'll do better than me.

713
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:31,090
Will I really be able to do well?

714
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,860
Try giving her more cases.

715
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,570
Because she'll eventually find the answer in the process.

716
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,280
To an attorney, cases are the medicine, right?

717
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,720
Should I try that?

718
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,680
I didn't think about that.

719
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,300
Please take a look at this one.

720
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,260
I just don't understand, so I don't know how I should respond.

721
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,230
Are things going well with Attorney Jeon?

722
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,890
Let me see your hand.

723
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,440
My hand?

724
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,460
What's this?

725
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,550
Let's go on dates, eat delicious food,

726
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,540
and watch movies together like we do now every day.

727
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,990
Though I don't know the answer yet...

728
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,050
Attorney Han.

729
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,170
There's no answer.

730
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,380
Marriage, remain single, and divorce...

731
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,660
They're all choices.

732
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:05,320
It's not that we need to make the right choice in itself.

733
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,980
It's putting in the effort to make that the right choice.

734
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,550
And if you've done your part by putting in the effort,

735
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,670
you can make another choice without regretting it.

736
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,980
Repeatedly making choices and taking responsibilities.

737
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,930
Isn't that what life is about?

738
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,210
Yes.

739
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,670
Regardless of what choice I make,

740
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:45,590
I'll do my best to make that the right choice.

741
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,580
Thank you, Attorney Cha.

742
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,480
Fighting, Han Yu Ri.

743
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,240
Fighting.

744
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,550
Fighting, Cha Eun Gyeong.

745
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,140
 Client: Attorney Cha, I've gathered all the evidence. 

746
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,270
 I've got more than 100 undeniable items. 

747
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,130
Good.

748
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,920
Shall we toast?

749
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,520
- Please enjoy.
 - Yes. Thank you.

750
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,700
- CEO Jeong! You're here.
 - Hey.

751
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,200
- You made it.
 - Whoa, tteokbokki and kimbap.

752
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,050
- Here. Let me pour you one.
 - Thank you.

753
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,670
So, tell me. How are things going?

754
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,390
Sorry? Wh-What do you mean?

755
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,010
You said you'll wait until Attorney Han opens up.

756
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,670
Well, I was going to tell you.

757
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,200
I took the courage.

758
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,630
Wow, that's Jeon Eun Ho for you.

759
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,850
I can't end up like you after just waiting around.

760
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,260
What? Me? Wh-What about me?

761
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,390
I'm just rooting for you.

762
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,770
Cheers!

763
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:31,880

 for your hard work 

768
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,780
It's been a while since the three of us got together.

769
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,500
Her workbooks.

770
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,070
She's extremely on edge because of the mid-terms next week.

771
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,110
You're in for some trouble.

772
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,860
Jae Hui obsesses over tests a lot.

773
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,530
She takes after her parents, after all.

774
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,530
Don't worry. I'll get her prepared.

775
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:27,250
She's too old for you to get her prepared now.

776
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,860
Just let her tackle it on her own.

777
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,600
Okay.

778
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,800
Thank you for looking after Jae Hui's feelings and letting me meet her again.

779
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:46,990
I hope you'll smile a lot at Jae Hui and reach out to her first.

780
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,690
I'll do that.

781
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,580
Jae Hui.

782
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,730
I'll get going now. Have a good time with Dad.

783
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,470
I'll get going.

784
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,870
Jae Hui.

785
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,440
â™«  Cause you are beautiful  â™«

786
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,450
â™«  A beautiful stranger  â™«

787
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,440
 Making your child smile again. 

788
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:51,080
 Creating an environment where she can receive love from her parents equally. 

789
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,390
â™«  A beautiful stranger  â™«

790
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,110
â™«   Please hug my shrivelled heart â™«

791
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,660
 That's the completion of divorce. 

792
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:07,560
â™«  It will be very brief  â™«

793
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:15,130
â™«  Eventually, it's will pass again  â™«

794
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,210
Dad, you saw it, right?

795
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,180
Daebak!

796
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,320
â™«  Cause you are beautifu  â™«

797
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,590
I'm sorry, my daughter.

798
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:33,570
 What a child wants isn't parents who blame themselves... 

799
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,630
 but parents who fulfill their roles properly. 

800
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:42,020
â™«  In the end loving you again  â™«

801
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,880
I'll assign you 10 more cases.

802
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,790
Think about what written letter each case needs next, and let me know.

803
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:56,390
You can do it, right?

804
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,080
 Try giving her more cases. 

805
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,720
 Because she'll eventually find the answer in the process. 

806
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,320
 To an attorney, cases are the medicine, right? 

807
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,030
Of course.

808
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,990
At the last office I worked at,

809
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:16,180
the attorneys worked on 50 cases simultaneously.

810
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,430
I'll only have 30 cases in total after these.

811
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,730
I'll have to get them done.

812
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,510
Yes.

813
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,680
 Spring Back Law Firm 

814
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,690
Yes, Mr. Myeong Hwan. I'll prepare accordingly by the next court date.

815
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,690
- Yes, this is Spring Back Law Firm.
 - Of course.

816
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,420
- Yes. You called us last time.
 - Don't worry too much.

817
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,560
Good thing we have so many pieces of evidence.

818
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,180
You'll be able to get a lot of alimony.

819
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,390
You consulted for the case with five mistresses, right?

820
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,590
- Yes, Attorney Han.
 - How did it go?

821
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:09,590
I organized and submitted the written letter for the five mistresses.

822
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:13,470
Fortunately, they didn't have a conflict of interest among themselves.

823
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:18,850
I apologize for the impertinent question I asked last time.

824
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,440
Not at all.

825
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,950
A new attorney can't help but have all kinds of thoughts.

826
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:35,390
Would you like me to give you a tip?

827
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,640
Yes, please tell me.

828
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,430
You need to start separating your personalities gradually.

829
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,500
Separating my personalities?

830
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,800
Yes.

831
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:53,650
Think separately as Attorney Lee Han Na and the human Lee Han Na.

832
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:58,750
Just leave the human Lee Han Na at home before coming to work.

833
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,850
 Try to separate your personalities. 

834
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:03,260
 Attorney Han Yu Ri and the human Han Yu Ri. 

835
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,890
 Attorney Han Yu Ri can't say what the human Han Yu Ri thought in her head. 

836
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,130
From what I saw, you wrote a great letter.

837
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,250
I'll take care of the defense.

838
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,830
Please watch me from the audience.

839
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,760
Yes, Attorney Han.

840
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,400
 Â­Schedule 

841
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,880
 All right, now. Please testify as to the allegations of the complaint. 

842
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,660
While using Defendant 1's laptop last month, the plaintiff found evidence

843
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:04,890
Defendant 1 had committed immoral acts with five people during their marriage.

844
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:08,270
I ask you'll take notice that there are five adulters, not one,

845
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,850
and present the maximum amount of alimony.

846
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:14,910
Defedant's representative, do you admit to the immoral acts?

847
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:20,850
Yes, Defendants 1, 2, and 5 plead guilty to the complaint and

848
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:26,180
Defendants 3, 4, and 6 claim they met after Defendant 1's marriage fell apart.

849
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,270
Your Honor, the defendant has pleaded guilty to the immoral acts.

850
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,450
Please submit it to the records.

851
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,190
That's not true. As I told you just now,

852
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:37,030
only Defendants 1, 2, and 5 agreed to the complaint.

853
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:42,140
Since Defendants 3, 4, and 6 met after Defendant 1's marriage fell apart,

854
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,760
we can say this is clearly a different matter.

855
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,760
Six defendants in one case?

856
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,860
The retainer must've been crazy on this one.

857
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,790
Yes, it's a historical amount.

858
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:19,580
And a crazy amount of work, too.

859
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,210
This case will last a while, right?

860
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:26,400
I think we'll meet every month for about a year.

861
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,700
Plaintiff's representative?

862
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,280
Any interest in a settlement?

863
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,360
None at all.

864
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,050
Then, Plaintiff's representative...

865
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:40,320
any interest in eating tteokbokki together?

866
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,150
I have.

867
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:48,370


868
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,290
 Who is your good partner? 

869
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,530
 Are you someone's good partner? 

870
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,250
 Thank you to all the good partners who watched "Good Partner." 

871
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:04,040
â™«  I ...just live on like that  â™«

872
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,860
â™«  Each day to me  â™«

873
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:11,760
â™«  could be a new day  â™«

874
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,690
â™«  I know that very well  â™«

875
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:19,760
â™«  Today I told myself again  â™«

876
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,080
â™«  even clumsy steps are not too late  â™«

877
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,930
â™«  That was a small consolation  â™«

878
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,790
â™«  Keep holding on  â™«

879
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,450
â™«  In the end there will be a bright day  â™«

880
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,420
â™«  Remember this moment   â™«

881
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,510
â™«  when your dream came   â™«

882
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,380
â™«  When you're tired  â™«

883
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:42,280
 Good Partner 

884
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:45,640
â™«  It isn't the end  â™«

885
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,240
â™«  It's going to be the start for you  â™«

886
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,170
â™«  Sometimes you can take a break and look back  â™«

887
01:04:54,170 --> 01:05:00,160
â™«  You can hide in that time for my sake  â™«

888
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:06,730
â™«  Feel free to pause, please take a break  â™«

889
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,850
â™«  Keep holding on,   â™«

890
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,680
â™«  In the end there will be a bright day   â™«

891
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,450
â™«  Remember this moment   â™«

892
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:39,020
â™«  When your dream came   â™«
