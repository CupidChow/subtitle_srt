00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,130
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:34,930


5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,050
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,480
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,510
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,030
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,320
 Plaintiff: Cha *** Gyeong / Defendant: Kim *** Sang 

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,050
 Court in session 

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,650
What are your intentions regarding custody?

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,280
Custody should be awarded to the plaintiff, the mother.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,080
Since this is a high-profile case,

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,260
we should settle the matter of custody

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,540
without a dispute over facts for a speedy process.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,530
Attorney, what are you talking about?

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,000
Custody matters the most for the defendant.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,530
The defendant invested more time and love in the child

19
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,660
than the plaintiff, Your Honor.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,220
Okay. Have a seat.

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,890
What's the plaintiff's opinion?

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,520
Plaintiff's attorney.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
Yes, Your Honor.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,130
 
  I just can't do it. 

25
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,270
What kind of thing is that to say as a mother?

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,760
I've been raising him all this time.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,520
You should be raising him from now on.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,980
I can never do it.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,230
Your Honor, I can't do it because it's too hard.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,020
I can't raise a child anymore!

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,600
The mother needs to raise the child, Your Honor.

32
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,470
The defendant left home several months ago.

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,330
The child is living happily with her mother.

34
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,850
An adolescent girl needs to be raised by her mother.

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,660
She's not a little kid. She must have her opinion.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,680
And the court investigator will decide if she's living happily,

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,400
not the plaintiff's attorney, right?

38
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,650
The defendant had an affair with someone I am acquainted with.

39
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,960
If the defendant gets custody,

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,490
his mistress and my daughter, Jae Hui...

41
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,800
The subject of the case...

42
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,020
That's enough.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,750
Since there's a disagreement regarding custody,

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,090
I'll start the custody investigation process.

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,200
Your Honor, custody should go to the plaintiff.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,960
The whole country is watching.

47
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,400
It should go to the defendant since he's been raising the child up to now.

48
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,510
That's the law!

49
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,230
 Episode 6  
 Mom!

50
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,490
Come here. Come here. You need to play with us.

51
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,390
Play with uncle. Here you go.

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,900
Are kids a delivery package? You leave him in front of a door?

53
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,610
Geez... Let's go.

54
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,820
Okay, okay.

55
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,150
You piece of trash!

56
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,160
Why did you want a child if you'd be so irresponsible?

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,560
Do you qualify as a mother, then?

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,660
What?

59
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,890
I pity the kids for having you as a mother.

60
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,290
You don't even act like a father! What are you talking about?

61
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,970
What did you ever do for Jeong Min?

62
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,490
- What did you do, then? What did you do? 
- What?

63
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,970
That's enough, okay?

64
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,260
Attorney Cha, I'm your fan!

65
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,570
Please help me.

66
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,020
- Mom!
 - Mom.

67
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,380
I'm sorry, well...

68
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,820
I am not an attorney but a plaintiff today. I can't think right now.

69
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,160
Right. Cheer up.

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,850
I'm totally on your side.

71
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,060
- Let's go home...
 - Accept her case right now.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,280
Let's go home...

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,240
Excuse me.

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,160
Come to our firm if you need to consult.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,270
Here's my business card.

76
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,030
Okay, I'll be in touch. Thank you.

77
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,880
- Yes.
   - Ms. Cha, are you with Jae Hui, by chance? 

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,320
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,340
Do you mean she's not at school?

80
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,910
 My goodness. I haven't seen her since the after-school study session. 

81
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,710
Did you take Jae Hui with you?

82
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,460
 What are you talking about? Didn't she go to school? 

83
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,750
Just answer my question.

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,930
Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong. Can't you even manage a child? Are you crazy?

85
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,310
 Did you try calling her friends' moms? 

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,820
You don't have any of their numbers, do you?

87
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,240
You think I called you to be told that right now?

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Send me everything you have.

89
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,200
 Ms. Cha, I can't find Jae Hui, and she won't answer my calls, either. 

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,500
- Do you know Kim Jae Hui from 6th grade, Class 2? 
 - I don't know. 

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,030
- Do you know Kim Jae Hui?
  - I don't know. 

92
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,080
Was Kim Jae Hui from the advanced class here?

93
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,340
I haven't seen her today.

94
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,420
Guys, have you seen Kim Jae Hui?

95
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,020
No.

96
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,450
Was Jae Hui here today?

97
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,230
No.

98
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,810
Guys, have you seen Kim Jae Hui?

99
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,140
We haven't.

100
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,120
Have you seen Jae Hui? Kim Jae Hui?

101
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,080
We haven't.

102
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
 (Choe Sa Ra) I'm with Jae Hui 

103
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,810
Choe Sa Ra!

104
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,810
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,760
Jae Hui, your mom is here.

106
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Jae Hui,

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,900
wait for me in the front for a moment.

108
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,910
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,060
You're pulling this after all you've done to me?

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,870
Do you think she's an object?

111
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,760
You think I'd just let you slide?

112
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,510
 Dad 

113
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,280
 I'm with Mom. 

114
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,530
 Let's talk later. 

115
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,550
Jae Hui

116
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,460
Could you explain to me what happened?

117
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,350
Auntie Sa Ra has been wanting to see me for a few days.

118
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,380
Why didn't you tell me, then?

119
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,190
Did she come to meet you in front of the school?

120
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,990
Yes. She wanted to talk briefly.

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,540
So, you followed Choe Sa Ra here?

122
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,560
You avoided me when I wanted to talk to you.

123
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,210
Dad's affair...

124
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,340
It was with Auntie Sa Ra, wasn't it?

125
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,490
Did you see it on the news?

126
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,960
I wanted to tell you directly, but...

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,170
By the way, I swear it's not Auntie Sa Ra.

128
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,910
Am I a kid?

129
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,400
I knew you'd deny it.

130
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,070
I'm saying that's not true.

131
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,670
Who will I end up living with?

132
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,150
Nothing is going to change.

133
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,530
You'll keep living in the house with me

134
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,470
and we'll see Dad on weekends.

135
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,590
Let's go.

136
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,210
Let's play outside. Play outside.

137
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,710
Let's go.

138
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,540
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

139
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,210
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,670
He left the boys in front of your door without a guardian?

141
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,250
 Yes, that's what I'm saying. 

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,450
 He has no right to be a father at all. 

143
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,820
 He just said... 

144
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,020
"I'm leaving the kids in front of your door. Open the door."

145
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,980
He just sent me this text.

146
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,850
He left them like a package.

147
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,610
Did you bring this up in court?

148
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,200
I couldn't say anything because I was too nervous without a lawyer.

149
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,890
Everyone said I needed evidence to bring stuff up.

150
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,920
That's why I finally decided to see you.

151
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,090
Why did he leave the kids at your door, anyway?

152
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,140
He's trying to become a YouTuber or whatever.

153
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,000
He always wants to drink with his friends, pretending it was a meeting.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,610
Drink? That's it?

155
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,030
Alcohol is his family and life. No...

156
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,890
It's his whole life to him.

157
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:58,300
But you want someone like that to have custody?

158
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,350
I think the children would be in danger.

159
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,210
Then, what did I do wrong?

160
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,330
Just because their father is like that,

161
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,630
do I have to be responsible for them forever?

162
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,960
He's the one who couldn't keep his family together. Why should I?

163
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,330
Will you just let your kids live with a father like that, then?

164
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,310
Please let me get out of this hell.

165
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,900
That's why I'm spending all my money to hire you.

166
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,850
Mom! Let's go home. Let's go.

167
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,530
- Let's go home. Let's go home.
 - Let's go. Let's go.

168
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,750
Let's go home.

169
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,500
- Hello, Attorney Cha.
 - Hello.

170
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,020
How was the consultation session?

171
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,920
I've seen many people fighting to keep their kids,

172
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,160
but I've never seen people fighting not to keep them.

173
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,670
There will be more people like that.

174
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,190
Inflation and housing prices continue to rise.

175
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,990
It's hard to raise kids in this world.

176
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,220
If they live with the father, it's so obvious they will be totally neglected.

177
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,560
I always tell you this, but set your opinion aside for now.

178
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,950
The client wants the father to raise them. So, we should find a way to make it happen.

179
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,630
First, test the water during the next trial.

180
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,070
All right.

181
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,600
By the way, where did you go earlier today?

182
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,990
Choe Sa Ra took Jae Hui with her. I went to pick her up.

183
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,000
What? What do you mean...

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,450
Did you report it to the police?

185
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,260
She didn't force her, according to Jae Hui.

186
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,100
She's friendly with Choe Sa Ra, too.

187
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,910
She tricked her, then.

188
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,020
That's considered a minor kidnap, too.

189
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,230
She knows enough about the law.

190
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,850
She even texted and said she was with Jae Hui.

191
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,870
Will you just let her be?

192
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,150
He did leave Jae Hui with me...

193
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,670
and he hasn't had a strong opinion about it all this time.

194
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,040
So, I thought he was demanding custody for formality,

195
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,100
but I think he's actually planning to take Jae Hui.

196
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,550
Choe Sa Ra wanted to split the assets and get it over with,

197
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,440
so I thought there wouldn't be a custody battle.

198
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,770
But according to the hearing this morning,

199
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,180
their main interest has been taking custody.

200
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,520
Don't worry about custody at all.

201
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,930
She's too old to be taken or hidden by force.

202
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,270
Kids usually want to live with their moms during custody investigations.

203
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,520
I was...

204
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,390
a mom who was often absent...

205
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,840
I mean, I was always absent.

206
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,750
So, I'm not confident...

207
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,770
that Jae Hui would choose me.

208
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,020
 Case 06: Parental Qualifications 

209
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,260
 We should collect the child quickly if she matters to you so much. 

210
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,010
 Find a place to live with her immediately. 

211
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,300
 You need to create an environment she likes before the investigation  
  

212
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,480
 so she says she'll live with you. 

213
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,720
How much did all this cost?

214
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,410
Attorney Cha is amazing, right?

215
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,800
I know. She's so cool.

216
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,220
She said we're suffering for no reason because of the tabloids.

217
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,100
She left her card and told us to get something tasty. What a model boss.

218
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,220
Totally cool.

219
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,160
Shouldn't you look pitiful if your husband cheats and leaves?

220
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,570
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

221
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,610
How come she gets cooler and cooler?

222
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,740
Right, Chief?

223
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,470
Oh, yes. She's cool.

224
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,160
How could you cheat on a woman like that?

225
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,910
She's not just successful. She looks amazing.

226
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,500
- Right?
 - She's totally my type.

227
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,900
Men don't cheat with someone prettier than their wives.

228
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,280
They just cheat because it's someone new.

229
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Gosh, seriously. Why is adultery no longer a crime?

230
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,610
I didn't think Kim Ji Sang was like that.

231
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,310
Don't you think the ones who appear gentle are the worst?

232
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,200
The tabloid says his mistress is a secretary at our firm.

233
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,510
The CEO should summon everyone and investigate them, right?

234
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,990
Don't you know that's against the law?

235
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,700
You all work at a law firm.

236
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,930
The promotion review is coming up soon. Let's be careful.

237
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,700
Since we're on the topic,

238
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,550
let's say you cheated with your boss' husband.

239
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,720
Would you quit your job or keep working?

240
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,940
Gosh, how could anyone do that?

241
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,990
What does having a relationship have to do with work?

242
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,670
I know.

243
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,740
But still, you need to keep work and life separate.

244
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,550
I have more work to do. I'll get going now.

245
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,990
You still have plenty of food left.

246
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,020
Why would you bring that up?

247
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
Her face got red. It must be true, right?

248
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,340
- Right?
 - No, can't be.

249
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,180
Come on, it's 100% sure.

250
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,800
Adultery is considered love, too, apparently.

251
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,100
So filthy! Shit...

252
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,720
Oh, come on. Take it easy.

253
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,560
 Performance Review 

254
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,370
 Name: Choe Sa Ra / Final Score: 100 out of 100 / Desired Position: Chief Manager 

255
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,550
How does it feel to sit there?

256
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,380
Well...

257
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,660
does it feel like you have it all now?

258
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,240
So...

259
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,610
what did you talk about with Jae Hui at the cafe?

260
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,210
You'd better be straight with me.

261
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,700
We didn't talk about much.

262
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,560
She asked me what my relationship was with her dad.

263
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,600
So I said we were friends.

264
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,690
I told her to take good care of you for the time being.

265
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,250
What bullshit is this?

266
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,140
- Who do you think you are?
 - I think of Jae Hui a lot, too.

267
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,870
And I think a mother should raise her daughter.

268
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,880
Oh, right!

269
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,250
That's where you two disagree, huh?

270
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,210
Looks like you and I are on the same page in this case.

271
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,600
What are you trying to say?

272
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,730
My co-workers verbally attacked me during lunch.

273
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,910
Please agree to settle.

274
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,230
He's Jae Hui's dad.

275
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,780
Why?

276
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,880
Are you scared to be exposed before the promotion review?

277
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
- Why should I do that?
 - If you split the assets quickly,

278
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,690
I'll persuade the director and make Jae Hui live with you.

279
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,210
I can do it.

280
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,900
You threatened me by saying "office husband" and whatnot. But that didn't work.

281
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,250
Now, you want to make a deal using Jae Hui?

282
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,690
You're messing with the wrong person.

283
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,200
To be honest, it wasn't entirely his fault.

284
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,930
- What?
 - You provided him a reason.

285
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,610
What more? Will you talk to me about keeping my husband now?

286
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,110
You're such a typical mistress, Choe Sa Ra.

287
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,550
Don't just get angry and think about what I said.

288
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,500
 Court in session 

289
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:24,620
Your Honor, both the plaintiff and defendant agreed to divorce

290
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,350
and they have no assets to split. Custody will be the only—

291
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,390
Your Honor.

292
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,270
The defendant isn't willing to divorce.

293
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,780
What's this?

294
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,720
Why are you flipping as soon as you got an attorney?

295
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,580
You agreed to divorce at the last hearing.

296
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,830
Sit. Sit down.

297
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,250
Because he was in a hearing without an attorney,

298
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,310
he said what he didn't mean.

299
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,780
The defendant isn't interested in divorce at all since he has two children.

300
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,250
Are you serious?

301
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,950
Plaintiff, please be quiet.

302
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,010
The complaint says the defendant can't sustain marriage due to alcoholism.

303
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,270
But there's no evidence.

304
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,410
If the defendant doesn't agree to divorce,

305
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,440
this isn't enough evidence to support a divorce case.

306
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,190
Attorney.

307
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,560
It's okay.

308
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,240
Your Honor, there's evidence for her reason for divorce.

309
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,440
I'll submit the evidence of the defendant's liability by the next hearing.

310
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,610
Why do you think he's suddenly refusing to divorce?

311
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,270
I think it's to avoid paying for child support.

312
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,330
He's currently unemployed, and all he does is drink.

313
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,700
That's not the only reason.

314
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,210
If the defendant disagrees to divorce, what would be our next step?

315
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,580
Providing the reason for divorce.

316
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,620
That's what the defense attorney is after.

317
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,340
He wants us to work hard to prove the reason for divorce.

318
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,930
If we submit the record of his alcoholism treatment,

319
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,530
the testimony from the neighbor lady,

320
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,150
we'd be proving that the defendant isn't a good father.

321
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,370
That's right. You were in disbelief during the meeting with the client.

322
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,190
 But you want someone like that to have custody? 

323
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,500
 Will you just let your kids live with a father like that? 

324
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,400
"You want someone like him to have the kids?"

325
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,390
He wants this sentiment to get through to the judge.

326
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,830
She'd be able to divorce him due to the reasons,

327
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,600
but she'd end up with custody.

328
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,580
That's what the defense attorney is after.

329
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,700
To make sure the plaintiff ends up with custody after divorce.

330
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,500
That's right.

331
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,300
Don't provide the evidence of his liability.

332
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,850
Pardon?

333
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:01,690
But she won't be able to divorce him due to lack of evidence.

334
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,470
Is getting divorced and taking custody the future she wants?

335
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,150
You must know that's not the case if you listen to her carefully.

336
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,520
 Please let me get out of this hell. 

337
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Hey, don't do that.

338
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,930
You can't touch that.

339
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,630
Come here.

340
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,740
Sit here.

341
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,980
Play the car game.

342
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm so sick of it.

343
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,010
Hey, let's do this.

344
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,010
It's been like this every day for five years.

345
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,220
I can't even sleep or eat.

346
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,620
I know it's difficult for you.

347
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,770
But would you feel comfortable after sending

348
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,250
the children to the father who isn't qualified?

349
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,630
How about you get divorced by providing reasons,

350
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,720
take child support,

351
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,190
and raise the children?

352
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,980
You can call me a bad mother.

353
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,060
I want to live like a human, even for a day.

354
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,010
Hey, seriously!

355
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,960
I told you to stop, didn't I?

356
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,670
I told you to stop!

357
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,820
Why won't you listen to me?

358
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,450
Why won't you listen...

359
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,170
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

360
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,510
Mom is so tired...

361
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,120
I think I'm about to die.

362
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,370
 Have you brushed her teeth before bed, even once? 

363
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,990
 Did you give up on the child after your one-year maternity leave? 

364
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,050
 Is everything my responsibility? 

365
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,860
 I can't even tell if you're a mom. 

366
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,580
 Can't you just do more? 

367
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,700
 Must we designate your job and my job all the time? 

368
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,570
 - I do everything.
 - What do you mean... 

369
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,800
 Hey, you... 

370
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,490
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

372
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,800
Can we really win if we do that?

373
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,440
We might end up with custody even after this.

374
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,960
If we follow the normal path, you'd end up with custody 99%.

375
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,540
Will you not even try?

376
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,070
You might end up achieving nothing except for

377
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,620
hurting your children.

378
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,570
Do you really think this is the best way?

379
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,530
I've been your fan for a long time, Attorney Cha.

380
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,200
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

381
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,020
You're a mom, after all.

382
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,570
 I'm home. 

383
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,970
 Let's sleep inside. 

384
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,300
 Jae Hui come here. 

385
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,450
 I can't keep doing this. 

386
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,980
 She cried herself to sleep again. 

387
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,520
 She barely sees you once a day. What kind of mom are you? 

388
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,330
 Why say it like that... 

389
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,980
 You've decided that this is the best for the children. Right? 

390
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,630
 I know... 

391
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,800
because I'm a mom, too.

392
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,020
- Jae Hui.  
- What will you do afterward?

393
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,290
- See you later.
 - Bye.

394
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,600
Bye, Jae Hui.

395
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,700
- Give it to me.
 - It's okay.

396
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,690
You were at the conference for a long time.

397
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,080
I suppose you went to Argentina.

398
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,180
You remember that it's the farthest country from Korea.

399
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,910
I told you when you were about nine.

400
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,070
You have such a good memory.

401
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,930
Yes, I have a really good memory.

402
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,750
Did you text Mom that you're seeing me?

403
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,910
No. The academy will text her that I didn't come soon.

404
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,530
I see.

405
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,290
Let's get in.

406
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,810
It's nothing serious. Jae Hui will be absent today.

407
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,550
Yes, you don't have to call her mom.

408
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,160
Yes.

409
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,750
Where are we going?

410
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,940
There's something I'd like to do with you.

411
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,970
It's messy, right?

412
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,070
Will you live here after the divorce?

413
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,600
I thought of dozens of excuses in case

414
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,100
you didn't know, but you beat me to it.

415
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,600
You want to live here? The two of us?

416
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,260
You're asking so directly again.

417
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,660
That's right. I'll work harder and get a nicer place soon.

418
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,470
It's a bit messy, but let's live here together, Jae Hui.

419
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,670
Or do you want to go on a trip with me while the place gets sorted out?

420
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,010
You're not interested in making up with Mom, right?

421
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,710
I'm sorry.

422
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,640
I don't think we'll win.

423
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,910
The custody investigation will reveal that the defendant has been a bad dad.

424
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,410
Will the judge panel let the dad have the children?

425
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,920
That's why we need to push ahead before the investigation ends.

426
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,270
Using what law?

427
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,140
This case can't be solved with law.

428
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,350
I have to use my experience.

429
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,020
I'll take the lead starting the next day in court. Just watch.

430
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:01,550
How could they both not want to have the adorable children they gave birth to?

431
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,610
I really can't understand it.

432
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,720
You don't know what it's like to raise children, right?

433
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,110
You're no longer yourself.

434
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,900
You start living as a parent only.

435
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,450
 You don't get private time at all. 

436
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,720
 All parents... 

437
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,080
 experience their own identities being erased. 

438
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,110
Kim Ho Seok finally experienced that for the first time.

439
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,420
Some people need to experience it to understand.

440
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,330
But still.

441
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,810
Using the children as a negotiation tool is...

442
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,550
Who's using them as a tool?

443
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:05,590
Why don't you think of it as an opportunity for the children to get to know their dad?

444
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,540
Got it.

445
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,010
By the way, Attorney Cha,

446
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:26,120
Jae Hui also needs to bond with you before the investigation.

447
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,110
You said you've been absent a lot.

448
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,020
If she says she wants to live with her dad—

449
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,480
Attorney Han, you...

450
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,210
you should call the plaintiff and ask about the defendant's parents.

451
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,530
Okay.

452
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,860
Attorney Han.

453
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,640
Yes.

454
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,310
I'll try harder with Jae Hui.

455
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,350
I will.

456
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,690
Of course, I should.

457
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,420
Okay.

458
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,370
 Custody matters the most for the defendant. 

459
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,820
 The defendant invested more time and love 

460
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:42,010
 in the child than the plaintiff, Your Honor. 

461
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,730
Seonbae, I talked to a reporter I know on the phone.

462
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,290
I think the office husband rumor came to an end.

463
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,900
It should. The more I think, the more unfair it was. Good work.

464
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,730
I didn't do much.

465
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,600
It was more of a headache for you.

466
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,230
- Should we go for a walk?
 - What if someone says something?

467
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,020
No one would say anything.

468
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,780
We've known each other for so long.

469
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,270
You must be upset about Jae Hui.

470
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,150
Don't worry so much.

471
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,520
I was confident with everything else, but the matter of custody

472
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,600
makes me think a lot.

473
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,670
It feels like I'm being judged as a mom.

474
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,950
Feeding, dressing her, and making money to educate her.

475
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,070
I might've thought that was all I needed to do.

476
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:56,680
But I wonder if that was the easiest justification for me.

477
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,810
No parent can do everything perfectly.

478
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,530
So don't ever blame yourself.

479
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,290
Based on a decade of my observation of you,

480
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:12,080
you prioritized work and put yourself at the bottom of the list.

481
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,900
And it was all for Jae Hui.

482
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,770
I thought so, too.

483
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,240
But why am I feeling less sure?

484
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,120
You proved to Jae Hui that you work hard

485
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,380
and you supported her well financially.

486
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,030
Not anyone can do that.

487
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,660
Parents deserve gratitude just for being there.

488
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,280
Thank you, Jeong Wu Jin.

489
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,760
By the way,

490
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,470
why haven't you married yet when you understand things so well?

491
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,630
I know.

492
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,560
Other people's lives seem clear, but not mine.

493
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,450
Don't fantasize about people too much.

494
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,190
Everyone is the same, after all.

495
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,210
Are you looking for anything specific, ma'am?

496
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm shopping for a bra for a girl who's entering middle school.

497
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,400
I see. I'll help you over here.

498
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,520
Oh, okay.

499
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,390
Jae Hui.

500
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,470
Do you want to see what I got?

501
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,650
Ta-da. This is apparently the best one.

502
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,220
I only wear wireless ones.

503
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,570
It's too uncomfortable. Return it.

504
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,720
Oh, the wire? This is uncomfortable, huh?

505
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,380
Can you remove it?

506
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,930
Auntie (the housekeeper) gets me the ones I like. Don't worry about it.

507
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,470
Since when did you buy me stuff like this?

508
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,470
Are you still angry about the camping day?

509
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,430
What about it?

510
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,880
That was taken care of because Auntie came.

511
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,970
Stop having so much attitude.

512
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,130
Just tell me what you're angry about.

513
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,480
I can't understand you otherwise.

514
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,790
Who asked you to understand?

515
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,380
You're busier these days.

516
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,650
Just do what you need to do,

517
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,310
as you always have.

518
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,930
Be honest with me.

519
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,620
By chance,

520
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,750
are you trying to tell me...

521
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,270
that you want to live with Dad?

522
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,670
You're the one who wants me to live with Dad.

523
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,440
Am I wrong?

524
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,830
Kim Jae Hui!

525
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,920
When did I ever tell you that?

526
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,540
Mom,

527
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,470
don't pretend to be a good mom now.

528
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,460
Give me some time to think, too.

529
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,540
I have the right to choose, too.

530
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,280
Hey, Kim Jae Hui!

531
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,510
Bye.

532
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,200
What did you mean, "Please make time for me"?

533
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,330
Like booking a consultation?

534
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:12,690
You're 13 years old. Just say, "Eonni, could you come meet me?" Do that!

535
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,730
Don't be so proud.

536
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,280
- Aren't you hungry?
 - I am.

537
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,670
Should we get tteokbokki?

538
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,700
Really? Your dad cheated, too?

539
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:30,260
Hey, you're embarrassing me if you speak so directly like that.

540
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,570
Why do you keep saying, "hey" to me?

541
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,090
What should I say instead, then?

542
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,070
Never mind.

543
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,510
How old were you when you found out your dad cheated?

544
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,380
When I was in high school.

545
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:53,730
I'm an adult now, but it still hurts just as much.

546
00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:00,480
So, you must be hurting a little more since you're younger.

547
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,250
Do you think I'm a kid, too?

548
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,530
You're very mature for your age.

549
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:13,380
But it's true that you're young.

550
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,010
People always told me

551
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,010
that I matured quickly because my mom is always busy.

552
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,750
But I didn't hate it.

553
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,720
There are many things I need to do alone.

554
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,020
I sometimes felt lonely, but I became good at many things.

555
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,480
How impressive.

556
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:40,670
When I was really young, they called me mature.

557
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,810
I'm actually all grown up now,

558
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,220
but they suddenly treat me like a kid. It's silly.

559
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,540
You didn't like the way they treated you.

560
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,890
Yes, you're right.

561
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,850
You're old enough now.

562
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:05,310
Don't think too much and do whatever you want to do.

563
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,910
Because you're Mom's attorney,

564
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,150
you must want me to say I'll live with her, right?

565
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,720
It's not like that.

566
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,730
Whether you live with Mom or Dad,

567
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,050
I want you to be happy.

568
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,880
That's all.

569
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:35,820
If I choose someone, the other person would get hurt, right?

570
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,370
No matter who's at fault, they're still my parents.

571
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,880
Don't think about stuff like that.

572
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,440
They will become okay as long as you are okay

573
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,010
because you're their everything.

574
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,060
Stop thinking too much.

575
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,100
Eat a lot.

576
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,450
Dad! When is she coming?

577
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,960
Dad, when is Mom coming?

578
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,780
Dad! When is Mom coming?

579
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,120
Dad! When is Mom coming?

580
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,080
Security.

581
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,310
- Please leave with the children.
 - Pardon?

582
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,710
I'm sorry.

583
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:42,680
- Dad!
 - Let's go out. Let's go out.

584
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,400
Your Honor, you saw that, right?

585
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,050
The kids want to see her, but she doesn't come to see them.

586
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,810
How could someone like that be a mom?

587
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:05,180
She sent the children to the father due to a sudden car accident.

588
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,510
 I'll do whatever you tell me to do. 

589
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,160
 Text the father... 

590
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,510
 that you can't pick up the children because of a car accident. 

591
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,050
 Ask him to pick them up at 2:40. 

592
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,410
 Damage the car by running into something in a parking lot. 

593
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,250
 You need to force him to care for the kids daily. 

594
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,620
That's also the reason she couldn't attend the trial today.

595
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:32,190
She still can't care for the children due to complications from the accident.

596
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,530
And it'd be difficult for her to raise them in her financial status.

597
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:41,630
She hasn't worked for almost ten years since she had children.

598
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,110
They fabricated the situation to avoid getting custody, Your Honor.

599
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,640
If you look at the Evidence No. 15 I submitted,

600
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,060
it says the plaintiff was diagnosed with depression.

601
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,790
I was diagnosed with alcoholism.

602
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,490
If you look at the Evidence No. 16, the criminal record,

603
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,080
the plaintiff was punished for theft 10 years ago.

604
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,340
I have several DUIs, too.

605
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,200
By the way, hold on.

606
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,270
Can kleptomaniacs not raise children?

607
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,010
Can you not raise children if you have DUIs?

608
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,150
No, an alcoholic can be plenty dangerous to the children

609
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,510
and that's enough reason—

610
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,650
That's enough.

611
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,420
What are you doing right now?

612
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,200
Is this the worst parent competition or something?

613
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,450
Have you no respect for the court?

614
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,170
My apologies.

615
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,890
By the way, Your Honor...

616
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,290
Yes, Attorney Cha.

617
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,870
The defendant's parents,

618
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:47,760
the parents of the case subject are former educators.

619
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,610
They even received awards when they were teaching.

620
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:54,780
They'd make excellent supporting guardians.

621
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:02,570
 Attorney Han, call the plaintiff and ask about the defendant's parents. 

622
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,400
 Wow, she's really all in. 

623
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,610
 How impressive. 

624
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,280
Do you think my parents won awards for raising grandchildren? Huh?

625
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,890
- Isn't she going too far?
 - That's enough.

626
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,560
I'll set the next hearing for mediation.

627
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,780
You should try to settle.

628
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,050
Sounds good.

629
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:30,280
I'd like the defendant to think positively about raising the children.

630
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,440
I should be saying that. Go tell the boys' mom.

631
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,890
Tell her to raise her own kids.

632
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,480
I suppose they aren't your kids.

633
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,180
How dare you talk to me like that? Seriously!

634
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,670
Settle down.

635
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,000
- Mom!
 - Mom!

636
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,270
Mom.

637
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,870
Mom!

638
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:06,070
- Mom!
 - Mom, you said it won't rain.

639
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,550
Mom, you came.

640
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,600
- Mom!
 - Dad!

641
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,030
Mom.

642
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,520
Bye.

643
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,710
- Dad!
 - You walked a long way.

644
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,990
 Jae Hui, I'm sorry I raised my voice yesterday. 

645
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,320
 I miss you, my daughter. 

646
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,120
 Don't you miss me at all? 

647
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,660
Why not just come pick me up...

648
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,610
 That we should try dating. 

649
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,850
 I'm sorry, Attorney Jeon. 

650
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:22,120
 I hope we won't talk about these things again after today. 

651
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,280
Friends.

652
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,180
Friends.

653
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,520
You said establishing yourself was important.

654
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,310
Were you talking about securing a convenience store table?

655
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,330
What? What do you mean...

656
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,880
 And establishing myself is more important to me. 

657
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,530
Don't laugh.

658
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,390
You said it's fun to hang out with me.

659
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,950
Why are you here all alone?

660
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,930
Well, I didn't want to call you because it's evening.

661
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,720
Excuse me, Attorney Han. We're still colleagues, okay?

662
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,330
So, it doesn't matter if it's day or night.

663
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:09,030
Feel free to call me anytime.

664
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,360
Cha Eun Gyeong and her husband are fighting over their child

665
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:23,420
and the client from today's trial is fighting not to take them.

666
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,220
The hearing was really something today.

667
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,050
They were getting worked up about not wanting the kids.

668
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,610
My head hurts from today's hearing.

669
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,780
You're a two-faced attorney right now, aren't you?

670
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,740
I've done that often, too.

671
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,690
Friends can say "I love you" to each other.

672
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,920
The defendants are nothing more than friends.

673
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,490
They definitely aren't having an intimate relationship.

674
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,320
Face off.

675
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:54,530
Even if they are friends, does it make sense that friends of the opposite sex exchange texts late at night?

676
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,610
I find it fun.

677
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,390
Face off.

678
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,810
Fun, did you say?

679
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,410
Yes.

680
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:13,450
Being a divorce attorney isn't for me.

681
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:19,140
I really can't decide what's right or wrong.

682
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,000
I should join the Corporate Team—

683
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,410
Gosh, I'm so sick of hearing "Corporate Team."

684
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,240
And there isn't right or wrong in relationships.

685
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,140
Only they know the truth, don't you think?

686
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,710
Do you really think so?

687
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,920
Kim Ji Sang, the man who cheated.

688
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,080
Kim Ho Seok, who treats his kids like packages.

689
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,960
Putting them in charge of their children's lives?

690
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,980
That's definitely wrong.

691
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,310
Don't you think that's right?

692
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,300
I wonder.

693
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,380
We might not know enough to judge.

694
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,470
I need some beer, too.

695
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,210
What? Who's that?

696
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,300
I'm leaving.

697
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,470
Why? All of a sudden?

698
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,240
What's the deal?

699
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,230
Is it a man?

700
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,860
Going out at this hour...

701
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,290
and drinking a beer in front of a grill.

702
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,710
Do you know when I did that last?

703
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,810
I'm not sure.

704
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,560
It's been five years.

705
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,550
Five years?

706
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,880
Can you believe that?

707
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,070
- How come?
 - What do you think?

708
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,910
It's because I've been raising kids.

709
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,430
I have no siblings, and my parents live far away.

710
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:14,310
I had no one to leave my kids with, even briefly.

711
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,720
I couldn't go to the hospital even when I had a fever.

712
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,560
You've been through so much. How about you try to cheer up

713
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,520
and take the children back?

714
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,440
I came here because I wanted to say that for the last time.

715
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,670
But Attorney,

716
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,580
will they turn out well just because I stay with them?

717
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,930
Do they need nothing but love?

718
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,620
The father doesn't make money. At least I should.

719
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,560
After I send them, I'll get treatment for depression

720
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,100
and get a job immediately.

721
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,390
I'll work hard to make money while the kids are away.

722
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,410
I want to raise my children well.

723
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,500
And...

724
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,140
I want to find out who I was.

725
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,480
I want to get myself back, too.

726
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:36,100
 - All the parents love their children the best they can  
- Let's go eat.

727
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,320
 in different situations and unique ways. 

728
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:46,400
 Realizing it that night, I couldn't dare speak more. 

729
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:53,480
 All I did was pour her another drink. 

730
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,500
 Seoul Family Court 

731
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,600
Defendant, do you still refuse to divorce the plaintiff?

732
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,590
Yes. Why should I do that for her?

733
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,230
Even if the divorce request doesn't get approved,

734
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,800
she isn't interested in getting back together with the defendant.

735
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,880
Thus, she will continue to live with her parents.

736
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,960
That means she won't take the children unless I divorce her.

737
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,420
- She's sticking it to me, huh?
 - Yes, that's correct.

738
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,620
What if I agree to divorce?

739
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,440
If you agree to divorce,

740
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,730
I recommend that Kim Ho Seok take custody and

741
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:48,930
the plaintiff stays with the children every weekend as a settlement.

742
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,230
So, your terms of settlement are that if he agrees to divorce,

743
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,960
the dad will take the kids on weekdays and the mom on weekends, correct?

744
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,430
Yes, she can pick them up on Friday evenings.

745
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:09,490
That means the defendant can drink all he wants starting Friday evenings.

746
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,090
Yes?

747
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,980
He'll accept it.

748
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,730
I guarantee it.

749
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:34,570
True. He might sign since he could get wasted on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

750
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,700
This watch hasn't been paid for in full yet. You won't ask for it back, right?

751
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,510
Take it and get lost.

752
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,710
Just be good to the kids.

753
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,260
How could you...

754
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:15,500
How about the massage chair we're still paying for?

755
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,370
- You like it a lot.
 - Yes, it's really nice.

756
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,130
It feels so good. It's my joy in life.

757
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,070
Take it.

758
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:51,640
The massage chair. Wasn't that so shameless?

759
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,150
It's because he didn't want to divorce. He was being clingy.

760
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,070
How does the massage chair mean he's being clingy?

761
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:02,490
He must've learned how difficult it is to raise children alone.

762
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:07,790
He's sorry about small things since he realized divorce spells loss for him.

763
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,050
Thanks to your strategy, Ms. Choe got him to divorce her

764
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:22,350
and the children will be loved by both parents.

765
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,090
I learned a lot from you.

766
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,250
I can't believe he agreed to settle because he wanted to drink.

767
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,030
He didn't settle because he wanted to drink.

768
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:40,350
He's starting to become a dad while caring for the kids.

769
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,830
And I gave him that chance.

770
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,350
Wow, what are they?

771
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:49,430
 Humans are foolish animals who don't know anything without experience. 

772
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,810
 Did you plan all that, too? 

773
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,600
Boys!

774
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,050
Mom!

775
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:57,650
Have you been well?

776
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,700
You got cuter. My babies got cuter.

777
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,660
Try to get off work on time on Fridays.

778
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,500
Why don't you leave them at my door again?

779
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,530
You think it's funny?

780
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,880
You look good.

781
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,310
Are you happy that you got divorced?

782
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,940
Of course I am.

783
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,000
Can't wait to go out to drink tonight, right?

784
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,870
Of course.

785
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,570
Ho Seok.

786
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,050
- Hey.
 - Hyeon Seo.

787
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,610
We got started again.

788
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,700
Oh, my baby.

789
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,210
- Please "Like" us.
 - Will you subscribe?

790
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,710
Good luck.

791
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,480
Dad is leaving.

792
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,010
 Some finally become parents after divorce. 

793
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,900
- You guys...
  - Some people take a long time to become parents. 

794
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:46,900
 There are so many immature and flawed parents in this world. 

795
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:51,850
Dad came to visit me.

796
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,870
- What's this?
 - What do you think?

797
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:07,070
Dad decorated my room.

798
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,000
Were you trying to keep it a secret from me?

799
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,050
I'll choose who I'll live with in the end.

800
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,830
I can choose because I'm all grown up now.

801
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,460
 Daejeong Law Firm 

802
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,640
- I don't know, either.
 - Appointed, not fired?

803
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,190
I think she kissed up to them.

804
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:32,510
- Hello.
 - Unbelievable.

805
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,280
It's 100%. A hundred percent.

806
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,040
Hello.

807
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,280
Did you check?

808
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,440

 Choe Sa Ra / Divorce Team / Chief Manager 

811
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,800
- Chief Manager Choe Sa Ra?
 - Yes?

812
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,250
 I'll become the chief manager someday if I work hard, right? 

813
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,520
Why the chief manager?

814
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,110
I mean, it's not like your salary would double or anything.

815
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,100
I want my own office.

816
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,920
An office?

817
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,910
I used to live in Haenam.

818
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,860
As a kid watching TV dramas,

819
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:31,780
I dreamed of becoming a career woman with her office in Gangnam.

820
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:38,320
I've always been envious of you for having your office with your name on it.

821
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,650
I'll achieve that someday, too, right?

822
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,850
 Chief Manager Choe Sa Ra 

823
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,010
 I became the chief manager. 

824
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:19,270
 I have my own office, too. 

825
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,640
You finally achieved your dream.

826
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,420
You don't have to go back in there.

827
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,080
Pardon?

828
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,890
Chief Manager Choe Sa Ra,

829
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,180
you're fired.

830
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:59,950


831
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,140
♫  Facing challenges, I persisted  ♫

832
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,040
♫  Learning to navigate heavy days  ♫

833
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,840
♫  But it's still hard  ♫

834
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,640
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫

835
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:23,360
♫  my reflection in the mirror will also blur  ♫

836
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,230
♫  Keep holding on  ♫

837
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,900
♫  In the end there will be a bright day  ♫

838
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,860
♫  Remember this moment you've dreamed of  ♫

839
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:35,100
♫   when your dream came true  ♫

840
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,930
 Good Partner 

841
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,120
 I was so happy to see you on TV. 

842
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,840
 Why did you come here, anyway? 

843
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,580
 How could you forget your old client? 

844
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,750
 Accept my dad's mistress case? 

845
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,720
 Who'd care if you resist divorce? 

846
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,000
 I'll make a suggestion. 

847
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,570
 Fire Han Yu Ri immediately. 

848
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,440
 I told you not to mess with my daughter. 

849
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,090
 But you know how she is, right? 

850
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:01,470
 It'd become a bloody battle. Would you be okay with that?
