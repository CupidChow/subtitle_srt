This is what I do for a living.

22

Wouldn't I have gathered evidence?

23
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,269
You said you wouldn't get divorced.

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,780
I gathered it to avoid a divorce.

25
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:51,509
Because as you know, the guilty can't sue for divorce.

26
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,750
I wanted to use the proof to stay married.

27

you decided to part ways.

189
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,050
What happened?

190
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,050
I never found proof,

191
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,720
but there was an affair of sorts.

192
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,489
You're wrong.

193
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,518
Are you delusional or something?

194
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,290
I wasn't going to say this,

195
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,888
but the Korean churchgoers say...

196
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,430
you walk with an arm linked with his.

197
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,430
I told you he's just a friend.

198
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:58,499
Do you have proof?

199
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,229
Shall I come over and find witnesses?

200
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:01,470
Let's break up.

201
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,210
- What? - I'm sick and tired of this.

202
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,570
I told you it's not what you think.

203
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,879
If you can't believe we, we must split.

204
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,810
Let's call it quits.

205
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,050
Do you mean that? You want a divorce?

206
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,019
I don't want to stay married to a man who doubts his wife.

207
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,248
The kids won't finish college for a few more years.

208
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,859
We'll sign the paperwork then,

209
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:22,820
but break up now.

210
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,489
Weren't you...

211
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,429
hoping I'd notice you were seeing other men?

212
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,300
And if I did have an affair,

213
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,029
that's on you.

214
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,200
For making me lonely.

215
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,710
She said that, but when your company got listed,

216
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,310
she changed her mind.

217
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,340
And pretended your marriage was fine and intact all this while.

218
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,580
The large sum would've given her ideas.

219
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:51,149
I don't have to give her half of what I own, do I?

220
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,858
The defendant will say you were married for 23 years...

221
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:59,029
and so she deserves to get half of the company.

222
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,959
We'll say the company was listed...

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,528
after the point in time when you agreed to part ways,

224
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,829
and so the shares...

225
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,229
should not be considered in the assets to be divided.

226
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,739
The result depends on proof.

227
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,009
Okay.

228
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,869
Was there any contact since then?

229
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,540
I did make a few trips.

230
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,309
To see the kids during their breaks.

231
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,508
I barely spoke to my wife.

232
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:23,419
Then there was COVID which put a stop to travel.

233
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,450
A trial depends solely on proof.

234
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,589
Your wife will provide immigration records and say,

235
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,930
"Look. He visited us in the US."

236
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,989
She'll use it to say you maintained an ordinary marriage.

237
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,070
A lawsuit is all about fitting facts to the evidence.

238
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,430
I wasn't there to see her.

239
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,669
What should I do?

240
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,940
It took a lot of work to set up my company.

241
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,310
If I give her half my shares, the whole thing will collapse.

242
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,978
My assets...

243
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:53,249
No, my company. Please save it.

244
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,190
What's the main argument?

245
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:03,489
The duration of marriage could be 18 years or 23 years,

246
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,089
and which it is decides...

247
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,988
whether the shares should be shared or not.

248
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:08,129
How do we prove which it is?

249
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,829
We'll get their phone records...

250
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,368
to confirm they didn't talk during those five years...

251
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,439
They could've talked often to discuss their kids.

252
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,439
Does that prove a broken marriage?

253
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,839
That's the case if they were in touch.

254
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,408
If there are zero records that they called each other,

255
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,079
can we use it as circumstantial evidence...

256
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,819
that they weren't in touch?

257
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,850
First,

258
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,819
we won't be able to obtain...

259
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,850
the call detail records from the phone company now.

260
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,490
Is that the only way you thought of to prove our argument?

261
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,530
Then...

262
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,999
Why do you think about...

263
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
asking Mr. Jang Hyun Sung's parent to be a witness?

264
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,229
Mr. Jang said he practically lived...

265
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,070
with his mother for the past five years.

266
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,139
Blood is thicker than water.

267
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,608
If we submit a statement from his mother as evidence,

268
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,310
do you think the judge will believe her?

269
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,079
Besides, how is living with his mother...

270
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,849
considered proof for the end of their marriage?

271
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,149
His wife is living abroad.

272
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,549
Off the top of my head,

273
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,889
I can't think of any other ways to prove their marriage ended.

274
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,290
Then I'll think about it a bit more.

275
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,429
Do you remember my special lecture at your school?

276
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,569
You must think outside the box...

277
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,040
while listening to the series of complaints from the client.

278
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,409
To have any chance of doing that, just let me go first.

279
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,438
You're not a student anymore. You're an attorney.

280
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,340
You can't be stuck at having the same, predictable ideas.

281
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,179
How will you handle my case if you can't do that?

282
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,320
See where your creativity takes you.

283
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,359
Understood?

284
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,989
Yes. I got it.

285
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,990
Okay.

286
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,039
It's not just a divorce lawsuit.

287
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,340
It's your case. Why do you want me to represent you?

288
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,879
I specialize in criminal cases.

289
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,918
My wife is Cha Eun Kyung.

290
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,149
Who's Cha Eun Kyung?

291
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,388
Is she famous for having gone through several divorces?

292
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:13,490
She's a divorce attorney.

293
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,589
It would be to our disadvantage...

294
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,519
if we were to hire an attorney who's acquainted with her.

295
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,729
That's why we're here.

296
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,760
This attorney from Daejeong... Is she that famous?

297
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,230
I've reviewed the written complaint.

298
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,699
(Evidence 5)

299
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,639
You guys had an affair right under her nose.

300
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,908
Their marital relationship had ended a long time ago.

301
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,570
They were no longer a married couple.

302
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,310
They were only married on paper. They were practically strangers.

303
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:38,879
By the time I started seeing him, their relationship...

304
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,080
had already ended.

305
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,649
If all she ever did was work, who took care of the child?

306
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,359
I raised our child all on my own.

307
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,760
She's closer to me than to her mother.

308
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,329
This isn't how a normal family functions.

309
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,699
She must've acted all bossy for having a well-paying job.

310
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,428
Seriously. This is the thing with women.

311
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,230
Whenever they start earning money, they act as if they own you.

312
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:04,740
But still. The evidence she has on you guys is pretty strong.

313
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,740
It's way too strong.

314
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
I never pegged you to be the bold type, though.

315
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:15,678
Since you guys lived together for 15 years,

316
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,419
you should divide your assets half and half...

317
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,719
and sign the paper. It will be simple then.

318
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,359
My top priority is gaining custody of my child.

319
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,888
Will it still be a simple process then?

320
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:28,230
You're a man. Why would you complicate it for custody?

321
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,699
Her mom should have custody.

322
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:35,669
Sir.

323
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,909
Could you help us settle this case?

324
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,250
Are you serious about wanting to raise Jae Hui?

325
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,590
Of course. She's my daughter.

326
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,060
(Plaintiff: Kim S. Hui, Defendant: Jang H. Sung)

327
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,829
Your Honor, the plaintiff and the defendant of this case...

328
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,429
aren't two spouses living in different countries.

329
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,070
Then what do you suggest?

330
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,070
They're two spouses who have been separated.

331
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,438
(Defendant, Plaintiff)

332
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,309
Yes. Go on.

333
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,339
(Defendant)

334
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,208
Some married couples agree to live in different countries...

335
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,579
due to different circumstances...

336
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,949
while maintaining their marital relationship.

337
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,718
But they are married couples...

338
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,148
who agree to live separately because their marriage has ended...

339
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,889
which makes them strangers, in fact.

340
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,659
So you're arguing that they had been separated financially. Correct?

341
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,059
Yes, Your Honor.

342
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,599
They stopped communicating with one another...

343
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,169
unless it was about their children.

344
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,669
Of course, they didn't have any sexual intercourse for years.

345
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,969
We were happy as a couple.

346
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,080
Everyone was so surprised how happy we were together...

347
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,509
even though we lived in different countries for so long.

348
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,550
Kim Se Hui!

349
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,019
Your Honor, she's lying!

350
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,519
She's doing this for money. She's putting on a show.

351
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,259
We lived as strangers since five years ago.

352
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,619
Sit down.

353
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,859
- Calm down. - What's he talking about?

354
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,129
Your Honor.

355
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,928
Three months ago, the defendant's company got listed.

356
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,330
The value of his shares went up tenfold.

357
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,368
The plaintiff is making a false statement,

358
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,999
so she can include his shares in the division of assets...

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,409
by extending the duration of their marriage.

360
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,340
That makes it clear what his intention is.

361
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,179
Your Honor.

362
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:31,320
He's the one lying for money, not me.

363
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:33,489
Now that he doesn't want to divide his assets,

364
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,859
he's arguing we were separated, we stopped making love, and so on.

365
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:37,928
He's lying.

366
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:40,229
You even cheated on me! Should I bring up everything?

367
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,398
Why do you keep putting on a show?

368
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:43,530
I should ask you to stop putting on a show.

369
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,969
How could you lie in court?

370
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:48,439
Do you have proof?

371
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:56,439
I don't see any need to respond to his accusation about the affair.

372
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:59,980
He has been sending such a large sum of money to my client...

373
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,480
which makes it hard to believe that they were separated.

374
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,148
You're right.

375
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,990
Looking the arrival and departure records,

376
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,219
you visited the US at least 2 or 3 times a year...

377
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,260
up until two years ago.

378
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,359
Yet, you argue you've practically been strangers for five years?

379
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,859
And you're separated?

380
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,369
You must prove that.

381
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,899
Yes. We'll prove it so by next the hearing.

382
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,469
Then we'll see you at the next hearing.

383
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:32,449
(Court of Korea)

384
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,820
Remember what the opposing counsel said in court earlier? Is it true?

385
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,449
Are you still sending her money?

386
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,990
Yes. Of course.

387
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,290
I send about 25,000 dollars a month for living expenses.

388
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,889
You send her that much money?

389
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,830
Stop sending her money.

390
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,999
Then how will she live?

391
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,699
She'll have to find ways on her own. She'll have to use her savings.

392
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,169
But isn't that irresponsible?

393
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,540
If she runs out of money, she might ask our children.

394
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,980
You said, "Of course" when we asked about the money.

395
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,309
Of course, you should send...

396
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,749
a generous sum of money to the wives of your children.

397
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,719
Of course, you should buy her an apartment in Manhattan.

398
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,448
Of course, you should send her...

399
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:13,948
tens of thousands of dollars even when you're broken up.

400
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,320
Do you really believe all this is your duty?

401
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,320
It's what I've been doing so far.

402
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,129
Fine.

403
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,599
Then isn't it also your duty...

404
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,359
to give her half of your shares for the company that got listed?

405
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,869
That's different.

406
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,628
My duty as the breadwinner...

407
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:28,668
has nothing to do...

408
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,000
with my company getting listed after our separation.

409
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,040
"Breadwinner." "Responsibility."

410
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,840
You chained yourself to these terms.

411
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,878
You let your wife take what you provide for her...

412
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,750
for granted for 20 years.

413
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,719
If you tell her now that you can't give half of your shares,

414
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,419
don't you think that would throw her off?

415
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,359
Well,

416
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,490
you have a point.

417
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,729
Fine. I probably wanted a sense of acknowledgment...

418
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,198
as a competent provider.

419
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,569
But what's so bad about it?

420
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,100
I never thought things would get out of hand like this.

421
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,770
You must now accept that she's not your family.

422
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,379
No. Accept that you are no longer...

423
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,060
the provider.

424
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,039
Ms. Park. Do we have another case that overlaps...

425
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,679
with Jang Hyun Sung's hearing in court?

426
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,350
It's okay if it's not my case.

427
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,689
I see. Then tell them I have to lead the trial in Daegu.

428
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,418
Request the panel of judges...

429
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,419
for Jang Hyun Sung's case to postpone the next hearing.

430
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,159
Why did you postpone the hearing?

431
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,159
His youngest child will be an adult soon.

432
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,699
Didn't you calculate when that would be?

433
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,439
In about three weeks.

434
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,469
That's why we postponed it after his child's birthday.

435
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,639
You should have checked the birthday and caught it on your own.

436
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,708
Is it because the judges are...

437
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,280
reluctant to recognize a statement from a minor?

438
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,909
Did you just figure that out?

439
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,349
His eldest child is in the US, so getting in touch will be hard.

440
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,520
So contact his youngest child.

441
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,919
Okay. I got it.

442
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,760
Ms. Cha.

443
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,158
Well,

444
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,329
like you said, I bought a car.

445
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,230
You don't have to give me a lift starting today.

446
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,530
Okay.

447
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,368
Yes, hello. I'm sorry.

448
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,379
You said the shuttle bus didn't run today.

449
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,649
Well, my next appointment is coming up soon.

450
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,449
Yes. Actually,

451
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,719
hold on.

452
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,959
Yes. I'll give you a call.

453
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,759
Ms. Han.

454
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,330
I'm so sorry. But could I ask you for a favor?

455
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,129
Don't tell me...

456
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,769
Jae Hui had a field trip today,

457
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,699
so I was supposed to pick her up myself. But I forgot.

458
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,740
Could you give her a ride to her academy just this once?

459
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,510
Me?

460
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,139
I have no one else to ask.

461
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,909
Well,

462
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,879
don't you think her father should do that?

463
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,350
Ms. Han.

464
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,590
You didn't forget that you're handling my case, right?

465
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,218
We're in the middle of a lawsuit. Should I call him to say...

466
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,520
I can't pick her up? Why give him any ammunition?

467
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,888
Could you postpone your next appointment?

468
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,599
I must attend the meeting with the VIP client.

469
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,830
You don't have any appointments this afternoon. Help me out.

470
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Gosh.

471
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,169
Just this once. I'll text you the address.

472
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,969
You can go home after that. Thank you.

473
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,609
Ms. Cha!

474
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,379
You came five minutes late, so my schedule got iffy.

475
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,040
I wanted to take a break.

476
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,879
What? The time... Where's...

477
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,050
Get a grip, and just focus on driving.

478
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,119
Besides, it's a bit odd to see that an attorney isn't punctual.

479
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,189
What? What did you say?

480
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,359
You don't even have a decent wristwatch.

481
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,730
Forget it. Please drive safely.

482
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:56,299
Buy one. Buy a watch as well.

483
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,069
Time is everything to an attorney.

484
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,469
You must constantly be checking the time.

485
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,608
Daejeong is 1 of Korea's top 3 law firms.

486
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,279
Our fee is at least triple the industry standard...

487
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,608
as are our salaries.

488
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,320
Due to that, our efficiency should also be tripled.

489
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,178
So to perform efficiently,

490
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,179
you will need your own car and comfortable shoes.

491
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,019
You're Little Cha Eun Kyung.

492
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,790
I'm Little Kim Ji Sang.

493
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,189
I'm nothing like my mom.

494
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,030
You're just like your mother.

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,570
Aunt Sa Ra used to pick me up when I had field trips.

496
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,969
Is she busy?

497
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:33,469
Yes. Aunt Sa Ra is very busy.

498
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,480
So what are my parents going to do?

499
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,579
What? What do you mean?

500
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Their divorce?

501
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,879
What divorce?

502
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:44,550
- Who told you that? - How could I not know that?

503
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,519
When dads suddenly go on a business trip abroad...

504
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,549
and don't come home...

505
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,290
or when moms go to Hawaii to live for a month,

506
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,629
those parents end up getting a divorce.

507
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,669
I don't know anything.

508
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:02,968
I think you should ask your mother yourself.

509
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,939
As if. You know everything.

510
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,239
I really don't.

511
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,709
Seeing how you came to pick me up, there's no way you know nothing.

512
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,080
You...

513
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,250
take after your mother a lot.

514
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,629
- Cheers. - Cheers.

515
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,399
All right. We're having beer with pork skin today.

516
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,678
Hold on. Here you go. Try that piece.

517
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,909
- It's really tasty. - Gosh.

518
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,750
So you picked her up at school? That's crazy.

519
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,219
You know what? I can pick her up ten times if I have to.

520
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,020
You know what?

521
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,760
You'll now be an attorney-encer.

522
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,629
- What's that? - You really don't get it?

523
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,859
It's a compound word of an attorney and influencer.

524
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,530
Ms. Cha is more of a superstar than an attorney.

525
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,699
But you're driving her daughter around now.

526
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,899
So you're bound to be famous just like Ms. Cha.

527
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:10,939
Is that so?

528
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,240
Gosh. It seems you've got a bright career ahead of you.

529
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,939
Don't you think I should have my chance first?

530
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,939
An attorney-encer, my foot.

531
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,310
I'm not her babysitter.

532
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:22,149
Should I report her...

533
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,350
- to the Ministry of Labor? - Hey, no.

534
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,550
If you don't want to do it, I'll do it.

535
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,448
I don't mind picking Ms. Cha's daughter up.

536
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:28,859
I can do it 10 or 20 times...

537
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,260
as long as I can be famous.

538
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,729
What's the point of gaining fame?

539
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,830
Isn't it obvious? I'll open up my own law office.

540
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,059
I'll get to start and finish work whenever I want.

541
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,330
To do that, I must be a free agent.

542
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,030
My seniors who opened their own law offices...

543
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:42,840
didn't seem "free" at all.

544
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,840
You're right.

545
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,169
Attorneys with their own offices seem to be busier. Right?

546
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,608
Should I just quit my job...

547
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,509
and marry a competent woman instead?

548
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,878
If you're interested in marriage, try harder with your blind dates.

549
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,549
Don't have one of those "quick" dates during lunch.

550
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,648
Hey.

551
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,119
You know what? I have a long list of blind dates coming up soon.

552
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,589
At this rate, I'm not sure...

553
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,060
if you'll keep having the pleasure of having lunch with me.

554
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,389
How many date requests are you getting?

555
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,398
Let me check, ma'am. Looking at the date requests so far,

556
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:10,560
I have about three dates a week.

557
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,969
Then you're practically a blind date machine.

558
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,939
Isn't that a waste of time?

559
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,070
You should just pick one already.

560
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:20,270
You see, I don't have that luxury.

561
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,509
Listen. People can be so weird.

562
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,178
When I told them I worked for a huge law firm in Korea,

563
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,979
they thought that I would only say the cool stuff and live in luxury...

564
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,149
like the attorneys in dramas.

565
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:29,379
But in reality, I'm just a pathetic office worker.

566
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,719
See? You're already miserable all on your own.

567
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,449
It would just get worse when you get married.

568
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,159
That's why I won't get married.

569
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,429
Humans are selfish beings who are incapable of sharing anything.

570
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:44,600
I do agree with that.

571
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,398
That's why we must meet someone whom we love...

572
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,599
beyond the innate nature of selfishness...

573
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,770
we have as humans.

574
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,570
If I were to meet a woman like that,

575
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,909
I'd want to marry her in a heartbeat.

576
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:03,879
Okay.

577
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,850
All right. So is there anything troubling you these days?

578
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,718
Order anything you want here...

579
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,119
other than the beef sirloin.

580
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,090
Have a lot of this.

581
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,198
The bus will arrive shortly.

582
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,469
Seriously.

583
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,540
I'm going to report her to the Ministry of Labor.

584
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:29,739
No matter how long I think about it, reporting her is the right thing.

585
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,509
What's the point of going on dates all the time?

586
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,408
I don't like any of them.

587
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:35,878
- I am... - Do they expect me to own a house?

588
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,579
- I rarely get to save up money. - an attorney.

589
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,790
- I'm not a babysitter. Seriously. - Gosh.

590
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,319
If I owned an apartment with the view of the Han River,

591
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,519
why would I work at the law firm?

592
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,789
I would've quit my job and opened up my own office a long time ago.

593
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,429
I would've accepted only the cases I wanted.

594
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,530
- You know what? Jae Hui... - Yes.

595
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,770
will be just like her mother when she grows up.

596
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,340
It was uncanny how much she took after her mother.

597
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,139
Gosh, that girl...

598
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,259
Oh, my head.

599
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,569
What...

600
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:39,008
(Motel Eunyu)

601
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,710
Motel...

602
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,179
Eunyu?

603
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,259
(Motel Eunyu)

604
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,799
(Plaintiff Evidence 7)

605
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:02,900
(Plaintiff Evidence 7)

606
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,850
What am I doing here?

607
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,299
Oh, no.

608
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,069
Okay.

609
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,810
Round Three is on me.

610
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,839
Let's go for PB.

611
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:45,779
What's that?

612
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,279
Pork hangover soup and beer.

613
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:49,920
Get up. Let's go.

614
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,920
- Watch out. - Oh, no.

615
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,690
Oh, no.

616
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,980
My goodness.

617
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,639
Ms. Han.

618
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,440
Hello.

619
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,310
Your outfit is the same as yesterday's.

620
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,349
I thought you went home after dropping Jae Hui.

621
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,679
- Hello. - Hello.

622
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,949
No.

623
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:31,350
I'm wearing different pants.

624
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:34,790
Oh, right. Did you hand in the evidence? Motel Eunyu?

625
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,389
What about Motel Eunyu?

626
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,028
The picture you said you'd hand in by Monday.

627
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:41,960
Did you submit it?

628
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
Oh, yes, I did.

629
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,029
Okay.

630
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Gosh.

631
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,509
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

632
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Well...

633
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,980
Wait.

634
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,589
Send me your account number.

635
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,889
Insurance number?

636
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,759
- What? - What?

637
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,489
No.

638
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,230
Send me your account number.

639
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:19,500
What for?

640
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,698
You paid for everything last night. I'll pay half.

641
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:26,008
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

642
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:28,269
Don't refuse. It's not fine for me.

643
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,810
- And... - Yes?

644
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,850
Let's go for lunch separately.

645
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,080
Sure. Okay.

646
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,049
I have a blind date anyway.

647
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,650
Oh, I see.

648
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,789
- A blind date? - I mean...

649
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,960
- Go on your way. - Coffee...

650
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,159
- Bye. - Yes, bye.

651
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,929
Gosh.

652
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,468
- A blind date? - Why did I...

653
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,399
- Seriously? - ask for his account number?

654
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,539
- Have I lost it? - What am I going to do?

655
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,310
Have I gone mad?

656
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,350
This is insane.

657
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,949
Where is Ms. Cha?

658
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,549
Where is Ms. Cha?

659
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,159
Ms. Cha!

660
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,698
"Attorney C who is increasing her price..."

661
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,440
"through various activities."

662
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,539
"Due to an affair between her husband and secretary,"

663
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,508
"the country's top three law firm D..."

664
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:36,040
"is in an uproar."

665
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,738
"What is a divorce attorney's divorce going to be like?"

666
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:39,779
Ms. Cha!

667
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,850
This tabloid.

668
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:44,279
Is this true?

669
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,819
It's partially true, sir.

670
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:52,259
- What's going on? - Is it true?

671
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,600
I'll handle it. Go back to your office.

672
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,770
Why would you? It's my business.

673
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,809
I ordered the divorce team to increase the profit,

674
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,580
and are you providing it from within?

675
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,179
Is that it, Ms. Cha? Answer me!

676
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:14,980
Mr. Oh.

677
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:18,380
Everyone is watching. Don't be like this.

678
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,449
This tabloid hasn't been confirmed if it's true.

679
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,790
Even if it is true, it's her personal life.

680
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,029
You should leave.

681
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,298
This could lead to defamation.

682
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:34,670
Defamation?

683
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,000
What about my firm's reputation? And my reputation!

684
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,569
I'll handle it. You should leave.

685
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:08,069
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

686
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,869
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

687
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,380
Seriously.

688
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:25,080
You're the biggest problem.

689
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,619
You should've checked first.

690
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,028
How can you humiliate the partner attorney...

691
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:35,028
in front of everyone over the tabloid?

692
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:37,799
How can I stay still when my firm is mentioned?

693
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,928
I will make sure it won't damage the firm's reputation.

694
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:41,969
You do not have to worry.

695
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,469
You acting like this...

696
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,940
will damage the firm's reputation even more.

697
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,330
My goodness.

698
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:15,299
Eun Kyung.

699
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,299
- How can you do that? - Do what?

700
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,909
You let me hear about your divorce through the tabloid...

701
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,810
when we saw each other every day for over a decade?

702
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,009
You should've told me at least.

703
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,778
I'll take this chance...

704
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,819
to make Law Firm Daejeong...

705
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,319
a byword for a divorce.

706
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:35,989
Then Mr. Oh won't complain.

707
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,088
What are you going to do?

708
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:39,889
I am the channel and media myself.

709
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,789
Through the channel Cha Eun Kyung,

710
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,699
I'm going to let the whole nation watch everything about a divorce.

711
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,770
We should think about the direction of your lawsuit.

712
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,839
An attorney?

713
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,969
Did you go straight to Jung Woo Jin?

714
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,080
- Jung Woo Jin. - Yes?

715
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,409
I'll take care of it.

716
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,589
Yes?

717
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:22,170
Gosh.

718
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,630
If you want it all, come and get it.

719
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,400
Although, it'll be brief.

720
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,089
I bet you read the tabloids.

721
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,888
Up until this moment,

722
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,420
I thought they were only meant for celebrities,

723
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,589
but I must've been wrong.

724
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,029
They were surprisingly accurate.

725
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:26,269
Am I to blame for everything?

726
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,100
Yes, you're the only one to blame.

727
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,509
Don't be gossiped about by the entire nation,

728
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,239
and quietly settle.

729
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:37,779
Me? Why should I do that?

730
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,118
I don't even want to see your face, so get yourself an attorney.

731
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,150
I already have.

732
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,119
He wanted to meet you right away,

733
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:49,319
but I came to you first...

734
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:51,259
out of courtesy since we were once family.

735
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,900
How about a piece of advice?

736
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,528
Being represented by the same attorney...

737
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,799
won't seem ideal in the eyes of a judge.

738
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,039
Having the same attorney...

739
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,009
makes you look like a set of cockroaches.

740
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,040
Don't you think you'll be hurt by this?

741
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,350
You're even threatening me now. That's not bad.

742
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,150
You've changed a lot, Ji Sang.

743
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,448
I'll go back to my life...

744
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,159
after a moment of shame in the spotlight.

745
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,219
But you're a public figure.

746
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,189
I'll reveal how selfish you were...

747
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,089
and what kind of mom you were.

748
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,400
Will you be okay with that?

749
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Bring it. Do your worst.

750
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,610
Are you going to continue with this lawsuit?

751
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,040
What about Jae Hui?

752
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:47,049
And you call yourself her mother?

753
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,679
Do you even have the right to be one?

754
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,350
You dare to say I'm not qualified?

755
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,519
You should've thought about Jae Hui first...

756
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,690
before things ended up this way.

757
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,900
Look here, Mr. Kim.

758
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:06,929
Listen to me loud and clear.

759
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:12,500
You are not to mention my daughter to my face ever again.

760
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,810
Also, I won't settle.

761
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,580
I wouldn't have sued you if that had been what I wanted.

762
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,779
Properly fight your battle with the right weapons. Got it?

763
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:31,659
I'll make you regret this.

764
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,310
Where's Attorney Cha Eun Kyung?

765
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,509
I have something to say to her.

766
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:52,948
- What could this be about? - Where's Attorney Cha?

767
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:54,750
She's not in her office at the moment.

768
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:58,250
Also, you can't come to see her without a prior appointment.

769
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,318
I came to see her in person because I can't seem to book one.

770
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,019
Ma'am, please calm down and book an appointment and...

771
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,389
Where the heck is she?

772
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,299
What is this about?

773
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,500
You changed the next court date.

774
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,670
Let's not drag this out and settle.

775
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,539
I'll concede and...

776
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,779
We won't settle.

777
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,839
Why should we settle?

778
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:28,379
I don't have to hear your offer to know...

779
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,218
that you'll only ask for 30 percent of the shares...

780
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:31,920
as if you're doing him a favor.

781
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:36,690
I don't need half of it.

782
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,060
That's me being generous.

783
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:40,960
I'm afraid we have very different ideas.

784
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,359
Our goal is...

785
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,400
not to give you 1 percent, let alone 30.

786
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:48,069
And he still thinks he has the right to call himself their father?

787
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,239
Being the breadwinner of the family doesn't make him one.

788
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,040
His children will receive their inheritance.

789
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:58,908
You say him earning money...

790
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,449
doesn't automatically make him their father,

791
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:04,218
but you're asking for more in the divorce.

792
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,150
I suggest you think about...

793
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,520
how contradicting that is.

794
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:13,360
I'll see you in court.

795
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,940
She came to the firm without her attorney?

796
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,239
She's not your average housewife, I give you that.

797
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,739
Let's give her what she wants and end this.

798
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,379
I'm exhausted...

799
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,449
by her doubting my role as their father.

800
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:37,979
You're willing to settle?

801
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,548
You want to pay her that large sum of money?

802
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:42,888
The mother knew you'd cave...

803
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:45,059
if she questioned your role as their father,

804
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,290
and you'll gladly give in to her demand.

805
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,330
Sure. We'll do just that.

806
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:55,868
- Sorry? - I love wrapping up...

807
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:56,900
my cases early.

808
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,069
Then, I'll call her to say that you'll settle.

809
00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:11,619
You're hesitant to give me an answer...

810
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:14,619
despite sounding so determined earlier.

811
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:18,060
What do you think I should do?

812
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,388
You're not paying for her living expenses anymore,

813
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:22,929
so block any texts or calls you might receive from her.

814
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,798
She'll be swamped with paying the living expenses...

815
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,000
including the utility bills.

816
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:29,469
It's now her turn to give you an answer.

817
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,369
She must struggle with money first...

818
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,270
to realize that what she took for granted...

819
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:37,409
was the result of one's hard work and concerns.

820
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,779
I want to teach her a lesson too,

821
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,079
but I don't want her to mooch off our children.

822
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,448
Would you rather be dragged along by a woman...

823
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:45,719
who makes threats with your children?

824
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:48,750
Are you going to continue with this lawsuit?

825
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:50,059
What about Jae Hui?

826
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,290
And you call yourself her mother?

827
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,989
Do you even have the right to be one?

828
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,330
Don't lose focus.

829
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:05,270
The suffering might be unbearable for now,

830
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,569
but don't give up.

831
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:09,139
You should stand strong, win the battle,

832
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,678
and protect your assets.

833
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,009
You're almost there.

834
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:18,679
It's our youngest's birthday tomorrow,

835
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,448
and I'm ashamed to let her see...

836
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:22,250
that her parents are fighting over money...

837
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,059
on her big day.

838
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,060
Her birthday.

839
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,659
Your youngest daughter's birthday is a big day for us as well.

840
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,860
It's only a day away, so be patient with us.

841
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,500
Why is her birthday important to you?

842
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,769
Your daughters are the witnesses of your marriage,

843
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,000
so just be patient.

844
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,069
We'll do our best to make you feel like you won.

845
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,929
Ms. Han?

846
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,630
Ms. Han, your driving...

847
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,699
Ms. Cha, Jae Hui...

848
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:12,368
is like a younger version of you.

849
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,409
Is she?

850
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,540
Yet, you drove her home with this level of driving.

851
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,480
That's the thanks I get?

852
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:25,020
I drove her home safely at a slow speed.

853
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,319
Kim Ji Sang asked for us to settle.

854
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:31,588
- What was his offer? - I didn't let him talk...

855
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,690
because it wasn't worth my time.

856
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,159
He'll call once again after hiring an attorney.

857
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,190
He will.

858
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:41,699
Goodness.

859
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,500
As if it isn't Attorney Cha Eun Kyung.

860
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,869
So here's where we meet.

861
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,179
Can I help you?

862
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,279
I'm representing Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra.

863
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,179
I see.

864
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,529
I hear you're a public figure.

865
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,230
Being gossiped about wouldn't benefit you at all.

866
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,830
Everyone knows everyone in this particular case,

867
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:16,029
so let's settle without taking this to court.

868
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,270
I have no intention of doing so.

869
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,480
I'm her attorney.

870
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,908
From now on, please contact me if you have anything to discuss.

871
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:31,719
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri, Law Firm Daejeong)

872
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,649
Goodness, Ms. Han.

873
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,190
You look like someone who just graduated high school.

874
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,989
Well, I have to be in court, so...

875
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,258
Also, you look like a headmaster...

876
00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:49,330
who is close to his retirement.

877
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,940
(Defendant)

878
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,839
We'd like to submit a written statement.

879
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,250
Sure. Pull it up on the screen.

880
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,949
"Hello,"

881
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,789
- "I'm..." - I'm...

882
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,859
- "the second daughter..." - the second daughter...

883
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,119
of the plaintiff and defendant, Jang A Reum.

884
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,428
Like you said, I contacted and met with...

885
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:16,190
Mr. Jang's second daughter who's currently in Korea.

886
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,929
Our parents...

887
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:20,130
did their best for us...

888
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,199
in their own unique ways.

889
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:25,298
In the year I was born,

890
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:27,539
my dad founded Areum Company that was named after me,

891
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,880
worked hard to grow it for 20 years,

892
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,610
and managed to have it listed on the stock market.

893
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,008
Our mom cared for us on foreign land...

894
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:35,909
so that we could receive our education.

895
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:38,618
Five years ago,

896
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:41,949
our parents said this to us in person.

897
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:45,119
They will continue to be our parents,

898
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:47,389
but not as a married couple.

899
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:50,100
They had agreed to live separate lives.

900
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:54,130
I was shocked to hear it...

901
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,199
at such a young age,

902
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:58,539
but this was common...

903
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,239
- among families in the US. - "Among families in the US."

904
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,509
"That is how I was able to accept it."

905
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:04,008
That's insane!

906
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:06,380
I doubt you'll rule based on the words of a teenager.

907
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,310
She's still a minor.

908
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,819
She wrote that statement...

909
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,319
after she had legally become an adult.

910
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:15,919
It's our youngest's birthday tomorrow.

911
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,919
Your youngest daughter's birthday is a big day for us as well.

912
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,229
Are you sure it was after her birthday?

913
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,689
Yes, she's legally an adult,

914
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,000
and I received a statement that favors our client.

915
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:28,170
Also, we submitted into evidence...

916
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:31,039
how the plaintiff changed the beneficiary...

917
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,409
of all her insurance claims to her mother five years ago.

918
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:36,369
When the defendant visited his family in the US,

919
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,479
he didn't stay at the plaintiff's Manhattan residence...

920
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,709
but at a hotel the entire time.

921
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,080
We also submit that into evidence.

922
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,420
Here's our last piece of evidence.

923
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:46,488
Please play the recording.

924
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:48,020
(Plaintiff)

925
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,360
I told you not to call me anymore.

926
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:51,888
Let's live our lives separately.

927
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,528
I called for the first time in three years.

928
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:54,888
But despite everything,

929
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:56,798
shouldn't we at least discuss our children's career paths?

930
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,299
I don't care if it was 3 years or 5. Don't call me again.

931
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:10,638
(In session)

932
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:11,738
(2024-527, Plaintiff Kim, Defendant Jang)

933
00:55:11,739 --> 00:55:13,080
I thank you both.

934
00:55:14,409 --> 00:55:16,079
She must've been ashamed to face the children...

935
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,520
because she gave up on the shares which allowed us to settle easily.

936
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,048
Your company went public...

937
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:22,250
after you and your wife were already separated.

938
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,359
Also, you've been providing her...

939
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,118
with enough money to spend on living expenses...

940
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:28,258
which made it hard...

941
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:31,029
to acknowledge her rights to the company's shares.

942
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,599
However, my guess is that the plaintiff...

943
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,839
wanted it to be over since she's practically broke.

944
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:39,399
Traveling to Korea for the trial and hiring an attorney...

945
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,810
all cost money, you see.

946
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,979
The children spent most of their time with their mom,

947
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,750
so I believed they'd take her side.

948
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,709
My youngest daughter is all grown up now.

949
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,250
She maintained an objective view.

950
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:53,219
She's no longer a minor.

951
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,150
So do not be fazed...

952
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,489
even if people try to threaten you...

953
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,730
by using your children against you.

954
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,330
Right.

955
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,100
You don't have any underage children among you...

956
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,670
which makes you as good as strangers.

957
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:14,369
I know the battle was tough.

958
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:16,270
The waiting was hard to bear,

959
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,080
and I almost gave up.

960
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,639
I appreciate you helping me stay strong.

961
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:32,420
This is an expensive meal.

962
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,488
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

963
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:38,099
There's no need to thank me...

964
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,699
since we're paying for this with what we earned.

965
00:56:56,409 --> 00:56:59,750
Jae Hui asked if you two...

966
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:01,449
were getting divorced.

967
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,060
And?

968
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:07,529
I feigned ignorance.

969
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,929
But I think it's time...

970
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,330
you told her.

971
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:19,940
I should soon.

972
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:23,279
Rumors about us are already circulating.

973
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:29,149
Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra's attorney...

974
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,948
keep contacting me suggesting that we settle.

975
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,850
Didn't this recent case teach you anything?

976
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,690
I don't intend to settle.

977
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:38,589
I won't give him anything.

978
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,289
If Ji Sang agrees to give up everything...

979
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,829
like Kim Se Hui did,

980
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,400
I'll reconsider the offer.

981
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:50,239
But the two instances aren't the same.

982
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:53,198
In Mr. Jang's case, he had already divided his assets...

983
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,069
by buying her the Manhattan house.

984
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,409
And for years, their marriage hadn't existed.

985
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,479
But in your case,

986
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,880
you were married for nearly 15 years.

987
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:08,189
You'll be forced to give him half of your assets.

988
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,250
No.

989
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,190
He won't get a penny.

990
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:17,659
Did you forget what you taught me?

991
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,900
I believe you're caught up in only getting your revenge.

992
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,138
Spouses who were cheated on all say the same thing.

993
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:28,408
They want the cheating spouse...

994
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:30,178
to end up with nothing.

995
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:31,610
That's the result of watching too much TV.

996
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,048
But if your spouse cheats on you,

997
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:37,349
even I'd want to get revenge in that form.

998
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,380
Revenge?

999
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,989
We're attorneys.

1000
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,589
Let them get revenge on their own time.

1001
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,618
In the eyes of the law,

1002
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:48,729
even the unfaithful spouse is entitled to their joint assets.

1003
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,960
Be clear with that.

1004
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,130
You're right. I'm getting my revenge.

1005
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,739
I'll have him get nothing in this divorce no matter what.

1006
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,589
Are you kidding me?

1007
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,190
Cha Eun Kyung, don't tell me you...

1008
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:40,509
Why do these things keep happening to me?

1009
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,179
Why?

1010
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,419
(The defendant's marriage to the plaintiff...)

1011
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,989
(was already wrecked due to Cha's extramarital affair...)

1012
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:54,060
(Her office husband...)

1013
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,589
Seriously?

1014
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:34,400
(Good Partner)

1015
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:35,569
How could nothing have happened...

1016
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,198
between two colleagues of the opposite sex...

1017
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,069
while working together for over a decade?

1018
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:40,810
What are you two doing?

1019
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:43,408
- You and Attorney Jung Woo Jin. - Han Yu Ri, you...

1020
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:45,940
You're saying there wasn't an affair.

1021
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,850
Of course it'll hurt Ms. Cha more since she's a public figure.

1022
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,080
Keep coming after me, and I'll fight to the end.

1023
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,650
I would like you to strongly consider a settlement.

1024
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,259
It seems as though I hired the wrong attorney.
