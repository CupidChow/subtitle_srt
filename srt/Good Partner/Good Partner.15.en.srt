11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,950
Has he ever been diagnosed with it?

12
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:53,258
No.

13
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,259
He has to admit it before we could do anything.

14
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,829
But he has no intention to do that.

15
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,640
Don't worry, and feel free to talk to me.

16
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,539
Well...

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,619
I think a male attorney would be better.

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,860
Because this is about fighting,

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,959
sometimes people prefer male attorneys.

20
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,458
But we fight with law and reasons, not power.

21
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,199
No, that's not what I meant.

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,940
It's more like dysfunction.

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,809
He can't even try...

24
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,839
to work it out.

25
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:51,948
You mean he's impotent?

26
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:52,949
Yes.

27
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,220
Thank you.

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
My wife...

29
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,520
wants to do it too often.

30
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,059
So I can't live with her anymore.

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,329
We've had a problem...

32
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,330
- due to that issue. - It's been a while.

33
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,799
It got worse and worse, and in the end,

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,729
- we crossed the line last weekend. - Let go.

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,370
Seriously.

36
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:14,969
I wasn't going to say this to keep your pride.

37
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,038
But don't you have a sense of shame?

38
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,840
What are you trying to say? Just say it.

39
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,809
Since when did you care about my pride?

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,810
Just say it.

41
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,548
You need to see a doctor.

42
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,680
That's not the body of a man in his 30s, but 80s...

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,548
No, even an 80-year-old man would do better than you.

44
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,589
You're the one who needs to see a doctor.

45
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,619
You.

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,889
You're a sex addict.

47
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,919
Are you saying I'm mental?

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,159
What the heck are you saying, impotent?

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,029
You seriously need to see an urologist.

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,960
You need to see a psychiatrist, you addict.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,729

Instead of filing a lawsuit,

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,000
why don't you settle it?

55
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,210
No,

56
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,969
I'm going to take him to court...

57
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,380
I'll tell the judge about my grudges.

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,579
I have so much to say. I can't end it like this.

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,479
He doesn't admit his fault.

60
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,079
It's not fair for me to divorce him like this.

61
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,919
File a complaint, please.

62
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,060
File it before today.

63
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,430
Because I'm dumping him first.

64
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:19,399
Make sure you file it first.

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,440
Or she'll think I still have feelings for her.

about my future as an attorney.

84

- I'm sorry. - No need to apologize.

85

Then...

86
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,239
why don't you take a few days off?

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,429
Must be so nice to be busy.

103
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,269
I'm jealous.

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,340
Come on. It's about time you're getting more cases.

106

I've thought about it.

107
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,279
There's a fatal reason...

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,390
a divorce attorney is struggling.

109
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,720
It's missing two most important business tactics.

110
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,489
Two? What are they?

111
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,890
Connections and regulars.

112
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,228
No one's like, "I got divorced here. She was really nice."

113
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,069
"You should try it."

114
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,499
And it's rare to get divorced multiple times.

115
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,669
You're right.

116
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,340
No connections and no regulars.

117
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,410
So it's not easy to get many cases.

118
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,179

- Here. - Thank you.

121
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,590
I'm willing to pay at any time.

122
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,890
By the way, has this happened to you before?

123

124
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,169
to file the petition within an hour all of a sudden.

125
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,769

126
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,929
Me too.

127
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,238
Fighting wasn't enough,

128
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,710
now they even battle about who files the complaint first.

129
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,579
I guess the clients prefer...

130
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,080
the term plaintiff over defendant.

131
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,379
I know.

132
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,949
They think it's unfair to be a defendant...

133
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,720
when they did nothing wrong.

134
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,859
A fight to be a plaintiff is intense.

135
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,160
It's so intense.

139
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,840
Ms. Cha, I'm the defendant?

140
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,178
Did you read the complaint?

141
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,779
The one with the issue should be the defendant.

142
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,809
It's not fair that I'm the defendant.

143
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:27,379
Does this mean he prepared this before I did?

144
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
He's dying to divorce me.

145
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,488
Whether it's a plaintiff or a defendant,

146
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:37,058
the term doesn't really affect the result.

147
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,289
You don't need to worry about it.

148
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,628
First, did you bring evidence...

149
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,229

150
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,270
Yes, luckily, I found a few.

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,600
Has Yu Ri gone mad?

184
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,399
See?

185
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,700
This is just absurd!

186
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,440
I never asked him to have sex with me every day.

187
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,709
He just wants to frame me as a sex addict,

188
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,040
so he can end our marriage. That's why he's lying.

189
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,009
Don't worry.

190
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,879
This kind of absurd accusation won't last long.

191
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,850
Here.

192
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,290
- Yes. - Where are you?

193
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,790
I'm on a sales run.

194
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,219
Will you be coming home late again?

195
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,388
Yes. It's the new product we launched.

196
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,590
I told you I was busy at work.

197
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:54,999
I have to go if that's all you wanted to ask me.

198
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,399
Hey!

199
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,729
Do you find my call a hassle now?

200
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,369
You know that we're married, right?

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,238
You've been coming home late these days, so...

202
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,509
I'm working right now.

203
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:06,969
I'm already tired as it is.

204
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,479
I don't want to fight about this.

205
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,550
Don't you think you're being unreasonable?

206
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,220
I should be saying that to you.

207
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,850
We did it yesterday.

208
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,290
Do you skip eating just because you ate yesterday?

209
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,659
- How are they the same thing? - I know they're not the same.

210
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,830
We have three meals a day.

211
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,329
Are you saying you want to do it three times?

212
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,859
This is an illness. You seriously need to stop!

213
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,369
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

214
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
- Yes? - Ms. Han.

215
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,419
The opposing counsel...

216
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,419
from Mr. Choi Jin Hyuk's case is on the line.

217
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,019
She wants to speak with his attorney.

218
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,690
Should I put her through?

219
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,759
Yes. Please put her through.

220
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,459
Hello.

221
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,869
This is Han Yu Ri speaking. I'm representing Mr. Choi Jin Hyuk.

222
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,340
Hello. I'm representing Lee Sung Hee.

223
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,999
My client has received a petition.

224
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:13,409
We actually filed the petition on the same day.

225
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
Is that so?

226
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,149
But it seems ours was filed before yours.

227
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,320
Yes. Well, we can combine the two cases and proceed together.

228
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,419
But more importantly, it's clear both of our clients want a divorce.

229
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,060
So before it goes to trial, I was wondering...

230
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,460
if there was any possibility of reaching a settlement.

231
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,300
My client doesn't want to settle.

232
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:41,638
There's something I must tell you. So I'll pay you a visit tomorrow.

233
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,070
Pardon? You'll come here?

234
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,869
Yes. Sure.

235
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,239
She sounds like a real attorney now.

236
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:50,850
What was that?

237
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,089
This is so good.

238
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,190
- It's good, right? - Yes.

239
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,590
I knew you would like this place.

240
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,330
I really wanted to bring you here.

241
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,330
How long has it been since we ate together?

242
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,028
I know, right?

243
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,670
I love having meals with you.

244
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,970
How many weeks has it been?

245
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,170
Well, this is bad news then.

246
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,779
We won't be able to grab meals together for the time being.

247
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,009
What?

248
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,279
Why all of a sudden?

249
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,519
I'm taking some days off. I'll go and visit my parents.

250
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,950
What?

251
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,690
Is...

252
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,859
everything okay with your family? I hope nothing bad has happened.

253
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,690
It's nothing like that. Eat up.

254
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,759
- You should eat up too. - Okay.

255
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,970
- This is so good. - Yes.

256
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,359
Mr. Jun. Enjoy your break.

257
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,460
You can find me in the swamp of case files.

258
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,629
Come back quickly and help me escape the swamp.

259
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,129
And we can go and have a nice meal again.

260
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,700
(Attorney Jun Eun Ho)

261
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,430
(Attorney Cha Eun Kyung)

262
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,830
- Yes, Ms. Cha. - Where are you?

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,439
I'm in my office.

264
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,199
I see. I'm pretty close from Daejeong.

265
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,570
Do you have some time to meet me outside?

266
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,839
I have a meeting coming up soon.

267
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,879
That meeting is with me.

268
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,278
Why didn't you tell me...

269
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,779
that you were representing Ms. Lee Sung Hee?

270
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,219
I get that you've grown a lot as an attorney.

271
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,090
But you were quite wild with your petition.

272
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:15,060
Ms. Han. Don't you think you've gone too far?

273
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,119
Pardon?

274
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,629
Well,

275
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,930
my client is a sex addict?

276
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,800
She's demanding intercourse every day.

277
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,868
If he doesn't comply with her demands,

278
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,999
she accuses him of having a sexual dysfunction.

279
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,340
Isn't that what a sex addict does? Or how else should I describe her?

280
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,508
You must be saying so...

281
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,179
because you haven't gotten the petition I filed.

282
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,608
The one who needs treatment isn't my client.

283
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,749
It's yours.

284
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,220
Are you making stuff up simply because they can't be proven?

285
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,519
Is that how I taught you?

286
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Ms. Cha.

287
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,489
I'm not making stuff up.

288
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,728
Mr. Choi sincerely claims that...

289
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:55,059
Ms. Lee's constant demands for intercourse...

290
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,229
is the cause for destroying their marriage.

291
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:58,499
And...

292
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,430
we can prove our claim.

293
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,340
You can?

294
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,478
I've been practicing law for 17 years.

295
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,449
But I've never seen anyone successfully prove their case...

296
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,479
by using sex addiction as a strategy.

297
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,850
How will you prove it?

298
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,190
I can't tell you that.

299
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm not your subordinate anymore. I'm your opposing counsel.

300
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:31,929
Anyway,

301
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,269
we didn't make any false accusations.

302
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,869
Ms. Lee might be lying to you.

303
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,779
What about you, Ms. Cha? Can you prove everything?

304
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,350
Yes. I can.

305
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,950
How will you prove that he has sexual dysfunction...

306
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,590
without a medical diagnosis?

307
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,590
He was never diagnosed.

308
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,129
He may not have sexual dysfunction.

309
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,800
But sexual refusal can be a factor in a divorce.

310
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:08,340
Fine. Let's say that it's difficult for both of us to prove our cases.

311
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,540
That's why I'm here.

312
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:12,440
To settle?

313
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:15,909
But my client doesn't want to.

314
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,778
Yes. My client doesn't want to settle either.

315
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,979
That's how they feel now.

316
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,649
But the court will set a date for mediation.

317
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,149
Then we can settle amicably...

318
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,420
for our clients who are still young.

319
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:34,430
I understand.

320
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,159
But...

321
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,268
it is too early to discuss settlements.

322
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,310
Hey, Han Yu Ri...

323
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,109
Ms. Han.

324
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,349
It will be a challenge to prove...

325
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,488
any matters related to sexual intercourse.

326
00:16:58,489 --> 00:16:59,618
I'm simply saying...

327
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,859
we shouldn't encourage our clients to get worked up.

328
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,690
Okay. I understand.

329
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,398
I will call you after talking to my client,

330
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,469
Ms. Cha.

331
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,320
Gosh.

332
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,619
- What's that look on your face? - Jung Woo Jin.

333
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,520
You need to rein in your associate.

334
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,590
What do you mean? Did you meet with Ms. Han?

335
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,060
Yes. She's my opposing counsel.

336
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,969
I think I did a good job with her, seeing how angry you look.

337
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:53,969
So that's it. You guys are on the same side now.

338
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,510
Don't rub it in the face of an attorney without an associate.

339
00:17:58,879 --> 00:17:59,879
Eun Kyung.

340
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:01,619
Do you want me to buy you tteokbokki?

341
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,350
Let's go.

342
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,850
- Gosh. That's funny. - Goodness.

343
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,859
(Railroad Diner)

344
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,330
So you really ordered everything?

345
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,770
Gosh, Eun Kyung. You changed a lot. Aren't you busy?

346
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,040
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

347
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,310
You don't have to stay with me. I'll take my time to finish it.

348
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:26,439
It's not that.

349
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,480
I meant that in a good way.

350
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:30,909
Hey.

351
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:34,520
Han Yu Ri is something else.

352
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,149
What did she say?

353
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,619
"What about you, Ms. Cha? Can you prove everything?"

354
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,119
"Can you?"

355
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,659
- Jung Woo Jin. - Yes.

356
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:49,330
You started dropping your honorifics again.

357
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,030
- I did? - See?

358
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,300
You did that when you asked me if I wanted tteokbokki.

359
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,310
You guys must think you can walk all over me now.

360
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,909
You guys do whatever you want when there are no ranks involved.

361
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,449
We're not walking all over you. We're just being friendly.

362
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,189
Seeing you enjoy a full meal with a lot of dishes...

363
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,359
makes me happy that I accepted your resignation.

364
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,189
The firm is super busy right now.

365
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Mark my words.

366
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,898
My firm may not be as big as a major law firm like you.

367
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:26,570
But I will grow it as big as it can.

368
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:32,310
Why don't you hire an associate...

369
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:33,740
if you want to save time to sign clients?

370
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,939
You should hire more employees.

371
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,250
You can't do everything on your own.

372
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,119
Well, I'm thinking about it.

373
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,119
I don't want to hire some random people.

374
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,149
You know I'm quite selective about the people I keep close to me.

375
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,719
I don't think so.

376
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:54,189
- What? - What?

377
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,769
My husband is cheating on me with a female employee.

378
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,499
Gosh, let me talk to her. My husband has been gambling.

379
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,968
And we're about to lose our house because of that.

380
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,408
Money isn't the problem.

381
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:07,780
- Hold on. Please. - Gambling...

382
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,709
Please calm down.

383
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:12,079
I noticed that my mediation meeting...

384
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,148
and hearing were scheduled on the same date at the same time.

385
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:15,948
I was told that reaching my client,

386
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,290
Mr. Oh Kyu Chan, has been a problem.

387
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,388
- I see. - Gosh.

388
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:21,459
I know you guys are busy. Please pay more attention to that.

389
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,010
Come in.

390
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,810
Ms. Han. Shouldn't you go home? Everyone left.

391
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,609
I was just about to.

392
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,080
- Should we head out together? - Yes.

393
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,129
(Octopus, Bean Sprout Hangover Soup, Webfoot Octopus, Blue Crab)

394
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,770
It's nice to see you take a break like this.

395
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,740
You had to prepare for trials even on weekends.

396
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,040
You were so busy with paperwork.

397
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,069
You never had the chance to visit us.

398
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,809
That's because your son is very successful.

399
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,310
Goodness. You always talked about having a good work-life balance.

400
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:20,909
Are you sure this is the right path for you?

401
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,320
Be honest. Work has been too much, hasn't it?

402
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,520
As for my work-life balance,

403
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,260
it's pretty good for a first-year attorney.

404
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,560
As for my work-love balance,

405
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,830
I'm not sure yet.

406
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,030
Eun Ho.

407
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,340
When things are tough,

408
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,439
you can be honest and say so.

409
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,740
If you don't speak up, no one will know.

410
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,909
Don't just act cool.

411
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:51,850
Okay, Dad.

412
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,250
I'm usually surrounded by bickering couples.

413
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,448
It's nice to come down here and see you and Mom,

414
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:00,520
happily married together.

415
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,730
Gosh.

416
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,869
(Mediation Room)

417
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,040
You don't have children.

418
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,740
You agreed to the division of assets as well.

419
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,340
Is it absolutely necessary for you to receive a ruling?

420
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:23,740
He's the reason we're childless.

421
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,749
For me to get pregnant, the act had to be...

422
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,350
feasible.

423
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,550
Why are you bringing that up here?

424
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,918
Should I talk about how you quit your job after getting married?

425
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,219
Why are you bringing that up here?

426
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,128
Are you telling me you don't find me...

427
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,859
attractive anymore because I don't make money?

428
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,560
I see. That was why...

429
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,469
you couldn't get it up.

430
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,969
Gosh. You're embarrassing me. Why would you say that?

431
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,340
Fine. Think whatever you want.

432
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,638
Other couples have no problem getting pregnant and raising kids.

433
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,908
Why is it so difficult for us?

434
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,878
You're blaming me for everything, aren't you?

435
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,908
Of course! How come you won't recognize your fault in this?

436
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:02,250
Is giving birth all there's to it?

437
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:03,419
What do you mean?

438
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,618
Besides, why is it my fault that you can't get pregnant?

439
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,050
Of course, it is!

440
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,119
(Defendant)

441
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,260
I wasn't going to bring this up.

442
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:13,290
Should I mention our visit to the OB-GYN clinic?

443
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,359
Hey, Choi Jin Hyuk.

444
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,500
If it doesn't pertain to this case, let's not bring it up.

445
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,869
We've called this meeting to reach a settlement.

446
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,969
Counsels. What do you think?

447
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,149
I understand your point.

448
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,449
But my client doesn't want to settle.

449
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,320
Does the defendant feel the same way?

450
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,859
Yes. She wants to see who is legally at fault.

451
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,290
I'd like to ask this to the defendant.

452
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,029
If you were to lose the case,

453
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,100
would you accept the judge's ruling?

454
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:53,929
No. I will appeal.

455
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,840
- What about you? - Same here. I'll appeal too.

456
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,369
She wants to do it every day.

457
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,840
Who can survive that?

458
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,638
It looks like neither will give in,

459
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:06,709
and both will appeal and go through appellate court.

460
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,250
You attorneys are the winners here.

461
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,550
Appellate court?

462
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:12,750
That's a thing?

463
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,159
Will you go with me all the way?

464
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:16,889
Yes.

465
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,159
I'll go all the way too.

466
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,000
I don't care how much it costs.

467
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,609
You failed to reach an agreement.

468
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,550
Let's go to court, Ms. Cha.

469
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,550
Okay. I'll see you in court,

470
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,379
Ms. Han.

471
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,659
Can we...

472
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,899
win?

473
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,100
I think we need a more in-depth consultation.

474
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,138
Your conversation with your husband...

475
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:06,040
made me realize we hadn't talked enough.

476
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,179
What do you mean?

477
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,080
What was that about the OB-GYN?

478
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,679
You both flew into a rage when pregnancy came up.

479
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,790
That dirtbag.

480
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:24,290
The coward said it was my fault we couldn't get pregnant.

481
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,429
It's polycystic ovarian syndrome.

482
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,129
Then...

483
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:34,968
can we never get pregnant?

484
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,040
You can get pregnant naturally,

485
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,168
but if you don't want to wait,

486
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,678
we can induce ovulation medically.

487
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,439
- Think about it. - Okay.

488
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,609
Okay.

489
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,250
- Darling. - Yes?

490
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,490
What do you want to do?

491
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,330
Well...

492
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,600
It's best to keep things natural.

493
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,469
You always say that.

494
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,269
Who cares if we have a baby or not?

495
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,540
That's not important. We're more important.

496
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,139
Are you saying you're okay being with me and without kids?

497
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,350
Yes.

498
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,050
I can look after you as if you're my daughter too.

499
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:23,619
You're as pretty as a child.

500
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,359
I couldn't get pregnant, and I didn't work.

501
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,659
He'd have found me less attractive.

502
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,859
I went from loving him to death to feeling lost and empty.

503
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,429
Now I wonder if this was the extent...

504
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,699
of what he meant by love.

505
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,810
Did you ever tell your husband this?

506
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:47,240
No.

507
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,679
I wouldn't dare. It would hurt my pride.

508
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,419
I don't think the point of your lawsuit...

509
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:58,719
is the refusal to copulate.

510
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,050
What?

511
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,189
Are you sure your husband wants a child too?

512
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,889
Could you be...

513
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:08,800
the only one who wants one?

514
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
No.

515
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,600
He told me it was okay just to console me...

516
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,100
when we were told it would be hard to get pregnant naturally.

517
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,840
He would've been disappointed.

518
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:23,409
He stopped showing interest in me right after that.

519
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,560
(Plaintiff Choi Jin Hyuk, Attorney Han Yu Ri)

520
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,740
(Attorney Han Yu Ri)

521
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,939
But it is too early to discuss settlements.

522
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,889
Ms. Cha, are you in?

523
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,090
Why are you here?

524
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,929
To say something.

525
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,000
Are you here as Yu Ri or Attorney Han?

526
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,969
I'm here as Mr. Choi's attorney.

527
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,469
Please take a seat, Ms. Han.

528
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,050
Thank you.

529
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:46,629
I don't think this case is about being addicted to...

530
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,359
or refusing copulation.

531
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,199
You felt that too?

532
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,500
You felt that too?

533
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,100
Did you not want children?

534
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,609
Why not?

535
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,139
Because of money.

536
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,409
We're a single-income household.

537
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,719
And my wife didn't seem to want a child urgently.

538
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,290
I found that a relief.

539
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,129
Did you ever tell your wife this?

540
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,859
I couldn't.

541
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:26,830
It hurt my pride way too much.

542
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,340
It's easy for everyone else.

543
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,740
Why is it so hard for me?

544
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,909
Is it even right for an attorney to get involved more deeply?

545
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,718
I came to ask you just that.

546
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,050
Why are you asking me?

547
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,589
I'm no longer your superior.

548
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,320
We can be more honest now.

549
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,730
I don't know either.

550
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,629
You don't know?

551
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,299
Should we keep proving and fighting?

552
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,369
For all three trials?

553
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,109
Is that what an attorney should do? Because the client wants it?

554
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:07,709
Or should we arrange a meeting?

555
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,378
We're attorneys, not couple counselors.

556
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,379
Exactly.

557
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,750
Wouldn't that be...

558
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,020
being too nosy?

559
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,119
You decide.

560
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,919
What?

561
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:39,810
I don't know.

562
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,350
- Ms. Han? - Yes?

563
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,090
Let's have tteokbokki.

564
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,719
Okay.

565
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,230
(Railroad Diner)

566
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:04,158
Let's not discuss work while we eat.

567
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,399
- It's such a headache. - Sounds good.

568
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:15,510
I feel like I'm a loner at Daejeong.

569
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:17,879
You left,

570
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,449
and Mr. Jun who took me out to eat is gone too.

571
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,719
It's best to be alone.

572
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,359
So are you happy that you're alone?

573
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:30,990
Yes, I am. It's great.

574
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,260
If you do so well when you're alone,

575
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:40,070
why on earth did you get married?

576
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,740
You want to know?

577
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,010
- Out of the blue? - Yes.

578
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:49,179
I'm really curious.

579
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,948
Everyone thought I'd marry a decent person at a decent time...

580
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,919
in my life as if it were an assignment to be done with.

581
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:03,389
It wasn't like that.

582
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,389
It wasn't?

583
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,499
You didn't marry suddenly as if...

584
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,830
you were finishing a legal report?

585
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,030
It was sudden.

586
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,070
I didn't feel the need to date for a long time.

587
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,270
Why not?

588
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,168
Because time was money?

589
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:21,540
Or time was your life?

590
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:23,939
No.

591
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,379
I liked him that much.

592
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:29,050
What? Did I hear you right?

593
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,520
I liked him so much...

594
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,719
that I missed him when we were apart.

595
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,800
I'd always been content to do things on my own,

596
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,469
but I couldn't stand being without him.

597
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:49,639
Even if I were to go back to that time,

598
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,600
I'd probably be the same.

599
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,810
I liked him so much that nothing could replace him.

600
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,679
Plus, he was the one...

601
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,280
who gave me Jae Hui.

602
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:17,629
Why don't you be more honest?

603
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
What about me?

604
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,639
Are you really okay?

605
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,840
- Yes. - Are you sure?

606
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,750
Yes.

607
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,980
Finish your meal, Ms. Cha.

608
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,369
(Attorney at law, Jun Eun Ho)

609
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,050
Mr. Jun, are you doing okay?

610
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,630
(Mr. Jun, are you doing...)

611
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,330
Let's just work.

612
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,739
- Mom. - Hey.

613
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,339
Your classes are over?

614
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,940
I came by to walk home with you.

615
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,049
Good girl. Let's go home.

616
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
Wait.

617
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,549
Jae Hui.

618
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,389
Can I ask a weird question?

619
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:49,819
What is it?

620
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,630
You didn't choose...

621
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,460
to be born into this world.

622
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,238
Mom and Dad discussed and agreed...

623
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,000
and brought you here.

624
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,610
I want to know how you feel about it.

625
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,810
Why would you ask me that?

626
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,850
Just because.

627
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,719
I like it that I was born.

628
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Why?

629
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,560
I can become someone the world needs.

630
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:28,600
That's nice.

631
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,969
You're just like me.

632
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,940
I told myself that so many times when I was a kid.

633
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,509
Then...

634
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,810
how does it feel to live alone with me?

635
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:47,080
I like it.

636
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,279
- Do you really? - Yes.

637
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,449
You're much more honest than you used to be.

638
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,520
You always pretended to be strong and cool around me.

639
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,889
I feel that we finally got closer.

640
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Do you?

641
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:06,770
Thanks.

642
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,699
Thank you, Jae Hui.

643
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Come in.

644
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,658
We might have overstepped boundaries...

645
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:32,230
as your attorneys by arranging this meeting.

646
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,730
I'd like you both to be honest, just for today at least.

647
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:41,000
It might be the last time you see each other face-to-face.

648
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,509
You mean...

649
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,110
you didn't want to have a baby?

650
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:56,819
No.

651
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,850
I'm not sure...

652
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,819
I make enough to support you and a baby.

653
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,589
To save up more before we got pregnant,

654
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,130
I delivered food and drove drunk people home after work.

655
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,729
I didn't know that. You should've told me.

656
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,170
How could I when I was the only one who was worried about money?

657
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,540
You quit your job fully knowing our financial situation.

658
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,239
I quit because the doctor said it would improve our chances.

659
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
You came back on your own.

660
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,049
I don't want my husband to worry.

661
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:31,650
What should I do...

662
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,389
in order to get pregnant?

663
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,619
If you can cut out overtime, drinking, and stress,

664
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,830
it could improve your chances.

665
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,230
That's why many couples get pregnant as soon as the wife quits working.

666
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:46,869
I see.

667
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,299
What?

668
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
That was why?

669
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,539
Because you thought I wanted a kid?

670
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,210
I thought we both desperately wanted to be parents.

671
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,209
But thinking that you no longer...

672
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,980
considered me attractive when you wanted a child...

673
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,049
I was sad and my pride took a hit and it drove me crazy!

674
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,630
It must've been a grueling session. Well done.

675
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,170
You just embarked on having an honest discussion.

676
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,710
Go home and talk about it some more.

677
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,409
Then tell us what direction you wish to move in.

678
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,449
We're your representatives.

679
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,020
We'll do as you ask.

680
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,549
Whether that's to settle or go to court.

681
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:44,119
Ms. Cha, would you like to stay to eat?

682
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,489
I have an important meeting with a VIP.

683
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,129
Treat me if you sign a VIP client.

684
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,500
Okay. Bye.

685
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,420
(Search: Starlight)

686
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,428
This is the second arbitration.

687
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:24,459
(Defendant)

688
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,670
Both parties wish for a divorce.

689
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,469
Can we finalize the case?

690
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,869
Yes.

691
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:35,609
My client wishes for a divorce because they can't agree on...

692
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,239
the matter regarding children.

693
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,679
I'm getting older each day.

694
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,879
I don't think I can dream of a future...

695
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,980
with someone who doesn't want children.

696
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,718
Through the proceedings, my client...

697
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,159
came to the realization that he does not want children.

698
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:57,159
He reached the conclusion that they should divorce.

699
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,600
But I'm grateful to both attorneys...

700
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,469
who arranged a meeting.

701
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,270
Now I clearly know why we're parting,

702
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,779
and I feel at ease.

703
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,279
Okay. Thank you for your input.

704
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,718
- Good job. - Well done.

705
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,750
- Great job. - Thank you.

706
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:28,589
Sung Hee.

707
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,699
Shall we eat before we part ways?

708
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Sure.

709
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,409
I thought they'd talk it out and reconcile.

710
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,920
They chose to divorce instead.

711
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:55,589
Compared to when they blamed each other without knowing why,

712
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,460
they'll both feel much better.

713
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,630
Why is it so hard for people to be honest?

714
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,100
The closer you are, the harder it is.

715
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,469
They seem to love each other a lot.

716
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,239
It's a shame they're splitting up.

717
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,170
What's up with you?

718
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,039
A divorce is the end of a marriage,

719
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,580
but it's not the end of a relationship.

720
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,149
Now they're free of a shackle called marriage,

721
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,520
financial responsibilities, and the burden of pregnancy,

722
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:28,319
this could be the start of a real relationship.

723
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,389
Do you see that?

724
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:39,730
Wasn't I right?

725
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,339
I learned yet another thing.

726
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,879
Each case has a unique characteristic.

727
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,350
Be sure to check those.

728
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,190
- Okay. - Got it.

729
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,089
Hello.

730
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,790
(Law Firm Daejeong Divorce Team, Case Briefing)

731
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,388
I'm sorry I'm late.

732
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,060
It's fine. You were in court.

733
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:09,529
Did it go well?

734
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:12,869
Yes. Choi Jin Hyuk's case is closed.

735
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
Nice.

736
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,500
The briefing's over.

737
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,069
I have an announcement to make.

738
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,079
It was important,

739
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,710
so I waited for you to join, Ms. Han.

740
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,080
Attorney Jun Eun Ho...

741
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,279
decided to leave the firm after today.

742
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,849
- What? - Just like that?

743
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,388
The decision was sudden,

744
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,989
so I apologize for springing this on you.

745
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,159
I'm sorry for not giving you a heads up.

746
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,699
- Seriously? - Is this for real?

747
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,729
We'll soon hire new blood,

748
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,130
so don't worry too much, Ms. Han.

749
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,139
I'll make sure you're not swamped with cases.

750
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,710
Sure.

751
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,080
Mr. Jun,

752
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:59,980
would you like to say goodbye?

753
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,850
I know I lacked a lot,

754
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,549
so thank you for having my back.

755
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,259
I'll keep moving forward to build a better future for myself.

756
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,658
Go, Daejeong. Go, Jun Eun Ho.

757
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,659
- Go, team. - That's right.

758
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:17,659
Go, Eun Ho.

759
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:19,429
You did some great work.

760
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,599
I can't believe you're leaving.

761
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,798
- We'll miss you. - I can't believe you, Mr. Jun.

762
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:25,699
- Don't be like that. - It's too bad.

763
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,639
Why the sudden decision? I hope nothing's wrong.

764
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:43,460
I appreciate how you allowed me to end my chapter on a good note.

765
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:47,758
I bet you thought...

766
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,359
there would only be sunny days...

767
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,960
after passing the bar and getting into a top firm.

768
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,529
But life wasn't that simple.

769
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:56,569
I'll soon turn 30, but I still feel clueless.

770
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:59,409
Thirty is when you begin your life.

771
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,710
You can do anything you put your mind to.

772
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,810
And Attorney Jun Eun Ho will do a great job.

773
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,679
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

774
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,488
Even though you quit, our bond will remain intact.

775
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:13,948
- I hope you know that. - Of course.

776
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,920
- Call me at any time. - Sure.

777
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,690
Thank you.

778
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:21,730

00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,069
How could you?

782
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,369
You could've at least confided in me.

783
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:34,839
Sorry about that.

784
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:38,279
You were swamped with cases,

785
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:40,250
so how could I dump my worries on you?

786
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,619
That's ridiculous.

787
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,520
I confided in you whenever I needed to talk,

788
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,319
and now I feel terrible.

789
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,190
This must've given you a headache.

790
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,330

Got it?

794
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:09,980
Are you leaving just like that?

795
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Later, when you finally have some free time on your hands,

796
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
we'll get together.

797
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,119
See you.

798
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:55,989

799
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:58,489
Nice.

Mr. Jun, thank you for coming aboard.

803
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,730
Nonsense.

804
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:11,739
I won't ever forget how you made the time to come to my house.

If it hadn't been for you, I'd still be grilling clams.

- Here it is. - Is this fresh?

807
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:22,919
Please enjoy.

808
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Thanks.

Please enjoy while you talk.

00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,138
Anyway, how are you here?

00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,179
You must be busy.

An attorney who's quick to close cases...

824
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,699
and is sociable as yourself shouldn't be taking a break.

825
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,170
You'll take the offer, right?

826
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,770
Would I be of help though?

827
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
Why me?

828
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:26,150

829
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,379
would be lining up since I'm "the" Cha Eun Kyung.

Isn't this a win-win situation?

When you're met with a sudden farewell,

854
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,600
- we will be your reliable partner. - Mr. Jun, what's this?

855
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,110
I bet you haven't texted people about your law firm.

856
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:02,369
Isn't it slightly embarrassing?

857
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:04,178
Don't be like that and text them.

858
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:05,709
Text everyone you know.

859
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,310
I, for one, already have.

860
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,819
They'll come to you when they get a divorce...

861
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:11,649
and will refer to you...

862
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,250
when their friends or family get a divorce as well.

00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,420

867
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:28,899

Ms. Cha,

878
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,960
a newly opened law firm seems to be my cup of tea.

879
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:57,259
Building everything from scratch without having to follow a manual...

880
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,770
brings the passion out of me.

881
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,798
You're both so good at your jobs.

882
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:05,839
Yet, you can't tell how you feel.

883
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,969
- Sorry? - What?

884
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,909
I'm talking about you and Ms. Han.

885
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,549
You're still not being honest with each other.

886
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:20,290
I see you knew as well.

887
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,549
I feel like...

888
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,290
one's honesty could come off as selfish.

889
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,230
The 20-somethings who spent their youth buried in books...

890
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,369
are dense when it comes to this field.

891
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:36,198
I thought you'd know better,

892
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,569
but you're pretty much the same.

893
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,739
I didn't think anyone knew how I felt, but I was wrong.

894
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,008
There are so many instances...

895
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,880
where only those on the outside can see what's happening.

896
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,250
I don't want you two...

897
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,850
to lose out on each other just because you didn't know better.

898
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,130
Mr. Jun, let's grab lunch.

899
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:11,600

900
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:22,449
Oh, dear.

901
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:29,350
Mr. Jung, I think the materials have been put together.

902
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,619
- Right. Shall we head down? - Sure.

903
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,060
Unbelievable.

904
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,799
You two sure are frustrating.

905
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,380
Mr. Jun, congratulations on joining Spring Again.

906
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:55,580
You're throwing me a welcome party too.

907
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,980
Thanks, Ms. Cha.

908
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,678
In a year from now,

909
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:00,219
there will be about ten people around this table.

910
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,888
Mr. Jung will join the party soon.

911
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:03,889
Mr. Jung too?

912
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,360
He's the one who referred you to me.

913
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:09,929
Can I make a referral?

914
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,529
- Who? - Jun Eun Ho.

915
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,230
Mr. Jun?

916
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:18,639
But he never works overtime.

917
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,239
That's because he doesn't have to.

918
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:25,179
I'll show you the cases that he has handled.

919
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:27,980
You'll see him differently.

920
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:31,279
Really?

921
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,350
You always get off work right when business hours end.

922
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,960
Before, I thought it was because you hated working overtime.

923
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,790
But then I got to read a list of the cases you handled.

924
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,360
Here you go.

925
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,400
(Person-in-charge: Jun Eun Ho, Method: Mediation)

926
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:52,339
I'm impressed, Eun Ho.

927
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:56,480
He's what Spring Again needs.

928
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:59,109
All of your cases ended with a mediation.

929
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,579
None took over a year.

930
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,710
My motto...

931
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,480
is "Divorce at rocket speed."

932
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:06,750
Everyone's happy if things are wrapped up quickly.

933
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:08,789
The clients are never exhausted,

934
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,189
and I don't have to work overtime.

935
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,520
- Divorce at rocket speed. - That's right.

936
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,029
I love it.

937
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,690
That must be Mr. Jung.

938
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:22,770
Ms. Han.

939
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,170
Mr. Jun?

940
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:30,940
Tell me about it. Ms. Han, come on.

941
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,609
We came here for dinner today...

942
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,880
but then heard some familiar voices.

943
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:41,949
I...

944
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,529
Mr. Jung, how about we eat elsewhere?

945
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:50,460
- Should we? - Yes.

946
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,029
- I had something to tell you. - Exactly.

947
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:54,529
What should we do, then?

948
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,539
Enjoy dinner together.

949
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,569
- Just the two of you. - But...

950
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,170
Sorry about this, but we have something to talk about.

951
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,980
What on earth is going on?

952
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,020
Why were you with Ms. Cha?

953
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,819
Ms. Cha offered me a job,

954
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,389
so I'm working at Spring Again.

955
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,560
What? Really?

956
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:25,259
Yes.

957
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:29,838
That was poor teamwork.

958
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,869
Teamwork? And you call that acting?

959
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,069
- Come on. - Unbelievable.

960
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,339
Working together for 14 years didn't help at all.

961
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,879
I usually hate to meddle in the personal life of others,

962
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,650
but that's what I've been doing lately.

963
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,779
I hate it too,

964
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:47,319
but it was frustrating to see them not talk it out.

965
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,488
It might not work out,

966
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,190
but it's better to speak your mind.

967
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,489
What should we have for dinner?

968
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,029
Again with that cheeky attitude.

969
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,299
Shabu-shabu.

970
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,369
What? No way.

971
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:06,770
Why? I know a good place.

972
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,339
You? Shabu-shabu?

973
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,210
That takes at least 40 minutes to eat. You know that, right?

974
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,880
Let me relax and enjoy my free time.

975
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,489
Jae Hui's having dinner with a friend,

976
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,389
so zip it and follow me.

977
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,659
But a relaxed person doesn't walk that fast.

978
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,659
Eun Kyung, wait up.

979
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,339
Well, I'm headed this way.

980
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,969
It was nice seeing you.

981
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:45,679
Right.

982
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,449
Same here.

983
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,619
Let's meet up for dinner sometimes.

984
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,790
Of course.

985
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,420
As if you needed to ask.

986
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,429
I'll get going, then.

987
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,799
Sure. Get home safely.

988
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,100
Right.

989
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,350
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

990
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,420
Want some ice cream?

991
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,750
Tiring, isn't it?

992
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,860
Don't let it get to you.

993
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:32,989
People like him are usually all talk.

994
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,360
You sounded like a senior lawyer just now.

995
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,000
You said it was important to get a seat at the table.

996
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,600
I didn't think it meant a seat at the convenience store.

997
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,170
Look here, Ms. Han.

998
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,540
We're still colleagues, you know.

999
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,270
I don't care if it's day or night.

1000
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,040
Call me if you need me.

1001
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,290
Ms. Han, are you all right? Were you hurt?

1002
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,860
I'm good.

1003
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:09,589
I don't want you to be in danger anymore.

1004
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,000
I think we should give this a try.

1005
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:19,239
Forget anything serious and the fact that we're colleagues.

1006
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,469
Han Yu Ri and Jun Eun Ho.

1007
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,380
Let's casually get to know each other better.

1008
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:30,520
Maybe you should be honest with yourself.

1009
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,980
Are you sure it's fine?

1010
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,429
Jun Eun Ho!

1011
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,839
I liked him so much that I missed him when we were apart.

1012
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,940
I'd always been content to do things on my own,

1013
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:57,880
but I couldn't stand being without him.

1014
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,330
I'll be the one to confess this time around.

1015
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,069
Let's give this a try.

1016
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,210
(Law Firm Spring Again)

1017
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:11,219
Ms. Cha.

1018
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:12,819
Mr. Oh?

1019
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,460
I want you to take my case.

1020
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,139
(Good Partner)

1021
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:10,339
Welcome to the Divorce Team.

1022
01:00:10,779 --> 01:00:13,080
We hired a new attorney,

1023
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,009
but I don't know how to guide her.

1024
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,549
There isn't a clear answer to that.

1025
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,350
- It's been a while. - Sure.

1026
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:22,319
In no way can you lose.

1027
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,860
You will put Daejeong in its place.

1028
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:28,129
I'll ask our best attorney to handle the case.

1029
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,258
- You! - It seems...

1030
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,658
like both parties have a lot to say.

1031
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:31,759
Let us help you.

1032
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,969
Rather than their attorneys, let's be their interpreters.
