00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,320
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,060
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:34,820


5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,070
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,640
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,420
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,140
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,610
 Who is it? 

10
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,470
 Who is it? 

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,850
Who are youâ€”

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,410
Attorney Cha, have you gone mad? Let go!

13
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,100
Let go of me!

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,400
Answer me clearly.

15
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,070
Are you pregnant?

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,210
Can't I be?

17
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,630
You two are pretty much divorced anyway.

18
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,570
Did you tell my Jae Hui about this?

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,390
Did Jae Hui say I told her?

20
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,910
Answer me!

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,960
Did you tell her?

22
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,890
Jae Hui found out by herself.

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,040
She said she saw the ultrasound picture at her dad's place.

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,070
 It seems she saw an ultrasound picture at her dad's place. 

25
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,780
Hey, how would you know that?

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,830
Did you meet my Jae Hui again?

27
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,090
Jae Hui contacted me first!

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,470
Honestly, Jae Hui also has the right to know.

29
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,670
That she has a younger sibling now.

30
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,940
- Crazy.
 - Let go of me.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,260
You shouldn't have messed with my daughter.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,520
- You shouldn't have messed with my daughter!
 - Let go of me!

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,160
- You want to die?
 - Let go!

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,670
- I'll kill you!
 -  Let go of me!

35
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,160
- Let go!
 - Get over here!

36
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,510
Let me go!

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,180
 She said she knew her dad had an affair with Auntie Sa Ra before her mom did. 

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,400
 Dad's affair... It was with Auntie Sa Ra, wasn't it? 

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,680
 Did you see it on the news? 

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,250
 By the way, I swear it's not Auntie Sa Ra. 

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,570
 I knew you'd deny it. 

42
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,180
 I'm saying that's not true. 

43
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,580
 Is lying easy when you become an adult? 

44
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,020
 Case 09: Half-hearted apology 

45
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,280
- Thank you.
 - You're all ready.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,770
All right. We'll start the shoot.

47
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,740
Okay...

48
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,550
 Episode 9  
  All right. Here's our next story.

49
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,590
"Hello. I've been pregnant for eight months now.

50
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,850
But it seems my husband is having an affair.

51
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,570
To expose him, I don't think I can handle it because I'm pregnant.

52
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,690
To look the other way, every day is hell for me."

53
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,630
That's what it reads.

54
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,710
Attorney Cha, are these instances common?

55
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,610
Yes, it's quite common.

56
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,900
Especially early or late in pregnancy,

57
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,980
the doctor usually recommends refraining from having intercourse.

58
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,770
So, people who lack self-discipline tend to commit adultery.

59
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,260
But their child will be soon born into this world.

60
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,020
How can it be possible?

61
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,030
It's also surprising that this is common.

62
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,180
Could you give advice to people who are going through this?

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,360
That this too shall pass.

64
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,910
Attorney Cha, people will see you.

65
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,110
Let's go to Yu Ri's place.

66
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,010
You did great. That was good.

67
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,500
I wasn't able to do that.

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,020
But you need to do that to relieve yourself.

69
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,300
What...

70
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,650
What do I do about my daughter?

71
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,670
Why?

72
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,310
Did she find out about everything?

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,880
She already knew everything.

74
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,430
Gosh, poor thing.

75
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,360
She's at a very sensitive age.

76
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,210
The fact she couldn't talk about such secrets even to her mom...

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,640
That's what I'm most sorry about.

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,890
I don't...

79
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,760
I don't think I deserve to be a mother.

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,610
That's nonsense! Don't say that.

81
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,760
The dad's the one who doesn't deserve to be a parent.

82
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,290
It's not the mom's fault.

83
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,340
You need to pull yourself together even more at times like this.

84
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,900
Don't waver.

85
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,370
I've got...

86
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,570
matters to tend to, so...

87
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,440
I see.

88
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,810
Thank you.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,170
- Attorney Cha. 
- Yes?

90
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,410
What's certain is that they all pass.

91
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,890
 I'd like to tell them to... 

92
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,810
do whatever it takes to protect

93
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,480
people they cherish.

94
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,460
 Yes. I believe the sender would've been... 

95
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,570
 That day, I didn't see Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong. 

96
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,260
 I saw my client, Jae Hui's mother, who's in an ongoing divorce suit. 

97
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,540
 I hoped the process of divorce wouldn't harm Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong. 

98
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,550
 I also sincerely rooted for... 

99
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,700
 Cha Eun Gyeong, the mom would become confident again. 

100
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,810
That's daebak!

101
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,540
Jae Hui?

102
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,970
I'm on the phone.

103
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,370
Sorry.

104
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,190
Gosh, that's so cheesy!

105
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,710
Really? That's daebak.

106
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,240
So, what did you do?

107
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,270
You can't do that! You need to tell me.

108
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,080
It looks delicious!

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,350
Of course!

110
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,280
All right. Take a bite. The pork belly and soju here are the best.

111
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,840
The court date for Choi Sa Ra's adulterer compensation for damages hearing is coming up.

112
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,680
What do you plan to do?

113
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,630
 Attorneys your age are dragged around by the law. 

114
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,890
 You become a real attorney if you use the law instead of getting pushed around by it. 

115
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,910
I'm thinking about what Attorney Cha really wants

116
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,690
and how I can use the law without getting pushed around by it.

117
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,570
Not because she's my superior at work.

118
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,430
Because I want to give my client what she needs as an attorney.

119
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,520
You'll have to eat up, get strong, and fight to do that, Han Yu Ri.

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,500
I mean, she's not just a client. She's Cha Eun Gyeong.

121
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,050
But if you get Attorney Cha what she needs most,

122
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,060
that'd make you the top-tier attorney. Okay?

123
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,800
Thanks.

124
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,130
I thought Kim Ji Sang was at least a good dad to Jae Hui,

125
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,150
despite how much of a scumbag he is.

126
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,980
That's what I thought watching Jae Hui.

127
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,780
But I don't think that's the case.

128
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,870
What are you saying? Never.

129
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,860
An affair and a half-sibling.

130
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,500
This is a complete shit show.

131
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,980
Beyond betraying his spouse, he even betrayed his child.

132
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,510
He shouldn't have gone that far.

133
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,240
Cheers.

134
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,860
- Cheers.
 - Fighting.

135
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,320
It's not my fault.

136
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,790
I said the guy hit on me first.

137
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,490
If one should pay the alimony, the one who made the first move should pay!

138
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,910
Who wouldn't fall for it if he hit on you like that?

139
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,350
You're an adult with free will.

140
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,830
It's not like this is a case of kidnapping a minor.

141
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,600
"The guy hit on me first, so I'm not guilty."

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,300
Is that the claim you want me to make?

143
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,250
Yes! That's right. That's exactly it.

144
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,330
Regardless of who made the first move,

145
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,650
it's adultery if you dated a man who has a wife.

146
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,520
Gosh, Attorney. How did you pass the bar exam?

147
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,770
- Sorry?
 - Why can't you understand what I'm saying?

148
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,650
I said he deceived me into sex under false promises of marriage.

149
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,690
I'm the victim here!

150
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,670
Sex under false promises of marriage was abolished as a crime.

151
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,400
What you've committed is an illegal act.

152
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,510
You have a duty to pay alimony, Jang Seon Ah.

153
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,170
Why is that a crime?

154
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,180
Adultery was de-criminalized, too!

155
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Don't you know that?

156
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,490
 She doesn't know having sex under false promises of marriage was abolished, 

157
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,540
 but she surely knows adultery was de-criminalized. 

158
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,880
 That selective knowledge. 

159
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,390
If you won't do as I say, why'd I pay for a lawyer?

160
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,640
Am I an object for you to buy?

161
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,370
I'm not for sale.

162
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,170
Whatever. I came to meet Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

163
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,850
Let me see Attorney Cha.

164
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,430
Gosh, she's so frustrating. Aigoo!

165
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,170
Are you the victim, Attorney Han?

166
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,140
Why are you all worked up again?

167
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,560
She won't admit her fault and keeps doing that throughout the suit.

168
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,020
I think it'll be too hard for you to represent her.

169
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,640
She can't even understand her obligation to pay damages.

170
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,320
This isn't the first time for us.

171
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,460
How many adulterers do you think are aware of their wrongdoings in this world?

172
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,900
You can still say that after dealing with Kim Hui Ra?

173
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,330
What about Choi Sa Ra?

174
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,800
Because you don't really need to take on this case.

175
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,520
You saw the fact-finding report, huh?

176
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,940
Yes.

177
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,260
You should just reject this oneâ€”

178
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,390
Start your own firm later if you want to be picky with cases.

179
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,000
This is the CEO's firm, not yours, right?

180
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,430
Will you really be okay, Attorney Cha?

181
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,630
I'm Cha Eun Gyeong.

182
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,990
I don't need your concern.

183
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,050
What do you feel is most unfair among the allegations in the complaint?

184
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,990
You can see it says I seduced him.

185
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,510
But it's not true.

186
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,490
He said he'll be divorcing soon.

187
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,040
You can be deceived if he sets out to lie.

188
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,900
Right, Attorney Cha?

189
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,410
The person who lied is the one at fault.

190
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,890
You were also deceived by your husband's lies.

191
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,730
But saying he'd get divorced soon and

192
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,360
saying he's not married are clearly different.

193
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,300
Because the former is established as adultery.

194
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,820
They're different.

195
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,940
If he said he'd divorce soon, it means he told you he was a married man.

196
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,470
So, it won't excuse you.

197
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,370
Are you on my side, attorneys?

198
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,140
Is it okay for attorneys to corner the victim like this?

199
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,600
You also deceived his wife, Jang Seon Ah.

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,100
Why do you think you're the only victim?

201
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,580
Let me tell you what happened.

202
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,820
First off, his wife provided the cause in the first place.

203
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,330
 To be honest, it wasn't entirely his fault. 

204
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,190
 You provided him a reason. 

205
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,640
How did you two meet?

206
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,380
When I went to get a new phone.

207
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,950
 Can you just do it for me, please? 

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,390
 To open a line for someone else, I need your family member's I.D. 

209
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,600
 and family relationship certificate. 

210
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,920
 I'm sorry. 

211
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,980
 Ms. Sa Ra? 

212
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,200
 Hello, I'm Kim Ji Sang. I heard a lot about you. 

213
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,260
 Hello, I'm sorry to inconvenience you at our first meeting. 

214
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,140
 Not at all. I should actually apologize for my wife for asking you to do this. 

215
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,450
 Here's the family relationship certificate. 

216
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,610
That man was so determined to seduce me.

217
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,850
 Oh, my. Director Kim! 

218
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,180
 Yes, Ms. Sa Ra. I figured Eun Gyeong was probably busy. 

219
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,980
 Y-Yes, Director Kim, go ahead. 

220
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,650
 What's wrong, Ms. Sa Ra? Are you sick? 

221
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,240
 Did my wife overwork you and make you get sick? 

222
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,850
 Stop by the hospital later. You must. 

223
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,370
 Okay. 

224
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,000
You can tell from my story, right? How unfair this is for me.

225
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,610
So, he acted like he sent you a text by mistake, meant for someone else,

226
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,440
 letting you know that he'll divorce soon, right? 

227
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,300
 Director Kim, should I get a divorce?  
 Yes! You can easily think

228
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,380
his marriage is over, and he's pretty much single.

229
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,340
 Director Kim, should I get a divorce? 

230
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,410
 Manager Choi Sa Ra 

231
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,780
 - Hello?
 -  Director Kim!  

232
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,190
Don't you agree?

233
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,290
Well, you must've gone to the motel that day since you were certain.

234
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,840
Yes. I didn't really fret since he said he'd divorce.

235
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,450
But he only took you to motels and never got a divorce, right?

236
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,660
He said they were discussing divorcing or that he might have to sue.

237
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,140
He was taking his sweet time!

238
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,350
From what I saw on social media, they were going on trips on the weekends.

239
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,950
Look here.

240
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,000
I guess he only needed you for sex.

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,830
Not at all!

242
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,470
That man really loved me a lot.

243
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,320
I'm sure he still does.

244
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,240
But he just can't get out because he's too scared of his wife.

245
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,280
That's what you think, huh?

246
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,250
So, are you upset that they aren't getting a divorce?

247
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,000
Of course, I'm upset!

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,470
I saw him because he said he'd divorce, and I loved him sincerely.

249
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,800
But he didn't divorce, which makes me the only victim!

250
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,750
That's your logic, huh?

251
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,350
You're the victim.

252
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,340
His wife is a complete maniac.

253
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,470
He couldn't possibly not cheat living with a woman like her.

254
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,240
I don't want to pay a penny, Attorney Cha.

255
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,580
I'm too upset to even pay damages!

256
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,990
You'll make it happen, right?

257
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,650
If you didn't want to pay a single penny for damages,

258
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,410
you shouldn't have done what you did.

259
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,460
You don't think your wrongdoing will go away just by hiring an attorney, right?

260
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,180
You're my attorney.

261
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,160
Isn't it wrong for you to say I'm the one at fault?

262
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,180
She's telling you...

263
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,380
it's legally impossible to pay nothing in damages, as a matter of fact.

264
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,760
I really don't have any money!

265
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,840
So, I won't pay even if the judgment orders me to.

266
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,960
I can't pay! Tell them to stick it to me. I've got nothing.

267
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,890
The time's up.

268
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,320
Let's wrap things up here.

269
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,020
Come in.

270
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,220
Attorney Jeong.

271
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,490
Yes. What's the matter, Attorney Han?

272
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,950
I think Attorney Cha is quite emotional right now.

273
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,960
She's a bit different from usual.

274
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,280
What can I do to calm down Attorney Cha as her representative?

275
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,570
I know just the answer to this.

276
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,400
Not because I've been an attorney longer than you.

277
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,590
Because I've known her for a long time.

278
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,260
What's the answer? Please tell me.

279
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,490
Tteokbokki.

280
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,340
Sorry? T-Tteokbokki?

281
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,380
You know this place, too, Attorney Han?

282
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,080
 Just listen to her while eating tteokbokki. 

283
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,710
 Even if she's a bit lost, she'll get right back on track 

284
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,960
 on her own as if she's never been lost. 

285
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,250
Did you get to talk with Jae Hui yesterday?

286
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,830
I guess she felt better after talking to someone.

287
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,380
She finally laughs and chats with her friends.

288
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,980
So, I couldn't bring that up again.

289
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,260
We need to reveal Choi Sa Ra's pregnancy in court.

290
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,340
There isn't enough objective evidence.

291
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
Should we request the court's permission to get

292
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,920
Choi Sa Ra's gynecology exam record based on Jae Hui's testimony?

293
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,300
Let's put it on hold for now.

294
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,070
How Jae Hui feels matters the most now.

295
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,250
How about you?

296
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,920
What would make you feel better?

297
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,190
Tell me how to win in a situation like this.

298
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,800
I'm your attorney, you know.

299
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm not so sure.

300
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,670
If you want to get a lot of alimony,

301
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,220
I'll try negotiating with the defendant.

302
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,650
If you want to let the media know and ruin their reputations,

303
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,400
I'll meet with a reporter immediately.

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,800
As you said, I won't do things my way but will adjust to do things my client's way.

305
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,830
Thank you, Han Yu Ri.

306
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,500
I'll always think of the best solution for you.

307
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,240
It's to create a balance, as you said.

308
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,720
Let's eat.

309
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,250
Okay.

310
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,510
Hey, Choi Sa Ra!

311
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,430
Don't yell. Our baby is listening.

312
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,780
Did you think talking to Jae Hui would make her want to live with her mom?

313
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,400
Weren't you better than this?

314
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,940
You're right. I talked to her.

315
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,570
Because I'm also a mom who needs to protect my baby.

316
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,740
So, you thought you could've started a new family with just me?

317
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,520
Of course, we have to. You're the father.

318
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,100
Choi Sa Ra, I'm sorry, but things won't go the way you planned.

319
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,810
What will you do, then?

320
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,220
Will you give up on being a dad for both?

321
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,820
I don't think Jae Hui would want to live with you anymore.

322
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,610
Get lost.

323
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,170
What did you just say?

324
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,870
Don't ever show up in front of me from now on.

325
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,740
I told you! Our baby is listening!

326
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,080
Is there evidence it's mine?

327
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,640
Don't ever contact me again.

328
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,210
Isn't she Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong?

329
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,310
Jae Hui.

330
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
This is my mom.

331
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,880
I told you she's a lawyer.

332
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,440
- Hello.
 - Hello.

333
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,940
I'm Min Seo, Jae Hui's friend.

334
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,810
She told me a lot about you.

335
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,890
She said you're famous, and you're on TV.

336
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,820
I see.

337
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,480
- Let's go, guys.
  - Take care. 

338
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,410
- Bye, Jae Hui.
 - I'll see you guys.

339
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,610
Mom!

340
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,100
Jae Hui, give it to me.

341
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,950
What are you doing?

342
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,120
I'll come whenever I can from now on.

343
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:47,210
Other moms give their kids snacks before they go to the next academy.

344
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,140
I'm all grown up now, but I wanted to try it.

345
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,220
It doesn't have to be often. Only once in a while.

346
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,600
I'll be a middle schooler soon.

347
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,650
You won't have to come as much anymore.

348
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,860
I heard you know everything.

349
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,790
This is how the adults are.

350
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,300
It was supposed to be a secret.

351
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,240
It must've been difficult for you.

352
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,180
I'm sorry. I won't see Auntie Sa Ra anymore.

353
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,630
Don't worry, and tell me everything from now on, okay?

354
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,300
By the way, if she has a baby,

355
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,420
will it legally be my younger sibling?

356
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,520
Ms. Choi Sa Ra? This is from the court.

357
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,500
 Court of the Republic of Korea, Electronic Litigation 

358
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,530
 Witness Subpoena 

359
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,240
Attorney, here's a letter from Ms. Jang Seon Ah's opposing party.

360
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,990
Oh, thank you.

361
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,920
 Written Testimony 

362
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,440
 I was sure my husband was cheating, 

363
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,660
 but I was afraid to open Pandora's box because I was pregnant. 

364
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,090
 "Only focus on the baby. 

365
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,750
 - It can't be true."
 - "It can't be true." 

366
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,110
 I said that to myself and tried to avoid the truth. 

367
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,290
Hey, you're back.

368
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,640
Gosh, you must be tired.

369
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,210
- You haven't eaten, right?
- No.

370
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,400
Just one moment.

371
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,650
The water glass. Where is it?

372
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,040
- Aren't you going to answer?
 - What?

373
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,260
Who is it?

374
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,190
It's an annoying customer.

375
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,390
They always have to call at night.

376
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,310
 I sensed that she was getting more involved in my husband's everyday life. 

377
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,880
 Did you get home safely? 

378
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,120
 Yes. That place we went to was so nice. 

379
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,240
 This is our first day as a couple, right? 

380
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,800
The doctor wants to increase the insulin dose because my number is high.

381
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,160
Really?

382
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,800
Yeah.

383
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm so tired today.

384
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,970
Aren't you always tired?

385
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,450
We haven't done it in over two weeks now.

386
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,270
I have gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.

387
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,950
How can you say that looking at my belly?

388
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,220
No one's as nice as me to their pregnant wives.

389
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,040
Who said that?

390
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,280
Never mind. Pregnancy doesn't make you powerful.

391
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:02,120
 Unlike what he said, I became powerless with pregnancy. 

392
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,830
 But to focus on going through healthy labor, 

393
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,280
 I decided to find evidence or get a divorce after giving birth. 

394
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,370
 Then, this happened one day when I was almost due. 

395
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,860
Honey, they say you can't do it during post-natal care.

396
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,100
We can do it today, right?

397
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,680
Can't you wait until I give birth?

398
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,020
We came all the way here.

399
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,350
Hold on. Please move your hands from my belly.

400
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,490
Sorry. Let me take this call.

401
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,840
Hello?

402
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,800
Yes, this is she.

403
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,310
Pardon? Who are you again?

404
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,980
Hey, who are you?

405
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,140
What? What?

406
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,870
Your...

407
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,260
Your girlfriend is apparently in the hotel lobby...

408
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,710
So Eun! S-So Eun, are you okay?

409
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,190
- My gosh... 
- So Eun.

410
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,800
 He begged for forgiveness after I gave birth. 

411
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,850
 He asked me to fix things. 

412
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,080
 Because I couldn't have sex while I was pregnant, 

413
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,930
 he was so frustrated. That was why. 

414
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,980
 I visited the defendant because I wanted an apology, 

415
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,090
 but she said I was at fault for not caring for her husband. 

416
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,930
 She said she was the victim. 

417
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,910
She's our client,

418
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,060
but this doesn't seem right.

419
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,030
Jang Seon Ah is really an evil woman.

420
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,080
She wanted an apology.

421
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,860
 I heard she'll have a half-sibling. 

422
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,210
 How could she hide this from me? 

423
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,330
 She wanted an apology. 

424
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,770
 Seoul Family Court 

425
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,960
Yes, come on in.

426
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,560
The defendant has two attorneys.

427
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,890
Didn't you hire an attorney, Plaintiff?

428
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:29,000
My husband makes a million or two a month because his shop isn't doing well.

429
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,170
We can't afford an attorney.

430
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,020
"We"? See? They're a scammer couple.

431
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,850
They might be doing this to screw me over.

432
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,890
To take my money.

433
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,220
Please be quiet.

434
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,650
Plaintiff, you must've gone through a lot.

435
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,950
It couldn't have been easy to come here. Tell me what terms you want.

436
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,880
Terms?

437
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,910
Would a fortune turn things back the way they were?

438
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,700
A fortune?

439
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,400
Really, you're a couple of scammers.

440
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,750
You saw how greedy she was, right?

441
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,610
They're a scammer couple. I'm telling you.

442
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,000
She wants a fortune from me?

443
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,300
Gosh, I can't believe it.

444
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,290
Ms. Jang Seon Ah.

445
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,870
- Yes?
 - Can you do what I tell you to do?

446
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,650
I'm sorry my client caused a commotion.

447
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,470
The reason she's doing this is...

448
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,170
because the plaintiff's husband said he'd get divorced soon

449
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,290
and he's been deceiving her. She's angry about that.

450
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,750
She's completely aware of what she did.

451
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,850
I'm not sure.

452
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,020
I don't think I buy that.

453
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,690
Instead of being compensated,

454
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,000
how about you receive a sincere apology?

455
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,010
Right here.

456
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,410
 She wanted an apology. 

457
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,830
As you said, even if you were given a fortune,

458
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,270
you won't feel comforted. I'm sure of that.

459
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,610
So you should receive an apology, at least.

460
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,340
If only I could erase my memories...

461
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:54,350
I wish my baby could've had a happy mom,

462
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,560
not a mom who's fallen apart like this...

463
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,210
You know how I feel, right?

464
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,240
You're in the same situation.

465
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,410
I'm so sorry.

466
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,720
Do you mean it?

467
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,640
Yes, I did the wrong thing.

468
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:59,770
Ms. Jang, be regretful of what you did to Plaintiff and the baby for the rest of your life.

469
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:06,150
Your foolishness took away the child's right to be loved by both parents

470
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,520
and you traumatized the Plaintiff forever.

471
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,240
Don't ever forget that. Do you understand?

472
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,910
Yes.

473
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,910
I'm so sorry.

474
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,800
 Mediator 

475
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,190
Attorney, you're seriously so clever.

476
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,630
- What do you mean?
 - You put on a show

477
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,870
in front of everyone so I don't have to pay. You're such a pro.

478
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,950
Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't put on a show.

479
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,510
I didn't pay compensatory damages, and there's no sentencing, either.

480
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,850
This must be why you're so famous.

481
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,350
Someone from a drama said you shouldn't skimp on lawyers.

482
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,920
I totally agree.

483
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,660
Enough is enough.

484
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,210
What are you, a psychopath?

485
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,030
Okay, fine.

486
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,090
She's like my high school ethics teacher.

487
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,990
Do you think I didn't let you pay up because I'm good?

488
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,060
Didn't you?

489
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,200
You said you can do anything as long as you don't have to pay.

490
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,270
And the Plaintiff said she'd prefer a fake apology than accept money from you.

491
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,140
I just used that to reach an agreement.

492
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,510
So, there's no need to thank me.

493
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,930
I hope your apology had an ounce of sincerity.

494
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,150
You can leave.

495
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,550
Okay.

496
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,940
I don't understand Mr. Park Chan Seong's wife.

497
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,000
She went through so much while she was pregnant.

498
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,110
She ended up forgiving her husband

499
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,280
and didn't accept money from his mistress.

500
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,730
It's okay because she won.

501
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,300
Both parties were satisfied with the conclusion.

502
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,980
Let's say we both won.

503
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,640
I heard having a child is expensive.

504
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,370
I'd prefer money over a fake apology like that.

505
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:35,680
A fake apology might've been slightly better than dirty money.

506
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,430
- Yes.
  - Attorney, 

507
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,970
 a man named Park Chan Seong wants to talk to you. 

508
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,720
Okay, put him through.

509
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,790
 Okay, just one moment. 

510
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,990
Yes, this is Han Yu Ri.

511
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,310
 Hello, ma'am. 

512
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,180
I heard she apologized to my wife.

513
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,840
Thank you.

514
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:15,830
You sound as if you had no fault in this along with her.

515
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,230
You speak as if you're a victim.

516
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,870
Ma'am, that is so unfair.

517
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,740
When I was sexually frustrated with my wife, that womanâ€”

518
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,600
 - She seduced you? 
 - Yes.

519
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,760
You're two peas in a pod.

520
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm telling you. She seduced me first.

521
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:39,130
You should give your wife a full apology, not a half-assed one. Please.

522
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,980
And raise the child well. I'm hanging up.

523
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,820
Raise the child well?

524
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:05,040
He wasn't even the plaintiff. You can't talk to a third party like that.

525
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,690
I just...

526
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,940
wanted him to regret a tiny bit

527
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,790
and finally start being good to his family.

528
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,530
Although I was a fool to wish that.

529
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,330
Why am I so foolish?

530
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,200
You're not a fool.

531
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,680
Pardon?

532
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,350
Maybe what you said...

533
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,620
was true.

534
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,420
What did I say?

535
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,210
Thank you for your hard work.

536
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,730
To be honest, I didn't want to receive money from her.

537
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,710
I knew that.

538
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,630
That woman... Jang Seon Ah.

539
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,710
What was she like with you?

540
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,940
- What do you mean?
 - Did she...

541
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,890
have no regrets at all?

542
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,170
That's not the case.

543
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,600
Everyone becomes defensive in the courtroom.

544
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,050
Please think of it that way.

545
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,620
- By the way...
 - Yes.

546
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,840
May I ask why you aren't getting divorced?

547
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,350
A sincere apology.

548
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,340
I want that from him.

549
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,800
I guess he hasn't given you one yet.

550
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,970
He did, but...

551
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:21,500
not the kind he gives to avoid becoming a divorcÃ© and away from the baby.

552
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,670
I want a sincere apology.

553
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,660
I think I need that to go on.

554
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,730
I hope you get one, too.

555
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,710
Yes.

556
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:45,580
â™«  I toss and turn all night,  â™« 
 â™«  I'm used to it now, merely  â™«

557
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,790
Maybe...

558
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,710
Maybe...

559
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:02,600
I also wanted their apology from the beginning.

560
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,660
Maybe that's why...

561
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,070
I hesitated to get divorced.

562
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,240
â™«  But I never breakdown  â™«

563
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,950
â™«  If you could lose your way  â™«

564
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:31,210
â™«  Don't be afraid, I'll send you the moonlight  â™«

565
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:38,760
â™«  Keeping talks with the moon  â™«

566
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,250
â™«  Because at the dream's end, Still here 

567
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,900
- That was good.
 - It was tasty.

568
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,060
- Welcome.
 - Hello.

569
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,270
- You came, Attorney Jeon.
 - Yes.

570
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,200
Does she think she's still a 20-year-old?

571
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,730
Why drink so much when she can't handle it?

572
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,930
Attorney Jeon, could you take Attorney Han home?

573
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,930
Yes, of course.

574
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,100
Han Yu Ri. Han Yu Ri.

575
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,070
Wake up. Wake up. Let's go.

576
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,830
- Get up. Get up.
 - Huh? Why...

577
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,420
- We'll get going.
 - Get home safely.

578
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,700
Be careful. Be careful.

579
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,730
Gosh, why...

580
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,080
Geez...

581
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,620
We've worked together for decades, but you never invited me for a drink.

582
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,190
But you're asking for help because Attorney Han got drunk.

583
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,790
Thank you for coming.

584
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,910
Hyungnim, I'll take a glass.

585
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,560
 Okay. 

586
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,910
Drink this.

587
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,720
The perpetrator pretends to be a victim.

588
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,170
She didn't compensate her, either.

589
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,670
After giving a fake apology,

590
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,490
she fooled the court, the victim,

591
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,300
and she went on her way.

592
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,600
And why is Choi Sa Ra so proud she's pregnant?

593
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,780
She told the kid about it without any shame.

594
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,810
What a bunch of jerks.

595
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,960
Why are you invested in everything?

596
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,010
Look at you. Don't waste your energy.

597
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,620
Attorney Cha said earlier...

598
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,620
that she wanted an apology...

599
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,670
from Kim Ji Sang and Choi Sa Ra.

600
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,690
Apology?

601
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,180
That's the only thing the attorneys can't do.

602
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,700
I'm sorry.

603
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,990
I know you thought about this a lot.

604
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,360
I'm not sure if I'm...

605
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,810
doing a good job as a representative.

606
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,810
How much of it is my responsibility?

607
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,220
You look drunk. Stop drinking now.

608
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:31,520
I do a lot of things I've never done these days.

609
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,870
I look after Han Yu Ri when she's drunk,

610
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:39,140
I'm getting divorced,

611
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,190
and I make food for Jae Hui.

612
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:52,400
You have no idea how picky that little girl is about an omelet.

613
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,550
You know you're having a hard time, right?

614
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,470
Am I having a hard time?

615
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,320
Only you never notice that.

616
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,610
I never seem to notice anything.

617
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,180
I wanted to look cool getting divorced.

618
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,480
I promised to put on a divorce show.

619
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,490
What do I want, and what does Jae Hui want?

620
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:51,440
I knew nothing. Nothing at all.

621
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,710
Looking into your heart.

622
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,390
That's what you should've done first.

623
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,020
The divorce show? Company marketing?

624
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,950
You should quit now.

625
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,020
Only focus on yourself.

626
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,580
You know that'd be the best for Jae Hui, right?

627
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,310
Yes.

628
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,570
You're right.

629
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,810
I didn't even realize that.

630
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,890
Just a bit longer.

631
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,520
Hang in there just a bit longer, Cha Eun Gyeong.

632
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,720
What?

633
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,340
I'll get you a taxi, I said.

634
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,650
What time is it?

635
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,700
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

636
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:40,410
 Attorney Cha, could you come out right now? 

637
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,550
This is my breakfast.

638
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,120
Hello...

639
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,950
It's Choi Sa Ra.

640
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,020
Choi Sa... Sir, it's Choi Sa Ra.

641
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,990
Is she crazy?

642
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,600
Why is she here?

643
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,000
What's with her?

644
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,500
- What are you doing right now?
 - I'm sorry.

645
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,510
Forgive me.

646
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,630
What are you doing right now?

647
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,110
Get out immediately.

648
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,750
I've always wanted to apologize...

649
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,990
to you and Jae Hui.

650
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,420
I'm so sorry.

651
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,280
Why? Why?

652
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,590
Are you afraid of God now that you're a mother?

653
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,960
Or are you doing this to pay less for compensation?

654
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,630
It's not like that.

655
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:25,090
I wanted to apologize to live well with my child.

656
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,720
I see...

657
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,710
You're doing this so you feel better.

658
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,110
I have nothing to say to you.

659
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:38,670
Get out.

660
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,580
Did you plan that?

661
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,930
You said a fake apology...

662
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:42,940
might be better than dirty money.

663
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,720
So, did you tell her to apologize instead of compensating me?

664
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,400
No.

665
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,110
I didn't negotiate with her.

666
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,800
I just said what I needed to say

667
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,790
to Choi Sa Ra, the mother.

668
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,480
Not Choi Sa Ra, the woman.

669
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,270
 Apologize to Attorney Cha. 

670
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,470
 Did you come here this late to tell me that? 

671
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,490
 If you want to qualify as the mother of your baby, 

672
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,960
 make a real apology, not a fake one. 

673
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,580
Good job.

674
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,120
Thank you.

675
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:45,160
Hang in there just a bit longer.

676
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,730
You're almost there.

677
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,790
Even if it was a fake apology,

678
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,930
I could at least tell Jae Hui that I'm okay because I got an apology.

679
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,350
I can tell her not to worry about me...

680
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,340
and she can depend on me like a child.

681
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,650
I can at least tell her that.

682
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,000
Thank you.

683
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,920
 When you do something wrong, you need to apologize 

684
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,920
 and ask for forgiveness. It's a simple truth. 

685
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,140
 But you forget that as you become an adult. 

686
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,400
 I really didn't have an affair. 

687
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,300
 But my wife has delusional jealousy. 

688
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,840
 We were sincere toward each other, so I'm not ashamed. 

689
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,910
 I'm going to take custody. 

690
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,750
 They say it takes one to know one. Do you have proof? 

691
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,340
 Why is that a crime? I'm the victim here! 

692
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,350
 Are you still mad like a child? 

693
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,390
 And everyone has a limited amount of time to apologize. 

694
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,660
 Han Myeong Jong 

695
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,470
 Did Dad actually... 

696
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,650
 want to apologize to us? 

697
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,370
There's an eggshell in there.

698
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,760
Done.

699
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,560
Don't I look like a pro now?

700
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,540
You do.

701
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,570
Okay, let's see.

702
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,420
- Mom.
 - Yes?

703
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,380
I'm sorry.

704
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:59,860


705
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,000
 Kids blame themselves for what others did 

706
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,820
 and adults blame someone else for what they did. 

707
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,920
 In adults' apologies, there are always conditions, and they're insincere. 

708
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,610
No.

709
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,280
I'm sorry.

710
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,340
â™«  What gotten into me?  â™«

711
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,710
â™«  I ask you again  â™«

712
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:44,630
â™«  I don't want to get caught in a mess.  â™«

713
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:48,070
â™«  'Cause you are beautiful  â™«

714
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,430
â™«  A beautiful stranger  â™«

715
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:57,670
â™«  wearing clothes which don't fit  â™«

716
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,080
â™«  Because you are beautiful  â™«

717
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,950
 Even a half of an apology 

718
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,950
 can be a lifeline to someone desperate. 

719
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,540
 I came to learn that. 

720
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:25,260
â™«  Eventually it will pass again  â™«

721
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:34,380
â™«  Every single little word  â™«

722
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:40,390
â™«  gradually eats away at me  â™«

723
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:47,260
â™«  Hunching down without even a sound  â™«

724
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:52,980
â™«  Is this exhausted   â™«

725
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,480
â™«  and frayed heart me?  â™«

726
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,170
 Good Partner 

727
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,990
 She said she didn't want to see her father. 

728
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,920
 I don't need Dad anymore, either. 

729
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,410
 - You're despicable.
 - It's over. It's all over! 

730
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:14,750
 The fact that Jae Hui is losing her dad is more important than winning or losing. 

731
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,920
 You need to be punished if you did something wrong. 

732
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,230
 Jae Hui said she wants the case to be closed. 

733
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,160
 It'd be so nice if we could end things nicely. 

734
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,360
â™«  A beautiful stranger  â™«

735
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,470
â™«  Please hug my shrivelled heart  â™«
