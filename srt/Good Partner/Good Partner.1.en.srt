00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,428
Jeil Group's heiress Park Su Eun was granted a division of assets...

19
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,038
that mounts up to 150 million dollars in her appeal.

20
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,599
- Cha Eun Kyung? - Did she say 150 million dollars?

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,068
Many call it the divorce case of the century.

22
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,240
What is your take on it as an attorney?

23
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:15,508
Rather than the division of assets and the alimony itself,

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,049
- I believe the appellate court... - She won 150 million dollars.

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,478
finally let my client reclaim her rights...

26
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,818
after a prolonged amount...

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,948
- of suffering. - Did Cha work her magic again?

28
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,249
That being said, I am satisfied with the ruling.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,148
The amount tripled compared to the first trial.

30
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,359
Is it the Cha Eun Kyung magic?

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,019
How do you feel about the people saying...

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,030
that the change in representation led to a different outcome?

my client's best interest at heart. Thank you.

37
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:41,469

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,428
Yes, this is the divorce department.

Eun Kyung, we barely managed to recruit the top candidate...

102
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,859
to the divorce department,

103
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,629
so don't fire this one.

104
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,189
Let's get something straight.

105
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,499
I didn't fire anyone. They left of their own accord.

106
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,299
You know that's not what I meant.

107
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,669
You've been pushing it.

108
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,169
Also, listen to what others have to say.

109
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,808
No one will be able to stay on your team...

110
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,140
if you constantly speak your mind.

111
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:51,178
And here I thought people admired me for not letting...

112
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,479
other people sway me.

113
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,950
Kids these days are too weak-minded.

114
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,150

They won't change though,

116
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,859
so we should change our view instead.

117
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,928
We lost three of our new recruits by the end of last month...

118
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,129
all because you drove them hard.

119
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,369
You're costing us, you know.

120
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,999
So what? Did the boss say something?

121
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,439
Besides, we only lost two. Jung Eun Ho's still with us.

122
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,580
It's Jun Eun Ho, not Jung Eun Ho.

123
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,619
The boss still wouldn't dare to complain.

124
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,390
- Not when we're a cash cow. - Exactly.

125
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,059
We should train new talent, bring in more money,

126
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,590
and show him who's boss.

127
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,030
Sure.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,169
How about I ask you a question?

129
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:48,899
Sure thing.

130
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,270
Let's say you have a client who cheated on a spouse.

131
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,439
The married couple has been separated for a year.

132
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,839
The client wishes to divorce the spouse...

133
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,780
and start a new life with someone new.

134
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:01,619
What would you say?

135
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,789
Since Korean divorce law is strictly fault-based,

136
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,488
I will say that the unfaithful spouse...

137
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,488
cannot file for divorce.

138
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,259
And that is why you're a law school student...

139
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,729
and not an attorney.

140
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,228
In principle, a divorce filed by the guilty party is dismissed...

141
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,798
If the attorney only preach about principles,

142
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,799
how are we different from law books?

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,299
An AI would be better with laws.

144
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:29,280
You'll meet with Ms. Cha Eun Kyung later.

145
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,450
Excuse me. I'm sorry to ask,

146
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,220
but are you sure I'm on the divorce team?

147
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,430
Ms. Han Yu Ri.

148
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,399
You have been assigned to the divorce department.

149
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:51,769
I see.

150
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,939
Then there must have been a mix-up.

151
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,540
You, Cha Eun Kyung!

152
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,439
Where's Cha Eun Kyung? Get out here!

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,878
- Sir, wait. - This isn't the place.

154
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,979
- Hey! Let go of me. - Hold on.

155
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,608
- Cha Eun Kyung. - Sir, please calm down.

156
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,850
- Cha Eun Kyung! - Calm down, sir.

157
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,248
- Cha Eun Kyung, you. - Wait.

158
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,279
- Stop him from entering. - Goodness.

159
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,789
- Sir, please. - Cha Eun Kyung.

160
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,859
- You can't do this. - Let go.

161
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,790
Hold it and let go.

162
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,090
Sir, please.

163
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,470
What's this?

164
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,268
Did someone shoot the judge in the brains?

165
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,269
Why am I supposed to give up half of my assets...

166
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,209
to a woman who spent her time staying home playing with the kids?

167
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,180
That was the judge's call.

168
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,609
Please appeal if you deem it unfair.

169
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,249
Also, I'd appreciate some courtesy.

170
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,278
Don't you dare talk like...

171
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,648
this doesn't concern you.

172
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,090
But it doesn't concern me.

173
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,559
Attorneys represent you in court,

174
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,819
the ruling is up to the judges,

175
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,689
and paying your ex-wife is your own business.

176
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,229
So technically, this doesn't concern me.

177
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,258
- What? - Do you need consultation?

178
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,628
Why you little...

179
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:58,830
Should I book you an appointment?

180
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,399
What are you yapping on about?

181
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,440
I came to you because you were well-known in this field,

182
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,509
- but you robbed me. - Sir, please.

183
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,310
If you take this any further,

184
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,450
you will go from client to being the accused.

185
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,879
Darn.

186
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:23,758
This is how irresponsible women are!

187
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,460
Why don't us men take this outside, then?

188
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,430
What?

189
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,060
Are you also an attorney?

190
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,970
Sure. The men will talk.

191
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,369
Come on out.

192
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,239
Darn it!

193
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,239
- Hurry! - Yes, sir. I'm coming.

194
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Was I wrong to complain?

195
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,909
- Why that little... - Mr. Kim.

196
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,979
- Unbelievable. - At a law firm, you can't...

197
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:55,720
- Please have a seat here. - Sure.

198
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,159
Ms. Cha, Ms. Han Yu Ri is here.

199
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,509
Hello.

200
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,340
I'm Han Yu Ri.

201
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,378
There's no Han Yu Ri in this office.

202
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,680
Only Han Yu Ri the attorney.

203
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,920
Excuse me for saying this,

204
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,419
but I interviewed...

205
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,449
for the corporate department on the 13th floor,

206
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,790
and that was my first choice.

207
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,128
Interviews are conducted for the whole firm,

208
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,430
and we choose who works where.

209
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,199
We have five new recruits.

210
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,869
Four went to the corporate team while you came to the divorce team.

211
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,369
Why was I the only one...

212
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,008
I hear that divorce attorneys spend most of their time...

213
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,040
listening to clients complain and whine.

214
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,320
Do you still see divorce attorneys...

215
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,489
as those who listen to clients whine?

216
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,659
Did you have me assigned here...

217
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,629
because of what I said that day?

218
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:13,499
Do you think I like wasting my time?

219
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,269
Guess again as to why you're here.

220
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,670
Then,

221
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:21,810
is it because...

222
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,810
I had the lowest score among the recruits?

223
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,549
The boss...

224
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,618
probably didn't assign you to your choice of department...

225
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,519
because he thinks you need to prove yourself.

226
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:46,470
Then, what can I do to move to the corporate department?

227
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,899
Make yourself noticed on the divorce team.

228
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,069
Win ten cases in a row,

229
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,580
and I'll ask the boss to consider your transfer.

230
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,049
So you're saying that I can transfer...

231
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,349
to the corporate department if I win ten cases.

232
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,350
That's what I said.

233
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,060
Do you have a car?

234
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,399
- I take the subway... - Buy one.

235
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,999
And roll up your sleeves.

236
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,340
My sleeves?

237
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,070
Buy a watch as well.

238
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,540
Time is everything to an attorney.

239
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,050
You must constantly be checking the time.

240
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,579
However, your client will consider it rude...

241
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,180
if you keep checking your phone.

242
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,988
- Sorry? - Daejeong...

243
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:42,119
is 1 of Korea's top 3 law firms.

244
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,258
Our fee is at least triple the industry standard...

245
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,560
as are our salaries.

246
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,029
Due to that, our efficiency should also be tripled.

247
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,028
So to perform efficiently,

248
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,300
you will need your own car and comfortable shoes.

249
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,670
Shouldn't you get to work, Ms. Han?

250
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,379
Work?

251
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,029

(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

253
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,619
I'll take care of it.

254
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,220
This is Law Firm Daejeong.

255
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,070
Gosh. Each pile is 30 cases, so there are 60 cases in total.

256
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,998
Can you believe Ms. Cha?

257
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,070
Shouldn't she go easy on you on your first day?

258
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,069
If you're going to help, sort them out for her.

259
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,839
I was going to do that when you came in.

260
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,979
(Han Yu Ri, In court)

261
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,050
Am I expected to be in court tomorrow?

262
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,350
What?

263
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,648
Ms. Cha, Mr. Park and his son...

264
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,420
arrived for their 11am meeting.

265
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,559
You will first meet with that client...

266
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,329
today at 11am.

267
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,790
Gather the files and come to the conference room.

268
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,300
At 11am?

269
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,269
But that's in ten minutes.

270
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:36,139
The clock around here revolves around Cha Eun Kyung.

271
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,639
Gosh, you'd better hurry.

272
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,720
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

273
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,269
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

274
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,970
Why are you standing here?

275
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,310
Where's the conference room?

276
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,680
(Conference room)

277
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,879
Are you sure I should meet with the client alone?

278
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Of course.

279
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,859
Mr. Park Jong Sik?

280
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:32,830
- Yes. - He screams "affair."

281
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,600
Talk him into an uncontested divorce.

282
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,228
There might not have been an affair.

283
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:39,430
His face tells me he's lacking something.

284
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,970
Are you sure we should be judging someone by his cover?

285
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:45,638
He dresses neatly in a style women like...

286
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,040
and physical contact comes naturally to him.

287
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,909
Is she perhaps Ms. Cha Eun Kyung?

288
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,080
That's right.

289
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,320
He's also moderately courteous.

290
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,920
When put together, you get a cheater.

291
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,259
I see his wife filed for divorce.

292
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,659
His son was forced to come here to serve as a witness.

293
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,830
Good luck with that.

294
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Gosh.

295
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,949
This is the last thing I expected to happen in life.

296
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,389
He actually...

297
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,290
cheated on her.

298
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,859
That's not true.

299
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,959
It's wrong.

300
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,000
Never have I thought of being with a woman who isn't my wife.

301
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,709
So you're saying there wasn't an affair.

302
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,379
There isn't...

303
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,749
any evidence of an affair attached to your papers.

304
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,119
Because there isn't any.

305
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,780
How can there be evidence when there wasn't an affair?

306
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,958
Then, who is Jang Eun Ji...

307
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,760
that is listed as a second defendant?

308
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,389
Are you saying she isn't your mistress?

309
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,760
My mistress?

310
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,560
She's an employee of mine.

311
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,369
Then,

312
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,669
why did your wife file for divorce claiming infidelity?

313
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,080
I know this isn't the ideal time to say this,

314
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,449
but my wife suffers from delusional jealousy.

- Move! - What is it? When did you get here?

- Come on. - When?

Explain to the attorney.

Yes. Dad's right.

How bad is it?

343
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,080
She tells me to go through Dad's phone while he's asleep.

344
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,149
She made me do it since I was in elementary school.

345

When Dad has a company dinner, she makes him send photos.

Mr. Park, you want a divorce, right?

00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:01,169
No.

349
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,340
I won't divorce her.

350
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,240
She's slightly ill, but she's my first love...

351
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,439
and the mother of my son.

352
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,409
I must keep the family intact.

353
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,359
There's no proof of an affair here, so there's not enough for a divorce.

354
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,030
I think I can get the lawsuit dismissed as you wish.

355
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,760
Will you really get it dismissed?

An attorney that says "trust me" when a future is at stake?

361
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,510
Are we deities?

362
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,980
You're just a rookie attorney.

363
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,490
As you predicted,

364
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,020
he was sued for cheating,

365
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,319
but there was no proof whatsoever.

366
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,359
If there's no proof, skip the alimony...

367
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:00,030
and get him to agree on a division of assets.

368
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,898
The client doesn't want a divorce.

369
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,128
Broken glass doesn't stick back together just because...

370
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,629
the judge says, "Make it work."

371
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,869
Think of how to clear more cases faster.

372
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:12,709
What?

373
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,780
Do you mean I should...

374
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,479
clear cases like a restaurant clears tables to seat more people?

375
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Yes.

376
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,719
Don't waste pointless energy.

377
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,349
The plaintiff suffers from delusional jealousy.

378
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,089
That's what every cheater says.

379
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,159
That's how they describe their spouses.

380
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:34,090
You don't believe it, do you?

381
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,698
Dad's right.

382
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,070
Mom gets suspicious to an extreme.

383
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,300
His son agreed.

384
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:46,239
He's the closest witness to both the plaintiff and defendant.

385
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,280
Their offspring don't know everything.

386
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,080
They only see what their parents show them.

387
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,379
I think the defendant's acting like a victim.

388
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,990
Ms. Cha. I'm convinced he didn't have an affair.

389
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,060
I'll have the case dismissed.

390
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:15,340
There's no way a wife doesn't know her husband's having an affair.

391
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,010
They can tell with all their senses.

392
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,840
There are only people who failed to obtain the evidence.

393
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,618
You'll figure it out in time,

394
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,649
but I hope you do so soon.

395
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,919
Just how arrogant you're being.

396
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,719
My gosh.

397
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,859
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

398
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,879
(Law Firm Daejeong)

399
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,560
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

400
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,609
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

401
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:31,138
The kids with the worst grades always revise...

402
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,368
until the last minute,

403
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,309
and rookie attorneys wear black...

404
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,540
with their new badge and read files until they step into court.

405
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,448
I'll give you a ride while you're on probation.

406
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:41,820
Buy a car soon.

407
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,379
What?

408
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,060
What are you reading?

409
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:58,270
I'm not sure what the judge will ask.

410
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,530
A courtroom isn't like a classroom.

411
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,340
There's no point in trying to get the correct answer to each question.

412
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,810
A trial is a process of persuading the judge at your own pace.

413
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,980
Yes, but it's my first trial, and I should know what I'm doing.

414
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,448
If you can't answer the judge's question...

415
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:23,490
"I'll prepare by the next trial." That's all you say.

416
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,889
As calmly as possible.

417
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Okay.

418
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,800
We'll begin the trial for Divorce Court One.

419
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,039
Case number 2024-532.

420
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,540
Court's in session.

421
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:49,349
The plaintiff wants alimony...

422
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,750
and 50 percent of the assets.

423
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,060
Your child is an adult.

424
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,290
Defendant One, what's your opinion on divorce?

425
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,969
My client does not want a divorce.

426
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:09,938
Due to his wife's jealously that bordered on delusion,

427
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:13,840
he suffered all his married life.

428
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,639
As the plaintiff is at fault,

429
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,749
this case should be dismissed as the guilty party...

430
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,350
cannot sue for divorce.

431
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,249
The plaintiff harassed Defendant One to the point...

432
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,790
where he couldn't function at work.

433
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,730
She had her son go through his father's phone...

434
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,929
and came to his workplace many times to monitor him.

435
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,999
On July 22, 2023...

436
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,599
and on September 3...

437
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,839
Counsel, all the dates are on file.

438
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,570
You don't have to explain.

439
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:50,179
Okay.

440
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,879
She caused a scene at his workplace three times.

441
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,719
Your Honor. I apologize.

442
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,790
I'm the plaintiff's attorney. I submitted a POA this morning.

443
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,730
Defendant's counsel, you may continue.

444
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,169
Okay.

445
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,010
The plaintiff's delusional jealousy was so severe,

446
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,638
she demanded alimony without proof of an affair...

447
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,639
Your Honor.

448
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,679
My client hired me a bit later than recommended,

449
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,419
and I submitted the evidence only this morning.

450
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:33,149
I guess the defending counsel hasn't seen it yet.

451
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,520
Put it up on the screen.

452
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,330
(Evidence 1)

453
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,559
(S)

454
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
(C)

455
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,668
(O)

456
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:47,928
Do you see that?

457
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,239
- That's unbelievable! - See?

458
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,638
- He's out of his mind. - That's disgusting.

459
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,269
- Darn him! - How could he?

460
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,840
Order in court. Silence.

461
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,549
I don't dare explain...

462
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,480
what those initials mean,

463
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,949
but I'm pretty sure you know.

464
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,790
No. I'd like you to spell it out for us.

465
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,760
Yes, Your Honor.

466
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:15,059
At the top of the screen,

467
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,499
Defendant One says, "Shall we..."

468
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,600
(S)

469
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,500
"meet up to copulate nearby?"

470
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:24,869
Defendant Two replies, "Sounds good."

471
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:26,340
Defendant One says...

472
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:29,980
she should bring condoms, but he uses the initial "C."

473
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,550
What does the last set of initials mean?

474
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,619
I believe it's something done with the mouth.

475
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,718
- He's out of his mind. - That's gross.

476
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,859
Defending counsel, what do you say?

477
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,958
It's not true at all.

478
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,330
(Plaintiff)

479
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:53,100
The plaintiff was diagnosed with extreme bipolar disorder.

480
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,769
She's mentally unstable,

481
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,800
- and the proof could be faked... - No way!

482
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,740
You don't know how much my sister suffered!

483
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,439
Order in the court!

484
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,740
Sit down.

485
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,350
It's okay.

486
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,990
Your Honor.

487
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:15,820
I haven't seen the evidence myself...

488
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,259
If you can't answer the judge's question,

489
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,198
"I'll prepare by the next trial."

490
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,399
That's all you say. As calmly as possible.

491
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,409
I'll prepare a response by the next trial.

492
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
Your Honor.

493
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:38,279
To identify which assets are eligible for division,

494
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,050
I request access to the defendant's accounts and transactions.

495
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,449
Yes, approved.

496
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,619
The plaintiff could have stolen and hidden assets, so I request...

497
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,289
she submits her financial details...

498
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,290
and list of properties.

499
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,830
I stole his assets?

500
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:54,789
I bet he did the stealing!

501
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,500
Calm down and sit, please.

502
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:01,429
I'll see you all at the next hearing.

503
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,709
(In session)

504
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,790
Mom. My goodness.

505
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:25,659
Does your mom know you do this for a living?

506
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,560
You could be charged with assault and defamation.

507
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,169
Let go of me.

508
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,368
You witch. You're Jong Sik's mistress, aren't you?

509
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,770
Stop it, Mom!

510
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,740
Get your facts straight and do your job properly!

511
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:41,909
Okay?

512
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:43,809
- Let's go, Mom. - My gosh.

513
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,850
Don't you have anything better to do than to steal a married man?

514
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
- My gosh. - It's okay.

515
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,918
Sit down, Mom.

516
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,850
- I don't believe this. - Goodness.

517
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:55,459
Sit down.

518
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,980
What a mess of a first trial.

519
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,090
It's so annoying.

520
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,199
That witch.

521
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,429
I bet she slept with Park Jong Sik.

522
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,769
She wouldn't do this for him unless he slept with her.

523
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,209
- Are they out of their minds? - The disgusting rats.

524
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,679
My wife suffers from delusional jealousy.

525
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,550
She might suspect you and I.

526
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:57,179
How did he manage to seduce that young attorney?

527
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,589
He must've bought her a few designer bags...

528
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,189
with the money he hid away.

529
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,589
She looked like a kid.

530
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,060
Not all attorneys are rich.

531
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,559
She fell for the handbags.

532
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,359
It's so darn infuriating.

533
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,310
It was a tough first day.

534
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,570
Here.

535
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,020
You saw the proof, didn't you?

536
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,149
Should I get him to confess?

537
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,090
I told you so.

538
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,619
It's obvious.

539
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,688
He had an affair, couldn't handle the aftermath,

540
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:41,359
and decided to deny it.

541
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,958
People like that will never admit their wrong even to their counsel...

542
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,800
unless there's clear proof.

543
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,439
Get him to admit to it and settle out of court.

544
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:56,379
I'll talk to my client.

545
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,750
Don't talk to him. Lead him.

546
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,859
Ms. Han, did the trial go well?

547
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,330
I'll come to your office right away.

548
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,139
Ms. Han. Mr. Park Jong Sik's here.

549
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,850
Thanks.

550
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:53,429
You said there would be no proof.

551
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:54,899
No.

552
00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:58,139
You said you didn't have an affair.

553
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,639
Do you know how badly I was humiliated in court?

554
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,649
How could you...

555
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:09,649
lie to your own attorney of all people?

556
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,749
You need to cool down and...

557
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,589
Do you think I can cool down?

558
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,759
I really didn't have an affair.

559
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,199
You're still saying that?

560
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,830
I'm hurt that my own attorney doesn't believe me.

561
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,869
Are you?

562
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,310
Then how do you explain these texts?

563
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,690
(S, C, O)

564
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,689
Why does everyone think...

565
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,329
this is proof of an affair?

566
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,489
The initial "S!"

567
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,730
Supper.

568
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,429
"Supper?"

569
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:00,569
What...

570
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:07,940
Then...

571
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,040
what about "C?"

572
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,279
What...

573
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,080
does that mean if not "condom?"

574
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,179
Card.

575
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:20,020
My corporate credit card.

576
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,489
I'd left it behind the last time.

577
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:30,799
My gosh.

578
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,699
Then...

579
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,900
what "O" was the best?

580
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,469
The organic beverage.

581
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,439
We'd ordered mojitos at a previous supper,

582
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,239
and that was very tasty.

583
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,210
An organic mojito?

584
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,210
I don't believe this.

585
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,719
Do you think the judge will believe that?

586
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,360
Is she just laughing or laughing at me?

587
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,199
If Park Jong Sik's affair material,

588
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,130
you're witch material.

589
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,569
Say that's what your client said.

590
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,799
He's better than you.

591
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,139
I should hire him.

592
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,639
Goodness.

593
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,239
Do you really want me to say that in court?

594
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:21,110
That he meant to bring his corporate card...

595
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,079
to supper where they'd order organic drinks?

596
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,589
Ms. Han. We're hired to represent clients.

597
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,859
If the client insists they're innocent,

598
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,690
go with what they say.

599
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:33,588
Even so...

600
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:35,600
You represent your client's profits.

601
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
You want to work in corporate law.

602
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,169
In this case, getting the case dropped is a win.

603
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,199
Go for it.

604
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,569
I don't think the judge will believe my client.

605
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,209
He'll just become a mockery.

606
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,479
If you say that because you'd feel embarrassed,

607
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,980
put your shame aside.

608
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,279
There's no room for human Han Yu Ri here.

609
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,049
Only Han Yu Ri the attorney.

610
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,889
It's not because I feel embarrassed. I don't think that's the fact.

611
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:09,560
I see.

612
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,440
You don't like it because it feels like lying?

613
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,610
Yes. Lying to defend my client...

614
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,539
would be unfair to the plaintiff.

615
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,739
Do you represent the plaintiff?

616
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,879
The defendant's paying you.

617
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,310
You will lie if you must.

618
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,449
Plus, that could be the truth.

619
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:36,060
It could be true they wanted to meet for supper...

620
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:37,690
with a credit card?

621
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,589
What if,

622
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,989
and it could be a massive if,

623
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,630
but what if it were true?

624
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,298
Even if 99 people out of 100 say...

625
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,199
they meant to bring condoms to a motel to fool around,

626
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
what if your client's telling the truth?

627
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:02,318
No man and female subordinate...

628
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,020
would type "S" for "supper" in a private chat.

629
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:08,319
- It's impossible. - That's what you think.

630
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,259
We provide a service.

631
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,500
The judge makes the decision, not the attorney.

632
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,299
So just do your job.

633
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,730
Win.

634
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,908
I saw the new hire's cover letter.

635
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:30,909
And?

636
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,609
She actually put down she'd work...

637
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,080
in any department but divorce law.

638
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,380
- It's insane. - Gosh.

639
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,750
As usual, it won't be easy.

640
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:41,619
Why does everyone hate divorce?

641
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,960
Divorce is the most fun for me.

642
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:44,290
- Seriously. - Right.

643
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,689
You went to school together, but you joined the firm first.

644
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,630
- Yes. - Take good care of her.

645
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,429
I'll try to convince Attorney Cha.

646
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,969
What should I do?

647
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,810
Go out for a meal or coffee and be a listening ear.

648
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,509
Give her space to relax...

649
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,069
so she doesn't think about quitting.

650
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Ms. Han.

651
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,480
Can I ask you something?

652
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,979
- What is it? - Why do you hate...

653
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,219
the divorce team so much?

654
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Everyone wants to learn working under Ms. Cha.

655
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:22,330
Did the rumors spread that far already?

656
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:27,630
I don't love divorce cases,

657
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,040
but honestly, I don't love Ms. Cha even more.

658
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,909
Why? You've only seen her for a few days.

659
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,008
She came for a special lecture when I was in law school.

660
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:42,380
- Yes? - I didn't really like her then.

661
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:45,150
You are so uptight.

662
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,259
I'm already feeling down from my first case.

663
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,389
I didn't study that hard to be someone's assistant.

664
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,429
Have a drink.

665
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,298
And you need to win first.

666
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,129
You can't be picky right now.

667
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,928
Just do as Ms. Cha says.

668
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,638
She is very knowledgeable.

669
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,638
Did you always do as you were told?

670
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,009
Yes, of course.

671
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,040
Causing trouble in an organization only make you tired.

672
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,009
Getting a steady paycheck is enough.

673
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:21,690
Then what is the fun of working?

674
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,019
Salarymen have fun...

675
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,218
when they leave work right on time to have grilled tripe and beer.

676
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,130
Try a piece. It's good.

677
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,659
Only squeeze your brain until 6pm.

678
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,670
Right.

679
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,429
Until 5:59pm.

680
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,669
Until 5:59pm?

681
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,940
In the last minute, you have to pack your bag.

682
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:41,909
Right?

683
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,210
He is so shallow.

684
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,980
Yes, right.

685
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,349
Also, when you're struggling, just talk to me about it.

686
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,948
I'll buy you grilled tripe and beer and chicken and beer.

687
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,080
Whatever you want. Okay?

688
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,089
Also, let's have lunch together from now on.

689
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,960
- Pardon? - Let's just eat good food together.

690
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,029
Things like this.

691
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:10,069
Try some.

692
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,110
- Thank you. - Of course.

693
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,480
(Seoul Family Court)

694
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:21,909
The defense. Is it true?

695
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,150
"C D S" means...

696
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,850
"Use the card for supper?"

697
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,860
Yes, Your Honor.

698
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,900
Your Honor, if that were true,

699
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,830
they wouldn't need to use initials.

700
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,999
People use initials...

701
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,210
when it's uncomfortable to write embarrassing words explicitly.

702
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:47,839
Everyone knows that.

703
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,650
Everyone knowing something doesn't make it a fact.

704
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,790
We will submit evidence of the plaintiff.

705
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,199
I see that it is a recording.

706
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,009
- Please insert it. - Yes, sir.

707
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,580
(Deposition)

708
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,618
I'm sure he bought her some bags...

709
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,480
with the money he hid from his wife and children.

710
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,919
She was obviously young.

711
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,290
Just because she's an attorney, it doesn't mean she's rich.

712
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,988
She was won over by the bags.

713
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,619
Gosh. That makes me so angry.

714
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,400
Excuse me. Could you please be quiet?

715
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,529
Yes, I'm sorry.

716
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,399
A skanky client...

717
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,040
and a dirty attorney. What a great duo.

718
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,568
Your Honor. Recording the conversation of others...

719
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:57,380
is a violation of the Protection of Communications Secrets Act.

720
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,879
I was in that same space,

721
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,019
and I was part of the conversation,

722
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,218
so I don't think this can be seen as a violation of that act.

723
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:07,689
According to a Supreme Court ruling,

724
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,460
you must be part of the conversation from the start for that to apply.

725
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,230
Even before I went into the bathroom,

726
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:19,069
in front of the courthouse, the plaintiff's family...

727
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,830
called me the defendant's mistress.

728
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,299
You're Park Jong Sik's mistress, aren't you?

729
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:25,839
That's what they said to me.

730
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,968
I think there is enough reason to say...

731
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:30,239
that I was part of the conversation from the start.

732
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,279
We submit...

733
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:35,580
the aforementioned evidence to support our claim...

734
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,118
that she is paranoid enough to even distrust...

735
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,920
her husband's relationship with his attorney.

736
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:40,350
Nice.

737
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,719
Please display the next piece of evidence.

738
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,989
(Written Statement)

739
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,399
(I am the plaintiff's son, Park Min Jun.)

740
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,630
As you can see, the plaintiff...

741
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,069
used her son to run all of her errands.

742
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,170
When I met her son in person,

743
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,809
I could confirm that he grew up feeling very stressed...

744
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:02,839
because of that reason.

745
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:06,880
Are you saying Min Jun wrote that?

746
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:08,350
Yes, that is correct.

747
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,089
Your Honor. I'm sure Park Jong Sik, that punk,

748
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:17,089
I mean,

749
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,929
the defendant bribed him with something.

750
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
That jerk.

751
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,100
Bribed?

752
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:27,869
Is Mr. Park Min Jun...

753
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:30,769
a child who does as he is told when someone gives him a toy?

754
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,799
How dare you?

755
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,310
How dare you say my son's name?

756
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:43,979
Mr. Park Min Jun is an adult and a witness who watched...

757
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,520
the plaintiff and defendant's married life for decades.

758
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,759
Your honor. From the confirmation we requested previously,

759
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:55,289
we verified that the defendant gave 30,000 dollars...

760
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,730
to his son, Mr. Park Min Jun.

761
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,199
Please display the documents.

762
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,639
(Park Min Jun, outgoing, 30,000 dollars)

763
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,009
I knew it.

764
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,339
He got money from his dad...

765
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,279
and wrote a fake statement.

766
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,049
He didn't even come to court...

767
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,480
because he knew he couldn't control his expressions.

768
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:20,650
That is not true.

769
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,860
His was not able to come because of his work.

770
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,789
If so, what was the reason...

771
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,600
for the 30,000 dollars?

772
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,270
It is an allowance.

773
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,270
Who gives 30,000 dollars as allowance?

774
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,679
The defendant...

775
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,549
sincerely wishes for this family to stay together.

776
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:52,689
However, he had to prepare for this case...

777
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,850
to end in divorce.

778
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,360
Thinking his son would be devastated because of the situation,

779
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:01,159
he gave his son that money to get himself a place to live.

780
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:16,239
Saying the son's testimony is a lie...

781
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,179
because his father gave him money...

782
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,710
is not reasonable.

783
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,080
However, it is true...

784
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,989
that this seems like an incentivized relationship,

785
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:30,790
so we will proceed with the planned witness examination.

786
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:38,659
(Defendant)

787
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:39,868
Did the plaintiff...

788
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,799
visit the defendant's office often?

789
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,309
Yes. At least once a week,

790
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,639
she'd slam open the office door and start swearing.

791
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,739
- It was a bit much, honestly. - Where are those two?

792
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,449
When she comes bursting in, it's so hard to stop her.

793
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,350
I thought of quitting several times because of that.

794
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,218
They're all on the same side as Park Jong Sik.

795
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,789
The plaintiff's counsel, proceed with cross-examination.

796
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,819
(Plaintiff)

797
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:08,659
Defendant 1 and Defendant 2...

798
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,329
have done things...

799
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,429
in the office that could be seen as having an affair, correct?

800
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:17,339
Mr. Park and Ms. Jang do often leave the office together for work,

801
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,199
but I didn't sense anything like that.

802
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,779
If so, have you ever heard Defendant 1 and Defendant 2...

803
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,479
refer to dinner as supper?

804
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,679
(Witness)

805
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,020
One moment. Now that I think about it...

806
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,949
What do you think about naengmyeon for our midday meal today?

807
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,258
I thought you said Middle Eastern, not midday.

808
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:39,289
- Sounds good. - That sounds nice.

809
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,830
Sometimes, Ms. Jang says "midday meal" and "supper."

810
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,198
I thought it was a bit strange.

811
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,368
- There's no way. - Of course, there's no way.

812
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:50,699
We will end witness questioning and finish the day here.

813
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,770
I will see you on the day of sentencing.

814
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,468
- Gosh. - It's over?

815
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:56,980
Goodness.

816
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:58,639
Can you believe that?

817
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,190
She was a bit better this time.

818
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,489
You told me to make him just confess and go for a settlement.

819
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,330
Why did you suddenly tell me to fight it out?

820
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,999
That case had a 20,000-dollar incentive...

821
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,629
if the divorce were to be dismissed.

822
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,699
Of course, we had to win.

823
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,238
I thought you were telling me...

824
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,639
to fight for the minuscule chance that Mr. Park didn't have an affair.

825
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,210
That's the minimum.

826
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,150
But she wants to get divorced so badly.

827
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,219
If she can't get divorced...

828
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,989
Are you worried we might win?

829
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,029
You're so arrogant.

830
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,399
No, it's not that.

831
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,929
You have an arrogant attitude.

832
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,469
You must think you have the power to control how things go.

833
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,069
If so, why did you change your mind?

834
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,069
You said you trusted our client.

835
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,810
You said the plaintiff was paranoid.

836
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,310
At the time, there was no evidence.

837
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,719
Stop acting like a judge and do your job as an attorney.

838
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:15,389
You're like those attorneys in dramas.

839
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,529
I'll...

840
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:27,969
take the subway back to the office.

841
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,900
You're good at wasting your energy in weird ways.

842
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,049
I was hoping to run into you.

843
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,020
- You young... - Ma'am.

844
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,489
You can't speak to me like that and hit me.

845
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,360
Ms. Cha. You can go.

846
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:52,690
- Okay. - Let go of me.

847
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,488
What a terrible wench.

848
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:56,559
- Mom. Let's go. - Calm down, Mom.

849
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,798
- Let's go. - How can I calm down?

850
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:59,868
- Let's just go! - Stop it.

851
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:02,330
When I think of my Eun Hee, I can't even sleep!

852
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:04,199
My gosh.

853
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,409
You wrote a statement for 30,000 dollars?

854
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,989
I worked so hard to raise you. How could you do this to me?

855
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,420
Are you out of your mind?

856
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,230
What?

857
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:30,299
Why are you here?

858
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,299
I thought you were too busy to come to the trial.

859
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,130
I see.

860
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:38,199
You gathered here to cook up your schemes.

861
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,770
No, it's not that.

862
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:43,310
- Please don't do this... - Hey.

863
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,580
Be honest.

864
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:47,610
You two were up to no good, weren't you?

865
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,818
Just admit it!

866
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:51,980
Apologize right now.

867
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,150
You should be the one to apologize.

868
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,019
The person who takes money...

869
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,559
and spits out lies like a vending machine.

870
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,659
To ruin people's lives. You!

871
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:06,060
Your family turned away from you because of this kind of behavior!

872
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:08,198
- I would get tired of it too! - What?

873
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,429
Please stop!

874
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:14,670
I'm so tired of it.

875
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:16,809
Haven't you done enough for 20 years?

876
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:17,880
Please!

877
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:20,580
Please just stop.

878
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:31,020
Min Jun...

879
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,069
What do you know?

880
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,839
What does some young attorney know?

881
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:55,080
You don't know how I came to be this way!

882
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,519
He's cheated six times already,

883
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,290
starting when Min Jun was five.

884
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,920
I saw you!

885
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,460
I saw you...

886
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:13,330
doing that...

887
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,500
in our bedroom...

888
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,009
with other women!

889
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,739
What are you talking about? It's all a misunderstanding.

890
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,239
Okay?

891
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,679
Let's drop the charges...

892
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,218
and live happily together, okay?

893
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:31,250
Get your hands off of me!

894
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:35,920
I won't ask you to admit to it,

895
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,560
so please just let me divorce you.

896
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:44,460
Let me go, you jerk.

897
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,079
He's cheated six times already,

898
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,949
starting when Min Jun was five.

899
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:18,400
I won't ask you to admit to it, so please just let me divorce you.

900
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,600
Let me go, you jerk.

901
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:13,850
I lost.

902
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:16,889
I won't get any of his assets,

903
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,360
and I have to pay for that prick's attorney too.

904
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,460
How can the law be this way?

905
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:48,119
(Attorney Han Yu Ri)

906
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,159
Hello?

907
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:02,400
Isn't this Mr. Park Jong Sik's phone?

908
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,100
Honey.

909
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:07,810
Your attorney.

910
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,150
Ms. Han. I had to stop by somewhere.

911
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,679
How did the ruling go?

912
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:18,980
We won.

913
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,750
I see.

914
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:22,719
Thank you for your work.

915
00:55:43,279 --> 00:55:44,509
Hi, Ms. Cha.

916
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,279
Please sit there.

917
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,250
- Hi. - Hi.

918
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,250
I'll pour you a drink.

919
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,989
Good work, Ms. Cha.

920
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,789
Here's one for you too.

921
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,789
- Thank you. - I need to leave for a radio show.

922
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:03,959
I'll leave after this drink.

923
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,130
Gosh, I'm sad to hear that. Please stay for a bit longer.

924
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:12,469
Here you go. Good work today.

925
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,869
Thank you.

926
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,540
- I'll pour you a drink too. - Thank you.

927
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:21,749
Don't get too excited about winning the case.

928
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,319
Please stay humble and keep learning.

929
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,949
If you don't like that, you can open your own office.

930
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,259
Okay?

931
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,400
Ms. Cha is being mean again.

932
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,270
Congratulations on winning your case.

933
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:43,939
- Here. - Here.

934
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,940
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

935
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:53,009
Since we won the case, we should have one more drink.

936
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:54,210
It's too late.

937
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:56,949
Get home safely.

938
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,150
Why are you only sending me away?

939
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:01,989
Gosh.

940
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,520
Mr. Han. I called a chauffeur. Do you want a ride home?

941
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:08,159
It's okay.

942
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,400
I didn't drink much.

943
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,929
Also, I'm going to go back to the office.

944
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,270
Again?

945
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,170
We won. Why don't you look happy?

946
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,610
I'm not sure.

947
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,009
I did win, right?

948
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:33,119
First cases always feel weird, whether you win or lose.

949
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,319
You'll be able to see the cases more clearly going forward,

950
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:40,089
so don't try to be perfect on your first case.

951
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,159
Yes, sir.

952
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:46,500
Also, Ms. Cha doesn't really show it,

953
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,799
but I'm sure she's proud of you.

954
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,500
Let's keep winning.

955
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:55,839
Thank you.

956
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,309
I'll get going first.

957
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,580
Goodnight.

958
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:04,319
Bye.

959
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,480
(Vacant)

960
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,719
Hello, everyone.

961
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,190
"Moon Ji Ae's Every Day." This is Moon Ji Ae.

962
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:17,400
If I call this person the nation's divorce attorney,

963
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,029
would anyone disagree?

964
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,468
Attorney Cha Eun Kyung is here with us today.

965
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:24,270
Hello, I'm your attorney, Cha Eun Kyung.

966
00:58:24,339 --> 00:58:27,309
Even if the attorneys do their best,

967
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,610
they don't always win.

968
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,109
Sometimes you must be afraid of the result.

969
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,609
You might get blamed.

970
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,448
- My goodness. She doesn't care... - You're right.

971
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:37,019
about that at all.

972
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,049
So you don't need to worry.

973
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,690
If I fight like I'm fighting for myself,

974
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:45,290
I reach the result I want in the end.

975
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,289
You only deal with people who get divorced,

976
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:51,900
but how do you manage to keep your family congenial?

977
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,199
You're amazing in many ways.

978
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:57,940
My family is my highest priority.

979
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,638
Perhaps that's how I understand...

980
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,310
those people who had to make that decision...

981
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,679
and love this job.

982
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,349
- Yes, no wonder you became... - Respect.

983
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,650
the nation's divorce attorney.

984
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,779
I know this from experience,

985
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,690
but when you work, your family often comes second in priority.

986
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,229
- Thank you. - Thank you.

987
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,259
("Moon Ji Ae's Every Day")

988
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:29,769
What makes you call me at this hour?

989
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:30,770
Ms. Cha.

990
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:32,669
I'm calling you because you left the record...

991
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,739
for trial tomorrow morning.

992
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,639
Oh, did I?

993
00:59:36,009 --> 00:59:37,839
Can you ask someone to bring it to my house?

994
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,739
Everyone went home after dinner.

995
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:42,380
I also have a plan. I'm sorry.

996
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,219
It's okay. I'll go get it.

997
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,750
Congratulations on your first win.

998
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,968
(Verdict)

999
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:37,139
Judgment one.

1000
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,000
Dismiss the plaintiff's claim.

1001
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,710
We lost.

1002
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:45,008
Judgment two. The plaintiff is...

1003
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:47,909
I have to pay for that prick's attorney too.

1004
01:00:49,009 --> 01:00:50,480
subjected to pay for the lawsuit.

1005
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:59,158
Based on the text messages Defendants 1 and 2 shared...

1006
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,928
- the plaintiff submitted, - She left.

1007
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:02,059
Look at you.

1008
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,429
it's hard to tell the defendants had an affair.

1009
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:09,900
Also,

1010
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:13,610
the plaintiff and Defendant One's son...

1011
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,080
supports Defendant One's stance.

1012
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,009
Considering the fact...

1013
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:22,448
that the plaintiff and Defendant One have...

1014
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:25,319
a possibility of recovering their love and trust,

1015
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:28,089
it is hard to tell...

1016
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:32,690
their marriage is ruined enough to be restored.

1017

(I, Attorney Han Yu Ri...)

1019
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,839
Oh, right. Mr. Han.

1020
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,109
There's this awesome place on the 16th floor.

1021
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,678
It's called the relaxing room.

1022
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:29,749
If you go lie down there when you're tired while working overtime,

1023
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,049
you'll pass out right away.

1024

(Relaxing Room)

1026
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,219
We had a doctor in this office?

1027
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,920
Didn't you know? He's Ms. Cha's husband.

1028
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:50,489
For medical advice.

1029
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:53,730
He's here on time.

1030
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,989
That's him.

1031
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:56,529
He's Ms. Cha's husband.

1032
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,500
His office is on the 16th floor.

1033
01:04:58,830 --> 01:04:59,860
I see.

1034
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:55,889
Ms. Han?

1035
01:05:58,389 --> 01:05:59,389
What?

1036
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,089
(Good Partner)

1037
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,119
I thought she was working overtime, but she was writing her resignation.

1038
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:06,289
If she insists on leaving, soothe her.

1039
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,259
Tell Ms. Han Yu Ri to come to my office.

1040
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:10,229
What would you do?

1041
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,060
Me? I'd tell right away.

1042
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,069
Maybe it's best not to know.

1043
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:15,929
Are you coming to the hotel?

1044
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,440
You were with Ms. Cha, right?

1045
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,569
Your husband.
