(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

12
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:02,959
- Hello? - Hi.

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,899
Ms. Cha?

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,669
I think you need to come to my house now.

15
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,509
It's just my intuition.

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,039
I think Chun Hwan Seo...

17
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:18,350
is going to get into trouble.

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,190
Ms. Cha.

19
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,630
Is something wrong?

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Han Yu Ri.

21
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,509
- Ms. Cha, wait. - Ms. Han, stay here.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,739
I'll go with you.

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,409
I can't let you go alone.

24
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,610
He's the son of the foundation the whole country knows.

25
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,110
He wouldn't do anything rash.

26
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,418
Just in case,

27
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,648
if you don't hear from me in ten, call the police.

28
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,118
- Okay? - Still...

29
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,749
If you tell the police that I'm inside,

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,118
it'll make the headline and ruin our firm's reputation.

31
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,190
Tell them it's domestic violence, and they must come.

32
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,190
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,470
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,009
Come here.

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,979
You can never get away from me.

36
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,880
You think I'm funny?

37
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,719
It looks like you haven't learned your lesson yet.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,988
- Let me teach you a lesson today. - Honey...

39
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,818
- Come here. - Honey...

40
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,819
Honey...

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,600
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

42
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,169
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, are you home?

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,699
Ms. Yoo Ji Young?

44
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,870
Hi. You're here.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,310
Where's Ms. Yoo?

46
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:04,989
Ms. Yoo.

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,758
Ms. Yoo, can you hear me?

48
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,460
Ms. Yoo, wake up.

49
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,239
Ms. Yoo.

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Please...

51
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:25,710
help me.

52
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,609
Wait.

53
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,479
I beat her enough to kill her, but she's not dead.

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Darn it.

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,160
You piece of...

56
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,609
You really killed her.

57
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,910
Watch your mouth. Who killed whom?

58
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,079
She fell down and dropped dead.

59
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,489
She's driving me nuts.

60
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:15,419
How much will it cost...

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,130
for you to get me a suspended sentence?

62
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,760
You don't deserve a suspended sentence.

63
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,530
You deserve a life sentence.

64
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,470
You killed her.

65
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,400
A woman is dead. She's dead!

66
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,910
If that's what my attorney thinks,

67
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,510
you're no longer my attorney.

68
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,080
You're just a mere witness that doesn't need to stay alive.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,450
I'll do the same...

70
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,919
to your daughter too.

71
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,059
(Attorney Han Yu Ri)

72
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,369
The person you reached is unavailable.

73
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,368
If you don't hear from me in ten, call the police.

74
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,410
Okay?

75
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,239
Tell them it's domestic violence, and they must come.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Darn.

77
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
Darn it.

78
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Darn it!

79
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,510
Where did she go?

80
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:21,780
Where is she?

81
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,530
Darn.

82
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,779
(Police)

83
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,850
Darn it.

84
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,470
Hello, Father.

85
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,470
We have something to deal with.

86
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,970
Don't touch me. I'll go on my own.

87
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,450
I'll kill you soon too.

88
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,890
Okay?

89
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,010
(Episode 13)

90
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,379
If that's what my attorney thinks,

91
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,479
you're no longer my attorney.

92
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,649
You're just a mere witness that doesn't need to stay alive.

93
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,920
Who said you could be here without my permission?

94
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,399
I'll do the same...

95
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,399
to your daughter too.

96
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,769
(Police)

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,109
(Police)

98
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,379
What?

99
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,300
(Police)

100
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,700
- Ms. Cha, are you okay? - Ms. Han, are you okay?

101
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,570
Yes.

102
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,109
Where are you?

103
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm...

104
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,979
at the police station. Where are you?

105
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,479
I'm home.

106
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,820
Like you said,

107
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,029
I called the police ten minutes later.

108
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,600
Chun Hwan Seo was arrested red-handed.

109
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,029
Good job.

110
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,930
Good job. You did well.

111
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,369
Ms. Han Yu Ri?

112
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,440
Ms. Cha, they want to ask me questions.

113
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,550
I'll call you later.

114
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:12,249
Okay.

115
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm Attorney Han Yu Ri...

116
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,369
from Law Firm Daejeong.

117
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,409
How did you know about the situation when you reported it?

118
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:44,749
I'm...

119
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,320
Chun Hwan Seo's divorce suit attorney.

120
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,749
I received a call from him, and when I got there,

121
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,690
the door was open.

122
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,129
There were signs of a brawl, so I called the police.

123
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,430
Did you go to Chun Hwan Seo's house alone?

124
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,669
If you tell the police that I'm inside,

125
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,878
it'll make the headline and ruin our firm's reputation.

126
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,080
Tell them it's domestic violence, and they must come.

127
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,279
Yes.

128
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,580
Please...

129
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,749
help me.

130
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,109
I'll do the same...

131
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,979
to your daughter too.

132
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:07,820
(Case 13: Resolution)

133
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,259
(Dokseo Police Station)

134
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,310
I'll kill you soon too.

135
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Ms. Han.

136
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,529
Are you okay?

137
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,998
Sorry to call you late at night.

138
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,430
- Not at all. - I thought...

139
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,498
I should tell you immediately.

140
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,570
No need to apologize.

141
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:01,639
You don't have to say that.

142
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:02,899
Is...

143
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,139
Eun Kyung home safe?

144
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,879
Yes, I think so.

145
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,909
Well...

146
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,080
I didn't really get to hear...

147
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,479
what actually happened in detail,

148
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,190
but I think...

149
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,590
I think there was some kind of...

150
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,690
a scuffle between Mr. Chun...

151
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,460
- It's okay. - and Ms. Cha.

152
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,129
Okay.

153
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,269
You must have been scared too.

154
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,440
Let's go. I'll drop you off.

155
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Okay.

156
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,810
Thank you.

157
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,050
The law firm will sort out the rest.

158
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,519
Don't worry about anything. Just get some rest. I'll call you.

159
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,290
Okay. I will.

160
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,050
- Go inside. - Okay.

161
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,570
Hello, sir.

162
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,139
Did you know my son was arrested?

163
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,908
I was informed.

164
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,180
Ms. Han made the report. Were you informed about that too?

165
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:20,409
Yes.

166
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,720
- Please calm down. - How do you expect me to calm down?

167
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,290
What kind of attorney would report her client to the police?

168
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,019
How do you call yourselves attorneys?

169
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,028
Unfortunately, we won't be able...

170
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,700
to represent your son regarding this criminal case.

171
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,729
I wasn't going to hire your firm!

172
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,769
I'll make sure you guys pay for this!

173
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,608
(Eun Kyung)

174
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,450
Eun Kyung. Are you hurt?

175
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,649
The firm will take care of it from here.

176
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,420
Don't come to work. Just get some rest.

177
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,850
I'll contact you again.

178

(Daejeong)

181
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,550
Yes. I understand.

182
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm so sorry, Director Chun.

183
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Did you want to see me?

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,639
You told him you wouldn't represent his son's criminal case.

185
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
It's a murder case.

186
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,468
Even if he asked us to take it, we mustn't take it.

187
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,009
Do you think this is a simple matter...

188

- of taking his criminal case? - A woman is dead.

00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,349
It hasn't been even 24 hours since Ms. Yoo's death.

Do you think her death matters right now?

191
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,388
What if he hires another firm to represent Chun Foundation...

192
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,218
for their medical and construction-related cases?

193
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,060
Don't you know that it will damage the firm?

194
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,290
I'll come up with a contingency plan.

you're no longer my attorney.

199

You're just a mere witness that doesn't need to stay alive.

200
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,628
I'll do the same...

What was she doing at the murder scene?

205
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:19,990
Could she be an accomplice?

Gosh. These rich people call their attorneys before they kill.

Gosh. That's where all dirty attorneys work, I guess.

209
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,300
She's an attorney? So she represents a murderer?

210
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,340
Why was she at the murder scene?

First of all, Korea's biggest hospital,

238

239
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,438
- of Chun Medical Foundation. - Seriously?

Prosecution, state your charge.

292

The defendant was the victim's husband.

293

On June 4, 2024,

294
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,429
the victim filed for divorce. Due to her decision to file for divorce,

295
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,000
they fought often.

296
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,669
The victim had left home. But once she returned home,

297
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,340
they began to fight.

298
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,310
The enraged defendant pushed down the victim on the floor,

299
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,280
climbed on top of the victim,

300
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,280
and punched the victim in the face and head dozens of times.

301
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,319
The defendant's assault...

302
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,648
led to a subdural hemorrhage...

303
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,019
in the left side of the victim's brain.

304
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,520
This injury led to the victim's death.

305
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:20,859
Do you plead guilty to the charge?

306
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,138
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,299
(Defendant)

308
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,810
I'm sorry.

309
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,509
Yes, Your Honor. He pleads guilty...

310
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,108
to the assault charge.

311
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,109
However, to prove that he was mentally unstable,

312
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,208
we have submitted...

313
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,750
the defendant's treatment records from a psychiatrist.

314
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,718
As the defendant doesn't have any prior record,

315
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,850
I ask that you sentence him to a probational period.

316
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,760
You murderer!

317
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,899
I didn't know everything my daughter said was true.

318
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,439
If I were to side with her, I was worried she'd get a divorce.

319
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,909
So I didn't pay attention to what I saw or what she told me!

320
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:09,240
Had I known you were going to beat her to death that night,

321
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,409
I would've let her get a divorce. Getting a divorce was better...

322
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,349
than handing over my precious daughter to a murderer!

323
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,149

325
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,219
I'm the reason you died.

326
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,159
I killed my own daughter.

327
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,859
Oh, no.

328

- Are you all right? - Goodness.

329
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,030
Did she pass out?

330
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:35,669
- Are you all right? - Ma'am.

331
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
Please...

332
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,550
help me.

333
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:57,889
Had I gotten there faster,

334
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,990
- she would've lived. - Don't blame yourself.

335
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:03,530
Did you see his face?

336
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,869
Chun Hwan Seo was relieved, not anxious.

337
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,300
I saw it.

338
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,109
I think he had already made up his mind to kill Ms. Yoo.

339
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,510
Something has gone wrong.

340
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,509
He should have been indicted for murder.

341
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,310
It seemed to prove the intent for murder,

342
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,379
they didn't have enough evidence.

343
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,089
What? Why would you report it?

344
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,219
You weren't the eyewitness.

345
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:30,759
He was indicted with manslaughter because they thought...

346
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,459
it was without malice aforethought.

347
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,729
If I were to make a statement...

348
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,698
about his violent nature which I observed...

349
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:39,000
No. Ms. Han. Think rationally about this.

350
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,369
Do you think that would work?

351
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:42,570
This isn't a drama. This is the reality.

352
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,209
What if he tries to take revenge on you after he gets released?

353
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,770
This might put you in danger too.

354
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:50,179
I...

355
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,480
Please turn off the water!

356
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,820
If I can't get divorced this time,

357
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,320
I think this marriage will only end when I die, arbitrator.

358
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,959
I want to reveal the truth about the late victim, Yoo.

359
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,800
It's just not fair.

360
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,399
Ms. Han.

361
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,740
I don't want you to be in danger anymore.

362
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,379
Please?

363
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:35,619
(My daughter)

364
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,330

Where are you?

379
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,359
I told you I was going to a coin karaoke with my friends.

380
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,300
But why didn't you answer your phone? I was worried about you.

381
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,169
I didn't hear it because of the music.

382
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:59,669
What's wrong?

383
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,379
Jae Hui. I...

384
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,879
I'll go to you.

385
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,119
Send me the address right now. Okay?

386
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,490

387
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,159
Did anyone try to follow you today?

388
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,069
Well, if people you don't recognize want you to come with them,

389
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,669
you can't follow them. Okay?

390
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,070
Mom, are you okay?

391
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,869
Mom, you're acting really strange.

392
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,209
Yes.

393
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,550
- Nothing is wrong. - As if.

394
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,850
No. Well,

395
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,350
I...

396
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,290
Mom, you were always right.

397
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,730
You know that, right?

398
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,100
Everything will turn out well.

399
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:18,179
I'm in front of the Law Firm Daejeong building.

400
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,319
It recently came into light that an attorney...

401
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,320
from Law Firm Daejeong was an eyewitness to the murder...

402
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,628
committed by Chun Medical Foundation's Chairman,

403
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:27,929
Chun Hwan Seo, with the victim being his wife.

404
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,428
The public is speculating if there's a possible partnership...

405
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,899
between the foundation and the law firm.

406
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,330
Hello, everyone.

407
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,698
As a continuation of our last episode,

408
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,840
we'll cover more about Law Firm Daejeong today.

409
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,069
The MOU was signed right before...

410
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,080
Daejeong took on Chun Hwan Seo's divorce case.

411
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,810
I find that very surprising and suspicious.

412
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,378
Could they have been planning since then to do damage control?

413
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:51,718
That's what I think.

414
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,350
Here's my guess.

415
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,158
The two organizations had their own big picture...

416
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,989
which got messed up because of the other.

417
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,128
Are you seeing the comments?

418
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:02,198
Isn't this just too harsh?

419
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,330
- I know, right? - It's practically a fact now.

420
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,999
What should they do?

421
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,429
It's infuriating.

(They signed the MOU to hire a cleanup crew.)

425
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,329
If that's what my attorney thinks,

426
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,169
you're just a mere witness that doesn't need to stay alive.

427
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,600
I'll do the same...

428
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,270
to your daughter too.

438
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,699
She keeps wanting to report him to the police.

439
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,770
I'm worried, to be honest.

440
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,369
She's being hounded online already when she did nothing wrong.

441
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,840
If she gets in deeper...

442
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,740
I'm worried she might get in real danger.

443

I'll prepare a rebuttal.

458

What on earth...

459
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,789
were our attorneys doing at a murder scene?

460
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,730
They acknowledged Chun's violent tendency...

461
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,800
and went over to separate him from his wife.

462
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,030
That's where the murder took place.

463
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,699

465

Ms. Yoo didn't have an attorney.

466

467

468
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:09,350

I agree.

470
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,150
The MOU didn't cover handling divorce cases.

471
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,119
It was a mistake to represent Chun Hwan Seo.

481
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,489

548
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,690
What happened?

549
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,130
Why were you called as a witness?

550
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,860
I reported him to the police.

551
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,500
I'm the one who witnessed the scene.

552
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,310
Everything you worked for, your career at Daejeong.

553
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:01,969
What if it all crumbles?

554
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,509
If it's the time it crumbled,

555
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,250
I should let it.

556
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,920
I should have long ago.

557
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,039
The attorney who represented Chun Hwan Seo,

558
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,039
son of Chun Medical Foundation's director,

559
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,909
who's on trial for murdering his wife...

560
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,710
in the divorce trial turned out to be the famous Cha Eun Kyung.

561
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,479
Cha was selected...

562
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,019
to attend the trial as a witness.

563
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,619
The focus is what she'll say on the witness stand.

564
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,119
What on earth?

565
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:51,888
- What's this? - "I knew it."

566
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,359
"Cha Eun Kyung defended a murderer."

567
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,330
"Gosh, what a scary woman."

568
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,629
Look at this comment.

569
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,169
"I had a bad feeling about Cha Eun Kyung."

570
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,169
"She's a psychopath."

571
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,909
"She's telling the world what her client told her."

572
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,210
"She's a trashy attorney?"

573
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:08,710
How dare they say this?

574
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:11,439
We should report them all...

575
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,879
- and teach them a lesson. - Exactly.

576
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
- Scroll down. - This one?

577
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,118
- Screenshot it. - This comment?

578
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,150
- This one. - Hang on.

00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:20,190
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

580
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,520
Ms. Han. Did you read the comments?

581
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,588
(She's an expert traitor lawyer.)

582
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:29,199
"A national betrayer."

583
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,569
People...

584
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,069
really are just too cruel.

585
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,399
They don't see what Ms. Cha's trying to do...

586
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,009
to help Ms. Yoo.

587
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,709
They're just fixated...

588
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,710
on the fact that she was his divorce attorney.

589
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,080
I know.

590
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,009
Ms. Cha betrayed just one person, and that's Chun Hwan Seo.

591
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,480
They don't know anything.

592
00:40:55,219 --> 00:41:00,089
She won't be able to keep her job here, will she?

593
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,799
Obviously. The managing partner won't let her.

594
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,169
She wants to tell the world what her client...

595
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,600
told her in confidence.

596
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,110
Existing clients won't trust Daejeong anymore.

597
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,270
It's possible...

598
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,110
we won't get any new cases.

599
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,219
(The 3rd hearing)

600
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,360
(Defendant)

601
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,230
We'll question the witness now.

602
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,770
(Witness)

603
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,239
(Defendant)

604
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,449
Witness.

605
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,379
People like attorneys and doctors who learn facts...

606
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,520
as part of their services are allowed to refuse to testify.

607
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:01,819
Will you give up your right to do so and testify?

608
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,988
Yes. The proviso clause...

609
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,560
of Article 149 of the Code of Criminal Procedure...

610
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:09,298
states one can do so to benefit the public interest.

611
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:11,659
I give up my right to remain silent and will testify.

612
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,868
(Defendant)

613
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:15,639
Witness. How do you know the defendant?

614
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,838
(Defendant)

615
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,068
(Witness)

616
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:23,779
I represented the defendant in his divorce trial,

617
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,850
and I'm also the first witness to arrive at the scene of the crime.

618
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,790
Explain the situation when you first arrived.

619
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,230
When I reached the scene after a call from the defendant...

620
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:43,829
- Ms. Yoo? - The victim Yoo Ji Young...

621
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,830
Please...

622
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,830
help me.

623
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:50,869
was laboring to take her final breaths.

624
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,639
The moment I tried to call for help,

625
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,150
the defendant snatched my phone and tossed it.

626
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:01,949
At that moment...

627
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,290
I witnessed Ms. Yoo Ji Young die.

628
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,989
So there was time to take measures to save the victim,

629
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:14,730
but the defendant stopped you?

630
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,730
Yes. She was definitely still alive.

631
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,969
The defendant looked down at the victim and said...

632
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,670
I beat her enough to kill her, but she's not dead.

633
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,469
"She's not dead yet."

634
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:29,610
That's what he said.

635
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,839
No. That's a lie.

636
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,409
The defendant called me to the scene,

637
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,449
thinking the victim had died.

638
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,290
The defendant had said...

639
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,589
I'm going to kill her.

640
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:46,960
things to me that alluded he would kill the victim.

641
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,699
I went to the scene with a pen-shaped recorder.

642
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,170
(Defendant)

643
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,540
I beat her enough to kill her, but she's not dead.

644
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,449
The victim...

645
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,850
ended up dying.

646
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:16,989
Yes.

647
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,089
During the divorce proceedings...

648
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,960
If I can't get divorced this time,

649
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,369
I think this marriage will only end when I die, arbitrator.

650
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:31,270
The victim said it would only end with her death,

651
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,509
and that came to be.

652
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,310
(Defendant)

653
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:49,489
Hey!

654
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,219
My son is a murderer?

655
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,029
How dare you lie in court?

656
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,859
You represented my son.

657
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,259
How could you betray him?

658
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,900
- Please stop. - Why should I stop?

659
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,270
What? You'll annul the MOU?

660
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:06,139
Are you cutting ties to save your skin?

661
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,339
I'll come after you and your father, okay?

662
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,080
Just as you had nothing to do with your son's crimes,

663
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,880
my actions have nothing to do with my father.

664
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:20,150
I'm the managing partner of Daejeong now.

665
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,089
Come after just me.

666
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,859
Do you know how much I lost for doing business with you?

667
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,600
How we make up for our own losses is up to us.

668
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,270

that we're collectively responsible for her death.

On top of that, her divorce was denied in court...

680
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,230
only because she had trouble gathering the necessary evidence.

681

682
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:40,770
that they all led to her being stuck in an abusive marriage?

683
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,569

You have a tendency to carry all of the weight by yourself.

728
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:28,440
That has to stop.

729
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Here.

730
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,429
Hey.

731
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:53,799
I believed...

732
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,639
that I had been loyal to the firm all these years.

733
00:48:58,569 --> 00:48:59,969
But it wasn't for the firm.

734
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,110
It was for me.

735
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,310
I did it all for me.

736
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:11,350
So why have I been under the impression...

737
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,449
that I've been sacrificing my life for the firm and my family?

738
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,190
I'm sure you know...

739
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,130
you haven't been yourself lately.

740
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,259
What does "being myself" look like?

741
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:26,469
Right there. That tone.

742
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,400
That's the Cha Eun Kyung I know.

743
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,139
Gosh.

744
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,179
I should've said this sooner,

745
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,219
but I approve of our managing partner Jung Woo Jin.

746
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,020
Actually, I approved the second I heard it.

747
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,360
Write the second season of Law Firm Daejeong.

748
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,829
Not Oh Dae Gyu's Daejeong,

749
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,900
but as the new Daejeong led by Jung Woo Jin.

750
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,529
Can you please read this?

751
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:36,198
- Over here! - Attorney Picket,

752
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,238
- Han Yu Ri. - Please read this.

753
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:39,138
- Please read this. - Please take a look.

754
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:41,309
- You've got to be kidding me. - We might be responsible too.

755
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,979
- Unbelievable, right? - What is wrong with her?

756
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,509
- I'm mortified. - See what I mean?

757
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,980
She's a lot like someone I know.

758
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:57,618
That can be wrapped up by Team Three.

759
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:58,619
- Sure. - Got it.

760
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,059
- That'll end the meeting, then. - Sure thing.

761
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,189
- Good job, guys. - Great work.

762
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,659
- Thanks. - Good work.

763
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,529
Great work.

764
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:10,000
Mr. Jung.

765
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,369
We should watch the news.

766
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,908
The fact that Law Firm Daejeong...

767
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:23,020
immediately withdrew its position...

768
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,879
as Chun Hwan Seo's divorce attorney...

769
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,020
after discovering his abusive nature...

770
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,750
has garnered the attention of the public.

771
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,259
Also, Attorney Cha Eun Kyung was said to personally speak...

772
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,290
to the prosecution in favor of the late Ms. Yoo Ji Young.

773
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,129
Experts believe that the information...

774
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,729
provided by Ms. Cha somewhat influenced the prosecution...

775
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,170
to revise the charges from involuntary manslaughter to murder.

776
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,539
The public is displaying more interest...

777
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,040
as it is unusual for charges to be revised during a trial...

778
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:53,508
and has been showing heated support...

779
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:55,350
for Ms. Cha's courageous act.

780
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:58,548
Attorney Cha Eun Kyung has been stirring up controversy.

781
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,690
Could you please comment on that?

782
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:02,850
Ms. Cha...

783
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,219
risked her own career...

784
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,359
by providing the prosecution...

785
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,130
with necessary information that could revise the charges.

786
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:12,400
If she hadn't informed the prosecution,

787
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,199
the defendant would've received a lesser sentence...

788
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:18,869
only for involuntary manslaughter rather than murder.

789
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,569
Attorney Cha Eun Kyung...

790
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,178
is more courageous...

791
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,379
(Han Yu Ri, Divorce Attorney)

792
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,480
than anyone I know.

793
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:31,619
There is a keen interest on whether Mr. Chun...

794
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,388
could be charged with murder and how the Supreme Court...

795
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,020
- will eventually rule. - Unbelievable.

796
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,860
- Tell me about it. - Thank you, I'm Park Yu Na.

797
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:41,259
- What a relief. - That could've been way worse.

798
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,799
(- I feel bad for doubting them. - You're the best. I'm a fan!)

799
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,569
Ms. Cha, did you read the news?

800
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,409
It's such a relief.

801
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,409
Public sentiment is now supportive rather than hostile.

802
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:05,650
It should've been this way ages ago.

803
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,250
Thanks, Yu Ri.

804
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,559
I told you to stay out of it,

805
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,299
but you couldn't help yourself.

806
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,969
I wanted...

807
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:25,739
to be a good partner you could rely on.

808
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,509
You're a great partner, Yu Ri.

809
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,190
Thank you.

810
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,919
By the way, the camera loved you.

811
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,960
How about a regular stint on air?

812
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,960
I'll make introductions.

813
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:49,798
No, I don't think I can do it.

814
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,230
As if. You're a natural.

815
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,069
- Aren't you? - I'm not.

816
00:53:57,699 --> 00:53:59,770
Tomorrow, we'll know how the court decides...

817
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,210
in Chun Hwan Seo's case.

818
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,040
You all did great work in your respective places.

819
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:10,520
We're gathered here today as per Ms. Cha's request.

820
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,719
Is there something you want to say to us?

821
00:54:16,759 --> 00:54:18,219
The two of you...

822
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,589
will be taking on cases by yourselves from now on.

823
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,230
That's what I wanted to say.

824
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:25,429
- Sorry? - Sorry?

825
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,270
Your paperwork still needs to be reviewed,

826
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:28,729
but we'll no longer...

827
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,139
go with you to court or discuss defense strategies.

828
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,639
It's about time you flew solo.

829
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:38,210
That means we're actual attorneys now.

830
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:40,980
I'll do my best.

831
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,819
- Sure. - Nice!

832
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,949
(The ruling)

833
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:51,619
The defendant...

834
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,790
will be sentenced...

835
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:56,929
to 15 years in prison.

836
00:54:57,759 --> 00:54:59,658
- Look here, Judge. - What?

837
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:01,269
Who paid you to rule against me?

838
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,270
Let go of me, you punks.

839
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:05,838
How can you call yourself human when you're sending...

840
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,039
an innocent man to prison?

841
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,270
Let go of me. How much will it cost?

842
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,409
I'll pay you, so let's have a do-over.

843
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,380
How much did you each receive?

844
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,778
Hey! Let go.

845
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,309
Let go of me.

846
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,479
I get it, so let go.

847
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,879
I... Look here, Judge.

848
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,549
- That's enough. - Judge!

849
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,420
What did I even do? I didn't kill anyone.

850
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:25,388
I'll pay you just as much.

851
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,889
I can't accept this.

852
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:28,790
I won't accept it.

853
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,439
It's Cha Eun Kyung.

854
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,568
- Here she comes. - Over there.

855
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:40,769
- Here she is. - Ms. Cha!

856
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,008
Ms. Cha,

857
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,068
you were the attorney...

858
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:44,710
representing Chun Hwan Seo in his divorce case.

859
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,138
Why did you waive your rights...

860
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:48,710
and testify against your own client?

861
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,619
I wanted the deceased to at least have some closure,

862
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,119
and I believed it was my civic duty to speak up.

863
00:55:55,449 --> 00:55:57,318
That is because I know better than anyone...

864
00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:00,560
about the many victims who suffer from domestic violence.

865
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:03,460
Do you have any words for the victims of domestic abuse?

866
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:06,100
Even as we speak, somebody in this world...

867
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:08,830
is losing the will to live due to domestic abuse.

868
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,199
Family members should be our support system,

869
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,110
not predators who oppress us through force.

870
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,139
A family member who oppress us with force...

871
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,080
is no longer family.

872
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,809
Some are criticizing you...

873
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,079
for speaking against him when you were his lawyer.

874
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,718
What are your thoughts on that?

875
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,089
I couldn't care less.

876
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,920
I failed to notice the abuse sooner...

877
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:31,719
and couldn't stop the defendant.

878
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:36,230
All I'm sorry about is the fact that I couldn't save Ms. Yoo.

879
00:56:36,389 --> 00:56:38,698
He received a heavier sentence than what is normally given.

880
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,069
- Is that true? - Yes.

881
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:43,838
The law is there to punish those who commit crimes...

882
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,569
and rarely has the ability to prevent crime itself.

883
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,139
However, the court's ruling today...

884
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,278
will serve not only as a punishment...

885
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:53,009
but as a social function that will prevent crime.

886
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,480
For that, I show my gratitude and respect to the judicial branch.

887
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,850
Could you share some last words about this case?

888
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,170
The attorneys and staff at Law Firm Daejeong...

889
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,479
gave it their all...

890
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,119
to speak up for the late Ms. Yoo the best that they could.

891
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:34,549
We mourn the victim who met an untimely death.

892
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,659
May she rest in peace.

893
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,798
- Is that all? - What is your take...

894
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,229
- on the heavier sentence? - Ms. Cha!

895
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,868
What was the crucial factor in this case?

896
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:49,069
- Gosh. - Nice.

897
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:51,869
- That was killing me. - What a relief.

898
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:54,008
- It's done. - This is great.

899
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:55,610
Yu Ri, you're incredible.

900
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,809
- This is great news. - Good work.

901
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,379
- Great work, guys. - You too.

902
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,249
- Good work, everyone. - You did great.

903
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,150
- You did a great job. - Thanks.

904
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,920
- You did great. - What a relief.

905
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,279
That was satisfying.

906
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,520
- I can't believe it. - This is incredible.

907
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,560
Good work, everyone.

908
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,159
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

909
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:24,369
You did great.

910
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,110
And thank you.

911
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,549
No one had it rougher than you did, Ms. Cha.

912
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:35,850
What you did was courageous.

913
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:43,119
And I'm thinking of my second courageous act.

914
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,460
What is it? Do tell.

915
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,230
- Together... - I'm leaving.

916
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,199
You're leaving?

917
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,670
Leaving from what?

918
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:05,139
I'll leave Daejeong,

919
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,350
and you'll stand alone out from under my wing.

920
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,599
(Good Partner)

921
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,138
What kind of a place...

922
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:09,939
is Cha Eun Kyung's Spring Again?

923
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,138
A place that will help clients...

924
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:13,480
regain their springs as soon as possible.

925
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,810
Wire money into my commissary account,

926
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,619
and I'll sign the contract the next time you're here.

927
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,219
I'm the one refusing.

928
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,020
I couldn't book any clients and wasted my time all day.

929
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,119
I won't even be able to pay the rent at this rate.

930
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,130
Maybe you'd like to pay her a visit.

931
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:29,929
She's the best attorney I know.

932
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,000
Place your complete trust in me.
