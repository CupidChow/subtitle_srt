6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,660
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,350
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,070
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,230
Did he ever get a medical diagnosis?

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,250
No, he needs to acknowledge there's a problem in order to fix it,

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,740
but he has no intention to do that.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,460
Don't worry, and speak comfortably.

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,570
Oh... You see...

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,620
I think a male attorney would be better.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,700
Our job requires us to fight, so many people prefer male attorneys.

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,340
But we use the law and logic to fight, not strength-

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,360
No, no. That's not what I meant.

18
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,050
I think it's more like dysfunction.

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:47,220
I guess you can say he doesn't even try to bump bodies.

20
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,090
You're saying it's erectile dysfunction, right?

21
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,670
Yes, thank you.

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,780
My wife...

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,080
wants to do it too often. I can't take it.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,330
 - We always clashed because of it,  
- But it's the weekend!

25
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,010
 but we finally reached the breaking point this past weekend. 

26
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,220
Whoa, seriously.

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,930
Hey, I didn't want to say this to hurt your ego,

28
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,060
but don't blame me when it's your problem.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,780
What did you want to say? Just say it!

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,680
Since when did you care about my ego? Just spit it out!

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,420
You need medical treatment!

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,230
Your body isn't in your 30s but 80s—

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,510
No, even an 80-year-old grandpa would be better than this!

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,950
You need medical attention. You're a sex addict!

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,360
Are you calling me a mental patient?

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,060
What are you saying, you eunuch?

37
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,930
Go visit a urologist!

38
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,440
You go visit a mental hospital, you addict!

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,960
Please submit a complaint.

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,440
You don't even have a child...

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,040
Why don't we end this with a settlement instead of going to trial?

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,990
No. I'll take him to the judge...

43
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,230
I'll tell the judge how unfair this is for me.

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,560
I can't end it like this when I have so much to say.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,890
He doesn't even acknowledge his fault.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,280
I feel too cheated to simply give him a divorce.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,880
Please submit a complaint.

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,190
 Please submit it today. 

49
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,630
I'm dumping him first.

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,280
Please submit mine first.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,660
 Or else, she'll think I still have lingering feelings. 

52
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,790
 Submit 

53
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,650
 Registration date and time: 8-5-24 17:29 / 8-5-24 17:28

 Case 15: Sincerity or Truth 

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,060
Another bottle of soju, ma'am!
  Episode 15 

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,330
So, did you figure out your dilemmas from last time?

57
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,330
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
- Attorney Jeon, by chance... 
- Yes.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,280
- Is this because of Attorney Han? 
- Sorry?

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,880
You know how I've been peering into human relationships for the past 15 years?

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,400
There are things that stand out to me.

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,760
- I do have feelings for Attorney Han. 
- Okay.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,640
But she isn't the reason for my dilemma.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,440
I just have a lot on my mind about me, Attorney Jeon Eun Ho's future.

65
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,050
- I'm sorry. 
- Don't keep apologizing.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,430
Attorney Jeon, how about using your personal time off for a few days?

67
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,300
It's best to rest when things seem complicated.

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,360
Commas are necessary for you to put a period at the end properly.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,010
Yes, thank you.

70
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,790
Attorney Cha.

71
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,500
- When did you get here?
 - I knocked, but you didn't hear me.

72
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,630
Please buy me dinner.

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,380
You buy me dinner.

74
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,920
Do I still earn more than you?

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Yes.

76
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,650
Let's go.

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,300
What's up today? You're not eating with Attorney Jeon.

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,280
You used to be two peas in a pod, but not lately.

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,980
I've been a bit busy.

80
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,500
It must be nice to be busy! I'm jealous.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,470
Come on, your caseload should be increasing right about now.

82
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,650
You're exaggerating, aren't you?

83
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,380
I've been thinking about this.

84
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,730
There's a critical reason why divorce attorney offices

85
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,210
have difficulty with sales.

86
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,960
They lack the two most important things in sales.

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,590
Two things? What are they?

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,920
Referrals and returning customers.

89
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,800
"I got a divorce with them, and they were great. You try them, too."

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,120
No one ever says that.

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,550
And it's rare for people to get two or three divorces.

92
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,890
You're right.

93
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,180
There really aren't any referrals or returning customers.

94
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,340
Which is why it was difficult to increase my caseload.

95
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,160
This means you should continue to treat me in the future.

96
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
- Here.
 - Thank you.

97
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,370
It would be my pleasure.

98
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,170
Did this ever happen to you?

99
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,300
Today, my last client suddenly asked me to submit a complaint within the hour.

100
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,790
I didn't even have time to breathe.

101
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,460
That happened to me, too.

102
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,190
On top of their fighting,

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,930
they're even battling about who files for divorce first.

104
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,210
I guess clients prefer to be called the "plaintiff" rather than the "defendant."

105
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,810
I guess so.

106
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,720
It must feel unfair to be called the defendant when they've done nothing wrong.

107
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,300
The battle for the title of "plaintiff" is fierce.

108
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,360
Absolutely fierce, right?

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,570
- Your stew is here. 
- Thank you.

110
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,910
- Enjoy.
 - Thank you.

111
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,910
Attorney Cha, how could I be the defendant?

112
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,150
Did you review the complaint?

113
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,880
The person at fault should be the defendant.

114
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,140
It's utterly unfair that I'm the defendant!

115
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,690
That bastard prepared his earlier than I did, right?

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,600
He's absolutely desperate for a divorce.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,530
Whether it's "plaintiff" or "defendant,"

118
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,390
the nuance won't impact the trial result, so don't worry.

119
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,720
More importantly, did you bring evidence of his rejection of sexual intercourse?

120
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,430
Yes, I found some, fortunately.

121
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,740
I found some in an old phone I restored.

122
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,900
 Oh, hello? 

123
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,080
 Hi, Babe! What are you doing? 

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,610
 It's past work hours. Why aren't you coming home? 

125
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,450
 Oh, I'm still working. I think I'll be late. 

126
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,890
You didn't say you'd be late, so I prepared dinner and was waiting.

127
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,670
 Will you be very late? 

128
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,550
Yeah, don't wait up and go to sleep first.

129
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,030
It's okay. I'll wait.

130
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,950
 - Call me when you're done.  
 - I said I'll be late!

131
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,350
 And... 

132
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,640
I'm really exhausted today.

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,880
How are you always late and exhausted?

134
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't you know that continued refusal of sex is grounds for divorce?

135
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,870
Don't you think you're being too pushy?

136
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,720
Can't we just live without having sex?

137
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,980
 The sound of you taking a shower scares me the most these days. 

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,010
There are over ten files like this one.

139
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,470
Then, it's worth a try.

140
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,520
- Please give me the complaint. 
 - Okay.

141
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,040
 Attorney in charge: Han Yu Ri 

142
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,440
 My last client today suddenly asked me to submit a complaint within the hour. 

143
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,100
 I didn't even have time to breathe. 

144
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,180
 The defendant's sex addiction. 

145
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,710
 The defendant suffers from a sexual addiction 

146
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,870
 where she can't last a day without sex and, thus, requires treatment. 

147
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,190
 Is Han Yu Ri crazy? 

148
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,760
You see, right?

149
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,280
I absolutely could not believe it.

150
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,720
I never asked him to do it every day.

151
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,800
He's just lying to make me out to be a sex addict to end things.

152
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,850
Don't worry.

153
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,930
Unreasonable claims don't last long.

154
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,630
 - Yeah.
 - Where are you? 

155
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,930
 I have to make a sale. 

156
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,230
 Will you be late tonight, too? 

157
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,290
Yeah, I told you things are hectic because of the new product.

158
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,020
I'm hanging up if that's all you had to say.

159
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,800
Hey. Hey!

160
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,910
 Are you tired of my calls now? 

161
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,960
You're aware we're a married couple, right?

162
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,090
 You always come home late these days, so I— 

163
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,820
I'm working right now!

164
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,450
 I'm tired as it is. I don't want to argue with you over this. 

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,580
You're over the line.

166
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,590
Aren't you the one who's over the line?

167
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,210
We did it last night!

168
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,530
 Do you skip eating today since you ate yesterday? 

169
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,970
 - Is that the same thing? 
- It's not! 

170
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,860
 Since we eat three meals a day. 

171
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,190
 You want to do it three times a day? 

172
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,850
 You really are ill. 

173
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,030
 That's enough! 

174
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,250
 Daejeong 

175
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,150
- Yes?
  - Attorney Han? 

176
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,330
 The opposing attorney for Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok's case is on the line. 

177
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,210
 She's asking for the attorney in charge. 

178
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,500
 Should I put her through? 

179
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,730
Sure, put her through.

180
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,880
Hello, I'm Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok's legal representative, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

181
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,530
 Yes, hello! I'm Ms. Lee Seong Hui's legal representative. 

182
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,020
 The party concerned received the complaint. 

183
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,370
We actually filed a complaint on the same day.

184
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,490
Is that right?

185
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,770
I guess ours was processed first.

186
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,370
Yes, I think we can proceed by merging the two cases.

187
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,300
 More importantly, we've confirmed that both intend to divorce. 

188
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,350
I was wondering what you think about reaching a settlement before going to court.

189
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,590
 My client does not want to settle. 

190
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,570
I'll come by tomorrow because there's something I must tell you.

191
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,030
Sorry?

192
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,560
H-H-Here?

193
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,970
 Sure, why not? 

194
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,560
Wow, she's come a long way.

195
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,860
What's her deal?

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,010
It's delicious!

197
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,190
- It's good, right?
 - Yeah.

198
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,780
I thought you might like it here.

199
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,230
I always wanted to bring you here.

200
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,690
How long has it been since we ate together?

201
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,110
Exactly! I love eating with you, Attorney Jeon.

202
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,880
How many weeks has it been?

203
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,910
But I hate to tell you.

204
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,960
I don't think we can eat together for a while, Han Yu Ri.

205
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,380
Huh?

206
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,250
Why all of a sudden?

207
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,810
I used my PTO to visit home.

208
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,500
What?

209
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,870
Is something going on at home?

210
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,590
It's not like that. Eat up.

211
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,710
- You should eat, too.
 - Okay.

212
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,850
- It's really good. 
- Yeah.

213
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,560
 Attorney Jeon, enjoy your time off. 

214
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,970
 I'll bury myself in my files. 

215
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,700
 Hurry back and save me. 

216
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,200
 Let's go eat something tasty again. 

217
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,750
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

218
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,870
Yes, Attorney Cha.

219
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,040
 Attorney Han, where are you? 

220
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm in my office.

221
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,000
 Oh, I'm close to Daejeon. Can I see you for a moment? 

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,900
I have a meeting soon.

223
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,740
That's me.

224
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,570
Why didn't you tell me you were Ms. Lee Seong Hui's attorney?

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,980
You might've come a long way, but you went too far in your complaint.

226
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,130
Attorney Han, aren't you being a bit much?

227
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,650
Sorry?

228
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,410
What?

229
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,960
Sex addict?

230
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,960
She demanded intercourse every day

231
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,860
and if she didn't get what she wanted,

232
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,420
she would accuse him of erectile dysfunction.

233
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,430
If she's not a sex addict, then what is she?

234
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,120
You must not have received the petition I submitted yet.

235
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,540
The one who needs medical intervention is Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok,

236
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,630
not Ms. Lee Seong Hui.

237
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,290
Are you throwing things out there because it hasn't been proven?

238
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,450
Is that how I taught you?

239
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,840
Attorney Cha, I wasn't just "throwing things."

240
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,980
Mr. Choi is really claiming the reason for their divorce is

241
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,510
Ms. Lee's frequent requests for sex.

242
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,160
And we can prove it.

243
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,260
You can prove it?

244
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,440
Throughout my 17 years as an attorney,

245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,550
I've yet to see anyone who could prove someone is a sex addict.

246
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,800
How will you prove it?

247
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,370
I can't tell you that.

248
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,130
I'm your opposing attorney, not your subordinate, Attorney Cha.

249
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,400
Anyway, we didn't make any fake claims.

250
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,920
Ms. Lee Seong Hui probably lied.

251
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,820
Then, can you prove it, Attorney Cha?

252
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,150
Yes!

253
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,480
I can prove it.

254
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,840
How will you prove erectile dysfunction without a medical diagnosis?

255
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,320
He said he was never diagnosed.

256
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,190
Even if it doesn't amount to a sexual dysfunction,

257
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,980
refusing sexual relations can be grounds for divorce.

258
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,990
Fine. Let's say it'll be hard to prove both of their claims.

259
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,260
That's why I'm here.

260
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,380
To reach a settlement?

261
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,280
My client doesn't want to settle.

262
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Yes, my client doesn't want to settle, either. For now.

263
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,090
But a mediation date will be set soon.

264
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,460
Let's reach a nice settlement then.

265
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,550
For the sake of both of them, who are still young.

266
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,970
I understand what you're trying to say.

267
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,110
However,

268
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,290
I think it's a bit too early to talk about settlement.

269
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,200
Hey, Han Yu—

270
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,780
Attorney Han Yu Ri?

271
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,370
It's hard to prove sexual problems anyway.

272
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,970
So, I'm saying let's not get too heated up.

273
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,480
All right. I understand.

274
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,520
I'll contact you after discussing this with my client, Attorney Cha.

275
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,530
My goodness...

276
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,900
What's wrong?

277
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,690
Jeong Wu Jin, you'd better manage your associates better.

278
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,670
Did you meet with Attorney Han Yu Ri?

279
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,410
Yes. I'm here as her opposing attorney.

280
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,160
I think I managed her quite well since you seem angry.

281
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,790
You're all on the same side now, huh?

282
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,760
Poor me for not having an associate.

283
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,390
Seonbae, should I buy you tteokbokki?

284
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,620
After you.

285
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,890
Gosh, that's hilarious.

286
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,880
 Railway Restaurant 

287
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,360
Y-You ordered all of this?

288
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,010
You've changed, Seonbae.

289
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,530
Aren't you busy?

290
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,470
Oh, sorry. You're busy, huh?

291
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,250
You can go when you're done. I'll take my time eating.

292
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,980
That's not what I meant.

293
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,880
You look like you're doing well.

294
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,870
Hey, that Han Yu Ri is really something.

295
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,810
What? "Then, can you prove it, Attorney Cha?"

296
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,000
"Can you?" Wow...

297
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,610
Jeong Wu Jin?

298
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,810
You know, you've been dropping the honorifics since earlier.

299
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,520
- Me?
 - See?

300
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,190
You asked earlier, "Should I buy you tteokbokki?"

301
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,970
You guys are treating me like a joke.

302
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,890
Going all out now that I've taken off the rank and title.

303
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,620
I don't think you're a joke. I'm just treating you comfortably, Seonbaenim.

304
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,500
Seeing you order various items and eat at ease

305
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,070
makes me think accepting your resignation was a good idea.

306
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,110
Our firm is really busy.

307
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,480
You just wait.

308
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,830
I don't know about a major firm,

309
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,780
but I'll grow it to the best of my ability.

310
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,480
Seonbae, you should hire an associate if you want more time for business.

311
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,170
And hire some staff.

312
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,620
How long will you run around by yourself?

313
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,540
Well, I'm considering it.

314
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,070
I don't want to choose just anyone.

315
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,290
You know me. I'm picky when it comes to people.

316
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,730
I don't think so.

317
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,770
My husband had an affair with a female coworker!

318
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,930
Stay put. My husband is about to gamble away our house!

319
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,120
Money is not the issue!

320
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,090
Hold on! Please, both of you!

321
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,090
Please calm down.

322
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,070
In rare cases, the date of the trial and mediation coincide.

323
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,120
It seems to be difficult to contact Mr. Oh Gyu Chan by phone.

324
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,220
Yes...

325
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,620
I know you're all busy. Please give this a little more attention.

326
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
Yes?

327
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,900
Aren't you going home yet?

328
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,850
Everyone left already.

329
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,170
I was about to leave.

330
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,100
- Shall we walk out together? 
- Sure.

331
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,060
 Octopus, Soybean Hangover Soup, (Seasonal Menu) Mackerel, Webfoot, Gizzard, Crab­ 

332
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,910
It's good to see you take a break like this.

333
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,110
You were busy preparing for trials on the weekends

334
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,300
and submitting written notices.

335
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,030
You couldn't come home at all.

336
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,620
That's because your son is really successful.

337
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,320
You were always going on about WLB (Work-Life Balance).

338
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,590
Are you sure things are going well?

339
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,300
You're just suffering, aren't you?

340
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,320
I think my WLB is going well for a first-year lawyer.

341
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,370
As for my love life...

342
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm not too sure.

343
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,760
Eun Ho, if you're going through a tough time,

344
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,940
it's okay to say so, honestly.

345
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,140
If you don't say it, no one will know.

346
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,420
Don't just act chill.

347
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,790
All right, Father.

348
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,560
All I see are couples fighting.

349
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,560
It's nice to see my mom and dad get along back at home.

350
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,310
 Mediation Room 

351
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,040
You two don't have any children.

352
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,830
Both parties have agreed on the division of property.

353
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,780
Is it necessary to go to court for a ruling?

354
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,260
Our lack of children is also his fault.

355
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,840
He should be able to function properly in order to have children.

356
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,790
Why are you bringing that up now?

357
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,790
Should I bring up you quitting work after getting married?

358
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,200
How is that relevant to this discussion?

359
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,450
Are you saying I lost appeal because I didn't earn money?

360
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,220
Oh, is that why...

361
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,450
 that  doesn't function properly?

362
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,050
Hey, why would you say something so embarrassing?

363
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,260
Fine, think what you want.

364
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,880
Others have kids, no problem. Why's that so difficult for us?

365
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,710
You're blaming everything on me, right?

366
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,830
Of course! Why won't you acknowledge your faults?

367
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,390
Do kids raise themselves?

368
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,680
- What are you saying?
 - And is it my fault you can't get pregnant?

369
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,010
Of course, it is!

370
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,310
I wasn't going to say this, but

371
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,590
should I talk about your gynecology consultation?

372
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,140
Hey, Choi Jin Hyeok!

373
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,820
All right, let's refrain from digressing from the issue.

374
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,870
This meeting is for reaching a settlement.

375
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,210
What do you think, Attorneys?

376
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,190
I understand what you're saying,

377
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,870
but the plaintiff does not desire a settlement.

378
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,430
Do you feel the same, Defendant?

379
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,770
Yes, they want to legally determine who's right and wrong.

380
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,400
Let me ask the defendant.

381
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,870
If you lose the case, will you accept the judge's ruling?

382
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,120
No, I'm going to appeal.

383
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,460
What about the plaintiff?

384
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,790
I'll have to appeal, too.

385
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,490
She asks to do it every day.

386
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,300
How can I live like this?

387
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,580
You won't accept the decision anyway,

388
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,110
and you'll continue through the appeal and Supreme Court stages.

389
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,230
I guess you're making the attorneys rich.

390
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,460
Supreme court stages...

391
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,070
There's such a thing?

392
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,310
You'll go with me until the end, right?

393
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,870
I'll see this through to the end, too.

394
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,200
I don't care about the legal fees.

395
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,820
 You two failed to settle. 

396
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,610
Let's go to trial, Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

397
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,160
Yes, I'll see you in court, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

398
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,600
Do you think...

399
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,120
we can win?

400
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,190
It seems we need further consultation first.

401
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,210
After hearing your conversation today,

402
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,050
I felt our consultation was not enough.

403
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,000
About what?

404
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,650
What was that about the gynecology consultation?

405
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,730
When the topic of pregnancy came up, both of you got upset.

406
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,520
Jerk.

407
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,420
He's blaming me for not being able to conceive. What a coward.

408
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,560
It's polycystic ovarian syndrome.

409
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,790
Does that mean I won't be able to get pregnant?

410
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,060
Natural conception isn't impossible,

411
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,250
but if you want to conceive soon,

412
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,490
you can try the ovulation stimulant.

413
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,400
- You should think about it. 
- Okay.

414
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,210
- Honey.
 - Yeah.

415
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,620
What do you want to do?

416
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,600
I want to...

417
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,940
c-c-conceive naturally.

418
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,430
You always say that.

419
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,300
If it happens, it happens. If not, oh well.

420
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,250
Is having a child important? Our relationship is important.

421
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,240
So, you'll be fine even without a child as long as you have me?

422
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,140
Of course. You can be my baby, and we'll just live together like that.

423
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,340
When you're this cute, like a child.

424
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,620
 I couldn't conceive, and I also quit work, 

425
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,560
 so he probably found me less appealing. 

426
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,530
We married because we couldn't live without each other,

427
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,420
but I felt so empty.

428
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,710
I wonder if his idea of love was this insignificant.

429
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,870
Have you ever discussed this with Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok?

430
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,760
How could I tell him something so humiliating?

431
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,230
It seems the core issue of this case is not the refusal of sexual relations.

432
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,910
Pardon?

433
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,050
Are you sure Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok also wants a baby?

434
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:07,010
Are you sure you're not the only one who desperately wants a child?

435
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,750
I'm not. When they said the chances of natural pregnancy were low,

436
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,360
he tried to console me and say it was okay.

437
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,400
But I'm sure he was very disappointed.

438
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,600
After that, his interest in me plummeted.

439
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,600
 Complaint 

440
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,800
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

441
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,920
 I think it's a bit too early to talk about settlement. 

442
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,940
Attorney Cha, are you here?

443
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,910
Why are you here?

444
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,820
I have something to tell you.

445
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,130
Are you Han Yu Ri or Attorney Han Yu Ri?

446
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,990
I came as Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok's attorney.

447
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,600
Yes, please have a seat, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

448
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,940
Thank you.

449
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,050
I don't think sexual addiction or refusal of sexual relations

450
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,410
are the issues here.

451
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,590
That's what you think, too?

452
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,940
Did you think that, too?

453
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,430
Did you not want any children, Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok?

454
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,320
Why not?

455
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,990
Because of money.

456
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,330
Being the only provider is tight enough as is.

457
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,540
But it seemed like my wife wasn't in a rush to get pregnant, either.

458
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,380
So that was a relief.

459
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,590
Have you discussed this matter with Ms. Lee Seong Hui?

460
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,990
I couldn't bring myself to.

461
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,950
I don't know why it hurts my pride so much.

462
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,250
I don't know why it's so hard for me to do

463
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,820
what's natural for everyone else.

464
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,420
But would it be appropriate for a lawyer to get involved at this point?

465
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,650
That's what I'm here to ask.

466
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,240
Why are you asking me?

467
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,480
I'm no longer your work superior.

468
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,560
So, I can be more honest with you, right?

469
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,630
I don't know, either.

470
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,760
You don't know?

471
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,490
Do we keep proving and fighting? Go all the way to the third trial?

472
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,100
Is that an attorney's duty? Because the client wants to?

473
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,430
Or should we arrange a meeting?

474
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,260
But lawyers aren't marriage counselors.

475
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,080
Exactly!

476
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:15,150
Isn't that... a bit of an overreach?

477
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,870
You decide.

478
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,310
What?

479
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,590
Gosh, I don't know.

480
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,890
Attorney Han?

481
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,410
Yes.

482
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,830
Let's eat tteokbokki.

483
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,280
Okay.

484
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,290
 Railway Restaurant 

485
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,060
Not a word about the case while we eat.

486
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,740
Gosh, my head hurts.

487
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,580
Sounds good.

488
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:13,150
These days, I feel like I've been left all alone at Daejeong.

489
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,930
You're not there

490
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,490
and Attorney Jeon, whom I always ate with, isn't there, either.

491
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,650
It's best to be alone!

492
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,300
So, now that you're alone, are you happy?

493
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,100
Yeah, I'm happy. Very happy.

494
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,760
Well, if you like being alone so much,

495
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,180
why in the world did you get married?

496
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,310
You're curious about that? All of a sudden?

497
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,350
Yes! I'm really curious.

498
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,620
Everyone thinks I got married

499
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,030
as if it were a life assignment, finding the right person at the right time.

500
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,360
But it wasn't like that.

501
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,700
It wasn't?

502
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,370
Getting married suddenly as if handling a legal document?

503
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,020
It was indeed sudden.

504
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,150
Since there was no need to date for a long time.

505
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,580
Why?

506
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,810
Because time is money? No— life?

507
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,200
No. Because I was head over heels.

508
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,040
What? Did I just hear that right?

509
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,830
I was head over heels and missed him when he was out of sight.

510
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,320
I found nothing more fun than playing alone,

511
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,560
but I couldn't live without that person.

512
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,670
Even if I were to go back to the past, I'd do it again.

513
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,890
Because I liked him so much that no one else could replace him.

514
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,830
And thanks to him,

515
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,420
I have Jae Hui.

516
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,820
Why don't you become a little more honest, Attorney Han?

517
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,320
About what?

518
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,690
Are you really okay?

519
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,230
Yes.

520
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,990
Really?

521
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,020
Yes! Attorney Cha, finish your meal.

522
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,270
 Attorney Jeon Eun Ho 

523
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,900
 Attorney Jeon, are you doing well? 

524
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,140
Let's just get to work.

525
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,480
- Mom!
 - Yeah.

526
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,730
Done with the academy?

527
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,610
I came so we could go home together.

528
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,420
Good thinking! Let's go home.

529
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,030
Give me a minute.

530
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,710
Jae Hui, can I ask you a weird question?

531
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,370
What is it?

532
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:56,710
You didn't choose to be born into this world.

533
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:03,210
Your dad and I made the decision and brought you into the world.

534
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,610
I was wondering what you thought about that.

535
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,670
Why are you asking me that?

536
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,550
Just because.

537
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm happy I was born into this world.

538
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,950
Why?

539
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,430
I can become someone this world needs.

540
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,530
I like that.

541
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,720
You're the same as me.

542
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,170
I used to think a lot about that when I was little, too.

543
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,610
Then,

544
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,960
how is it living with me now that you've tried it?

545
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,480
I like it.

546
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,980
- Really?
 - Yeah.

547
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,140
You've become a lot more honest than before.

548
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,090
You always used to act strong and cool in front of me.

549
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,850
I feel closer to you now, Mom.

550
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,030
Yeah?

551
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,280
Thanks.

552
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,540
Thanks, my Jae Hui.

553
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,780
Please, come in.

554
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,360
We could be overstepping our boundaries as lawyers by arranging this meeting.

555
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,260
We hope both of you can be honest today.

556
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,950
Since this might be the last time you see each other.

557
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,740
So,

558
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,710
you never wanted me to get pregnant?

559
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,560
Right.

560
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,690
I don't have the confidence to support you and the child on my salary.

561
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,120
 I tried everything to save up before you got pregnant. 

562
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,700
 I even worked part-time after work as a deliveryman and designated driver. 

563
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,670
 I had no idea! You should've told me! 

564
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,300
 How could I tell you when I'm the only one worrying about money? 

565
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,050
You even quit work when you were aware of our situation.

566
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,450
I was told I had to quit work if I wanted a better chance of pregnancy!

567
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,780
You came alone today.

568
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,410
I didn't want my husband to worry needlessly.

569
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,710
Doctor, what should I do to become pregnant?

570
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,720
If you cut out late night, alcohol, and stress,

571
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,190
the chance of pregnancy can increase significantly.

572
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,270
That's how many women get pregnant right away after quitting their jobs.

573
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,400
What?

574
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,910
That was the case?

575
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,450
Because you thought I wanted a baby?

576
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,630
I thought we both desperately wanted one.

577
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,160
But I thought even though you wanted a child,

578
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,550
you no longer saw me as a woman, and that made me feel

579
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,960
so hurt and sad that I thought I was going to lose my mind!

580
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,870
Thank you for your cooperation all this time.

581
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,330
It seems like this is the beginning of an honest conversation,

582
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,750
so please go home and discuss this further.

583
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,560
Then, please let us know how you'd like to proceed.

584
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,910
We're legal representatives.

585
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,070
We'll proceed however you wish.

586
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,800
Whether it's a verdict or a settlement.

587
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,280
Attorney Cha, do you want to grab a bite?

588
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,160
I have an important VIP meeting.

589
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,050
Buy me dinner if you close this VIP contract.

590
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,730
All right. I'm off.

591
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,280
We will begin the second mediation session.

592
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,350
Both parties have expressed their intent to reach a settlement.

593
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,740
We need to wrap this up as a divorce, correct?

594
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,650
Yes. My client wants a divorce because there is a disagreement

595
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,790
between both parties regarding children.

596
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,070
I'm growing older by the day

597
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,930
and it'll be difficult to picture a future with someone who doesn't want children.

598
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,720
The plaintiff has also come to a clear realization through

599
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,480
this litigation that he does not want a child

600
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,380
and concluded that divorce is the appropriate course of action.

601
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,940
Even so, we were very thankful our attorneys

602
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,030
arranged that meeting for us.

603
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,470
The reason for breaking up has become clear,

604
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,020
so I feel more at ease.

605
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,310
Yes, we understand both party's opinions.

606
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,720
- Thank you for your time. 
- Thank you for your time.

607
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,640
- Thank you for your help. 
- Thank you.

608
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,350
Seong Hui.

609
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,690
Should we grab a meal before we part?

610
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,900
Let's do that.

611
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,030
I thought they'd talk things out and live happily together.

612
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,150
But they actually chose to divorce.

613
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,560
I'm sure they feel far better than blaming each other without knowing why.

614
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,640
Why is it so hard for people to be honest?

615
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,050
It's even harder for people who are close.

616
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,460
It seems they like each other a lot.

617
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,590
I'm sorry they're breaking up.

618
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,120
What's gotten into you, Attorney Han?

619
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,540
Divorce is the end of a marriage, not their relationship.

620
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,140
Since they were freed from the walls of marriage, financial responsibility,

621
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,080
and the homework called pregnancy,

622
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,200
they might actually start a real relationship now.

623
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,230
See, see?

624
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,550
What did I say?

625
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,370
I've learned another lesson, Attorney Cha.

626
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,400
Each case has different characteristics, so please check those for me.

627
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,120
-  Yes!  
-  I understand. 

628
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,840
Hello.

629
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,370
I'm sorry I'm late.

630
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,470
Not at all. We know you came from the court.

631
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,300
Did the mediation go well?

632
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,860
Yes, Mr. Choi Jin Hyeok's case was closed.

633
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,710
We just finished case briefings.

634
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,020
Lastly, there's an announcement for you all.

635
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,660
It's important, so I waited for you to come, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

636
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:30,370
Today will be Attorney Jeon Eun Ho's last day here with us.

637
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,930
- Why?
 - So suddenly?

638
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,550
It was decided urgently, so I apologize for not telling you in advance.

639
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,160
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

640
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,660
We'll hire a new attorney soon, so don't worry too much, Attorney Han Yu Ri.

641
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,030
I'll make sure you're not sitting on top of a pile of cases.

642
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,130
Yes.

643
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,790
All right, Attorney Jeon Eun Ho. Shall we listen to your last farewell?

644
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,960
I know I was inadequate, but thank you so much for being there for me all the time

645
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,390
I'll continue to work hard so I can have a better future.

646
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,530
Let us all keep it up, both Daejeong and I, Jeon Eun Ho.

647
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,710
- Fighting!
 - Fighting.

648
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,970
Fighting!

649
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,200
Thank you for all your work.

650
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,300
But seriously, what's this, Attorney Jeon?

651
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,780
- How can you do this so suddenly?
 - It's not a prank, is it?

652
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,450
Thank you for helping me to end it properly, CEO Jeong.

653
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,240
You probably thought you'd be at ease if you studied hard

654
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,930
and get hired at a good firm, right?

655
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,450
But life isn't like that, is it?

656
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,540
I'll be 30 soon, but I feel like I still don't know anything.

657
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,460
Gosh, 30 is just the beginning.

658
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,600
Regardless of what you start now, you can do it all.

659
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,260
And you'll do well, Attorney Jeon Eun Ho.

660
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,780
Thank you, CEO Jeong.

661
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,910
"Once a senior, always a senior," even if you quit. You know that, right?

662
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,250
- Of course!
 - Hit me up anytime.

663
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,920
Yes.

664
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,450
Thank you.

665
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,540
- Fighting.
 - Yes.

666
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,790
 Jeon Eun Ho 

667
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,880
Attorney Jeon...

668
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,080
how can you do this?

669
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,700
You could've talked to me about it once at least.

670
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,020
I'm sorry.

671
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:38,140
How can I add my problem to your plate when you're buried in cases?

672
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,900
How can you say that?

673
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,660
I spilled everything on you whenever I felt frustrated.

674
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,490
You're making me feel so bad.

675
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,200
I'm sure you had a lot on your mind, too.

676
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,910
No, it's fine.

677
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,800
Han Yu Ri...

678
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,080
don't starve just because you don't have a lunch buddy.

679
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,040
Okay?

680
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,990
You're really leaving like this?

681
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:13,820
Let's meet later, after all your busy matters are over.

682
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,780
I'll get going.

683
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,850
Attorney Cha, what should I start with?

684
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,780
 Spring Back Law Firm, Attorney Jeon Eun Ho 

685
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,650
Attorney Jeon, thank you for coming.

686
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,750
Gosh, not at all.

687
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:09,220
I'll never forget how you came all the way to my house in person.

688
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,330
If it weren't for you, I might still be grilling oysters.

689
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,020
Please enjoy.

690
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,610
Attorney Cha.

691
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,320
Please eat while you talk.

692
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,780
- I'm leaving Eun Ho in your care.
 - Aigoo!

693
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,990
- Go inside.
 - Thank you.

694
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Attorney Cha, please try this. It's delicious.

695
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,040
- Thank you.
 - But what brings you here?

696
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,190
You must be busy.

697
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,670
Nothing is more important than meeting you right now.

698
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,800
Sorry? What do you mean by that?

699
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,300
Attorney Jeon Eun Ho, come work at my office.

700
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,140
I'm scouting you with an official offer.

701
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,950
- What?
 - An attorney who takes care of cases fast and

702
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,010
has great social skills can't be on break.

703
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,020
You'll come, right?

704
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,280
Will I be of help to you?

705
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,490
Why did you choose me?

706
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,770
Since I'm Cha Eun Gyeong,

707
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,310
I thought all the clients would come if I opened a business.

708
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,760
But it wasn't the case.

709
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,020
I need an attorney with sales skills.

710
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,510
Well, I'll do my best so you can get off work on time.

711
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,790
What do you say? Isn't it a win-win for both of us?

712
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,180
Well, yes. It's just the two of us right now.

713
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,090
But I'll do my best and contribute

714
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,710
so Spring Back can grow as large as Daejeong.

715
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,020
There's no need to go that far.

716
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,560
Just do your thing.

717
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,300
Thank you for trusting me and having me join you.

718
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,100
Let's get to work.

719
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,770
Okay.

720
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,540
 Spring Back­ 

721
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,460
Spring Back Law Firm.

722
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,410
These days, every law firm has an SNS.

723
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,250
People do a lot of their searches on SNS, so you have to make one.

724
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,560
Well, I like it.

725
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,010
It's all done.

726
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,470
Whoa, I like it.

727
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,360
 How are you? Our law firm, Spring Back, is 

728
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,360
 a law firm where two divorce attorneys primarily handle divorce cases. 

729
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,060
 When a sudden breakup happens in your life, we'll be a reliable partner- 

730
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,650
Attorney Jeon, what's this?

731
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,210
You haven't told people about your business yet, right?

732
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,510
- Isn't it a bit embarrassing? 
- You can't do that.

733
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,710
Hurry up and forward the message to everyone you know.

734
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,520
I already sent it to everyone.

735
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,880
Naturally, when your acquaintances get a divorce,

736
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,190
even their friends and their friends' friends will hear the word of mouth.

737
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,610
I see. Really?

738
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:16,760
Just copy and paste what I sent you.

739
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,430
Here you go.

740
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,720
Do you want a snack, Lee Seo?

741
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,180
- I want it.
 - Come here. We've got a playroom, too.

742
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,050
Look over there.

743
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,690
Yes, yes. You want this?

744
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,040
Do you like the playroom?

745
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,800
So, what brings you here?

746
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,150
To be honest...

747
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,820
Thank you.

748
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,990
What would I have done without you, Attorney Jeon?

749
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,210
You are so dependable!

750
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,040
Attorney Cha, I think working at a new office is totally for me.

751
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,180
Building things from the ground up without any rules,

752
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,800
I guess I can say my passion is bubbling up.

753
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,780
You're both so good at work,

754
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,560
but why can't you look into your own hearts?

755
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,200
Sorry?

756
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,060
I was talking about you and Attorney Han.

757
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,750
You two still aren't honest with each other, right?

758
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,140
You knew about it, too, huh?

759
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,230
I thought, being honest

760
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,590
might actually mean I'm being selfish.

761
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:28,670
Bookworms who only studied in their 20s are

762
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,680
so weak in this field.

763
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,260
I thought you'd be better at it, but you seem just the same.

764
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,940
I thought no one knew how I felt,

765
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,850
but that wasn't the case.

766
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,250
Do you know how often other people can see

767
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,750
what two people don't realize?

768
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,070
I hope the two of you

769
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,750
won't miss out on each other because of inexperience.

770
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,920
Attorney Jeon, let's go eat—

771
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,200
That's right.

772
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,330
I'll just get back to work.

773
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,110
CEO Jeong, I think we got all the information.

774
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,530
- Okay. Shall we go down? 
- Yes.

775
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,860
You two are so frustrating.

776
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,450
Attorney Jeon, congrats on joining Spring Back.

777
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,590
You even hosted a welcoming party for me.

778
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,960
Thank you, Attorney Cha.

779
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,940
By this time next year, it'll be crowded with about 10 people with us.

780
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,830
Attorney Jeong will join us later, too.

781
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,280
Wh-Whoa, CEO Jeong is?

782
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,760
Jeong Wu Jin recommended you to me.

783
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,880
Should I make a recommendation?

784
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,750
Who?

785
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,160
Jeon Eun Ho.

786
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,360
Attorney Jeon?

787
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,510
Aigoo, he always gets off work on the dot.

788
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,830
He does because he can afford to.

789
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,590
I'll show you the records of the cases Attorney Jeon took.

790
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:26,000
You'll probably change your mind.

791
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,420
Really?

792
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,030
The reason you always leave work on the dot.

793
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,710
I always thought it was because you didn't want to work late.

794
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:40,880
But I reviewed all the cases you had worked on.

795
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,550
Here.

796
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,420
 Attorney Jeon Eun Ho: Concluded in mediation 

797
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,450
Jeon Eun Ho is amazing.

798
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,420
He's perfect for Spring Back!

799
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,970
You ended most of them with mediation.

800
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,520
Not a single case that lasted over a year.

801
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,030
My motto is...

802
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,570
"rocket divorce."

803
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,760
Everyone will be happy if we end it fast.

804
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,070
Less stressful for the clients and good for me since I get off on time.

805
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,970
- A rocket divorce.
 - Yes.

806
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,570
Nice.

807
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,700
CEO Jeong must be here.

808
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,340
Oh, Attorney Han.

809
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,000
A-Attorney Jeon.

810
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,950
Seriously.

811
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,430
Attorney Han, come inside.

812
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:31,540
We were going to have a company dinner for the first time in a while

813
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,980
when I heard familiar voices. You know?

814
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,880
Attorney Jeong, should we eat by ourselves somewhere?

815
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,390
- Shall we?
 - Yeah.

816
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,240
- I needed to talk to you earlier.
  Yes, that's right.

817
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,340
Oh, what should we do?

818
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,760
You two should eat.

819
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,390
You two eat together.

820
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,380
Sorry, we have something to talk about.

821
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,430
What's going on?

822
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,010
Why are you with Attorney Cha?

823
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,530
Attorney Cha recruited me,

824
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,420
so I decided to work at Spring Back.

825
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,240
What? Really?

826
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,720
Yeah.

827
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,920
Boy, we're so out of sync.

828
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,140
Sync? You call that acting? Geez...

829
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:33,490
And you worked with me for 14 years, ahh, seriously.

830
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,780
I usually hate sticking my nose into other people's business.

831
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,210
But I keep sticking my nose these days.

832
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,520
Gosh, I hate doing this, too.

833
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,520
But it's too frustrating to see them not talking.

834
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,440
True. It's better to say what they need to say even if they break up in the end.

835
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,240
What shall we eat?

836
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,170
You're skipping honorifics again, huh?

837
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,120
Shabu-shabu?

838
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,090
Huh? No way.

839
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,060
Why? There's a good place.

840
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,990
You're going to eat shabu-shabu, Seonbae?

841
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:12,230
You know it takes at least 40 minutes just to eat that, right?

842
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:15,410
Hey, let me take it easy for once!

843
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,890
Jae Hui went to have dinner with her friend, too.

844
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,340
Don't say a word and follow me.

845
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:26,150
Why is she walking so fast when she's taking it easy?

846
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,570
Seonbae, wait for me!

847
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,330
I have to head this way.

848
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,770
It was nice to see you again after a long time, Attorney Han.

849
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,400
Y-Yes.

850
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,280
Me, too.

851
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,920
Let's grab dinner together from time to time.

852
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,820
Of course.

853
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,450
It's nothing new.

854
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,320
I'll get going now.

855
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,460
- Okay. Get home safe. 
 - Okay.

856
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,890
 It's hard, isn't it? 

857
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,820
 Gosh, don't worry too much about it. 

858
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,910
 People like him are likely just putting on a show. 

859
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,430
 You were like a seonbae just now. 

860
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,890
 You said establishing yourself was important. 

861
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,030
 Were you talking about securing a convenience store table? 

862
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,930
 Excuse me, Attorney Han. We're still colleagues, okay? 

863
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,480
 So, it doesn't matter if it's day or night. 

864
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,820
 Feel free to call me anytime. 

865

♫  I'm a bit scared, too  ♫

866

♫  I'm scared of all the things I hid away  ♫

867
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,830
 Attorney Han! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? 

868
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,210
 Y-Yeah. 

869
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:07,510
 I wish Han Yu Ri would stay out of danger. 

870
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,600
 That we should try dating. 

871
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,800
 Putting aside being a man and a woman, colleagues, and attorneys... 

872
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:23,430
 let's just get to know each other as Han Yu Ri and Jeon Eun Ho, ever so casually. 

873
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:28,780
 Why don't you become a little more honest, Attorney Han? 

874
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,980
 Are you really okay? 

875
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:39,060

Jeon Eun Ho!

878
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,140
 I missed him when he was out of sight. 

879
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,840
 I found nothing more fun than playing alone, 

880
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,340
 but I couldn't live without that person. 

881

 We got a new attorney and... 

906
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,060
 How am I supposed to teach her? 

907
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,890
 There's no answer. 

908
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,280
-  Long time no see. 
 -  Yes. 

909
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,290
 You mustn't lose. 

910
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:21,960
 You must show the punks at Daejeong who the boss is! 

911
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,030
 I'll ask our firm's ace attorney to handle it.
