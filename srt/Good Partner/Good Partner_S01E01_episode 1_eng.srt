 Good Partner

00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,430
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,110
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,850


5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,000
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,520
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,720
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,000
 Child actors were filmed in a safe environment. 

9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,530
It's Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong!

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,680
- Attorney!
 - Attorney!

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,880
Attorney Cha!

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,510
Over here, please!

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,410
Oldest daughter of J Group, Park Su Won, received  an award of 150 billion won

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,950
in the property division from the second trial of the divorce and...

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,800
- Cha Eun Gyeong? 
- 150 billion won from the second trial?

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,150
 calling it the award of the century. What's your opinion as an attorney? 

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,340
 More important than the amount of alimony and division of property, 

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,410
 I'm satisfied the appeals court granted my client the rights she deserves 

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,010
 when she has been suffering for a very long time.  
 Is that the Cha Eun Gyeong Effect?

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,000
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong, the second trial's award was three times that of the first trial. 

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,330
 Is it the Cha Eun Gyeong Effect? 

22
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,910
 What do you say to the people saying 

23
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,930
 the verdict changed because the attorney was changed? 

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,350
I only did my best for my client's benefit, as I always have been doing.

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,250
Thank you.

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,370
 Case 01: Divorce Attorney 

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,400
 Episode 1 

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,850
 Daejeong Law Firm 

29
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,870
 Daejeong Law Firm: Dear Attorney Han Yu Ri, congratulations on being hired. 

30
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,600
 We'll see you at Daejeong Law Firm at 9:00 a.m., March 4th. You can meet us on the 15th floor. 

31
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,970
I'll get to work in the Corporate Team if I am accepted, right?

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,600
We'll let you know.

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,050
 15th Floor: Divorce Team 

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,330
15th floor.

35
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,710
They told me to come to the 15th floor. The Divorce Team?

36
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,890
But the Corporate Team is on the 13th floor.

37
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,260
- Hello.
 - Good morning.

38
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,290
Hello. Good morning.

39
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,760
Hello.

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,390
Ms. Hong, please send up what I mentioned yesterday right away.

41
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,610
Oh, yes.

42
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,640
Senior Manager Ahn, you had to work late last night, right?

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,980
No, it was nothing. You had a lot more on your plate.

44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,200
Did you drink a lot last night?

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,230
No, I worked late.

46
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,540
Hello.

47
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,220
The new hire's coming in today, right?

48
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,530
Yes, that's right.

49
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,530
They didn't tell her to come to the 13th floor, did they?

50
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,900
- Any changes to the consultation schedule?
 - No, there's none.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,700
- Please double-check it for me.
 - I got it.

52
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,280
Yes, this is the Divorce Team.

53
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,170
Yes, this is the Divorce Team.

54
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,620
Yes, it's the Divorce Team.

55
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,430
You're the new hire for the Divorce Team, right?

56
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,900
- Sorry?
 - I'm Attorney Jeon Eun Ho.

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,680
By the way, I'm pretty sure I was placed in the Corporate Team.

58
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,670
I'm pretty sure it's the Divorce Team.

59
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,830
I know one of the new hires will be added to Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong's team.

60
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,920
And you won. Congrats.

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,030
 He's not using honorifics. 

62
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,230
Attorney Cha is coming up!

63
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,100
There she comes.

64
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,630
Thank you.

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,930
- Hello. 
 - Oh, you're here, Attorney Cha!

66
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,820
I'll see you later.

67
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,550
Yes.

68
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,590
 Attorney Jung Woo Jin 

69
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,680
And this is Associate Manager Park Ju Hyeon.

70
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,340
This is Associate Manager Kang Seong Ha.

71
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,750
- How do you do?
 - Hello.

72
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,610
And this is where Team One sits, including myself.

73
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,540
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

74
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,880
Yes.

75
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,890
Seonbae, I barely managed to bring in

76
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,160
the top person from the interview in the Divorce Team.

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,940
You absolutely can't make her leave this time.

78
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,670
Let's keep this straight.

79
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,310
Did I send them out? They walked out on their own.

80
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,420
That's not what I'm saying right now.

81
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,500
You're working too much.

82
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,360
And you need to listen to others, too.

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,050
If you say everything you want to say, no one can last.

84
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,680
You said I was so cool that I don't get swayed by what others say.

85
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,710
It's because kids these days are such weaklings.

86
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,910
Well, let's say that's true.

87
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,540
But would that change them?

88
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,220
We need to change.

89
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,690
Also, three new hires left because they couldn't deal with you as of last month.

90
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,920
This is all expense.

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,160
Why? Did the CEO give you an earful again?

92
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,440
Oh, and only two people left. Jung Eun Ho is doing fine.

93
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,530
It's Jeon Eun Ho, not Jung Eun Ho.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
That doesn't mean the CEO can do away with the Divorce Team.

95
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,370
- We've made him quite a fortune.
 - Exactly.

96
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,460
So, we need to raise our newbies right, raise our profit,

97
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,780
and show it to them.

98
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,740
- Want me to give you a little quiz? - Yes!

99
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,530
 One year ago  
 A client who cheated comes to you.

100
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,970
The couple has separated for about a year.

101
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,820
They whine to the attorney, saying they want to

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,250
start anew with a new person after the divorce.

103
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,220
What will you say?

104
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,670
I'll say our country abides by the cause-of-divorce policy,

105
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,360
so the one who cheated can't apply for divorce.

106
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,720
That's why you're a law school student, not an attorney.

107
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,100
It's the law to deny a divorce request from a spouse at fault—

108
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,660
How are you different than a law book if you just read off the rules?

109
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,400
Wouldn't AI know better about the laws?

110
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,250
You can go meet Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong later.

111
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,760
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but...

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,260
am I really a new hire for the Divorce Team?

113
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,360
Attorney Han Yu Ri...
  Han Yu Ri – Divorce Team 

114
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,510
I can confirm you were assigned to the Divorce Team.

115
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,630
There must've been a mistake—

116
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,810
Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong!

117
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,960
Where's Cha Eun Gyeong?

118
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,030
- Tell her to come out right now!
 - Hold on, please!

119
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,880
- You can't do this here.
 - Hey! Why you little...

120
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
- Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong!
 - Sir, please calm down.

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,710
- Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong!
 - S-Sir, please...

122
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,140
- Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong!
 - Hold him back.

123
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,590
- Sir.
 - Hey, Cha Eun Gyeong!

124
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,760
- Let go of me!
 - You can't be—

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,560
I got it, so let go!

126
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,210
Wait a minute—

127
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,150
What's this?

128
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,130
Did the judge get shot in the head?

129
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,460
Why is he telling me to hand over half? Huh?

130
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,100
To a woman who dillydallied all her life at home with the kids?

131
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,930
The judgment is the judge's job.

132
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,970
If you're not happy with it, you can appeal.

133
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,440
And don't skip the honorifics.

134
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,470
Will you pretend it's not your problem and talk like you're not involved?

135
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,710
It's indeed not my problem.

136
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,460
The attorney's job is to represent you,

137
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,650
the judge's job is to judge,

138
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,540
and your job is to hand over the assets.

139
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,240
So, it's clearly not my problem.

140
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,130
- What—
 - Do you need a consultation?

141
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,420
This woman is seriously getting on my nerves!

142
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,870
Should I schedule a consultation for you?

143
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,640
What kind of bullshit is this?

144
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,800
I came because they called you a star attorney and stuff.

145
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,140
- She's nothing but a highway thief. 
- Now, now.

146
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,510
If you take one more step from here,

147
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,690
your position could change into that of a defendant from being a client.

148
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,560
This is how irresponsible women are!

149
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,190
Shall we have a men's talk outside, then?

150
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,780
What's this?

151
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,520
Are you an attorney?

152
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,240
Fine. Let's talk man to man.

153
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,590
Come outside.

154
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,210
Damn it!

155
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,680
- Hurry up and come out!
 - Yes, sir. On my way.

156
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,810
Did I say something wrong here?

157
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,210
That little!

158
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,050
Mr. Kim Jun Ho, you're at an attorney's office.

159
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,770
- Please sit over here. 
- Oh, okay.

160
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,240
Attorney Cha, Attorney Han Yu Ri is here.

161
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,790
How do you do? My name's Han Yu Ri.

162
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,700
There's no Han Yu Ri in the office. We only have Attorney Han Yu Ri.

163
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,360
I'm sorry, but I did an interview with the Corporate Team on the 13th floor

164
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,740
and I chose Corporate Team as my first pick.

165
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,710
The interview is done collectively, and appointment is our authority.

166
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,570
Four hires were placed on the Corporate Team

167
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,780
and you were put on the Divorce Team, Attorney Han.

168
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,580
Why was I the only one...

169
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,830
 I heard you waste most of your time 

170
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,310
 listening to the clients venting in divorce cases. 

171
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,760
Do you still think a divorce attorney's job

172
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,650
is to listen to people venting?

173
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,990
Did you intentionally appoint me

174
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,040
to the Divorce Team because of what I said back then?

175
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,680
Does it look like I've got nothing to do?

176
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,550
Why don't you re-analyze the causality?

177
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,570
In that case...

178
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:25,040
did I get the lowest score among those who were accepted?

179
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,460
If the CEO didn't give you your first pick,

180
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,450
perhaps you need more testing, right?

181
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,990
What do I need to do to transfer to the Corporate Team, then?

182
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,050
Get good results on the Divorce Team.

183
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,980
If you win 10 cases in a row from now,

184
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,790
I'll let the CEO know about your wish to transfer teams.

185
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,240
You're saying I can transfer to the Corporate Team if I win 10 cases, right?

186
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,150
That's what I said.

187
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,520
Do you have a car?

188
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,550
- I use the subway—
 - Buy a car first.

189
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,740
- Also, roll up your sleeves.
 - Sleeves...

190
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,600
Buy a watch, too.

191
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,580
To an attorney, time is life.

192
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,820
Check it all the time.

193
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,410
But if you keep checking the time on your phone,

194
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,280
that's not good etiquette with a client.

195
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,920
- Sorry?
 - Daejeong is a major law firm that ranks

196
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,300
among the top three.

197
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,940
We charge more than three times and get paid three times more than other places.

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,740
So, you need to use your work hours at three times the efficiency, too.

199
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,450
To do that, your own car and comfortable shoes are essential.

200
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,850
Aren't you going to start working, Attorney Han?

201
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,040
Work?

202
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,300
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

203
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,680
Look at this...

204
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,160
Thirty cases per stack, so it's sixty in all.

205
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,770
Even for Attorney Cha, this is a bit...

206
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,430
I think she's being too much on your first day, right?

207
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,980
You can take some or give her a hand.

208
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,730
I was just about to do that, and you walked in right now.

209
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,220
 List of Cases and Trial Dates 

210
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,220
Am I going into trial right away tomorrow?

211
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,230
Attorney Cha, Mr. Park Jong Sik, and his son came for their 11:00 a.m. appointment.

212
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,140
That trial's client's first meeting is at 11:00 a.m.

213
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,480
Wrap up the files and come to the consultation room.

214
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,560
11 a.m.? 11 a.m...

215
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,610
It's only 10 minutes until 11:00 a.m.

216
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,240
The Divorce Team's time flows according to Cha Eun Gyeong.

217
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,830
I think you'll have to hurry.

218
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,620
Why are you still here?

219
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,380
Wh-Where's the consultation room?

220
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,420
Am I really going to give a consultation alone?

221
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,410
If not?

222
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,300
Mr. Park Jong Sik?

223
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,340
- Yes.
 - I can just tell it's an affair.

224
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,570
Convince him to come to a settlement.

225
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,100
It might not be an affair—

226
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,690
I can see a deficiency in his face.

227
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,380
Can we judge based on just looks?

228
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,390
Neat styling women like...

229
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,860
and touching people naturally.

230
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,910
Is she Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong by chance?

231
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,140
Yes, she is.

232
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,870
Proper courtesy. They're clearly ingredients for an affair.

233
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,010
He was served the complaint from his wife.

234
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,630
He forced his son to come be a witness.

235
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,700
Good luck with him.

236
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,230
My gosh.

237
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,140
I never thought something like this would happen to me.

238
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,080
 Husband's affair 
 It's really...

239
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,780
an affair, huh.

240
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,800
It's not.

241
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,610
I didn't.

242
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,030
I've never even thought about any other women besides my wife.

243
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,580
You're saying you've never cheated on her, right?

244
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,610
If you look at the complaint, it doesn't really have any evidence attached.

245
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,320
Because there's no evidence.

246
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,960
There can't be any since I never had an affair.

247
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,770
Who's this woman named Jang Eun Ji, who is written here as the second accused?

248
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,600
You're saying she's not your mistress, right?

249
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,250
Mistress?

250
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,540
She's a female employee.

251
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,420
Then...

252
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,790
why did the plaintiff file a complaint like this?

253
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,310
It doesn't feel right to say this at this point,

254
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,640
but my wife has delusional jealousy.

255
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,710
 Hey, where are those bastards? 

256
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,500
 Madam, what's wrong? CEO is checking the inventory at the storage— 

257
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,210
 You! 

258
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,790
 You're all in this with him, right? 

259
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,670
 How much did that asshole pay you? 

260
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,600
 Assistant ManagerJang! Where's Assistant Manager Jang that bitch? 

261
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,270
 M-Madam, Assistant Manager Jang is working out of the office right now- 

262
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,890
 Out of the office, my foot. 

263
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,000
 Move! 

264
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,260
 Hey! Come out. 

265
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,180
 - Assistant Manager Jang! Come out.
 - Honey. 

266
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,670
 - What's the matter? 
- What else? 

267
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,340
 - What is it? -
 - Move! 

268
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,660
 - Move.
 - Stop it now. When did you come? 

269
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,080
 - Gosh— 
- Why do you care? Where's Ms. Jang? 

270
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,420
 - Where's Assistant Manager Jang?
 - She's working off site. 

271
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,010
 Business trip, my foot. Get your filthy hands off me! 

272
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,190
Min Jun, go ahead and tell the attorney.

273
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,240
Yes, what my father said is right.

274
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,110
Mother is very suspicious.

275
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,260
How bad is it?

276
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,160
She tells me to search dad's phone when he's sleeping.

277
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,690
It's been like that since I was in grade school.

278
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,800
When dad's at a company dinner, she'll tell me to take a picture and send it to her.

279
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,470
It must've been hard on you.

280
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,070
You want to divorce as well, Park Jong Sik, right?

281
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,470
No.

282
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,430
I won't get a divorce.

283
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,110
She's suffering a bit, but she's my first love and

284
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,060
she's Min Jun's mother.

285
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,590
I need to protect this family.

286
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,480
The complaint doesn't have any evidence of the affair, so the cause of divorce is lacking.

287
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,660
I think I can get it denied as you wish.

288
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,940
You'll get it denied for sure, right?

289
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,970
Just trust in me.

290
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,020
"Trust in me"?

291
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,300
Professionals shouldn't say such things so easily.

292
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,860
A doctor telling the patient to trust in him with his life.

293
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,100
An attorney telling the client to trust in her with his life.

294
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,110
Are we god or something?

295
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,010
You're merely a newbie attorney, on top of that.

296
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,230
As you expected, he did get a complaint alleging adultery.

297
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,200
But there wasn't any evidence attached.

298
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,850
Then, you'll just have to settle the division of property and leave out the alimony.

299
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,780
He doesn't want a divorce.

300
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,950
Just because the court tells them to live happily together,

301
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,680
do you think a broken glass will get glued back?

302
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,720
Try to increase the case turnover rate.

303
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,340
Sorry?

304
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,370
By turnover rate,

305
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,270
are you talking about the turnover rate at restaurants' tables?

306
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,980
Yes. I'm telling you not to waste your breath uselessly.

307
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,220
He said the plaintiff has terrible delusional jealousy-

308
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,950
That's what all the cheaters say.

309
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,420
They all say their wives and husbands have delusional jealousy.

310
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,130
By chance, did you believe that?

311
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,650
 Yes, what my father said is right. Mother is very suspicious. 

312
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,540
Because their son said so.

313
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,010
Because he had the closest look at the plaintiff and the accused's marriage.

314
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,540
Just because he's their child, he can't know everything.

315
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,060
Because children only get to see what their parents filter.

316
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,260
In my opinion, the accused is pretending to be a victim.

317
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,610
Attorney Cha, I'm certain it's not an affair.

318
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,090
I'll get it denied.

319
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,340
A wife is bound to find out if her husband cheats on her, no matter what.

320
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,020
She knows through all her senses.

321
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,040
It's just there are people who didn't get to secure substantial evidence.

322
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,470
Well, you'll realize it all in time.

323
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,990
But I hope you'll realize quickly

324
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,020
just how arrogant you are.

325
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,710
Gosh, seriously...

326
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,910
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

327
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,030
 Daejeong Law Firm 

328
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,240
 It's always the bad students who carry their notes right up until the exam 

329
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,150
 and the newbie attorneys wear a black suit with their attorney badges, 

330
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,600
 looking at the records until the trial. Is it a tradition? 

331
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,200
I'll give you a ride for a while during your training.

332
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,240
So hurry up and buy a car before that.

333
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,700
Pardon?

334
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,730
What on earth are you looking at?

335
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,080
I don't know what the judge might ask.

336
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,300
You think the court is like a school?

337
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,170
There's no point in answering a question correctly.

338
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,850
A trial is a process of drawing the judge to your pace.

339
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,920
Yes, but it's still my first trial, so I should be well-informed.

340
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,260
If you get stuck on a question from the judge,

341
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,730
you can just tell him you'll submit it by the next deadline.

342
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,470
Like nothing's wrong.

343
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,500
Yes.

344
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,270
 The first mediation hearing begins now. 

345
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,680
 Case number 2013... 

346
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,770
DH532. We'll proceed with the hearing first.

347
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,660
The plaintiff is demanding 50% in the division of property and alimony.

348
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,120
And the child is an adult, right?

349
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,420
What's the defendant's position about the divorce?

350
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,180
The defendant disagrees with divorce.

351
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,270
The defendant actually had to suffer throughout their marriage

352
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,110
due to the plaintiff's delusional jealousy.

353
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,570
It's actually the plaintiff who's at fault.

354
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,650
So, we claim the request must be denied

355
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,500
since the cause of divorce lies with the plaintiff.

356
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,090
Also, the plaintiff has been harassing the defendant,

357
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,990
so much so he couldn't have any social life.

358
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,600
She made their child spy on the defendant's phone

359
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,220
and she also came to his workplace many times to keep an eye on him.

360
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,490
Including July 22, 2023, and September 3-

361
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,740
Attorney, all the dates are in the record,

362
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,550
so you don't need to tell us again.

363
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Yes, she made a scene at his workplace three times.

364
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,820
Your Honor, I apologize.

365
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,030
I'm the plaintiff's attorney who submitted my representation this morning.

366
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,630
Defendant's representative, please continue.

367
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,690
Yes.

368
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,980
The plaintiff's delusional jealousy has been so bad that

369
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,560
she requested alimony without any evidence at all—

370
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,450
Your Honor.

371
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,880
The plaintiff appointed an attorney quite late.

372
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,730
So, we submitted the evidence this morning.

373
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,120
But it seems the defendant didn't get to review it yet.

374
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,580
Yes. Please show it on the screen.

375
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,510
 - Assistant Manager Jang, do you want to have SS later nearby? 
 - Assistant Manager Jang: I'd love to. 

376
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,710
 - Ms. Jang, don't forget to bring a CD this time. 
 - Ms. Jang: Got it. 

377
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,650
 - I will look forward to it. Your O. last time was the best. 
 - Ms. Jang: Haha. 

378
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,550
Mom, just read that. Just look at that!

379
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,260
- What!
 - See?

380
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,810
This is nuts. They've gone mad.

381
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,450
I told you he's cheating! Look at it with your own eyes.

382
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,760
Silence! Please be quiet.

383
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,620
It's hard to tell you what those abbreviations mean here.

384
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,230
But I'm sure everyone knows.

385
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,840
No, please clarify for us, Plaintiff.

386
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,230
Yes, Your Honor.

387
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,330
If you look at the contents of the messages, the first defendant asks the second defendant,

388
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,600
 Do you want to have SS later nearby? 

389
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,830
"Do you want to have sex later nearby?"

390
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,090
And the second defendant answers, "I'd love to."

391
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:28,060
And the first defendant tells her to bring a condom using an abbreviation.

392
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,490
In that case, what does O. stand for?

393
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,530
It seems to refer to oral sex.

394
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,560
Gosh, he's got a screw loose.

395
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,080
What does the defendant's representative think?

396
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,000
It's absolutely not true!

397
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,230
The plaintiff was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder.

398
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,700
Her mental health isn't good, so she might have fabricated—

399
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,680
Nonsense! My eonni went through so much!

400
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,960
Please be quiet. Silence!

401
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Sit down. Sit.

402
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,960
Your Honor, it's my first time seeing the above evidence...

403
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,120
 If you get stuck on a question from the judge, 

404
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,580
 you can just tell him you'll submit it by the next deadline. 

405
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,470
 Like nothing's wrong. 

406
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:30,580
I'll submit a response by the next deadline.

407
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,160
Your Honor, to check the spouse's assets for division of property,

408
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,130
I'd like to request a verification of the defendant's bank account transaction history.

409
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,370
Yes, granted.

410
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,850
The defendant also requests the plaintiff's assets statement and

411
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,020
financial information to confirm the existence of any hidden assets.

412
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,060
You're saying I hid away money?

413
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,710
He's the one who must've hidden the money!

414
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,420
Now, now. Please sit back down. Please sit.

415
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,590
I'll see you all on the next hearing date.

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,580
 Court in session 

417
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,820
Oh, my. M-Mom!

418
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,740
Does your mom know this is how you make a living?

419
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,710
You're committing assault and battery right now.

420
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,340
Let go of me!

421
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,250
You wench! You're Park Jong Sik's mistress, aren't you?

422
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,030
Mom, stop it now!

423
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:39,050
You better check the facts properly and do your job right! You heard?

424
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,660
- Mom, let's go. Let's just go. 
- Aigoo.

425
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,390
Aigoo, don't you have better things to do than be a mistress?

426
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,000
- Huh? Aigoo!
 - Sit here, Mom.

427
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,880
Mom, take a seat.

428
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,020
I'll escort her.

429
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,630
Sit, Mom. Relax.

430
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,140
This is my first trial ever? What the heck...

431
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,160
- So annoying.
 - Gosh!

432
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,500
That bloody attorney is Park Jong Sik's lover, for sure.

433
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,700
She wouldn't go that far unless they slept together.

434
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,230
Are they nuts?

435
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,440
Filthy bastards.

436
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,740
My wife has delusional jealousy.

437
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,240
She might even suspect you and me, Attorney.

438
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,430
Anyhow, how the hell did he seduce such a young lawyer?

439
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,360
He must've tossed her a few bags with the money he hid from his wife and kids.

440
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,050
She's so young. Not all lawyers have money, you know.

441
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,520
She fell head over heels for a designer bag.

442
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,460
Aigoo, this is so annoying.

443
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,030
That was a great start. Here.

444
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,220
You saw the evidence earlier, right?

445
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,900
Should I make him confess while he still can?

446
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,260
I told you. It's obvious.

447
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,600
He cheated on her and is holding out by denying it because he can't handle it.

448
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,840
People like him would never admit it, even to his attorney

449
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,980
until decisive evidence comes out.

450
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,710
Make him admit it and settle right after.

451
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,890
I'll discuss it with the client.

452
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,690
You need to lead, not discuss.

453
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,370
   
  Attorney, did the hearing go well?   

454
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,500
 I'll come to your office right now. 

455
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,440
Attorney, Mr. Park Jong Sik is here.

456
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,610
Thank you.

457
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,540
You said there'd be no evidence. Also...

458
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,240
you said you didn't commit adultery.

459
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,150
Do you know how humiliated I was at the court today?

460
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:07,860
How can you lie to your own attorney, let alone the other party?

461
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,640
Attorney, please calm down.

462
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,710
You think I can calm down right now?

463
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,890
I really didn't have an affair.

464
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,120
You can still say that?

465
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm sad to have even my attorney doubt me.

466
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,870
Is that so?

467
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,280
How are you going to explain these text messages, then?

468
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,140
What impure thoughts do people have to say this is the evidence of my affair?

469
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,590
"SS"!

470
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,280
Snacks.

471
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,370
Snacks—

472
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,090
What—

473
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,180
What about "CD"?

474
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,340
What does it stand for

475
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,010
other than a "condom"?

476
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,730
A card.

477
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,140
The corporate card.

478
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,630
She forgot the corporate card after the last meal.

479
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,490
Well...

480
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,290
then...

481
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,410
"O. last time was the best"?

482
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,880
An order. An order of a drink.

483
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,300
She ordered a mojito with snacks

484
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,910
and she said it tasted delicious.

485
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,080
Mojito, you say?

486
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,380
This is beyond me.

487
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,810
Do you think the court will believe that?

488
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,070
 Are you laughing or mocking me? 

489
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,460
 If Park Jong Sik is affair material, 

490
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,420
 you're a bitch material. 

491
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,950
You can just say that in your defense!

492
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,090
He's better than lawyers.

493
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,450
Maybe I'll scout him as a new attorney.

494
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,720
Do I really say this in the defense?

495
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,530
Snacks and telling her to bring the corporate card.

496
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,980
Say he was talking about an order of a drink that was the best?

497
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,950
Attorney Han, we're representatives.

498
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,700
If the client denies it to the end,

499
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,820
you can just claim what they wish.

500
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,410
- Even so— 
 - Defend for the sake of your client's benefit.

501
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,220
You said you want to go to the Corporate Team.

502
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,960
Getting a denial is the same as winning in this case. So, just push for it.

503
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,550
Still, I don't think the court will believe it, and

504
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,100
I'll only become a laughingstock.

505
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,100
If it's because you'd be embarrassed, forget about shame.

506
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,480
I told you Han Yu Ri doesn't work here.

507
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,120
You're only Attorney Han Yu Ri here.

508
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,050
It's not because I'd be embarrassed.

509
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,960
I feel like it's not the fact—

510
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,320
I see...

511
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,130
You don't like it because it feels like you're lying?

512
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,370
Yes. If I give a false defense, it'd be more torture for the plaintiff.

513
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,870
Are you the plaintiff's attorney?

514
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,680
You got paid by the defendant.

515
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,410
You'll have to lie if you have to.

516
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,480
Also, it might be the truth.

517
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:34,810
Going out to get some snacks with the corporate card is the truth?

518
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,870
What if, in the unlikely case—

519
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:42,570
Or, in the highly unlikely case, what if it's really the truth?

520
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,220
Even if 99 out of 100 people say they went to a motel to have sex with a condom,

521
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,610
what if their claims are the facts?

522
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,170
No boss and an employee would refer to dinner

523
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,880
using "SS" in this world!

524
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,430
That's what you think.

525
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,550
Being an attorney is a service job in the end.

526
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,020
The judges do the judging. Not the attorneys.

527
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,560
So, you just do your job, Attorney Han.

528
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,550
Go win.

529
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,620
- I read the new hire's cover letter. - Yes.

530
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,790
She specifically wrote she's fine with any team except for the Divorce Team.

531
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,780
- I'm going to lose it.
 - Aigoo...

532
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,450
Gosh, I don't think it'll be easy this time, either.

533
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,560
Why do people hate divorce cases so much?

534
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,230
- Divorce cases are so interesting to me. 
- Exactly.

535
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,260
- You're her colleague but also her senior. 
- Yes.

536
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,710
Take good care of the newbie.

537
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,500
I'll do what I can to convince Attorney Cha.

538
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,260
How do I do that?

539
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,840
 Eat with her, grab coffee together, and hear her out. 

540
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,880
 Give her some breathing room 

541
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,070
 so she won't quit. 

542
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,560
Attorney Han, can I ask you a question?

543
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,660
- What is it?
 - Why do you hate the Divorce Team so much?

544
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,110
People are dying to learn from working under Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

545
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,520
Did the word already travel that far?

546
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,990
I don't like divorce cases,

547
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,960
but I dislike Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong even more, to be honest.

548
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,890
Why? You barely worked with her.

549
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,110
When I was in law school,

550
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,680
- she came to give a seminar. 
- Yeah.

551
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,210
It was never the same after that.

552
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,230
 You're exhausting, too. 

553
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,740
I'm getting a reality check starting with my first case.

554
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,140
I wonder if I studied so hard just to take care of other people's mess.

555
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,410
Hey, take a glass.

556
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,110
And you need to win first.

557
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,990
You can't be picky right now.

558
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,820
Just do as Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong says.

559
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,560
I told you she's on another level.

560
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,540
So, did you do everything you were told to do?

561
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,990
Of course! Obviously.

562
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,020
Causing trouble in an organization will only tire you out.

563
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,140
Getting paid on time is all that matters.

564
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,600
If that's the case, what fun is it to work?

565
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,780
The fun for a salaried employee is getting off work on time

566
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,210
and eating makchang (grilled beef tripe) with beer. Try it.

567
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,570
It's delicious.

568
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,460
Dealing with headaches ends at 6:00 p.m., right on the dot.

569
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,450
Just until 5:59 p.m.

570
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,920
- 5:59 p.m.?
 - You need to pack your bag at the last minute.

571
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,350
 He's as light as a feather. 

572
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,630
Yes.

573
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,190
Also, if you've got any problems, talk to me.

574
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,030
I'll buy you all the makchang, fried chicken, and beer you need.

575
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,120
Also, let's eat lunch together from now on.

576
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,930
- Sorry?
 - I'm saying let's eat a lot of delicious food.

577
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,890
Stuff like this.

578
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,850
Hurry up and eat.

579
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,980
- Thanks for the food.
 - Sure.

580
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,420
 Seoul Family Court 

581
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,270
Attorney Han, is it true?

582
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,460
"CD" and "SS" are referring to

583
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,850
buying snacks with a card?

584
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,950
Yes, Your Honor.

585
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:38,600
Your Honor, if that's true, why bother using abbreviations?

586
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:45,900
Everyone knows people use abbreviations to refer to words that are too embarrassing to use.

587
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,970
Just because it's something everyone knows,

588
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,720
does it make it a fact?

589
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,900
We'd like to submit evidence of the plaintiff's delusional jealousy.

590
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,360
It's a recording file.

591
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,210
- Please play it.
 - Yes.

592
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,630
 He must've tossed her a few bags with the money he hid from his wife and kids. 

593
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,310
 She's so young. Not all lawyers have money, you know. 

594
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,830
 She fell head over heels for a designer bag. 

595
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,830
Gosh, this is so annoying.

596
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,560
Excuse me. Could you quiet down, please?

597
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,590
Yes, I'm sorry!

598
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:49,890
 What a wonderful pair of a raggedy client and a filthy attorney. 

599
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,840
Your Honor, recording a conversation is against the Protection of Communications Secrets Act.

600
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,740
I was in the same space and was one of the participants of the conversation.

601
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,020
It'd be hard to say it was against the Communications Secrets Act.

602
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,820
The Supreme Court's precedent views only those who participated in the conversation

603
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,520
from the beginning as a participant.

604
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,260
Before I went into the bathroom,

605
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:18,240
the plaintiff's family asked if I was the defendant's mistress...

606
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,330
 You're Park Jong Sik's mistress, aren't you? 

607
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,030
in front of the court.

608
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,850
Isn't it reasonable to say I was a participant in the conversation from the beginning?

609
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:32,470
I'd like to submit the said evidence to prove her severe delusional jealousy

610
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:37,050
enough to doubt the relationship between the lawyer and the client.

611
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,570
Please display the next piece of evidence.

612
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,320
 Witness Statement
 Name: Park Min Jun 

613
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,510
As you can see, the plaintiff

614
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,380
used her child like her own errand boy.

615
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,480
I met with their child in person and

616
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,390
I confirmed that he grew up under a lot of stress from that.

617
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,820
Are you saying Min Jun wrote that and submitted it himself?

618
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,540
Yes, that's right.

619
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,940
Your Honor! Park Jong Sik, that bastard—

620
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,230
No, I mean...

621
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,530
The defendant must have wheedled my child with something.

622
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,730
That bastard.

623
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,410
What do you mean, "wheedle"?

624
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,630
Is Park Min Jun a young child who can be wheedled into doing something with a toy?

625
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,750
How dare you!

626
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,420
How dare you carelessly speak my son's name with that mouth?

627
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:42,490
Park Min Jun is both an adult and a witness to the defendant's marriage life

628
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,600
for several decades.

629
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,740
Your Honor, from the verification I requested last time,

630
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:55,800
it was confirmed that the first defendant had given 30 million won to his son, Park Min Jun.

631
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,180
Please bring up the data.

632
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,660
 To Park Min Joon: 30 million won 

633
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,680
I knew it.

634
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,470
 He wrote that false statement after accepting money from his dad. 

635
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,450
He didn't even come to the trial because he would show it on his face.

636
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:22,110
That's not true. He had to be absent because of his work.

637
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,780
In that case, why did he give him 30 million won?

638
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,310
It's allowance.

639
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,370
Who gives 30 million won as an allowance?

640
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,600
The defendant desperately wishes to keep this family together.

641
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,110
However, he also had to prepare for the chance of getting ordered to divorce.

642
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:54,460
His son will live with trauma because of his parents.

643
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:59,270
So, he gave him some money to get a small place to live.

644
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,370
Just because a father gave money to his son,

645
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:18,810
it's absurd to say the son's testimony is false.

646
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:25,410
Still, it's true there seems to have been a trade.

647
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,760
So, we'll go ahead with the planned witness testimony.

648
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:40,720
Did the plaintiff frequent the workplace of the first and second defendants?

649
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,570
Yes, Madam would kick open the office doors at least once a week and curse.

650
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,790
 - It's honestly too much. 
- Where are these bastards? 

651
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,520
 When Madam barges in, it's so tough to stop her. 

652
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,140
I even thought about quitting solely because of that.

653
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,190
Aigoo, they're on Park Jong Sik's side.

654
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,850
Plaintiff's representative, please proceed with your questions.

655
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,050
The first and second defendants

656
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:10,690
did behave suspiciously, having an affair at work, right?

657
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,390
Boss and Assistant Manager Jang do go off-site for work often.

658
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,570
But I've never sensed that.

659
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,760
In that case, did the first or the second defendant

660
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,650
ever talk about going out to get "snacks" instead of dinner?

661
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,560
One moment. Now that I think about it...

662
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,660
How about cold noodles for a mid-day meal?

663
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,140
I thought you meant Chinese food. I'm in!

664
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,020
 Assistant Manager Jang did say words like "mid-day meal and snacks." 

665
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,010
I also thought it was peculiar.

666
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,230
- Gosh, that's absurd. 
- That's nonsense.

667
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,390
This is it for witness questioning, and we'll wrap it up.

668
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,170
I'll see you on the judgment date.

669
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,600
Is it the end now? Aigoo, that's great.

670
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,860
Is it over?

671
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,360
 She's a bit better this time. 

672
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,640
You told me to get him to confess and settle.

673
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,360
Why did you suddenly tell me to fight to the end?

674
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,510
That case's commission for getting the divorce denied is 20 million won.

675
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,290
You need to win.

676
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,140
I thought you told me to fight for the

677
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:28,000
one in a million chance Mr. Park Jong Sik didn't cheat.

678
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,010
That's given.

679
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:35,190
By the way, his wife so badly wants to get a divorce,

680
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,350
but if they don't get a divorce...

681
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,050
Are you worried you might win right now?

682
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,360
You're arrogant.

683
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,320
No, that's not it—

684
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,740
Attorney Han, your attitude is arrogant.

685
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,590
I guess you think you can turn the tables at your will, huh?

686
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,520
Why did you change, then?

687
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,360
You said you trusted your client before.

688
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,710
You said the plaintiff has delusional jealousy.

689
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,660
That's when there was no evidence.

690
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,570
Stop trying to play the judge and just do your job as an attorney.

691
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,200
Gosh! You're totally an attorney from dramas.

692
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:25,150
I'm going to take the subway and go back to the office.

693
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,900
You sure waste your energy for no good reason.

694
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,860
- Great timing! 
- Mom!

695
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,170
This young little wench—

696
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,540
Ma'am, you can't talk to me like that or hit me.

697
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,790
Attorney, you can go.

698
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,520
- Sure.
 - Let go.

699
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,100
You're the worst human being alive.

700
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,810
- Just go, Mom. 
- Mom, don't bother.

701
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:56,750
- Just go. Let's just go!
 - How can I not bother?

702
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,390
I can't even sleep when I think of Eun Hui!

703
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,460
You wrote a statement for 30 million won?

704
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,730
You know how I raised you.

705
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,140
How can you do this to your mom?

706
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,410
Have you gone mad?

707
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,390
What's this?

708
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,610
How come you're here?

709
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,410
You said you're too busy to come to the trial.

710
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,850
Right...

711
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,380
This is where you were scheming together, huh?

712
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,410
No, that's not it.

713
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,300
- Stop doing this here and—
 - Hey.

714
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,980
Be honest with me.

715
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,800
You two slept together, right?

716
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,680
Just admit it now!

717
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,080
Apologize right now.

718
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,380
You should apologize.

719
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,450
You spew lies as soon as you get paid like a vending machine

720
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:00,320
and go around ruining other people's lives!

721
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,250
Your family turned against you because you're this impossible!

722
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,680
I'd be sick of it, too!

723
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,490
- What?
 - Stop it already!

724
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,300
I'm so sick of this.

725
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,840
Doing this for twenty years wasn't enough? Please!

726
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,650
Please stop it now.

727
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,130
What do you even know?

728
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,590
What does a young lawyer even know?

729
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:53,200
The reason I'm this impossible and why I ended up like this.

730
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,200
This is that man's sixth affair since Min Jun was five years old.

731
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,830
I saw...

732
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,300
you doing...

733
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:13,600
that crap in our bedroom with a different woman every time...

734
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,970
I saw it all! I did.

735
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,030
What are you talking about? I said you were mistaken.

736
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,060
Let's withdraw it and give it another shot together. Okay?

737
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,940
No!

738
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,420
I won't tell you to admit it.

739
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,030
So, divorce me, at least.

740
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,020
Let me go, asshole!

741
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:05,690
 This is that man's sixth affair since Min Jun was five years old. 

742
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,090
 I won't tell you to admit it. So, divorce me, at least. 

743
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,840
 Let me go, asshole! 

744
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,650
I lost.

745
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,450
I couldn't even get a division of property.

746
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:17,590
I even have to pay for that asshole's legal fees!

747
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:21,480
How can the laws be like this?

748
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:45,070
 Attorney Han Yu Ri 

749
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,140
 Hello? 

750
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,480
Isn't this Mr. Park Jong Sik's phone?

751
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,720
Honey.

752
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,050
 Honey, it's your attorney. 

753
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,980
 Aigoo, Attorney Han. I was in the bathroom. 

754
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,740
 What came of the ruling? 

755
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,680
You won.

756
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,310
I see.

757
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,630
Thank you.

758
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,860
You made it, Attorney Cha.

759
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,300
All right. Please sit inside.

760
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,750
You made it.

761
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,040
I'll pour you a shot now, then.

762
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,220
Attorney Cha, thank you for your work.

763
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,590
You, too, Attorney.

764
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,410
- Thank you for your work.
 - Thank you.

765
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,850
I need to go do the radio, so I'll leave after this.

766
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,220
Gosh, what a shame. You should stay a bit longer.

767
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,440
Attorney Han, you, too.

768
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,740
You did the most work today.

769
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,650
Y-Yes.

770
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,620
- Let me pour you one.
 - Thank you.

771
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,610
Don't get too excited just because you won.

772
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,720
I hope you'll learn in a humble manner going forward.

773
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,020
If you don't like that, open up your office now.

774
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,600
Attorney Cha's saying that again for no reason.

775
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,970
Congrats on your win.

776
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,810
- All right.
 - Congrats on your win!

777
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,840
Congratulations!

778
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,060
Attorney Jeon, let's do one more round since she won. Just one more.

779
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,970
It's too late.

780
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,060
Get home safe.

781
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,180
Why are you only sending me home?

782
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:03,520
Attorney Han Yu Ri, I called for a driver. Do you want a ride?

783
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,890
No, I'm fine.

784
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,900
I didn't drink a lot.

785
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,090
Also, I'm going to go back to the office.

786
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:13,810
Again?

787
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,230
You won, but why the long face?

788
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,510
I don't know.

789
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,190
I did win, right, Attorney Jeon?

790
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,370
The first cases never feel right whether you win or lose.

791
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:35,500
You'll see the cases more clearly from now on.

792
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,350
So, don't beat up yourself on your first try.

793
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,820
Yes.

794
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,220
Also, Attorney Cha doesn't really say it,

795
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,920
but I'm sure she's proud of you.

796
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,490
Let's keep the wins coming.

797
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,470
Thank you.

798
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,420
I'll get going first. Please get home safe.

799
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,940
Take care.

800
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,460
 Hello, this is Moon Ji Ae from Moon Ji Ae's Every Day. 

801
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:16,300
 Would anyone disagree with me if I call her the National Divorce Attorney? 

802
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,290
 We have Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong with us today. 

803
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,160
 Hello, I'm Cha Eun Gyeong, your attorney. 

804
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,180
 Yes. Attorneys do their best, 

805
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,980
 but it's not like they win all the time. 

806
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,060
 You must be afraid of the result sometimes. 

807
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,500
 You might even get resented. 

808
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,980
Aigoo. She cares not an ounce about such things.

809
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,590
Don't worry.

810
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,000
If I fight for each and every case as my own,

811
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,710
I always end up with the result I want.

812
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,210
 You always meet people who want a divorce. 

813
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,970
 But how do you keep your family happy together all the time? 

814
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,210
 It's really amazing what you do. 

815
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:55,380
I always consider my family my top priority.

816
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,170
That might be why I can understand my clients who are

817
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,440
at the last resort after doing their best

818
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,770
 and love the work I do. 

819
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:07,950
-  Yes, that was a great response fitting your title.  
- Respect.

820
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,880
 I also know because I'm married. 

821
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,760
 But people often put their families second because they're too busy with work. 

822
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,130
- Thank you for today.
 - Thank you for today.

823
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,640
- What is it at this hour?
 -  Attorney Cha. 

824
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,390
 You forgot the trial records for tomorrow, so I wanted to let you know. 

825
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:34,700
Oh, really? Please tell someone to drop them off at my house.

826
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,070
They all went to a company dinner and went home.

827
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,260
I also have plans. I apologize.

828
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,220
Not at all. I'll go.

829
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,790
 Congratulations on your first win. 

830
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,730
 Verdict one. 

831
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:37,580
 The plaintiff's request is denied. 

832
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,440
 I lost. 

833
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,910
 Verdict two. The litigation costs... 

834
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,800
 I even have to pay for that asshole's litigation fees! 

835
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,530
 will be covered by the plaintiff. 

836
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:55,940
 The text messages between the first and the second defendant 

837
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,840
 - the plaintiff submitted...  
- She's gone, she's gone.

838
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:03,610
 aren't enough to say the defendants committed an immoral act. 

839
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,720
 Also... 

840
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:15,280
 the son of the defendant and the plaintiff supports the first defendant. 

841
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:23,570
 It also seems the plaintiff and the first defendant can restore their love and trust. 

842
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:30,900
 So, it's hard to conclude their marriage is ruined without hope of reconciliation. 

843
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:05,920
 Resignation Letter 

844
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:13,860
 I, Attorney Han Yu Ri... 

845
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,910
 Oh, that's right. Attorney Han. 

846
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,950
 There's an amazing place on the 16th floor. 

847
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,590
 It's called the Complete Relaxation Room. 

848
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:26,570
 Go lie there when working late, 

849
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,920
 and you'll totally pass out. 

850
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,050
 Jo Jeong Hyeon, Ha Jin Yeong 

851
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,760
 Complete Relaxation Room 

852
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,240
We have a doctor in our office?

853
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,310
You didn't know? He's Attorney Cha's husband.

854
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,460
He's our medical advisor.
  Kim Ji Sang 

855
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,890
Speak of the devil.

856
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,360
That's him right there.

857
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,080
He's Attorney Cha's husband.

858
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,620
His office is on the 16th floor.

859
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,410
Attorney Han?

860
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:24,850


861
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,350
♫  Facing challenges, I persiste  ♫

862
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,160
♫  Learning to navigate heavy days  ♫

863
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,040
♫  But, it's still hard  ♫

864
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,750
♫  Because sometimes tears will flow  ♫

865
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,610
♫  my reflection in the mirror  ♫

866
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:48,230
♫  will also blur  ♫

867
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,110
♫  Keep holding on  ♫

868
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:55,530
♫  In the end there will be a bright day  ♫

869
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:58,140
 Good Partner 

870
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,080
 I thought she was working overtime, but she was writing a resignation letter. 

871
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,180
 Console her if she wants to quit. 

872
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,620
 Please tell Attorney Han Yu Ri to come up. 

873
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,160
 What would you do, Attorney Jeon? 

874
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,180
 Me? I'd tell her right away. 

875
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,690
 But ignorance might be bliss. 

876
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,580
 You're coming to the hotel, right? 

877
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,710
 You were with Attorney Cha, right? 

878
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,800
 Your husband, Attorney Cha... 

879
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,320
 Director Kim Ji Sang... 

880
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:28,100
