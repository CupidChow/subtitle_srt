you shouldn't come running for clients...

27

to serve divorce papers and request money,

79
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,729
only to have a change of heart.

She graduated from law school at the top of her class,

91

and she has only won cases ever since joining our firm.

92
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,669
Right. Ms. Han is a talented attorney,

93
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,038
but since she lacks experience, Ms. Cha would be better...

94

Ms. Cha's personal life has recently been the talk of the town...

95

and could bring unnecessary attention to the case.

96
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,580
On top of that, she could be quite stubborn.

97

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,589
"The waterboarding..."

186
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,689
"rendered her to be terrified of water."

187
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,629
"He dragged the plaintiff by the hair..."

188
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,029
"which resulted in bald patches."

189
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,340
(List of Evidence)

190
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,009
There isn't any evidence listed.

191
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,489
Right.

192
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,600
Since there isn't any evidence,

193
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,930
any attorney...

194
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,139
would be able to get this dismissed.

195
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,109
It'll be all right.

196
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
I'll be fine.

197
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,450
If...

198
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,560
my misguided sense of duty...

199
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,489
and poor sense of justice...

200
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,460
hadn't driven me to protect Ms. Cha at all costs,

201
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,759
would it not have happened?

202
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,470
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

203
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,180
Come in.

204
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,859
Ms. Cha, were you perhaps...

205
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,399
notified?

206
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,899
Yes, of course.

207
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,570
I'm cautious with this being a VIP's case,

208
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,580
so can I come to you for advice when needed?

209
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,408
Well, there isn't any evidence attached to the petition,

210
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,950
and you were advised to push for a dismissal.

211
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,049
I doubt you'll have any questions.

212
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,590
That's probably why...

213
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:40,960
Mr. Oh gave you the case.

214
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,028
You will make sure the VIP's case is dismissed.

215
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,359
Bring me a dismissal,

216
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,659
and I'll hold off on firing her.

217
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,869
Absolutely, Ms. Cha.

218
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,340
I'll do my best.

219
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,710
Even without you, I'll make sure...

220
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,450
your absence is unnoticeable. So don't worry.

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,720
Break a leg.

222
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,619
Sure.

(Severe domestic abuse)

227

(List of Evidence)

228
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,929
The opposing party...

229
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,590
is claiming assault.

230
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,729
However, there isn't any evidence attached to the lawsuit.

231
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,498
I heard you wanted a dismissal.

232
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,399
Are you claiming that her accusations are false?

233
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:39,769
Yes.

234
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,680
It's absolute nonsense.

235
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,638
This is the fourth time...

236
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,680
Ji Young...

237
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,279
has filed for divorce.

238
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,090
Why does she keep filing for one only to drop it?

239
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,389
Well...

240
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,790
I'm guessing it's due to money.

241
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,899
Whenever she filed for divorce,

242
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,830
I paid her.

243
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,070
She'd then drop it...

244
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,570
only to file for it again...

245
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,570
some time later.

246
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,139
Do you have a list of the deposits made?

247
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Well, yes.

248
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,249
Just a second.

249
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,420
(Yoo Ji Young, 30,000 dollars)

250
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,460
(Yoo Ji Young, 30,000 dollars)

251
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,040
I love her so much...

252
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,570
that I want to keep her by all means necessary.

253
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:49,909
Ms. Han,

254
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,810
would you be able to get this dismissed?

255
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,190
Yes.

256
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,119
Without evidence, fault cannot be proved...

257
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,759
with verbal claims alone.

258
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:07,499
If the plaintiff doesn't have more evidence to submit,

259
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,929
the court will dismiss the case.

260
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,669
Thank you.

261
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,810
There's no need to worry.

262
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,010
Your case will be dismissed as soon as possible.

263
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,889
Ms. Han is the star of our divorce department, you see.

264
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,520
I'll put my trust in you, Ms. Han.

265
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,159
- Please get home safely. - Sure.

(Seoul Family Court)

267
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:05,990
Defense counsel,

268
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,020
you are arguing for a dismissal.

269
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,889
That's right. The defendant wishes to continue their marriage.

270
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,429
Plaintiff,

271
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,369
you insist you were assaulted, but you have no evidence.

272
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,869
Do you?

273
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:26,240
How do you plan to prove your case?

274
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,109
Plaintiff.

275
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,649
Speak up.

276
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:36,448
Do you really have no proof at all?

277
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,820
(Plaintiff)

278
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,990
No.

279
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,230
I couldn't...

280
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,330
get any evidence.

281
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,679
Ji Young.

282
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:03,439
That was cute.

283
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,449
(Defendant)

284
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,730
Even if it's not direct evidence,

285
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,000
do you have anything circumstantial?

286
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,029
If you were assaulted,

287
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,399
you would've exchanged texts, taped conversations,

288
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,540
or have records of treatments. Do you not have anything?

289
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,909
No.

290
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:46,119
The plaintiff is the one at fault.

291
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,619
She sued my client to extort him.

292
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,030
Defendant Evidence Five shows a list of transactions.

293
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:55,658
Each time the plaintiff dropped the lawsuit,

294
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,299
my client gave her...

295
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,929
tens of thousands of dollars, as you can see.

296
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,540
It wasn't like that.

297
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,439
I dropped the lawsuits out of fear.

298
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,449
(Yoo Ji Young, 30,000 dollars)

299
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,119
I wired an allowance. Drop the suit.

300
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,320
If you agree to a divorce.

301
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:26,790
You've been hit but never killed.

302
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,959
Drop it while I'm being nice.

303
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,560
Drop it!

304
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,340
The next hearing will be a negotiation.

305
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,138
Try to talk to find a solution.

306
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,310
(Defendant)

307
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,889
"Talk to find a solution?"

308
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:26,619
Please turn off the tap.

309
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,189
- What? - Turn off the tap!

310
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,000
Are you...

311
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,179
"He dragged the plaintiff by the hair..."

312
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:55,780
"which resulted in bald patches."

313
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,459
Are you all right?

314
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,990
Can I help you?

315
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,359
Help?

316
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,929
Help me?

317
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:12,070
You lot.

318
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,270
Don't you defend trash as long as they pay you?

319
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,909
People like you are the reason...

320
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,250
I'll never escape my nightmare.

321
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,129
Mr. Chun.

322
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,560
Can we have a short chat?

323
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,100
- Wait. - Yes, sir.

324
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:56,709
Yes?

325
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,550
I must ask you something.

326
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,449
Can you answer honestly?

327
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,719
I represent you after all.

328
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,350
What is it?

329
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,990
Did you really never assault your wife?

330
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,330
Come on.

331
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,168
I told you I didn't hit her. What are you on about?

332
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,639
In the middle of a road too.

333
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:24,939
Why?

334
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,439
Do you not trust your client?

335
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,820
If you lie even to me,

336
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,980
I won't be able to represent you.

337
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,489
If you don't tell me the truth, the case might not be dismissed...

338
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,560
What the...

339
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,699
I chose you because I thought a rookie would be easy to handle.

340
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,629
Why do you talk too much? I said no, so nothing happened.

341
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,409
Hey.

342
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,280
You.

343
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,010
I don't want to see you again, okay?

344
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:33,368
I told Ms. Ahn to register you...

345
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:35,040
as the new representative.

346
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:39,480
You are now the actual owner of Daejeong.

347
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,780
Okay.

348
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,319
I'll do my best.

349
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,458
Shouldn't we inform the staff?

350
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,060
I'd like you to keep it a secret...

351
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,159
until the paperwork is finalized.

352
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,859
There's someone...

353
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,260
I must tell in person first.

354
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,428
You're now the CEO...

355
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,530
of one of Korea's top three law firms.

356
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,639
Watch how you act so you don't cause a scandal.

357
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:07,709
Take care.

358
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,750
He's leaving.

359
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,389
I have high hopes for you, Ms. Han.

360
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,830
It's time for Daejeong...

361
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,030
to undergo a transition.

362
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,139
Hey. Do you know anything?

363
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,480
A transition?

364
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:44,179
What transition?

365
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,889
Do you know what's going on?

366
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,658
- No. - What about Ms. Cha?

367
00:25:58,659 --> 00:25:59,959
What was that about?

368
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,260
What's going on?

369
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,379
Yes?

370
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,090
Ms. Cha.

371
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,590
That...

372
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:33,889
didn't feel nice, did it?

373
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,230
No.

374
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:37,300
Don't mind me and get back to work.

375
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,070
Goodness.

376
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,769
I don't know why the CEO...

377
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,709
- is being so childish. - Ms. Han.

378
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,179
You're calling the CEO "childish?"

379
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,909
Oh, dear.

380
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,250
I'll be careful.

381
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,389
At times, at work,

382
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,520
the unacceptable happens.

383
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,589
Like it or not,

384
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,859
we were hired by Mr. Oh,

385
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,330
so follow the instructions you're given.

386
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,770
Why Mr. Oh treats me like that,

387
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,270
or why I took this case.

388
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:22,480
You don't know at all.

389
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,709
Do I have to know?

390
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,250
You asked for a follow-up service.

391
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,050
I take it back if that stressed you out.

392
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:42,659
I didn't take Chun's case because I wanted to.

393
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,500
Forget it.

394
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,439
Anyway...

395
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,409
I did it to look out for you.

396
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,689
Did you see that?

397
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,629
Is Ms. Han crying?

398
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,359
I think Cha Eun Kyung chewed her out.

399
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,829
She got angry...

400
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,100
about what Mr. Oh did and vented at Ms. Han, didn't she?

401
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,399
They had great chemistry. What do you think it's about?

402
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:25,869
Isn't it obvious?

403
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:28,040
It's about the VIP case.

404
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,239
Ms. Han's working the case solo.

405
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,749
The number one feels threatened...

406
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,148
the higher the number two climbs.

407
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:36,378
Ms. Cha is a core member of Daejeong.

408
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:37,550
Exactly.

409
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,520
Mr. Oh sent a signal by leaving...

410
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,060
the core member out of a VIP case.

411
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,659
He wants to fire Cha Eun Kyung.

412
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,990
No wonder they're fighting.

413
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,799
I feel sorry for Ms. Han.

414
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,199
Why feel sorry for her?

415
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,628
A rookie's replacing the ace.

416
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,928
It's Ms. Cha we should feel sorry for.

417
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,399
Leave it. Only the strongest survive.

418
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:12,250
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

419
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,030
(Bengbeng's Steel Roof)

420
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,869
You've had enough to drink.

421
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,310
Let me be.

422
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,070
I won't be able to...

423
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:37,840
go to sleep sober tonight.

424
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,080
Mr. Jun.

425
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,490
A domestic violence suit.

426
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,260
Have you tried one?

427
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,659
I've tried lots.

428
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,929
I joined three months before you.

429
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:55,129
Ms. Han.

430
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,300
It's the Chun Hwan Seo case, right?

431
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,040
It's hard to defend domestic abusers.

432
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,840
They insist they didn't hit anyone,

433
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:08,139
but once you're in court, it looks like they did.

434
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,148
And when you see the victims,

435
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:14,709
you get all upset and you feel bad.

436
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,879
It bothers you,

437
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,020
and you get perplexed.

438
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:25,659
When I was in law school,

439
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,330
I thought...

440
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,369
the law...

441
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,969
could offer people power.

442
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:40,969
But in reality,

443
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:46,050
there's almost nothing the attorney can do...

444
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,149
for the victim.

445
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:51,949
Oh, well.

446
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,850
All I have to do is do as I'm told...

447
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,820
and get paid for it, right?

448
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,260
Why does every single case pain me?

449
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,139
Now...

450
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,109
I don't even know...

451
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,609
if there's anything I can do...

452
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,280
for anyone.

453
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,590
Gosh. I had a lot to drink, didn't I?

454
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,490
- Yes. - I should go home.

455
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:29,958
Can you manage on your own?

456
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,729
You bet. I can get home by myself.

457
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,888
I'll drop you off.

458
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:36,159
What? No, it's fine.

459
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,969
I need time to think.

460
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,300
Thanks.

461
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,149
Help me?

462
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,449
You lot.

463
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:03,560
Don't you defend trash as long as they pay you?

464
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,259
People like you are the reason...

465
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,429
Turn off the tap!

466
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,760
I'll never escape my nightmare.

467
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,230
At times, at work,

468
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,199
the unacceptable happens.

469
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,539
Like it or not,

470
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,040
we were hired by Mr. Oh,

471
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,480
so follow the instructions you're given.

472
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,830
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

473
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,129
You asked for a follow-up service.

474
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,669
I take it back if that stressed you out.

475
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,709
I didn't take Mr. Chun's case because I wanted to.

476
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,080
Forget it.

477
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,250
Anyway...

478
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,919
I did it to look out for you.

479
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,810
You were displeased with how your case was handled?

480
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Well,

481
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:37,280
I can't tell if Han Yu Ri's my attorney or a detective.

482
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,689
What does that mean?

483
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,418
She grilled me if I'd really hit my wife.

484
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,159
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

485
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,000
I see.

486
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,658
Ms. Han...

487
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,300
likes to get the facts straight before defending someone.

488
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:55,070
I see how you could've felt.

489
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:58,510
It's not how I felt. She was in the wrong.

490
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:01,980
The other attorney that was mentioned. Cha-something.

491
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:04,709
- Ms. Cha Eun Kyung? - Yes.

492
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:06,510
I want her instead.

493
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,820
I should've bought her from the start.

494
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:13,619
Sure.

495
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,790
I'll switch your counsel to Ms. Cha.

496
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,230
This is the only time you can change attorneys.

497
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,100
Our attorneys aren't consumer goods.

498
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,699
"Buying" isn't the proper term.

499
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,009
Ms. Han.

500
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,250
Mr. Chun asked for a different attorney.

501
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,619
I'm thinking of adding Ms. Cha to the case.

502
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Jung.

503
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,329
I was given the case when I don't have the experience...

504
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,259
to handle VIP cases yet.

505
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,428
I'm being a nuisance to a great deal of people.

506
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,469
No.

507
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,199
I know what you're like.

508
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:06,210
You want to get the facts first.

509
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,339
Mr. Chun's attitude...

510
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,239
wasn't great.

511
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:16,380
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

512
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,289
You said...

513
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,420
you'd add Ms. Cha to the case.

514
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,118
Does that mean we'll work it together,

515
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,230
or will Ms. Cha take the case on her own?

516
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,659
I heard there was an incident between you two.

517
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:34,670
Do you feel uncomfortable?

518
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,500
- Do you want out of... - No.

519
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,540
No, Mr. Jung.

520
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:44,110
I want to work the case well with Ms. Cha.

521
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,860
Hey.

522
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,759
Eun Kyung, are you free?

523
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,388
Yes. Why?

524
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,229
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

525
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,460
Ms. Han asked Chun Hwan Seo...

526
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,770
if he really didn't assault his wife.

527
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:09,100
He took that as an interrogation.

528
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,009
He wants a new attorney.

529
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:14,439
I'll submit the form to add you to the case.

530
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,040
Why don't you work on it with Ms. Han?

531
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,810
Okay, I'll do it.

532
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,319
- I'll submit the paperwork. - Okay.

533
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:32,089
You asked for a follow-up service.

534
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,529
I did it to look out for you.

535
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:42,739
It must've been tough on Yu Ri.

536
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:47,009
(Form submitted to include Cha as counsel)

537
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:04,319
Ms. Han.

538
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,500
I'm sorry.

539
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,440
For what?

540
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,580
Your service has an unlimited warranty period, right?

541
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,779
You're my attorney.

542
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:34,449
If so,

543
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:38,119
should I take a look?

544
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:49,770
Let's wrap up Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case well.

545
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,440
That's how I can keep my spot, right?

546
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,520
- Ms. Cha. - Yes?

547
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,449
You can't go anywhere, okay?

548
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
Okay.

549
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,650
I'm Cha Eun Kyung.

550
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,719
Right.

551
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:41,589
Gosh.

552
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:48,799
I was told you asked for a new lawyer,

553
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:53,229
but Ms. Han is a star attorney on our divorce team.

554
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,499
Getting an additional lawyer instead of a new one...

555
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,069
and a defense of two instead of one will be better.

556
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,469
Okay.

557
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,670
I ended up...

558
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,039
causing trouble for many people.

559
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,110
Not at all.

560
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,449
I looked through the complaint.

561
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,080
The physical abuse is absolutely false, right?

562
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,089
Yes, of course.

563
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,259
I always told Attorney Han.

564
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,529
I can't live without my wife.

565
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,299
Please get it dismissed.

566
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:44,850
(Settlement Room)

567
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,989
I will ask the plaintiff first.

568
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,690
At the last meeting, you said you had no evidence at all.

569
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,130
Is it still difficult for you to prove your claims?

570
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,259
(Defendant)

571
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,468
This is the second meeting already.

572
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:09,880
If she can't submit evidence,

573
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:12,850
the claims of physical abuse will have to be quickly dismissed,

574
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,949
and there won't be much meaning to these settlement meetings.

575
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,060
I found an old cellphone I used to use.

576
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,988
I did recover an audio recording...

577
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,060
through a digital forensics service.

578
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,629
Could you listen to it, arbitrator?

579
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,630
Sure.

580
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,850
We'll have to go to the pool again tonight.

581
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,219
If you have a fear of water,

582
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,360
you should try to overcome it.

583
00:40:57,259 --> 00:40:58,488
Please.

584
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,429
Just the sound of the water scares me.

585
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:06,130
I'll be good tonight.

586
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,199
Let's decide that after we see how you do. Okay?

587
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,170
Oh, no.

588
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,710
(Recording)

589
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,179
Pool... What is this?

590
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,389
Every night,

591
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:29,119
he asked to get intimate.

592
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,520
When I refused,

593
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,060
he tortured me with water.

594
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,730
Didn't you miss me? I, for one, missed you.

595
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:43,469
I'm not feeling well today. Could we not do it today?

596
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:44,900
You...

597
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,110
Are you looking down on me?

598
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,739
I was already irritated because of those old men.

599
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:51,838
Are you looking down on me too?

600
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,580
How could I look down on you? You're the director's son.

601
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,719
What did you say?

602
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,489
You were mocking me, weren't you?

603
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,219
No.

604
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,230
No.

605
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,389
My dear Ji Young.

606
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,699
It's been a while.

607
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,630
We should go take a night swim, don't you think?

608
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,099
Honey...

609
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,270
- Honey! - Come here.

610
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,440
How dare you disobey me?

611
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,409
Darn it.

612
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,080
Hey.

613
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:29,380
- Didn't I tell you to be quiet? - Honey...

614
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,819
- No, honey. - Do you think I'm a joke?

615
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,190
- Hey. - Please don't...

616
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,819
Come here.

617
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,118
- I said, come here. - Please.

618
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:40,159
- Honey. Please don't. - Come here.

619
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:41,559
Do as I say.

620
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,360
Darn it. You splashed water on me.

621
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,399
You got water all over me!

622
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,629
I'm sorry.

623
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,199
- I'm sorry! - Darn you. Go in.

624
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:53,310
- Oh, no! - Darn it!

625
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,179
He called our bathtub the pool.

626
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,650
(Defendant)

627
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,480
This is absurd, arbitrators.

628
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,290
I didn't know evidence could be misused like this.

629
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,960
She has a fear of water.

630
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,559
To overcome it,

631
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,500
we got memberships at a hotel pool and went together.

632
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,868
She said she'd only go to a hotel pool,

633
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:22,699
so I paid thousands of dollars for that membership.

634
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,770
I can submit records of us entering the pool anytime.

635
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,469
(Arbitrator)

636
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,080
That's not true.

637
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,119
That's not true.

638
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,190
It's not true.

639
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,319
It's not true.

640
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,790
It's not true.

641
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,670
It's not true, arbitrator.

642
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:57,369
Please save me.

643
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,569
If I can't get divorced this time,

644
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:06,080
I think this marriage will only end when I die, arbitrator.

645
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,449
I'm serious.

646
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,448
- Attorney Cha. - Yes?

647
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:17,020
I think it would be better to proceed with them separated.

648
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,230
- What do you think? - Yes.

649
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:20,960
Let's do so.

650
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:22,560
Shall we go?

651
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:37,179
Please calm down. Is that all the evidence you have?

652
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,448
It's hard for the judge to rule in favor of divorce...

653
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,080
if you don't have more evidence than this.

654
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,119
Every night,

655
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,920
he checks my phone and deletes most things.

656
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:52,489
That's not his true face and voice.

657
00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:55,290
When he's out, he wears a mask. At home,

658
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,600
he becomes a different person.

659
00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:01,529
Please let me get divorced.

660
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,739
Please.

661
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,810
Please save me!

662
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:15,209
Being suddenly presented with evidence like today...

663
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,948
can disrupt our defense,

664
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:20,049
so please let me know important things in advance.

665
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,359
After the meeting is over today,

666
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,560
I'll bring you the pool entrance records, so don't worry too much.

667
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,830
All that evidence shows...

668
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,060
is that we went to the pool.

669
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,130
Is that so?

670
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:40,408
Then I will trust that nothing else will come up.

671
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:42,139
Yes, there won't be anything.

672
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,639
Just wrap it up soon.

673
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,679
- Yes, let's do that. - Gosh.

674
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:50,420
Mr. Chun.

675
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,219
The point of proceeding with the discussion separately...

676
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:57,460
is to keep your testimony from each other.

677
00:45:58,619 --> 00:45:59,630
This way.

678
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,139
- Please come in. - Okay.

679
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,409
We will order that a family investigation be done.

680
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,818
Ms. Yoo Ji Young.

681
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,719
We recommend that you separate your resident from Mr. Chun's.

682
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,319
Thank you.

683
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,089
(Defendant)

684
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,170
Mr. Chun.

685
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,980
I have some things to explain. Let's have a quick chat.

686
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,190
Please head out first, Ms. Yoo.

687
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,520
Okay.

688
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,529
Why do I need to get a family investigation?

689
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,339
Do I really need to do that?

690
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,439
Yes. When the parties involved do not agree on the divorce,

691
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,039
the court must investigate...

692
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,210
I'm getting a family investigation because you didn't do your job.

693
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:29,419
That's not true.

694
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,749
A family investigation is required when the parties involved...

695
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,920
Hey. Are you a parrot or what?

696
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:35,449
I told you to get lost.

697
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,460
Run your mouth one more time.

698
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,580
Ms. Yoo...

699
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,980
won't be able to get a divorce, right?

700
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Right.

701
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,960
The law seems so old.

702
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,630
If you can't prove it,

703
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,730
you can't get a divorce.

704
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,739
Defending your client within the boundary of the law...

705
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,779
is what a lawyer does, right?

706
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:44,158
(Railroad Diner)

707
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,690
- Woo Jin. - Yes?

708
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,290
Do you know Mr. Chun Hwan Seo well?

709
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:52,529
No, I met him for the first time for the MOU the other day.

710
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:53,869
I see.

711
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,139
Why, all of a sudden?

712
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,699
Something is bugging me.

713
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,540
Does the other person seem like a victim?

714
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:08,710
She had the face of a person who's been scared for a long time.

715
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,650
All plaintiffs in divorce cases look like that.

716
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,218
But was there something different from normal?

717
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:20,560
Well... It's just my intuition.

718
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:26,830
I think Chun Hwan Seo is going to get into trouble.

719
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,270
But that's just intuition.

720
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,179
It's not evidence.

721
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:42,279
Lawyers can't use intuition to make a case.

722
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:49,819
Right.

723
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,460
You're right.

724
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,730
You said you had something to tell me. What is it?

725
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:59,060
No, it's nothing.

726
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,799
Let's talk after the Chun Hwan Seo case gets wrapped up.

727
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:05,400
Okay.

728
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:20,619
I apologize for causing concern.

729
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,219
The young lawyer seemed rude.

730
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,230
Young people these days are a bit...

731
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:27,729
They say whatever they want.

732
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,460
I apologize if you were offended.

733
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,529
I heard Attorney Jung assigned Attorney Cha to the case.

734
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,469
This time, I want to meet them myself.

735
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:35,929
Of course.

736
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:37,940
I'll schedule a meeting right away.

737
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,549
I'm getting a family investigation because you didn't do your job.

738
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,920
Hey. Are you a parrot or what?

739
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,520
I told you to get lost.

740
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,409
Are you busy?

741
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,778
No. Do you have something to tell me?

742
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:21,850
I heard you were handling Mr. Chun's case with Ms. Han.

743
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,850
I'm going to Chun Foundation right now.

744
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,619
If you're available, let's go together.

745
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,449
Yes, I can go.

746
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,360
- Should we go in my car? - Okay.

747
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:32,659
Come down when you're ready.

748
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,778
I don't think I've ever seen you...

749
00:51:49,779 --> 00:51:51,339
visit a client personally.

750
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,749
For Mr. Chun Hwan Seo's case,

751
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,880
you should personally visit him to provide updates.

752
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:59,750
They'll be our biggest source of income for a while.

753
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,549
Yes, I understand.

754
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,389
Is it going well?

755
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,888
Yes.

756
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:09,459
There has been no clear evidence whatsoever.

757
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,400
So you don't have to worry.

758
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,230
Of course, you should do well.

759
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,440
After taking a younger lawyer's case.

760
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:33,119
- Gosh. Director Chun. - Gosh.

761
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,520
(Director's Office)

762
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:51,339
I've caused you a lot of trouble because of my son.

763
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,540
Not at all.

764
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,110
Our construction and civil teams are great,

765
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,080
but our divorce team is great too.

766
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,179
Attorney Cha here will take care of everything.

767
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,380
Isn't that right, Ms. Cha?

768
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:09,888
Yes. Attorney Cha will make sure...

769
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:13,259
you get the result you want, so don't worry, Director Chun.

770
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,460
I'll put my trust in Daejeong, Managing Partner Jung Woo Jin.

771
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,339
From your face,

772
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,439
I guess Mr. Jung didn't tell you...

773
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,940
that he would become the new managing partner.

774
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:30,139
Since Director Chun is here, let's talk about that later.

775
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:33,709
Please look after my son, Director Chun.

776
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,549
I should be asking for your son to look after me.

777
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:37,619
Right.

778
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:43,118
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment,

779
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,520
so I'll have to get going.

780
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,429
Oh, sure.

781
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,959
Should we go have dinner together?

782
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,529
- Let's do so. - Okay.

783
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:09,679
Did you hear Mr. Oh's son works at our firm?

784
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:11,480
I think...

785
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,389
it must be Jun Eun Ho.

786
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,759
Did you see him leave exactly one minute before the hour?

787
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:20,029
Nobody but the son could do something like that.

788
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,860
Isn't he too young?

789
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,360
Please look after my son, Director Chun.

790
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,000
I should be asking for your son to look after me.

791
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,040
From your face,

792
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,309
I guess Mr. Jung didn't tell you...

793
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,770
that he would become the new managing partner.

794
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,040
Why don't you ever tell me?

795
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:40,080
Let's be honest with each other.

796
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,549
We're a team.

797
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,100
Eun Kyung. Wait...

798
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:11,339
(Law Firm Daejeong)

799
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,790
I'm sorry for letting you find out that way.

800
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:23,159
It's been 14 years.

801
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,329
How could you lie to me every day for 14 years?

802
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,860
I didn't mean to lie to you.

803
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,600
I was going to tell you everything after the case was over...

804
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,599
I'm sure you had to wait until the case was over.

805
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,500
Because Daejeong would make a lot of money from Chun Foundation.

806
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,670
Your actions finally make sense.

807
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:43,110
Eun Kyung.

808
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:46,080
You knew Chun Hwan Seo...

809
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:48,850
assaulted Yoo Ji Young, didn't you?

810
00:55:50,049 --> 00:55:53,080
You knew, yet you were ingratiating yourself with Chun Foundation.

811
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:55,119
Do you really think I'd do that?

812
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,429
Because Mr. Oh was...

813
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:05,159
- trying to fire you... - So?

814
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:08,299
Are you saying...

815
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,469
you told me to defend that piece of trash to protect me?

816
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:13,238
Is that why you told me...

817
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:14,669
to steal my junior's case and take the VIP's case?

818
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,739
That's right.

819
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:17,509
To protect you.

820
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,679
I must've looked like a fool to you.

821
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,880
Was it fun?

822
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,219
Fun?

823
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,548
Why do you say it like that?

824
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:29,449
I thought you wanted to be honest because we're a team.

825
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,989
Jung Woo Jin.

826
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:32,819
Jung Woo Jin.

827
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,630
You're contradicting yourself.

828
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,658
You'd take Chun Foundation's son's case,

829
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:40,968
but it's not about money.

830
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:42,329
And you never mentioned it for ten years,

831
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,569
but you didn't mean to deceive me?

832
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,170
You know that's not what it means.

833
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:55,909
Anyway,

834
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,619
take care of the case until the end.

835
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,520
Is that an order?

836
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,960
If you're going to give me that attitude...

837
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:09,790
Fine, I'll say it's an order.

838
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,330
You know a contract is a promise you must keep more than anyone.

839
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,130
- Does Ms. Cha know? - What?

840
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:49,798
Why did you guide him to that room?

841
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,238
He just walked in there even before I could stop him.

842
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,040
- Hello. - Hello.

843
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:00,179
Ms. Cha.

844
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
What?

845
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:06,819
Chun Hwan Seo is in your office.

846
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,219
Okay.

847
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,389
Wait inside.

848
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,270
Who said you could be here without my permission?

849
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,238
What? I can't?

850
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,969
What brings you here without a heads-up?

851
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,279
Are you here to apologize for what happened last time?

852
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:33,179
For goodness' sake.

853
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,580
I'm the one who deserves an apology.

854
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,190
What?

855
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,759
I mean,

856
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,489
you said you'd end it soon.

857
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:50,429
What? You want some money?

858
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,060
How much do you want?

859
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,969
Now that you've revealed yourself, tell me the truth.

860
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,150
When she claimed that you tortured her with water,

861
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,679
it wasn't just a claim but the truth, right?

862
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,330
Yes.

863
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:26,199
You got that right.

864
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:28,929
So? What are you going to do about it?

865
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,369
So...

866
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,540
defend me with your utmost effort.

867
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:39,940
Unless you want to end up like her too.

868
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:42,779
If the court approves our divorce,

869
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:46,479
you think I'd let Yoo Ji Young go?

870
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,589
No.

871
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:51,290
I'm going to kill that wench.

872
00:59:56,529 --> 00:59:58,900
Unless you want to see someone dead,

873
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:07,110
get your job done. Understood?

874
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:16,210
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

875
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,389
Yes?

876
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:31,060
Ms. Cha, what was Chun Hwan Seo doing here?

877
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,699
Nothing. Don't mind him.

878
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,480
Darn it.

879
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,219
Gosh.

880
01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:56,089
She's being a pain in the butt again.

881
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,230
Mom.

882
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:05,229
What are you doing here again?

883
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,869
How many times is this?

884
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,270
Let me live here.

885
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:11,899
I'm too scared to live with him.

886
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,000
I told you.

887
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,269
If you get divorced, you're not welcome here.

888
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,469
Mom.

889
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,940
I'm telling you. He hits me.

890
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:22,408
You can't do this to me.

891
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:23,548
Hit you?

892
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:26,380
He said the fight became intense, and you pushed each other.

893
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,850
- He apologized for that. - Who?

894
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,659
Hwan Seo called me.

895
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,440
Mother.

896
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,939
I'm sorry that this always happens.

897
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,839
Oh, no. Don't say that. It's my bad.

898
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,980
Mother, then we'll get back home.

899
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,980
Let's go.

900
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,420
Ji Young.

901
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,159
Do you have a death wish?

902
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,980
I heard Chun Hwan Seo came by.

903
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:29,049
- Why did he come? - Han Yu Ri and I...

904
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:31,920
will drop out of Chun Hwan Seo's case.

905
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:37,560
Is this about Chun Hwan Seo's attitude?

906
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,330
It's not about his attitude. The truth keeps bothering me.

907
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:43,158
A contract is a promise I must keep,

908
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,929
but I won't be able to keep that promise this time.

909
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,170
If I have to leave Daejeong...

910
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,739
for this reason,

911
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,049
I'll do that.

912
01:03:05,779 --> 01:03:07,619
- Eun Kyung... - And I have a favor to ask you.

913
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,659
Keep your eye on Chun Hwan Seo.

914
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,230
He told me he'd kill Yoo Ji Young.

915
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,500
What do you mean?

916
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,610
When she claimed that you tortured her with water,

917
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,380
it wasn't just a claim but the truth, right?

918
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,940
Yes.

919
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,679
- Wait inside. - You got that right.

920
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:37,119
So? What are you going to do about it?

921
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:39,880
If the court approves our divorce,

922
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,789
you think I'd let Yoo Ji Young go?

923
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:43,819
No.

924
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,659
I'm going to kill her.

925
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:07,080
Unless you want to see someone dead,

926
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:11,980
get your job done. Understood?

927
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:17,290
I'll separate Yoo Ji Young from him.

928
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:18,819
You should take care of the rest.

929
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:22,589
Okay. I'll do that.

930
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,159
Okay.

931
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:38,909
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

932
01:04:51,089 --> 01:04:53,460
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

933
01:05:00,259 --> 01:05:01,699
- Hello? - Hi.

934
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,270
Ms. Cha?

935
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,069
I think you need to come to my house now.

936
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:41,469
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

937
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:53,750
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo?

938
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,089
Mr. Chun Hwan Seo, are you home?

939
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,460
Ms. Yoo Ji Young?

940
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,960
Hi. You're here.

941
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,440
Where's Ms. Yoo?

942
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,949
Ms. Yoo?

943
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,580
Ms. Yoo.

944
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,949
Ms. Yoo.

945
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:31,089
Ms. Yoo, can you hear me?

946
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:36,129
If the court approves our divorce,

947
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,428
you think I'd let Yoo Ji Young go?

948
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:39,698
- No. - Please help me.

949
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:41,269
I'm going to kill her.

950
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,369
If I can't get divorced this time,

951
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,770
I think this marriage will only end when I die.

952
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,270
It's just my intuition.

953
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,339
I think Chun Hwan Seo is going to get into trouble.

954
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,319
(Good Partner)

955
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:38,520
If that's what my attorney thinks,

956
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:43,960
I'm going to do the same to your daughter.

957
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:47,698
If I were any faster, she would've survived.

958
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,900
To prove his intention to kill, the evidence wasn't enough.

959
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,638
I want to uncover the truth about Yoo Ji Young's death.

960
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,670
It could put you in danger.

961
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:57,909
I witnessed the scene.

962
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,448
I will give up on my right to refuse to testify, and I will testify.

963
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:02,509
(Witness)
