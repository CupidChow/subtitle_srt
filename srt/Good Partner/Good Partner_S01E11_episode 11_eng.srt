1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,290
 Good Partner 

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,300
 Daejeong 

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,990
 In session | Plaintiff 

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:35,000


5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,990
 Good Partner 

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,480
 This drama is fiction. 

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,400
 Characters, places, agencies, events, organizations, and the setting have no connection to real life. 

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,980
 Child actors were filmed under safe conditions. 

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,490
 Episode 11 

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,680
I'll be in middle school soon.

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,000
You don't have to drop me off.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Are you pushing me away just because you grew up a bit?

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,670
You're still a baby in my eyes.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,610
I couldn't do it all this time.

15
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,400
Whether you're in middle school or high school, let me do it.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,380
Okay?

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,070
Fine.

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,090
 Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong 

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,480
 Dear Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong, the most awesome dolsing* in the world,  
(*Korean for divorced solo)

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,170
 please live happily ever after. 

21
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,350
 Call for me whenever you need after-service. 

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,770
 I'll come running. 

23
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,050
 Legal Representative Attorney Han Yu Ri. 

24
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,280
After-service?

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,610
Seriously, Han Yu Ri.

26
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,370
- Yes?
 - Attorney Cha!

27
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,370
CEO was looking for you earlier.

28
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,910
He says to come to his office when you're in.

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,050
- Yes.
 - Okay.

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,150
Yes?

31
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,750
Can't believe...

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,350
you're late, Attorney Cha.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,990
Take a seat.

34
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,510
Yes.

35
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,340
It's been noisy with your personal matters, Attorney Cha.

36
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,010
And it's all over now.

37
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,940
I wanted to hear your plan. That's why I called you in.

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,080
I had said I'd promote Daejeong's Divorce Team through my divorce.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,190
But I'm sorry I ended up settling and couldn't keep the promise.

40
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,740
I'm not trying to get an apology from you.

41
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm saying let's review if you must be in the Divorce Team

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,950
and if there's a need to keep the Divorce Team

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,320
as a separate team in a world where young people don't even get married anymore.

44
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,300
Are you saying we should get rid of the Divorce Team now?

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,480
You took the initiative and created the Divorce Team.

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,390
But I'm not sure if there's a need for a big firm to keep a divorce team.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,460
What kind of role do you wish me to take on in the future?

48
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,360
You've been working here for 17 years now.

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,440
Haven't you thought that growing in a firm has its limits?

50
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,290
Isn't it about time you consider other options?

51
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,980
Opening up my office...

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,830
Or are you talking about my resignation?

53
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,160
I haven't thought about that...

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,370
I thought I had shown you sufficient performance in the firm.

55
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,920
Why don't you take a few days off?

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,820
You've gone through a lot.

57
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,560
There are many mediations scheduled next week—

58
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,220
Even without you,

59
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,590
things will run smoothly as if you were never here.

60
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,830
So, don't worry, Attorney Cha.

61
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,580
 Case 11: Vacancy 

62
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,940
Hello?

63
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,550
 Oh, yes, Jae Hui's mother, is this a good time to talk? 

64
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes, Teacher.

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,870
 Oh, yes. It's just that... 

66
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,790
- Jae Hui got into an argument with her friends today.
 - Pardon?

67
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,660
 Jae Hui is a bit more sensitive than usual these days. 

68
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,800
 Is she like that at home, too? 

69
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,090
Well, she's been the same all along at home.

70
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,320
She was in a good mood this morning, too.

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,240
 I'm a little cautious to say this, 

72
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,110
 but children often feel the other parent's absence after a divorce. 

73
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,190
 I also think becoming aware of others' opinions is a factor. 

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,390
 So I think you'll have to pay more attention to Jae Hui, ma'am. 

75
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,530
Yes, thank you, Teacher.

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
Attorney Han, Mr. Lee Seung Jun is here.

77
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,460
Hi.

78
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
Mr. Lee Seung Joon?

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,250
Yes.

80
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,680
Please have a seat here.

81
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,160
You two can sit as well.

82
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,140
 Why did three young men come to the Divorce Team's office? 

83
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,500
Did you get a plaint?

84
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,680
You can give me that.

85
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,220
One moment. I'll take a look.

86
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,040
 Plaint 

87
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,820
 2. Immoral Act Between Kim Ha Yoon and Defendant 

88
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,530
 An adulterer? 

89
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,570
You got sued for damages for being an adulterer.

90
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm not an adulterer, Attorney.

91
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,160
- Seung Jun isn't. 
- Seung Jun really isn't.

92
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,350
Ha Yoon is-— I mean...

93
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,950
I really didn't even imagine that woman would be married.

94
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,200
She even had a son who was in elementary school.

95
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,840
How did you meet her?

96
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,550
It's called Hug Hug.

97
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,860
Hug Hug? What is that?

98
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,510
It's a dating app.

99
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,850
Seung Jun never even had a blind date, so we installed it for him.

100
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,140
But it's really nothing shady, Attorney.

101
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,440
Young people these days use this app.

102
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,160
 You've been working here for 17 years now. 

103
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,810
 Haven't you thought that growing in a firm has its limits? 

104
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,670
 Isn't it about time you consider other options? 

105
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,590
 Vacation 

106
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,300
Yes?

107
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,810
Attorney Cha, are you busy?

108
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,870
Oh, I'm going on a trip with Jae Hui.

109
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't think I took care of her during my case.

110
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,130
I see.

111
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,270
That's a great idea.

112
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,670
Don't worry about the office, Attorney Cha.

113
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,850
Please pay a lot of attention to Jae Hui.

114
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,420
Okay.

115
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,300
Attorney Jeong, here's the list of this week's new cases.

116
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,540
Yes. Thank you.

117
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,690
Attorney Jeong, did you hear?

118
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,830
Attorney Cha submitted a vacation request just now.

119
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,080
A vacation request?

120
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,310
I worked here for over ten years.

121
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,750
I think it's my first time seeing Attorney Cha going on a vacation.

122
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,330
Yes.

123
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,690
Seonbae, are you going somewhere?

124
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,750
I was just about to tell you, Attorney Jeong.

125
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,310
I'm going on a vacation.

126
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,780
Why so suddenly?

127
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,610
Nothing's going on, right?

128
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,320
Did you meet the CEO by chance?

129
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,940
Nothing's going on.

130
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,560
Why won't you ever tell me anything?

131
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,050
Let's be honest here. Okay?

132
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,870
We're on the same team.

133
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,810
There's really nothing going on.

134
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,990
Let me have a break, too.

135
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,170
For next week's mediation, you just need to go and sign

136
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,660
since the settlement proposal was submitted.

137
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,250
For the case with a motion to transfer,

138
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,640
I explained to the client that the estimated date is out.

139
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,940
I switched next week's consultation to an over-the-phone consultation.

140
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,520
- Okay. The written document for submission— 
 - Seonbae.

141
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,110
Don't worry about it and have a good time.

142
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,190
I got everything from Senior Manager Ahn.

143
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,040
Thanks.

144
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,610
Please take good care of the Divorce Team while I'm gone.

145
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,840
Han Yu Ri, too.

146
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,790
It's all done, right?

147
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,900
How can I prove this?

148
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,480
Yes?

149
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,280
Attorney Cha, do you have a minute?

150
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,680
What is it now? What's not working out?

151
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,260
Sit down.

152
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,800
This is a division of property schedule. Please take a look.

153
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,990
As you can see,

154
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,070
- the defendant has quite a lot of assets.
 - Yes.

155
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,440
But I think they'll get too much if things go like this.

156
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,780
- Is that all?
 - Yes.

157
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,960
But the situation is not in our favor.

158
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,730
Yes?

159
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,340
Hey, Attorney Han.

160
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,050
Attorney Jeong, do you have a minute?

161
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,180
Yes, I'm free.

162
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm a bit confused because the plaintiff's claim and the

163
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,210
defendant's statement are too different.

164
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,690
Could you please take a look at the complaint?

165
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,000
Sure. Shall we take a look?

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Thank you.

167
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's see...

168
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,280
 The plaintiff says the defendant intentionally approached his wife and seduced her. 

169
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,350
 But Mr. Lee Seung Jun claims to the contrary he was the one who was seduced. 

170
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,250
 Adultery cases are always like that. 

171
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,770
They say the other person seduced them first.

172
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:41,200
But why do you think the client's story is a claim, not a fact?

173
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,280
There's a part that's pretty tough to believe.

174
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Kim Ha Yun's husband's name is Hun, and her son's is Min.

175
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,350
But if you look at the evidence here...

176
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,880
Over here.

177
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,760
Lee Seung Jun clearly talks as if he knows about Kim Ha Yun's husband and son.

178
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,730
But when I asked Mr. Lee Seung Jun, he said...

179
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,100
"I also want to be by Kim Ha Yun's side just like Hun and Min."

180
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,230
 Complaint: Plaintiff: Kim Hun 

181
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,220
Hun is the husband...

182
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,540
and Min is the son's name.

183
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,320
And you didn't know she was married?

184
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,350
I know it's really hard for you to believe,

185
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,150
but they're the names of the moss she grows.

186
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,540
Moss?

187
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,610
Marimo. Moss.

188
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,670
They're mosses called Marimo. Aren't they cute?

189
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,990
Their names are Kim Hun and Kim Min.

190
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,670
The mosses' names sound like people's names.

191
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,560
Because they're my pet mosses.

192
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,730
They're family.

193
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,190
Claims like this are so absurd, Attorney Jeong.

194
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,650
I guess I should request the mosses as witnesses.

195
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,690
- It's too weird.
 - Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

196
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,740
What I mean is the evidence that proves

197
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,770
Mr. Lee dated the woman with the knowledge that she was married.

198
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,010
It's too perfect.

199
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,080
That's weird.

200
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,580
It looks like the plaintiff planted an item in advance for use as evidence.

201
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,230
Sorry?

202
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,590
Her husband, the plaintiff...

203
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,150
planted an item in advance...

204
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,610
Huh?

205
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,960
Could it be that...

206
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,320
a married couple schemed together to bring about an adultery litigation?

207
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,790
It's your job to destroy that "Could it be," Attorney Han.

208
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,230
But did you know this?

209
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,590
An attorney's "Could it be" can be quite dangerous.

210
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,220
Give it some thought.

211
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,340
Could it be...

212
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,690
Was he really fooled...

213
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,370
or is he denying it after committing adultery?

214
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,220
Even if I want to believe him, a moss is out of the question.

215
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,910
 It's called Hug Hug. It's a dating app. 

216
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,890
 Young people these days use this app. 

217
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,290
Yes, the dating app.

218
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,020
Dating app, Hug Hug.

219
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,640
Jae Hui?

220
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,840
I bought this. Do you want to see?

221
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,690
Ta-da. It's a set.

222
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,370
Let's wear this and go on a trip.

223
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,310
- So suddenly?
 - I took a leave.

224
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,410
You'll come with me, right?

225
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,760
Pretty, aren't they?

226
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,930
Yes?

227
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,990
- What are you up to? Working late again?
 - Hey, Attorney Jeon.

228
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,170
Whoa, it's already 10 p.m.

229
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,040
- What are you doing?
 - Huh?

230
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,300
Oh, this is called Hug Hug.

231
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,460
It's a popular dating app, apparently.

232
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,810
It's nothing, really.

233
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,990
You can go on home first today, Attorney Jeon.

234
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,900
- Okay. I'll get going, then.
 - Okay.

235
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,260
It's done, right?

236
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,910
We got everything. Done!

237
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,540
Done.

238
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,910
What about this, though?

239
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,980
The backseat. I'll load them up.

240
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,610
Mom, will they all fit?

241
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,350
Yes, I'll carry the big one!

242
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,160
It's my first time going on a trip with you alone.

243
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm cutting school on top of that!

244
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,240
Can't be.

245
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,820
It's really my first time.

246
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,190
Let's go on trips often from now on.

247
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,000
I won't excuse myself saying I'm busy anymore.

248
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,240
It wasn't an excuse. You've really been busy.

249
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,870
There. It's 25 cases for each of you.

250
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,220
Attorney Cha already organized them for you and

251
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,600
notified the clients in advance so nothing major would happen.

252
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,290
But they might still call you or require additional explanation.

253
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,260
So, she asked each of you to take care of them.

254
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,170
Wait, I already have more than fifty cases.

255
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,620
This is really too inhumane.

256
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,500
Attorney Jeon.

257
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,720
You know Attorney Cha and Attorney Jeong always keep more than seventy cases, right?

258
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,910
Fighting!

259
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,040
Fighting.

260
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,240
 Take care! 

261
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,390
That's because they're partner attorneys.

262
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,420
Gosh, this is nuts.

263
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,090
It just means Attorney Cha has that big a presence here.

264
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,180
Because absences make you realize the person's significance.

265
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,690
My goodness.

266
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,700
Where's Han Yu Ri, who said Attorney Cha is terrible and that she doesn't like her

267
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,400
on her first day of work?

268
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,850
I've fallen for Attorney Cha.

269
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,050
I admit. I like her so much.

270
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,930
For Han Yu Ri to say she fell for Attorney Cha...

271
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,520
As I expected, Attorney Cha is really competent.

272
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,170
I want to learn from her.

273
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,050
By the way, Attorney Jeon,

274
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,420
do you think you can help me out?

275
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,030
I can't! I already have enough on my plate—

276
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,740
What is it? Let me hear it.

277
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,000
Look at the camera?

278
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,060
Well, I think you can just relax.

279
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,210
Look this way just once.

280
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,990
Attorney Jeon, can you take a seat here?

281
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,640
- Here?
 - Yes. Relax.

282
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,450
Relax?

283
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,030
Try holding this.

284
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,310
Try smiling, too.

285
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,490
Are you taking a profile picture for our homepage?

286
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,740
You look too stern and too much like an attorney.

287
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,660
An idol. Try to look like an idol.

288
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,350
An idol? I'm not good at that. Be cute and stuff?

289
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,640
What? Whoa!

290
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,410
What's this? Why are you so good?

291
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,210
Please register here.

292
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,700
- With this?
 - Yes.

293
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,040
- Geez, this one is really weird.
 - No, it's fine.

294
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,670
- For your hobby, choose tennis,
 - Tennis.

295
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,430
- and cooking...
 - Cooking.

296
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,730
Choose twenties for your age.

297
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,940
- Twenties?
 - Yes.

298
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,790
There. Press it as you scroll.

299
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,230
Wh-Whoa, what was that?

300
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,610
What was that? Wasn't it Kim Ha Yun just now?

301
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,720
Scroll a bit slower.

302
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,480
You never get the same person again after you pass once.

303
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,040
- Slowly.
 - I got it. All right.

304
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,570
Next.

305
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,370
Next.

306
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,130
Scroll to next...

307
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,750
Jae Hui.

308
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,090
Are you okay, Jae Hui?

309
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,690
Do we have digestive meds?

310
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,570
Why? Do you have a stomach ache?

311
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,860
Yes.

312
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,340
Maybe because I ate the bread too fast.

313
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,950
What should we do? I didn't bring the medicine.

314
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,180
It's fine. I'll just wait it out.

315
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,890
You didn't know I get indigestion easily.

316
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,730
I'm sorry, Jae Hui.

317
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,130
I'll hurry up and find a pharmacy nearby.

318
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,070
It's okay. I'll feel better soon.

319
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,130
All right. I brought us some cold coffee.

320
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,400
Thank you.

321
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,170
Did you get anything?

322
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,830
No, not yet.

323
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I found her.

324
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,690
- This really works, huh?
 - Whoa!

325
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,260
I got you, Kim Ha Yun.

326
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,370
This is daebak.

327
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,420
I found Ms. Kim Ha Yun in the app.

328
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,230
She lied about her age, too.

329
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,770
Everything you said was true, Mr. Lee.

330
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,350
- See?
 - Do people lie to their own attorneys?

331
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,510
Yes, there are more than you expect.

332
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,910
I'm not 100% certain yet, but I'm skeptical about something.

333
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,830
Until it's confirmed, make sure not to say sorry to the plaintiff—

334
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:31,800
I mean, make sure not to say sorry to Ms. Kim Ha Yun's husband.

335
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,190
If you apologize, you're admitting you committed adultery.

336
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,440
Would her husband really reach out to me?

337
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,200
Be sure to remember what I said.

338
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,820
Yes, I understand.

339
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,640
What?

340
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,040
You said you'd help.

341
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,730
I can't really do anything about this.

342
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,070
Gosh, no, no, no.

343
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,300
We're not the attorneys in a drama.

344
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,980
- Why go that far, Attorney Han?
 - I'm really sorry.

345
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,580
But it's so unfair for Mr. Lee Seung Jun.

346
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,240
He's in his early twenties, his prime.

347
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,400
But he's stuck and about to be labeled an adulterer.

348
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
This is for justice. Okay?

349
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,630
Just this once.

350
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,570
No, I can't. What if something happens to me? Will you take responsibility?

351
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,320
Yes, of course. I'll take responsibility.

352
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,120
No, I can't. This isn't it.

353
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,350
Excuse me. Are you from Hug Hug?

354
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,330
- Attorney?
 - Yes, nice to meet you.

355
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,200
- Hello.
 - Should we play a game first?

356
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,010
Yes.

357
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,100
 Marigold Tennis Club 

358
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,230
- Can we take a break?
 - Sure. Are you okay?

359
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,010
You're good at tennis.

360
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,120
No, not at all.

361
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,410
Whoa, excuse me. I'm sorry.

362
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,980
I have low blood pressure.

363
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,460
This goes... Let me see.

364
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,600
Unfold it and...

365
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,100
Like this. Oh, I see...

366
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,000
- Are you done?
 - Yes, I got it.

367
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,780
I get it now. I looked at the directions.

368
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,400
Mom, hold on.

369
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,210
- Huh?
 - I think this goes inside the black one, not that one.

370
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,400
It says to use the black one here!

371
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,260
Look here. It's got the slit.

372
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,920
Oh, okay.

373
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,320
Right?

374
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,280
- Gosh. What's wrong with this thing?
 - Come on.

375
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,340
- Aigoo.
 - My goodness!

376
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,730
- Come on.
 - I'm sorry.

377
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,600
It's my first time doing this.

378
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,850
 No new notifications 

379
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,280
- It's not done yet?
 - Huh?

380
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,570
It's done. It's all done.

381
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,500
There.

382
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,180
Let's see how Mom's ramen tastes.

383
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,400
Gosh, it looks good!

384
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,050
There.

385
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,920
I'll give you some soup, too.

386
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,520
That's hot.

387
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,530
Looks good.

388
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,420
Go ahead. It's hot.

389
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,800
- Why aren't you eating?
 - You added scallions.

390
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,290
I hate scallions.

391
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,190
Scallions...

392
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,060
 Dad, you're still not done? 

393
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,790
 Hold on a second. I'll be done soon. 

394
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,900
 Boss, hurry it up. 

395
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,860
 I want the usual, please. 

396
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,260
 Chopped scallions and an egg? 

397
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,600
 Please skip the scallions! 

398
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,340
Should I make a new one without scallions?

399
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,460
No, it's fine. I'll just eat it.

400
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,050
Add eggs instead of scallions next time.

401
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,200
Eggs. I'll add eggs.

402
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,050
I will make sure to add eggs next time.

403
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,160
Please try some of this.

404
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,950
Aren't you Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong from "All About Divorce"?

405
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,120
Yes, how do you do?

406
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,190
Yes, my mom is Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong.

407
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,410
Whoa, Attorney Cha!

408
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,870
Dad was too busy to come with you, huh?

409
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,120
Yes...

410
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,190
Honey, what are you doing?

411
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,830
What?

412
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,710
O-Oh, hello. Honey, one moment.

413
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,350
Honey, you really didn't know?

414
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,110
Cha Eun Gyeong's husband cheated on her with her secretary.

415
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,730
- Really?
 - Yes! That's why they divorced.

416
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,630
Jae Hui, should we clean up now?

417
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,180
- You're full now, right?
 - Yes.

418
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,840
Let's clean up and take a walk with me.

419
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,150
You can give me that.

420
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,440
We have three schedule changes on Thursday alone.

421
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,850
Let's set a new date. Okay? Set a new date.

422
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,910
Ms. Kim Eun Suk keeps calling. What should I do?

423
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,800
Attorney Cha said she explained.

424
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,240
She's impossible.

425
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
What should we do? I-In that case...

426
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,550
- Senior Manager!
 - Yes.

427
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,070
Yes. Is there a problem?

428
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,360
I think we need to contact Attorney Cha at least once.

429
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,490
No, we can't do that. What should we do?

430
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,010
Should we contact her? What do we do?

431
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,300
- Oh, Attorney Jeong!
 - Yes.

432
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,120
Boy, it's crazy here.

433
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,490
A client said she'll only speak to Attorney Cha.

434
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,430
I think we'll have to contact her.

435
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,080
No, please don't do that.

436
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,320
Gosh, it's her first vacation in ages.

437
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,490
I'll explain it to her, so please send me the file.

438
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,880
Yes! Thank you, Attorney Jeong.

439
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,930
- One chocolate flavor, please.
 - One? You're not eating, Mom?

440
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,260
- Gosh, I can't eat ice—
 - You should just eat one.

441
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,540
Should I? One more chocolate flavor, please!

442
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,900
- Please enjoy.
 - Thank you.

443
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,050
- Welcome.
 - Hello.

444
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,760
Jae Hui go slowly.

445
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,710
Mom, look all the way over there. Whoa, look at that!

446
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,530
Jae Hui, aren't you scared?

447
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,450
Nope.

448
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,170
Just kidding. I'm a little scared.

449
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,690
Look here.

450
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,770
Let me see. We look totally different.

451
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,940
- I think we look alike.
 - What do you mean? I'm way prettier!

452
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,340
- Eun Chae, look there!
 - Dad!

453
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,750
He's taking pictures.

454
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,340
One, two, three!

455
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,700
- One more time.
 - One more time?

456
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,530
All right. One, two, three!

457
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,010
Okay! Eun Chae, hold tight. It's dangerous!

458
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,980
- I'm okay!
 - Aigoo, it's fine.

459
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,920
 Plaintiff Kim Hun, the Husband 

460
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,050
 Moss' (Marimo) name, Kim Min (Son) 

461
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,840
 Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi-do &lt;-&gt; Gangnam, Seoul 
 Three to four hours roundtrip 

462
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,560
- Look here, Attorney Jeon.
- Okay.

463
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,900
Kim Ha Yun lives in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi-do.

464
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,700
Marigold Tennis Court is in Gangnam, Seoul.

465
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,830
Exactly. It takes three to four hours roundtrip.

466
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,150
Who travels such distances to exercise?

467
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,510
As you said earlier, their goal isn't to exercise.

468
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,370
Also, at the tennis court earlier...

469
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,530
 Are you from Hug Hug? 

470
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,500
 - Attorney?
 - Yes, nice to meet you. 

471
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,710
 Someone was taking pictures of you and Kim Ha Yun. 

472
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,310
 It must be her husband, Kim Hun, the plaintiff. 

473
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:47,480
This couple knows too well about the evidence needed for an adultery suit.

474
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,470
 Let's meet tomorrow if you have time. 

475
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,580
 It has expired. 

476
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,520
 Gosh, it expired. 

477
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,370
 What should I do? I left my card at home. 

478
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,050
 Could you pay for mine first? 

479
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,740
 O-Oh, okay. 

480
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,660
 Could I get a membership, please? 

481
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,100
 For one or two people? 

482
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,720
 Two people. 

483
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,400
 Yes. 

484
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,420
 Straight and over. 

485
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,400
 A hotel's a bit... 

486
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,110
They've done lawsuit fraud many times.

487
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,470
If I went to eat kimchi stew and saw the mosses,

488
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,460
I'd become an adulterer right away, too.

489
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,940
Aigoo, thank you for not telling me to go that far.

490
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,080
Hurry up and come.

491
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,260
How could that be? I don't get it.

492
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,080
I don't get it.

493
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,010
What do you want to eat?

494
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,030
Mr. Lee Seung Joon.

495
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,910
You're Mr. Lee Seung Jun, right?

496
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,020
Oh, yes.

497
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,860
Hey, you f***ing cheater.

498
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,640
Even if you didn't get a proper education at home,

499
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,590
shouldn't you have at least come and apologized first?

500
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,020
I-I'm-

501
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,000
 I'm not 100% certain yet, but I'm skeptical about something. 

502
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,100
 Make sure not to say sorry to Ms. Kim Ha Yun's husband. 

503
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,990
 If you apologize, you're admitting you committed adultery. 

504
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,810
It must've been tough.

505
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,390
What kind of nutcase is this?

506
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,980
Hey, you f***er.

507
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,600
Are you messing with me right now?

508
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,220
Hey, Seung Jun.

509
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,470
If things go to a verdict,

510
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,440
you're bound to become an adulterer.

511
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,970
I'm doing this out of pity for your life.

512
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,790
If you give me thirty million won right now,

513
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,510
I'll just agree to settle with you.

514
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,680
Th-thirty million...

515
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,750
You'll pay, right?

516
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,790
Okay.

517
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,440
 Attorney Han, he said he'll cancel the suit if I pay him thirty million won. 

518
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,330
 I want to just pay him and end it. 

519
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,930
You can't! Are you saying you'll admit being an adulterer?

520
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,020
 That's absolutely not the case. 

521
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,960
You have to fight to the end, then.

522
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,850
I'm doing my best as well.

523
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,830
If I don't give him the money right now,

524
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,820
he'll come to my school again.

525
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,480
If that happens, I'll be known as an adulterer, Attorney.

526
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,060
Don't lose heart, and hang in there for a bit longer.

527
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,930
 I'll call you back. 

528
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,320
Mom, look. Didn't I do a great job?

529
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,920
Didn't I do a pretty good job, too?

530
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,690
I get to try all sorts of things, thanks to you.

531
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,820
- I saw them do this.
 - Mom, how did you know?

532
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,390
I also know a thing or two.

533
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,380
There you go! Jae Hui, try it.

534
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,860
- Is it good?
 - It's delicious.

535
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,920
Are you sleeping, Jae Hui?

536
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,770
 No new notifications.

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,710
 I hate scallions. 

543
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,460
 It's fine. I'll just eat it.

 It's fine. I'll wait it out.

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,780
 I thought I was needed both at home and at work. 

562
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,070
 But was it just a big misunderstanding? 

563
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:04,240

What will happen to the case otherwise?

568
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,640
Of course. She requested a verification of facts.

569
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,110
How can I help— Oh, my!

570
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,340
Excuse me. How may I help you?

571
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,230
Who's Jeon Eun Ho?

572
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,680
- Sorry?
 - Jeon Eun Ho.

573
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,510
I said, who's Jeon Eun Ho?

574
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,540
Hey, which one of you is Jeon Eun Ho?

575
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,300
Tell Attorney Jeon Eun Ho to come out!

576
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,550
Yes, I'm Jeon Eun Ho. What's the matter?

577
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,910
- Is it you?
 - Yes.

578
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,600
- What are you doing right now?
 - Let me go!

579
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,420
Has he gone mad?

580
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,610
What are you doing right now?

581
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,860
This is assault!

582
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,010
You'll wake up after a good beating.

583
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,120
What's the matter?

584
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,820
You're the higher-up here, huh?

585
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,380
I mean, this is a law firm, right?

586
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,160
That f***ing attorney slept with my wife!

587
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,220
What do you think about that?

588
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,600
- Who are you saying slept with whom?
 - Come on!

589
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,290
- Calm down.
 - How dare you!

590
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,260
Yes, sir. This is a law firm.

591
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,680
If you state false information in a public space like this,

592
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,740
it's defamation.

593
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,860
I'm calling the police.

594
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,240
Disgusting.

595
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,330
Hey...

596
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,060
You won't get away with this.

597
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:09,280
Also, the fake and real victims are revealed in the end.

598
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
How so?

599
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,770
The fake victim is in a rush

600
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,890
because he needs to take profit before his intent is found out,

601
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,650
so he can't wait around.

602
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,720
For example, he may threaten blackmail.

603
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,440
He'll do whatever it takes to produce fast results.

604
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,630
What the f*** are you looking at?

605
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,720
- Are you okay?
 - Yes.

606
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,910
- Attorney Jeon, are you okay?
 - Yes, I'm fine.

607
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,680
Attorneys Han Yu Ri and Jeon Eun Ho?

608
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,390
Come to my office.

609
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,040
So, Attorney Jeon is an adulterer.

610
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,710
No, I'm not. I'm definitely not. What are you talking about?

611
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,680
This married couple is a team of frauds.

612
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,380
This couple does this for a living.

613
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,900
Whoa, people like this really exist in this world, huh?

614
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,680
Attorney Han, you actually broke through the "Could it be" from back then.

615
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,470
But I didn't mean you should go this far.

616
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm sorry.

617
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,790
As the saying goes, never say never.

618
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,540
They're really such terrible frauds.

619
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,350
All right. So, what's the plan now?

620
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,370
We need to close the argument now.

621
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,140
  
  Ha Yun, I miss you. Shall we meet again? 

622
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,830
Look at this.

623
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,010
Whoa, he doesn't even care the husband came to his work?

624
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,020
He totally fell for me.

625
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,610
I think he's actually more fired up.

626
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,000
Geez, seriously...

627
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,780
Throw!

628
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,140
Jae Hui.

629
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,090
All right. This one's a fastball. Catch it.

630
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,330
Son!

631
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,760
- All right. Catch!
 - Yes.

632
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,600
Full power!

633
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,790
Your full power is nice.

634
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,710
 I'll throw you in. 

635
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,130
Fastball!

636
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,600
Jae Hui.

637
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,950
Jae Hui, please give me a hand here!

638
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,060
Could you help me with this?

639
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,600
The other side, please.

640
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,960
Nice! One more time.

641
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,130
Gosh, why is it so heavy?

642
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,440
One family bicycle, please.

643
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,250
You can take number three.

644
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,040
Let's go.

645
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,130
You'll be riding with your Mom and Dad, right? Three of you.

646
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,240
No, it'll be for two people.

647
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry. I thought it was for three people.

648
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
- Sure.
 - You can take this one.

649
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,320
Let's go.

650
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,950
- Is it fun?
 - Yes!

651
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,270
I'm fast, right?

652
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,230
I'll go faster.

653
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,860
Mom, in front of you!

654
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,320
Hey, Jae Hui. J-Jae Hui!

655
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,500
Wh-What do I do? Jae Hui, are you okay?

656
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,090
Look at me. Look at Mom.

657
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,360
Aigoo, wh-what's all this?

658
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,140
This tastes the best.

659
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,260
It seemed you're too busy to even eat out.

660
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,010
Do you usually eat here?

661
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,000
No, I usually eat out.

662
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,630
Aigoo, you even trimmed the cherry tomatoes. So much effort.

663
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:18,470
Hello, I'm Attorney Han Yu Ri, Mr. Lee Seung Jun's representative.

664
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:22,950
Attorney Jeon, what's the meaning of this?

665
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,680
It's a lunchbox this time, not kimchi stew?

666
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,780
You're really a fraud, huh?

667
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,460
I see...

668
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,840
- You're all in this together?
 - Huh?

669
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,520
You and your husband are the only ones in this together.

670
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,170
Why live like that when you're still young?

671
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,740
If your husband is taking pictures right away on your first meeting,

672
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,650
it'd be impossible unless you're a band of frauds.

673
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,420
Well, i-it's possible.

674
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,170
Do you want me to sue you for fraud and interference with business, then?

675
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,660
You interfered with the business of Hug Hug by uploading false information

676
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,940
and your husband even grabbed me by the neck.

677
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,340
So he'll be investigated for assault as well.

678
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,590
F***.

679
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,700
Attorney, I'm sorry.

680
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,970
I'm under probation for another fraud right now.

681
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,360
I really can't get sued again.

682
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,500
You don't need to apologize to me.

683
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,100
You need to apologize to Mr. Lee Seung Jun.

684
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,130
Honey...

685
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,230
I mean, Mr. Lee Seung Jun...

686
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,210
I'm sorry.

687
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,970
 Attorney, I'm sorry. 

688
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,280
 I'm under probation for another fraud right now. 

689
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,570
 I really can't get sued again. 

690
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,610
 You don't need to apologize to me. 

691
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,410
 You need to apologize to Mr. Lee Seung Jun. 

692
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,850
Call Kim Hun and tell him to cancel the suit.

693
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,300
Oh, and also,

694
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:45,140
if he also submitted a complaint against our Attorney Jeon, take care of that, too.

695
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,980
Right now.

696
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,220
Honey, they found out. Cancel them right now.

697
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,310
Lee Seung Jun and Jeon Eun Ho were a team!

698
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,590
Thank you.

699
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,330
I'm not the one who did this.

700
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,950
This attorney here sacrificed himself.

701
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,540
Aigoo, you don't need to say that.

702
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,090
You need to treat me to something delicious.

703
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:35,660
Thank you so much, Attorneys.

704
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,660
Please take care.

705
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,480
Take care!

706
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,760
 Railway Restaurant 

707
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,480
-  Cheers! 
 -  Great work. 

708
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,770
Attorney Jeon, I'm so sorry and

709
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,820
I'm tremendously thankful.

710
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,770
I'm sure you didn't want to do it.

711
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,520
I don't do things I don't want to do.

712
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,420
But I did it because it was with you, Han Yu Ri.

713
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,710
I'm really happy today.

714
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,950
Attorney Cha wasn't here, so I was really worried at first.

715
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:23,210
But I created a plan to prove my case and ran on my own feet to resolve the case

716
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,950
for the first time after becoming an attorney.

717
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,380
That's true.

718
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,020
It's the first time you did it entirely on your own, Attorney Han.

719
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:42,040
I can finally feel I really provided some real help in someone's life.

720
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,390
That's why I'm happy.

721

722
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,560
Seonbae, in what direction do you want our Divorce Team to go in the future?

723
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,180
A team that saves someone.

724
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,690
A divorce team that

725
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,900
opens up new lives, not putting an end to them.

726
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,360
It would've been great if Attorney Cha had been here.

727
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,930
I miss Attorney Cha.

728
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,910
- You get what I want to say, right?
 - Hurry up and go. Yes.

729
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,280
Wait, is this my taxi?

730
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,000
Yes. Let's talk tomorrow.

731
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,120
Wait! I need to take Han Yu Ri home—

732
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,070
- Why are you sending only me home?
 - Take care!

733
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,380
- Attorney Jeon, bye!
 - Why are you sending me home?

734
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,960
If Attorney Cha Eun Gyeong had been here, you would've been scolded.

735
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,450
But I still want to compliment you.

736
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:52,320
Attorney Han Yu Ri, you did well on this case.

737
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,530
Thank you, Attorney Jeong.

738
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,210
Please get home safe now. I'll get going first.

739
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,930
Take care.

740
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,400
One second, Jae Hui.

741
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,300
There.

742
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,700
Nice and slowly. Aigoo.

743
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,530
- Be careful.
 - Is the dad not here?

744
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,770
It's dangerous for you alone.

745
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,130
- Dad's not here!
 - I'm the only guardian—

746
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:34,770
I'm sorry. I'll...

747
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,220
I'm texting Dad.

748
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,640
Jae Hui.

749
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,510
Why?

750
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,400
Can't I text Dad?

751
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,820
You can text him. Of course, you can.

752
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,300
Didn't both you and Dad want me to be a child?

753
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,820
That's why I'm being childish right now.

754
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,030
Why can't I do this?

755
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,260
I mean... D-Dad's far away right now.

756
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,490
So, if you suddenly tell him you're hurt, he'll be shocked.

757
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,090
Calm down just a bit, Jae Hui.

758
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:18,600
He'll come even if he's far away!

759
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,030
I'm hurt. He needs to come!

760
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,700
He needs to come running right now!

761
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,930
I'm by your side right now.

762
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,680
It's true I'm a bit inadequate,

763
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,650
but I'm doing my best right now, Jae Hui. Right?

764
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,740
I just...

765
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,860
miss Dad so much.

766
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,120
I hold it in again and again...

767
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,970
but I miss him even more.

768
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,690
I really hate Dad so much.

769
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:20,290
But I still miss him.

770
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,690
Mom...

771
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:30,020
is Dad really gone from our lives now?

772
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,220
I-I'm sorry.

773
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,080
I'm sorry. It's my fault. My baby...

How odd.

00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,390
It's the same for me.

802
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:26,070
We have fewer places to go to while living only for work and home.

Cha Eun Gyeong's absence is huge.

Hello?

817
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,570
Can I get after-service?

818
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:47,640
Attorney Cha, is something wrong?

819
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,410
Both at work and at home,

820
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,270
it seems no one needs me.

821

♫  I feel that everything I had has disappeared  ♫

822

♫  That's something which couldn't be helped  ♫

823
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,150
What should I do?

824
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,640
Please give me...

 Good Partner 

834
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,310
 Just get a dismissal for the VIP's case. 

835
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,860
 I'll hold off on firing Cha Eun Gyeong temporarily. 

836
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,620
 The CEO gave it exclusively to Attorney Han Yu Ri. 

837
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:14,840
 I don't have the tenure to take on the VIP cases, but I'm on it... 

838
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,360
 Sometimes, unacceptable things happen. 

839
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,570
 I really need you, Attorney Cha. 

840
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,130
 Let's give our best and finish it well. 

841
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,550
 That's how we can protect my position, right? 

842
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:32,810
♫  It's going to be the start for you  ♫
