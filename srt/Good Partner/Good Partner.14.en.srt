(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

11
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:53,289
And I'm thinking of my second courageous act.

12
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,229
What is it? Do tell.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,359
- Together... - I'm leaving.

14
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,329
You're leaving?

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,029
I'll leave Daejeong,

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,440
and you'll stand alone out from under my wing.

17
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,740
Come in.

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,179
It's still not too late.

19
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,148
Do you have to leave the firm?

20
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,019
Do you know what employer-employee relationships...

21
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,880
have in common with marriages?

22
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,050
Not really.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,959
I thought they were my everything.

24
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,399
So? Has weight been lifted off your chest...

25
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,029
now that they're both over?

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, absolutely.

27
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,268
I'll be rooting for the new beginning...

28
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,810
of managing partner Jung Woo Jin.

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,549
I'll give you...

30
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,850
a proper send-off.

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,358
No. Rather than my end,

32
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,960
I want my new beginning to be praised.

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,560
Okay, I hear you.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,859
Thank you for everything, Woo Jin.

(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

37
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,199
Thanks.

38
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,840
Mr. Kang, I hope Poppy's surgery went well.

39
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,508
Were you aware?

40
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,039
I'm Cha Eun Kyung.

41
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,750
Did you think I didn't know?

42
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,419
- You did great work. - You too.

43
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,220
Ms. Ahn, hasn't it been 15 years?

44
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,289
It's been 14 years and 7 months, Ms. Cha.

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,789
You've been like this for all that time.

46
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,400
You noticed the details that I missed.

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I hope you know that I deeply relied on you.

48
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,039
Thank you, Ms. Cha.

49
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,369
Thank you.

50
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,439
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your father's funeral.

51
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,109
The trial in Jeju went on for two days.

52
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:39,950
I can't believe you still remember that.

53
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,379
It's all right.

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,450
I saw your schedule and knew you had a trial.

55
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,720
Instead, you were highly generous with the condolence money.

56
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,728
I was grateful for how you were always on top...

57
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,359
of my daily schedule.

58
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,669
You did great work.

59
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,400
Thank you.

60
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,410
Your child will soon celebrate its first birthday.

61
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,009
Yes, in two weeks.

62
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,109
You'll be less sleep-deprived by then.

63
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,280
I saw you always napping on your lunch break,

64
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,850
and I felt bad.

65
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,119
Right. Thank you for saying so.

66
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,759
- You did great work. - You too, Ms. Cha.

67
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Right.

68
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,390
- Thank you. - Thank you.

69
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,739
I thank everyone...

70
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,510
for their assistance.

71
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,989
Now, get back to work.

72
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:58,330
I'll get going.

73
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:14,679
Ms. Cha.

74
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,280
Hey.

75
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,649
I'll make the move with you.

76
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,710
No.

77
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,119
No matter how much I think about it, it doesn't feel right.

78
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,188
Your devotion to this firm...

79
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,689
cost you your marriage,

80
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,890
so how could you leave in a heartbeat?

81
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,760
Ms. Han.

82
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,429
Do you think my work cost me my marriage?

83
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:40,669
It didn't.

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,298
My marriage ended...

85
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:43,739
because our relationship wasn't strong enough.

86
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,039
Besides, I have already received a compensation.

87
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:50,479
I made a lot of money, gained recognition in this field,

88
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:52,710
and met a junior lawyer like yourself.

89
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,419
Then, take me with you.

90
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,289
I still have a lot to learn from you.

91
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,789
Ms. Han.

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,400
Learn everything you can here and make it your own.

93
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,270
And someday,

94
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,340
we'll meet not as employer-employee but as partners.

95
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,410
All right?

96
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,590
Come here.

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I'll get going.

98
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,679
The end of a relationship we valued the most...

99
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,080
hits us at a moment...

100
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,080
we least expect.

101
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,570
However, ending something of my own accord...

102
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,900
is a beautiful act despite what others think.

103
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,840
And now that I know...

104
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
an end signals a new beginning,

105
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,979
the farewell isn't all too painful.

106
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,700
This is the space.

107
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:59,040
I didn't expect so many stairs.

108
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,509
Isn't it spacious? What do you think?

109
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,389
It's exotic, but also elegantly modern...

110
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,690
which provides coziness...

111
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,868
- Gently. - This way, please.

112
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,940
- Sure. - Sure.

Yes. I'd rather stay here.

Yes.

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,509
Mr. Jun,

152
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,009
you've always wanted to work divorce cases.

153
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,309
Is that still your passion?

154
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,749
Yes, I like it at the divorce department.

155
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,119
I still have a lot to learn...

156
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,450
and would like to stay.

157
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,220
So you're saying you don't need time to think?

158
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:35,859
Well, I'm grateful.

159
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,259
Then it's settled.

160
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,590
- Sure. - Okay.

161
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:43,359
Ms. Han, your first choice was the corporate department.

162
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:45,899
Yes.

163
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,399
Seeing you on TV the other day made me realize...

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,940
you'd be great at public interest litigations.

165
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,579
How about you move...

166
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,609
to the Social Contribution Team we're greenlighting?

167
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,649
If you want, you may also move to the corporate department.

168
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:01,850
What would you like to do?

169
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Right.

170
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,690
Well...

171
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,460
First,

172
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,590
I'm grateful for that generous offer, sir.

173
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,330
May I think it through...

174
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,398
and get back to you?

175
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,440
Of course.

176
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,269
Weigh your options and take your time.

177
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,369
Thank you.

178
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,889
Do you remember that we ate here on your first day?

179
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,059
Of course I remember that.

180
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,528
You asking me to lunch on the first day of work...

181
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,699
completely threw me off.

182
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,329
But it turns out that our supervisor...

183
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,800
told you to keep an eye on me.

184
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,300
I was shocked.

185
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,369

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,008
Yes, I am.

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,138
Ms. Han, I'm a fan.

188
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,539
What? A fan?

189
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,249
I saw you with the picket outside the courthouse.

190
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,278
I thought attorneys were mostly brusque,

191
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,779
but you have a warm heart.

192
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,689
Thanks to how you gave strength...

193
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,590
to the victims during your TV interview,

194
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,690
my cousin went to a shelter for battered women.

195
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,060
Thank you so much.

196
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,659
Can you take a selfie with me?

197
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,959
A selfie?

198
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Just one.

199
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,529
Why don't I take it for you?

200
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:26,170
- Thank you. - Thanks.

201
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,139
I'll take a few.

202
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,238
Right. Here you go.

203
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,149
- Thank you. - Thank you.

204
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,679
We'll be rooting for you.

205
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,320
- Go, Ms. Han. - Thank you.

206
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,529
See? I told you you'd be a lawyer-slash-influencer.

207
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,560
That was so awkward.

208
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:54,899
Let's drink.

209
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,529

211

Woo Jin, come on.

212
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,190
That wasn't necessary.

213
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,720
I can't bring you your coffee anymore,

214
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,090
so I'll have this replace me.

215
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:56,220
Here's your coffee.

216
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:03,399
Congratulations on opening your own law firm. From Woo Jin.

217
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:30,930
Mom.

218
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,690
You're here.

219
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,859
Everything's all set now.

220
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,768
I like how it's within walking distance.

221
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:38,769
Right?

222
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,268
After school,

223
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,499
come by for a snack before going to the academy.

224
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,839
And I won't have to miss any of your school events again.

225
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,479
- Really? - Yes.

226
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,409
This is great.

227
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,310
Don't I have a room here?

228
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,009
Well...

229
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,290
Ta-da.

230
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,590
Wait. It's a playing area.

231
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,790
I'm not a kid.

232
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,929
There are mothers who bring their children...

233
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,658
when coming in for a consultation...

234
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,800
because they couldn't find a babysitter in time.

235
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,000
That's why I created this space.

236
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,669
Then it's not just for me.

237
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,638
It's not entirely yours,

238
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,770
but there's still space for you.

239
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,840
Also, I'm giving you a task.

240
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,949
Can you play with the kids...

241
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,719
when I'm consulting the parents?

242
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,320
Mom, I'm a minor.

243
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:33,189

That's right. I'm Mini Cha Eun Kyung.

246
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,499
Should the bigger version treat you to something tasty?

247
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,800
- Really? - Sure.

248

Yes. I love tteokbokki.

A detention center?

259
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,649
Hello, Attorney Cha Eun Kyung.

260
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,378
I'm Inmate 3978 Park Young Jin...

261
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,480
who is currently serving time for fraud.

262
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,449
My wife served me divorce papers,

263
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,119
and I need a lawyer.

264
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:18,659
As you know, I'm not in a position to go to you for a consult.

265
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,889
Could you please come see me?

266
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,270
If you bring a contract that states your services,

267
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,600
I'll sign it right away.

268
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,939
You may enter.

269
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,339
Will it be just me?

270
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,709
- Yes. - I see.

271
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,050
Gosh, hello.

272
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,990
Hello.

273
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,429
You were served divorce papers?

274
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,070
If a husband is behind bars,

275
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,428
the wife should support him.

276
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,399
How could she serve me divorce papers?

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,208
She could be overwhelmed if this is her first time.

278
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:06,340
Her first time?

279
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,080
I supported her through her incarceration last year,

280
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,050
and this is betrayal.

281
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:16,549
- Sorry? - When my wife was in prison,

282
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,888
I came to see her every weekend...

283
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,320
and wired money into her commissary account.

284
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,559
But after I got shoved into prison,

285
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,118
she instantly filed for divorce.

286
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,359
This is far from fair.

287
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,428
I see.

288
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:29,799
I had no idea I'd be betrayed by someone...

289
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,129
who knows about what I'm going through.

290
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,469

291
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,270
- CS? - Yes.

No, a club for those who did time.

294
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,740
CS.

295
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,810
- "Chul So." Yes. - "Chul So?"

296
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,319

297
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,320

Yes.

305
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,520
I'm the one refusing.

306
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,820
Don't write to me again.

307
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:33,629
Wait. Ms. Cha?

308
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,280

Darn it.

317
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:04,320
I should get a digital lock.

00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:14,659
You startled me.

323
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,159
How did you find the place?

324
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:20,769
I was hoping to get a tour of the office.

325
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,969

00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,709
Buy me a barbecue, then.

329
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,010
What?

330
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,948
- Drink up. - I'll do my best.

331
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:35,979
Will you?

332
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,049
How did you find me and bring a potted plant?

333
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,949
I checked the Bar Association site.

334
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,689
You'd registered your office already.

335
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,790
You're really something, Han Yu Ri.

336
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,858
Ms. Han? Give me the tongs.

337
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:52,729
No. Let me do the grilling.

338
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,369
Give them to me.

339
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
My gosh.

340
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:00,270
I'll grill so you can buy.

341
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,080
What?

342
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,409
You make more than me now.

343
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,449
So buy me dinner.

344
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,649
Ms. Cha. You're whining, aren't you?

345
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,289
I got a letter from a detention center...

346
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,118
and rushed right over thinking I'd earn this month's rent.

347
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,429
I didn't get the case.

348
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:22,459
What would've happened if you'd come with me? Gosh.

349
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:33,469
Ms. Cha.

350
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,279
Do you know you look a bit different today?

351
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,378
How so? I don't look as amazing now that I don't have the backing...

352
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:40,379
of a massive firm?

353
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,780
No.

354
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,850
You seem more true to yourself and at ease.

355
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:46,949
And...

356
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,330
We're equals now.

357
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Eat.

358
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,659
It looks good.

359
00:24:57,899 --> 00:24:58,899
Thanks for buying.

360
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:02,939
- Let's eat. - Let's make that clear.

361
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,240
I enjoyed that.

362
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,980
I was treated by a junior.

363
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,540
That was a first for me.

364
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,678
You're just starting out.

365
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,619
You'll flourish as time goes by.

366
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,290
I had heard I would feel cold on my own.

367
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,389
It's colder than I thought.

368
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,590
Oh, do you have a business card?

369
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes.

370

(Cha Eun Kyung)

373
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,550
What kind of a place is Cha Eun Kyung's Spring Again?

374
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,850
A place where a lawsuit is the last resort...

375
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,750
and an agreement is the priority.

376
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,819
A place that will help clients...

377
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,889
regain their springs as soon as possible.

378
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,699
If I were to liken it to a hospital,

379
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,868
it would be one that doesn't over-treat...

380
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,699
and hands out only the necessary prescriptions.

381
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,340
Yes.

382
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,379
So... Ms. Cha.

383
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,280
Mr. Jung made me an offer.

384
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,649
How about you move to the Social Contribution Team?

385
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:25,750
If you want, you can go to the corporate department too.

386
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,260
He asked if I'd like to...

387
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,990
switch teams.

388
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,259
Could you give me the right prescription?

389
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,000
I'd like your advice.

390
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:41,869
Ms. Han.

391
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:43,899
Yes?

392
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,810
You know you're the only one who knows the answer, right?

(Law Firm Spring Again)

395
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,139
I hope you've been well.

396
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,448
Congratulations on your new firm.

397
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:26,580
Thank you.

398
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,780
How did you find me here?

399
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,750
I tracked you down deliberately...

400
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,689
to get a divorce.

401
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:43,560
You finally look like you've decided to leave.

402
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,530
Yes.

403
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,869
That contract thing? Give me one.

404
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,169
Okay.

405
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,339
If I support her well, I'm sure she will stay strong.

406
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,309
She can't go back to that miserable life.

407
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,609
Did you say "Just trust me" again?

408
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,780
Just follow my lead.

409
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,718
You had a hesitant client,

410
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:08,358
and with a misguided sense of duty and poor sense of justice,

411
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,889
you made her sign the divorce papers.

412
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,659
You shouldn't have done that.

413
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,530
What are you saying I should've done?

414
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,159
Ms. Park.

415
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,600
Yes?

416
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,800
Why don't you hire Ms. Han Yu Ri instead of me?

417
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,009
You don't have an appointment, so you can't see her today.

418
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,279
My husband kicked me out.

419
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,249
Please help me.

420
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,580
We lived together for 26 years, and he said I'm not his wife.

421
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,949
Please help me out.

422

Aren't you the attorney that was on TV?

425
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,959
Please hear me out.

426
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,559
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,500
It's not fair to others if I take walk-ins like this.

428
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,368
I got kicked out with nothing.

429
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,398
He gambled away all my money,

430
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,968
and I'm about to lose the one thing I have left.

431
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,809
I have nowhere to turn. Please help me.

432

Are you sure this time?

447
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,059
Yes. This time, I'm sure and serious.

448
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,530
I really want to live my own life now.

449
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,939

I can barely pay rent,

453
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,550
and I sent a client over to Yu Ri. Goodness.

454
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,389
I'm just crazy.

455
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,699
Excuse me. Is anyone...

456
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,868
Is this the attorney's office?

Thanks.

462
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,050
Take a seat. Well...

463
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,619
I should get some tea.

464
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,659
It must be urgent if you came over this late.

What's the issue?

466
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,340
My husband threw me out.

467
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,469
Just to make a living,

468
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,638
I grew vegetables, worked in diners,

469
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,980
and I even cleaned buildings.

470
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,310
Hey.

471
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:21,980

Where's your bag?

473
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,290
Darn you.

474
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,060
Nice.

475
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,089
What am I to live on if you take that?

476
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,530
Anything I earned,

477
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,629
he gambled away.

478
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,100
I lived on plain rice and kimchi.

Flowers are in bloom.

480
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,968
At first, it was 10 to 20 dollars.

481
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,239
- Thank you. - Then the bets increased.

482
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,909
You actually went for it.

483
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,109
- I'm so sorry. - He ended up losing the house.

484
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,980
Does that mean you have no property at all?

485
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,519
My mother-in-law died a few years ago,

486
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,449
leaving us a plot of land.

487
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,959
Someone wants to buy this for a million dollars?

488
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:08,259
It was worth less than 100,000 when my mom was alive.

489
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,729
That's right. Were you lied to your whole life?

490
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,929
All the landowners in the area...

491
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,939
suddenly got rich because of the redevelopment.

492
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,899
Would you like to sell it?

493
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,208
Why would I sell it?

494
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:21,570
I'll make ten times more on it.

495
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,580
Don't you dare.

496
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,279
Where's my registered seal?

497
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,648
You can't touch that land.

498
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:35,189
What? You knew, didn't you?

499
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,118
Know what?

500
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,629
I can see it on your face.

501
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,759
You sly wench.

502
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,300
It's not all yours.

503
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,929
If you want it, buy me out.

504
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:48,668
- You showed your true colors. - Honey.

505
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,638
They say you shouldn't take in stragglers.

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:51,669
How dare you?

507
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,468
- Where's my seal? - Honey!

508
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:55,809
- Honey! - Where is it?

509
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,309

Gamblers don't stop until they have nothing left.

When you go for a divorce,

517
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,530
in most cases, there are no assets to divide.

518
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,469
It was wise of you to come while you still have something.

519
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,769
If we prove he was a gambler,

520
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,000
you can divorce him since he's at fault.

521
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,439
The thing is, Ms. Cha...

522
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,649

523
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,580
You had no marriage license?

524
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,119
For 26 years?

525
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,648
I guess my husband wanted me gone all along.

526
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:42,359
How stupid of me.

527
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,959
If you don't have a marriage license...

528
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,229
That actually is better for us.

529
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,469
Aren't I unable to get a divorce or any money without a license?

531
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,540
You'll get to smile and laugh from now on.

You did this, didn't you?

548

It's a sequestration.

00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:02,238
Listen. There's something called a title.

554
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,798
What attorney doesn't know that?

555
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:06,169
You didn't care what belonged to whom...

556
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,169
when you gambled away Ms. Jung's money,

557
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,179
but now you care what's in your name?

558
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,979
Assets accumulated during a marriage...

559
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,548
are assumed to be...

560
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:17,448
under joint ownership regardless of whose name they're in.

561
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,020
I'm glad you said that.

562
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,960
You said "during a marriage."

563
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,919
Jung Mal Sook's a thief.

564
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,630
I knew she'd do this, so I never got a marriage license.

565
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,159
She didn't tell you that, did she?

566
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,299
Your not having a marriage license made my job much easier.

567
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
What does that mean?

568
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,709
A legal marriage with a license has strict rules...

569
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,179
on proving who the guilty party is.

570
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,709
And a common-law marriage...

571
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,508
is usually hard to prove when it's short.

572
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,279
But your common-law marriage lasted for 26 years.

573
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,289
There's a mountain of evidence because you were together for years,

574
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,190
making this a very easy case for an attorney.

575
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,658
What kind of law works like that?

576
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,889
You're all a bunch of thieves!

577
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,230
(Attorney at law, Cha Eun Kyung)

578
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:08,900
Here's a proposed settlement.

579
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,068
If this goes to court,

580
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,540
you'll likely have to cough up 500,000 dollars.

581
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,548
How much?

582
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:22,580
But Ms. Jung's willing to settle for 300,000 dollars.

583
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,819
(Settlement Agreement)

584
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,020
Goodness.

585
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,319
Goodness. You punks...

586
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:30,718
Goodness.

587
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,190
I heard about the work you've been putting so much effort into.

588
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,798
Let's say you grow your wealth through that work.

589
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:40,369
In other words, what will happen...

590
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:43,670
if your wealth goes from 1 million to 2 million?

591
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,679
What would happen?

592
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,579
If your assets subject to division increase,

593
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,119
the amount of assets you must give to Ms. Jung will increase as well.

594
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,719
The final amount could go from 500,000 dollars...

595
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,650
to one million dollars.

596
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:12,230
Do you want to waste money just to win a fight?

597
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,869
Or do you want to save money with a reasonable solution?

598
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,838
The 300,000-dollar settlement proposal...

599
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,710
will stand until 4pm of the day after tomorrow.

600
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,040
Give it some thought.

601
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:31,619
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

602
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,119
(Park Jin Sook, client)

603
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,259
Could it be...

604
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Not again,

605
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,630
right?

606
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,968
Yes, Ms. Park.

607
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,409
Attorney Han.

608
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm sorry,

609
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,679
but I won't get a divorce.

610
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,920
Ms. Park. What's wrong now?

611
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:08,758
No, this won't do.

612
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,319
Where are you? Let's meet now.

613
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:28,810
Ms. Park.

614
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,750
Why did you come all the way here? You must be busy.

615
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:37,819
What do you mean?

616
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,549
Stage 3 uterine cancer?

617
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,020
Yes. Sit down.

618
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,159
They need to open me up to know.

619
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,629
If it seems operable, they'll operate.

620
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,130
If not, they'll close me back up.

621
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,170
What is the point of divorce now?

622
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,569
I might die anyway.

623
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,880
Where is Mr. Kim?

624
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,980
Did he...

625
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,389
not come?

626
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,989
He didn't come even once.

627
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,589
I told him I wasn't well,

628
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,469
and he told me not to make a fuss.

629
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:29,399
I didn't even tell him that it was cancer.

630
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,969
I knew how he'd react.

631
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,710
It'd only cause me more trouble.

632
00:39:40,509 --> 00:39:41,650
That's why...

633
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:44,778
you should end things by getting a divorce.

634
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:45,850
Gosh.

635
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,250
I don't know. I'm tired.

636
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,329
Isn't dying with a clean record...

637
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,929
better than dying as a divorcee?

638
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,539
It's because of you!

639
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,569
- Darn it... - Oh, no.

640
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,110
He made you sick.

641
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,509
I can't see my future.

642
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:14,549
Hope for life and the will to live?

643
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,750
I guess those things were all luxuries to me.

644
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,630
I promised you...

645
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:32,869
that I wouldn't push you...

646
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:35,699
to get a divorce.

647
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,009
But this time,

648
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:42,779
you made the decision yourself.

649
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,239
If so,

650
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,310
should I do it after I get better?

651
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,549
I'm so...

652
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,759
tired and exhausted.

653
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,480
I'll solve this for you.

654
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:19,750
Just focus...

655
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,179
on getting better.

656
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:34,460
(Once winter ends, spring will come.)

657
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,969
He said he wouldn't give it to me, right?

658
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:42,100
Yes.

659
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,509
But he will.

660
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:49,540
You must know well because you lived with him,

661
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,448
but gambling addicts delude themselves...

662
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:55,210
into thinking that he'll become very rich soon.

663
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:57,619
I gave him an undeniable proposal.

664
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,420
He must be crunching the numbers right now.

665
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,089
He's anxiously thinking, "If I get a divorce..."

666
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,928
"after becoming rich, I might lose even more money."

667
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:11,229
Eventually, he'll conclude that he wants to end things,

668
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,529
even if he has to borrow money to do so.

669
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,270
I don't think he'll give me money so easily.

670
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,338
He thinks so little of me.

671
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,369
He may think little of you,

672
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:23,409
but he won't be able to think little of his loss.

673
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,750
Despite working so hard in life,

674
00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:27,279
you were looked down upon,

675
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,350
instead of being rewarded.

676
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,850
From now on, your life should be full of reward and rest.

677
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:37,259
Will that really happen?

678
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:41,130
I want to get my own place soon.

679
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,860
I only ate rice and kimchi for 26 years,

680
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,100
and the student apartment also only has rice and kimchi.

681
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:52,170
Trust me and wait.

682
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,238
Okay. I'm in.

683
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,810
I'm in too.

684
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:01,849
Oh, no.

685
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,019
- Goodness! - Oh, no.

686
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,949
What are you doing? You should put in your bet.

687
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,489
Why are you embarrassing me? Can't you tell?

688
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,119
You said your mother's land was worth a million dollars.

689
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:12,659
Did you already lose it?

690
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,929
No, it's still there.

691
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,360
But I can't take out loans on it.

692
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,928
That hag had it sequestered or whatever.

693
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:23,040
How unfortunate.

694
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,400
We're going to play a big game today.

695
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:28,810
If you play with that money, you could double it right away.

696
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,239
Nice.

697
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,009
I heard about the work you've been putting so much effort into.

698
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,479
Let's say you grow your wealth through that work.

699
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,719
In other words, what will happen if your wealth goes...

700
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:44,658
from 1 million to 2 million?

701
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:46,289
If your assets subject to division increase,

702
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,899
the amount of assets you must give to Ms. Jung will increase as well.

703
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,799
The final amount could go from 500,000 dollars...

704
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,170
to one million dollars.

705
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,199
If I transfer the money,

706
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:59,369
what will happen to the sequestration...

707
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:01,568
or whatever it's called?

708
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:04,210
It will be lifted as soon as the money is received.

709
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:10,548
Do you want to waste money just to win a fight?

710
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:13,420
Or do you want to save money with a reasonable solution?

711
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:15,718
The 300,000-dollar settlement proposal...

712
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,360
will stand until 4pm of the day after tomorrow.

713
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,330
Give it some thought.

714
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:22,230
So...

715
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,540
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

716
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,509
Did you...

717
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,380
respond to Mr. Jung?

718
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,850
- About what? - Changing teams.

719
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,650
Right.

720
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,520
No, I'm still thinking about it.

721
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,159
I see.

722
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:57,129
Should we get some beers? It's been a while.

723
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,429
How about pizza and beer?

724
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,330
Sorry.

725
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:03,399
There's an important settlement...

726
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,838
I need to figure out today.

727
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:05,909
This late at night?

728
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:07,469
Yes.

729
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,138
Okay. Good luck.

730
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,480
- Thanks. - Sure.

731
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,960
Do you really want to move to another team?

732
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:25,929
Well...

733
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:30,060
I like divorce cases, I do.

734
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:34,630
But it feels like an important decision for my career.

735
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:39,408
It feels like the time to think...

736
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,440
about what I'm really good at.

737
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,480
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

738
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,029
Do you remember me?

739
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
What now?

740
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,710
Are you going to go to my wife...

741
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:19,449
and convince her to get a divorce again?

742
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,719
You always leave work right away. Why did you want to get a drink?

743
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,759
What's going on?

744
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,830
It's nothing big.

745
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,659
You became the managing partner.

746
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,170
Ms. Cha left the firm.

747
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,100
And Ms. Han is thinking a lot about transferring teams.

748
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:48,409
I was worried that I was the only one not going anywhere.

749
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,579
You must be busy. I'm sorry.

750
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,110
No, you don't have to be sorry.

751
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:57,219
As a managing partner,

752
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,949
I appreciate that you're talking to me about this...

753
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:02,619
instead of worrying by yourself and suddenly leaving the firm.

754
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,599
I saw that Daejeong...

755
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,929
was the only large law firm with a divorce team.

756
00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:14,099
Right.

757
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,899
That's why I only applied to Daejeong.

758
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,838
- Really? - Yes.

759
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:22,069
I feel proud as the person who made the divorce team.

760
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:28,279
But to be honest, I think it's okay to take divorce cases...

761
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,750
after experiencing other cases.

762
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,118
I was worried...

763
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,020
that I chose my specialty too soon as a new hire.

764
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:39,830
Most people...

765
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,028
need to experience many things...

766
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:45,299
to figure out what they want.

767
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,900
But to me, you seem...

768
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,699
like someone who figured out what they wanted quite early.

769
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,710
Is that not the case?

770
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,170
Do you think so?

771
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:57,909
Yes.

772
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,219
Pardon?

773
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,989
He...

774
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,190
agreed to the divorce settlement?

775
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:17,759
When I told him...

776
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,400
that the lawsuit could worsen your condition,

777
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,799
he accepted it.

778
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:24,839
No way.

779
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,540
He's not the kind of person who would care about that.

780
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,650
So what am I supposed to do?

781
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:37,179
If I go to the hospital and feed her,

782
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,949
will that be enough?

783
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,500
Please think about what Ms. Park...

784
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,500
would want.

785
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:54,429
And...

786
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,969
give it to her.

787
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,139
This time,

788
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,980
he listened to your story.

789
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,290
You went through...

790
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,060
so much until now.

791
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,159
Oh, Ms. Han.

792
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,230
Until now,

793
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,298
I met over ten divorce attorneys.

794
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:32,400
But...

795
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:36,710
I've never met such a warm-hearted person like you.

796
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,580
I'm sure you were the only one...

797
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,880
who could convince him.

798
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,049
Thank you so much.

799
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,119
Thank you very much.

800
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,060
I want to thank you.

801
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:58,500
Thank you for coming back to me.

802
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,100
I felt...

803
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,799
very bad about last time.

804
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,509
Ms. Han.

805
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:10,909
I'll make sure to get better...

806
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,650
and try living a good life.

807
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:17,819
Please do.

808
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,589
You have to live until 100.

809
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,319
Live until 100? You're so silly.

810
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,130
Your life is precious.

811
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,060
I'll root for you.

812
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:34,299
Thank you so much.

813
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,799
Thank you so much.

814
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,610
Thank you so much.

815
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,540
I knew it.

816
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,408
He'd rather lose money by gambling...

817
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:48,310
than give it to me.

818
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:51,480
We still have two minutes left.

819
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:53,250
Trust me and wait.

820
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,298
One, ten,

821
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,239
one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand,

822
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:12,869
one-hundred thousand?

823
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:16,110
(GP Bank, Mr. Kim Chang Seob, Deposit, 300,000 dollars)

824
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,440
I told you to trust me, didn't I?

825
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:21,610
Oh, my goodness.

826
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,580
He really gave me this large amount of money.

827
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:27,488
How did you do that?

828
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:29,249
He got caught in a trap.

829
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,189
Did you set that trap?

830
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,730
No. A trap Mr. Kim set himself.

831
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:39,198
A trap of lies that makes him claim his wife isn't his wife.

832
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,600
A trap of delusions that makes him believe he can make more money.

833
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,609
I only showed him the way to the trap...

834
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,239
he set himself.

835
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,679
Thanks to that, the settlement was done quickly.

836
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,049
Thank you so much.

837
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,079
How can I repay you?

838
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,819
I want to do something for you.

839
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,489
If so,

840
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,060
could you have dinner with me?

841
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:16,230
I've only seen meals like this in dramas.

842
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:18,270
I've never eaten anything like this in my life.

843
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,409
Because you said you only ate rice and kimchi,

844
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:23,380
I really wanted to buy you this meal.

845
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,080
I should pay for you. What are you saying?

846
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,479
Ms. Jung.

847
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,649
Now that you received your share of the assets,

848
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,189
you need to send me the legal fee.

849
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,889
Of course.

850
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,059
I was kicked out without a single penny,

851
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,929
but you were understanding and said I could pay you later.

852
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,060
I really appreciated it.

853
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,629
- Go ahead and eat. - Yes.

854
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,900
I almost feel bad eating this.

855
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,940
It's so weird but so delicious.

856
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:59,210
What would I have done without you?

857
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:02,909
At first, I went to Daejeong,

858
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,020
a firm with a huge building.

859
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,888
The lawyer there...

860
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:10,319
told me to go to you.

861
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:12,920
I really appreciate that lawyer too.

862
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:15,059
Who in Daejeong?

863
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,299
That bright and kind-looking person who was on TV.

864
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,500
Han Yu Ri. Yes.

865
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,940
Yes.

866
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,009
- Go ahead and eat. - Yes.

867
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,809
There are so many dishes.

868
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,139
Take your time.

869
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,460
Could you give me the right prescription?

870
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,069
You know you're the only one who knows the answer, right?

871
00:53:58,869 --> 00:53:59,969
To tell you the truth,

872
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,739
I went to Attorney Cha's office first.

873
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:05,480
But she told me...

874
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,350
to go to you.

875
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,980
Ms. Cha Eun Kyung?

876
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,920
Why don't you hire Ms. Han Yu Ri instead of me?

877
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:17,659
What?

878
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,289
She wanted to get you divorced...

879
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,289
in the last lawsuit.

880
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,730
She'll do a better job than anyone else.

881
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,428
She's also talked to Kim Jong Bok before.

882
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,100
She might suggest a settlement.

883
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:30,968
Ms. Cha said...

884
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:34,239
you could settle it...

885
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,540
before the lawsuit.

886
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,920
Ms. Han.

887
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,119
Park Jin Sook's conciliation protocol is here.

888
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,190
That was very fast.

889
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:53,089
Amazing job.

890
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:54,589
Thank you.

891
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:00,299
(Conciliation Protocol)

892
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,610
(Purpose of Complaint)

893
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:16,779
I've never met such a warm-hearted person like you.

894
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:21,619
Thank you very much.

895
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,159
Thanks to you,

896
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,219
I was able to get divorced.

897
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,060
Thank you so much.

898
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,969
It was the best choice...

899
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,000
to choose you as my divorce attorney.

900
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:02,259
Hey.

901
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
Hey, Ms. Han.

902
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:11,639
- Mr. Jung. - Yes?

903
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,540
I'll remain in the divorce team.

904
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,440
May I ask why?

905
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:23,250
I want to save my client's precious time...

906
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,480
and make them smile again.

907
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,989
I think that's what I'm best at.

908
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,330
In which direction do you want the divorce team to go?

909
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,960
A team that saves someone.

910
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:39,929
A divorce team...

911
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,469
that does not put a period...

912
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,139
but starts a new chapter in life.

913
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,440
They're the same.

914
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,509
Pardon me?

915
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:55,250
Never mind.

916
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,420
Thank you for staying in the divorce team.

917
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,889
I look forward to working with you.

918
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,159
Sure.

919
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,000
(Sender: Heungim Detention Center, Inmate 3978)

920
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,699
I never expected you to come back.

921
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,739
I told you not to write to me.

922
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,008
At the time,

923
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:26,380
I really didn't mean to deceive you.

924
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:29,278
I was going to meet my wife for the last time...

925
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,279
before I hired my attorney.

926
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:34,319
I'm sorry if you were offended by it.

927
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,619
Sure.

928
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:38,920
I'll fall for your trick one more time.

929
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,429
Why did you want to see me today?

930
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,860
I talked to my wife for the last time.

931
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,270
I couldn't change her mind,

932
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,770
so I'll divorce her.

933
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,810
Then instead of fighting,

934
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,539
let's settle it.

935
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,710
Sure. I'll sign the contract.

936
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:08,920
Oh, and...

937
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:11,960
do you think you can meet these people?

938
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,088
Who are they?

939
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,830
You're famous in prison.

940
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,900
There are tons of people who want to get a divorce.

941
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,869
They all received a written complaint.

942
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,299
(2S4 1004)

943
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,299
Okay.

944
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,210
I'll talk to them one by one.

945
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,209
Since you're in difficult situations,

946
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,239
I'll try to settle it as much as possible.

947
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,549
Oh, yes. Thank you.

948
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,310
- Sure. - Thank you.

949
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:42,250
- Sign it here. - Yes.

950
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,989
(Sodam Student Apartment)

951
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:49,129
- Honey. - Gosh.

952
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,400
Honey.

953
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,630
How did you find me here?

954
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,428
Have you been tailing me?

955
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:56,068
Oh, you know.

956
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:57,599
When I went to the attorney's office,

957
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,440
I saw you and followed you here.

958
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:03,779
Honey, I'm in big trouble.

959
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:06,109
You know the land? After it was taken as security,

960
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,750
- I gambled... - You lost everything, didn't you?

961
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,509
- Honey. - Leave.

962
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,679
- Get out of my way. - Honey.

963
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
Honey?

964
00:59:12,921 --> 00:59:14,719
Honey!

965
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,419
Hello.

966
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,488
Honey.

967
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,130
Wait. Honey.

968
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,759
Honey. Oh, no.

969
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,799
Oh, honey!

970
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,029
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

971
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:37,079
I'm honored to have attorneys from a large firm...

972
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,678
visit my humble office.

973
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,508
Thank you. I appreciate it.

974
00:59:41,509 --> 00:59:43,350
What do you mean?

975
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,549
It's wonderful.

976
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,689
All attorneys dream...

977
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,349
about opening their own office.

978
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,158
- Wait, Mr. Jun. - Yes?

979
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:53,089
Did you just say you wanted to open your own office...

980
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,888
in front of your boss?

981
00:59:54,889 --> 00:59:56,959
Oh, Mr. Jung. That was a mistake.

982
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,959
- That was the slip of the tongue. - I'll let you go.

(Law Firm Spring Again)

984
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,270
- Ms. Cha. - Yes?

985
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:06,770
Can I have a moment with you?

986
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:08,239
Sure.

987
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,239
Was it your plan...

988
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,350
to send Park Jin Sook to me?

989
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,980
A plan is a fancy word.

990
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,089
Thank you...

991
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,790
for helping me wrap up Park Jin Sook's divorce.

992
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,830
That showed me the direction I should pursue.

993
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,330
That's great.

994
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,199
Why did you send Jung Mal Sook to me?

995
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,670
Because you were worried about the rent?

996
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,210
Just joking.

997
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,149
Jung Mal Sook seemed...

998
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,380
to need your settlement technique.

999
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:53,349
Well, did you use...

1000
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:57,159
your skill of fighting as well?

1001
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,830
I don't have any skills.

1002
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:02,889
I only do my best.

1003
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,099
Your technique to show what they're fighting for...

1004
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,699
and what matters the most.

1005
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,440
That's what you have.

1006
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,670
I know it the best.

1007
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:18,339
Thank you.

1008
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,449
If an attorney makes an effort to make clients settle,

1009
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,319
we can save our clients' precious time, right?

1010
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,319
Yes.

1011
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,888
Let's see what attorneys can do...

1012
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:33,460
again and again...

1013
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,489
before they take it to court.

1014
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,929
Wait a minute.

1015
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,129
Did you name it Spring Again...

1016
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,540
because you want to check the case again and again?

1017
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,770
(Once winter ends, spring will come.)

1018
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:49,610
I thought it meant spring will come once winter ends.

1019
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,839
It's both.

1020
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,739
I knew you were smart.

1021
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,310
Gosh.

1022
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:57,350
Let's clean up.

1023
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,179
Yes.

1024
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,190
You did not come to agreement.

1025
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,270
Let's take it to court, Ms. Cha.

1026
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:24,710
I'll see you in court, Ms. Han.

1027
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,369
(Good Partner)

1028
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,170
She wants to do it every day.

1029
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,499
How am I supposed to live with that?

1030
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,468
You're a sex addict.

1031
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:29,908
Even an 80-year-old man would do better than you.

1032
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,440
You mean he's impotent?

1033
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,048
You're not my boss anymore.

1034
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:35,349
I'm the other party's attorney.

1035
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,449
Did you meet Ms. Han?

1036
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:37,850
She was there as the other party's attorney.

1037
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,388
Are you blabbering because it can't be proven?

1038
01:03:40,389 --> 01:03:41,488
Is that how you taught you?

1039
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:43,889
Then can you prove your claim?

1040
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:45,360
That's why I'm here.

1041
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,759
Let's take it to court, Ms. Cha.
