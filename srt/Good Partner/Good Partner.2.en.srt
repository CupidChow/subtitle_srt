A month ago, he was diagnosed with late-stage pancreatic cancer.

He's Yu Ri's dad.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,338

Ms. Cha, what brings you by at this hour?

45
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,198
I came to pick up some documents,

46

But we're out camping.

138
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,159
When else would you have soda if not on a day like this?

139
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
I'll allow it today...

00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,429

Go on. Head on inside.

Let's hurry inside.

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,359
I must've had too much water.

159
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
It was as if I were awake in my own nightmare.

160
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,830
I should've killed them both in that very moment.

161
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,269
I had no idea...

162
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,570
that the handprint I had seen was actually hers.

163
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,679
We began to talk and the pieces of the puzzle...

164
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,249
finally came together.

165
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,060
I contemplated whether I had to tell him.

166
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,460
The pain was insufferable,

167
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,289
and I didn't know...

168
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,960
if I should inflict that on my friend as well.

169
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,330
But not telling him...

170
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,629
was even worse.

171
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
I see.

172
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,249
Did your wife admit to the affair?

173
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,320
At first, she said it was nonsense.

174
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,389
But she admitted it after seeing the camera footage we had.

175
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,849

178
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,029
Yes, photos of their trips together I found on his phone...

and the texts they exchanged.

180

182

00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,670
You should aim for a big payout.

185
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,309
Am I entitled to that...

186
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,579
when he received most of it from his father?

187
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,979
His father's reputation as an assemblyman is at stake,

188
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:00,879
so I'll request mediation.

189
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,089
Ms. Kim will be a plaintiff in one case,

190
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,159
and Mr. Kim will be a plaintiff in the other.

191
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,729
There will be two separate cases.

192
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,759
Let's fight this.

193
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,729
Sure.

194
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,409
All right.

195
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:25,769
Here's our tteokbokki.

196
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,639
Try it.

197
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,679
All you're getting me are gimbap and tteokbokki?

198
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,710
Seriously?

199
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,550
This is a place for hipsters, and it's not easy to get seats.

200
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,319
On top of that, it wasn't easy getting this window seat.

201
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,450
Unbelievable.

202
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:42,019
Try this as well. It's so good.

203
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,100
Maybe it's because I'm having something tasty,

204
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,229
but I feel better.

205
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,970
It's good, right? What did I tell you?

206
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,509
To be honest, I went on a job search site yesterday.

207
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,009
A job search site? Are you kidding me?

208
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,879
Have you forgotten that we're a top law firm?

209
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,509
It's hard to get a job here,

210
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,050
so why would you resign so easily?

211
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,420
Mr. Jun, do you like being a divorce attorney?

212
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:17,359
You've been here for three months, so tell me how it is.

213
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,859
Hold on. How did you know that?

214
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,398
You know I've only been here for three months.

215
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,769
I thought you had been here for at least a few years...

216
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,599
judging by how you played the seniority card.

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,940
It's only by three months, but I'm still your senior.

218
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,440
I honestly thought that divorce cases would be fun.

219
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,609
I love TV drama series. Especially soap operas.

220
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,579
You became a divorce lawyer...

221
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,778
because of your love for soap operas?

222
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,310
That's right. It's fun.

223
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,148
Why make it harder for yourself...

224
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,749
by opting to research materials and case studies...

225
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:45,590
for mergers and acquisitions as well as criminal cases?

226
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,249
The thought of it gives me a headache.

227
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:50,619
I find that to be more fun.

228
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,529
She has one heck of an ego.

229
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,060
Fine, smarty-pants.

230
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,029
Yu Ri,

231
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,699
you seem to be talking casually to me.

232
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,840
Is it because we graduated in the same year?

233
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,710
Since that's the case, I'm sure I can speak casually.

234
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,210
That's a bit too soon,

235
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,049
but if speaking casually to me will help you be more relaxed...

236
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,619
at the office, I'll gladly allow it.

237
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,489
Just don't resign.

238
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,919
I bet you don't know how many new lawyers we hired...

239
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,090
over the past three months.

240
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,060
Why is he being like a lost puppy?

241
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,590
The clients must not have been happy about having...

242
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,699
to switch lawyers frequently.

243
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,670
You have no idea. That's why Ms. Cha was up to her neck in work.

244
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:34,138
She met clients in one place, listened to others complain,

245
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,970
and handled all the cases outside the city.

246
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,909
I developed nothing but respect for her.

247
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,180
Ms. Cha's daughter...

248
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,279
must only see her mom's face on TV.

249
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:49,019
Darn it. He's having an affair because his wife is busy with work.

250
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,590
Ms. Han, don't be like that...

251
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,560
and hang tight for one month.

252
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,629
The firm pays for lunch,

253
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,358
so coffee will always be on me.

254
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,829
It's fine. Why would you buy me coffee?

255
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,600
I want to, that's all.

256
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,200
Seriously.

257
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,340
- Are you interested in me? - What?

258
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,738
Loving your peers is the same as loving your country.

259
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,940
And together...

260
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,279
Didn't you know?

261
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,249
Dig in.

262
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,850
Give it a month, okay?

263
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,060
Ms. Han, are you working late tonight?

264
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,869
Yes, I still have a few things to go over.

265
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,330
We'll head home, then.

266
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,440
Sure thing. Good night.

267
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:48,940
Shall we?

268
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,579
See you tomorrow.

269
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,979
- Enjoy your evening. - See you tomorrow.

270
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,019
Let's get a few more drinks.

271
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,090
- Sure. They'll be on me. - Let's head inside.

272
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:04,529
Hi, do you have an empty table?

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,060
What?

274
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,199
You normally have the basic gimbap because you're short on time,

275
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,199
so I'm surprised you ordered tteokbokki too.

276
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,270
And the spicier one, might I add.

277
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,709
Spill.

278
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,378
It's nothing. I like the food, that's all.

279
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,919
Don't tell me it's what I'm thinking.

280
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,389
- Not yet. - Not yet?

281
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,199
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

282
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,438
I thought she was working overtime,

283
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,939
but she was writing her resignation.

284
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,439
Her too?

285
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,039
She thinks divorce lawyers...

286
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,679
just listen to clients whine and complain.

287
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,648
She won't last long.

288
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,250
How about giving her a 20-percent raise?

289
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,649
I'm not sure...

290
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,389
money will have a hold on her.

291
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,688
I noticed...

292
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,830
she wasn't too happy about her first win.

293
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,290
Is that why?

294
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,199
If she insists on leaving, soothe her.

295
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,169
Forget it. Why would I do that?

296
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,709
I shouldn't give her a chance to talk.

297
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,839
Eun Kyung.

298
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,409
Who would give you such advice if I'm gone?

299
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:32,080
Don't be so cold to the staff.

300
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,179
Don't make enemies.

301
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:38,349
What's going on? Are you going somewhere?

302
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,449
Where would I go?

303

(2024-682, Plaintiff Kim, Defendants Park, Choi)

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,329
(Plaintiff)

306
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,570
Plaintiffs Kim Min Jeong and Kim Jun Hui are friends.

307
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,368
Out of consideration for their spouses,

308
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,239
after their separate marriages,

309
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,780
instead of meeting alone, the families went camping together.

310
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,979
Then their respective spouses had an affair,

311
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,080
and now they're suing for divorce and alimony.

312
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,919
Also...

313
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:18,429
the families spent weekends together as if they were one big family,

314
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,729
so please take into consideration that the plaintiffs'...

315
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,059
psychological duress would be as great as if their spouses...

316
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,868
had committed a crime you'd consider much worse.

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,208
What did you tell your wife?

321
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,550
That I'd go to exercise.

322
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,148
That's boring. Come up with better lies.

323
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,249
- She might suspect you. - This is a workout.

325
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
That's true.

326
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,060
Didn't we come here once before?

327
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,869
That motel behind an apartment complex.

328
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,429
This is a new place.

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,699
We've been to so many I got confused.

330
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,740
Let's go.

331
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,409
Defending counsel.

332
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,879
Do you admit to the affair?

333
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:13,678
It's true that...

334
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,979
my clients were filmed entering a motel,

335
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,020
but they are just good friends and there was no sexual intercourse.

336
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,458
As you know, we don't have to prove...

337
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,560
they had intercourse to say it was an affair.

338
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,260
The fact that Defendants One and Two were lovers...

339
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,070
We're in love.

340
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,908
Look up, Mi Jin. We did nothing wrong.

341
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:38,909
Be seated.

342
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,810
Your Honor.

343
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,648
Please put the defendant's claim in the record.

344
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,280
He admitted to his wrongdoing.

345
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,050
Yes, fine. Record it.

346
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,990
Defendant Two.

347
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,790
Do you admit to the affair?

348
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:58,060
If you call it an affair, then that's what it must be,

349
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,359
but we loved with all our hearts and are not ashamed.

350
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Very well.

351
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:12,638
If Defendant One Choi Mi Jin takes the same position,

352
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,438
instead of continuing in court,

353
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,839
how about we try to...

354
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,480
settle this out of court?

355
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,949
Yes, well, I'd like to end this amicably with an agreement.

356
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,590
My wife will get a divorce,

357
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,859
but not custody. I'll keep the kid.

358
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,329
We can discuss the custody of your child...

359
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,698
during the hearing of the case...

360
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,730

and Mr. Park, you're Defendant Two, the affair partner.

363
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,969
Don't mention your child here.

364
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,139
Exactly.

365
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,609
Seung Woo.

366
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,679
I want to raise him.

367
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,649
Drop it.

368
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,560
You don't mean your child...

369
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:10,029
but Seung Woo,

370
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,030
the child of Kim Jun Hui and Choi Mi Jin?

371
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes.

372
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:19,669
Your Honor, could you include this in the record too?

373
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,840
Defendant Two, please sit.

374
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Defendant One,

375
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,419
do you take the same position?

376
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,760
Yes. I want to raise our kids with him.

377
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,969
(Defendant)

378
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,709
The next hearing will be a negotiation.

379
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,139
On that day,

380
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,080
Park Min Seok's wife and Choi Mi Jin's husband...

381
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,219
will attend as participants to voice their opinions.

382
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,419
Let's talk this out with all four present.

383
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,199
Let's sit and rest a bit.

384
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,639
- You did well. - Thank you.

385
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,540
- Sir? - Hello.

386
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,010
What do you want?

387
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:35,919
As you know, Mr. Park's father is a well-known assemblyman.

388
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,689
He wouldn't want his son in the press.

389
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,689
That's none of your business.

390
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,188
Wouldn't you prefer a settlement...

391
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:46,859
to a written judgment stating a divorce?

392
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:48,959
Bring us a good offer.

393
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
We'll be waiting.

394
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Let's go.

395
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,699
- Why that... - It's okay.

396
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,609
What were you talking about?

397
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:00,369
The easiest route.

398
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,409
You'll see next time.

399
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,709
Why do you say there's not enough proof?

400
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:10,979
When that woman and I exchanged glances,

401
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,919
I swear she gave me the side-eye.

402
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,659
She's the affair partner. I know it.

403
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,260
Yes, but...

404
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,030
we can't replicate that side-eye for the court.

405
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,259
I asked you to try to record your husband...

406
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,329
confessing to having an affair.

407
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,540
- Did you give that a go? - I did.

408
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,138
But he denied having an affair.

409
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,270
What did you do?

410
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,679
You didn't ask the question I told you never to ask, did you?

411
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,850
I asked if he slept with her or not.

412
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,378
I was so angry I couldn't help it.

413
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,249
If anyone asked...

414
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,219
"Did you sleep with her or not," I doubt anyone would say yes.

415
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,388
If you keep this up,

416
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,629
you'll get fewer and fewer chances to collect proof.

417
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,669
- Hello. - Hello.

418
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:08,608
Hello, Ms. Cha.

419
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,739
Did you do well?

420
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,350
Sure you did. See you.

421
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,850
Hello.

422
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,060
He left right on time.

(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

424
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,070
Darn it.

425
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,609
"You'll see next time?"

426
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:44,850
She's horrible at communicating.

427
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,480
No wonder her husband's fooling around.

(True affair stories from a divorce lawyer)

429
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,569
So,

430
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,438
is it true that most affairs happen...

431
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,938
- close to home? - My gosh.

432
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,378
- Most affairs happen close to home. - Darn it.

433
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,379
Should I see her face after work too?

434
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,379
Work colleagues, neighbors, friends' spouses.

435
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,648
It's even common among relatives.

436
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,050
- Gosh. - Is it common for one to be...

437
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:28,790
unaware when the spouse is having an affair with someone close?

438
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:32,659
Yes. Your spouse's affair is always someone around you.

439
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,698
Some people took years to catch on...

440
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,829
when their spouse was cheating with their neighbor.

441
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,029
With their neighbor?

442
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,468
- I don't think your husband... - Don't you talk like...

443
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:44,070
- would do anything like that. - you're in the clear.

444
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,468
Right? Yes?

(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

446
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,250
Should I tell her?

(Cha Eun Kyung)

448
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:08,429
Oh, thank you.

449
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,800
The weather's amazing.

450
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:15,939
Here we go.

451
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,639
I thought I'd go to hotel lounges to drink...

452
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,350
when I became an attorney.

453
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,379
Are you looking down on convenience store cup noodles?

454
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,888
Look at the cherry blossoms. Aren't they pretty?

455
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,790
The petals are flying everywhere.

456
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,358
Hotel lounges are for people who are used to going there.

457
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,928
Smarty-pants don't start going...

458
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:42,359
out of the blue because they became attorneys.

459
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,760
Darn you.

460
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,629
I used to study in libraries and drink vending-machine coffee.

461
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,639
Now I'm typing petitions...

462
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,240
and drinking convenience store beer.

463
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,369
Nothing has changed.

464
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,080
I get your sob story.

465
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,678
Why did you call me over here when I clocked off?

466
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:03,980
We had lunch together.

467
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
- A friend's friend... - Yes.

468
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:14,158
saw her friend's husband...

469
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,159
making out with someone else.

470
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,230
But she's so torn as to whether...

471
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,199
she should tell the wife.

472
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:24,969
What would you do?

473
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:27,169
Me? I'd tell right away.

474
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:28,909
Don't I look like the type?

475
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,449
Yes, you do.

476
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:36,580
You're going too far over the line just because we're closer.

477
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,550
Sorry.

478
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,290
But...

479
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,029
maybe it's best not to know.

480
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,000
How is it best not to know? It's best to know.

481
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,599
Isn't it a waste to spend time and energy...

482
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,699
on a traitor?

483
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,708
That's why you'd tell the wife?

484
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:02,740
You bet.

485
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,009
If I found out even later on that my wife cheated on me,

486
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,310
I'd end it right then.

487
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:09,250
Why stay together when half the world is made up of women?

488
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,119
Even if half the world is women,

489
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,689
you made the hard choice of settling with one.

490
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:16,559
And I got unlucky.

491
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,330
I can say I made the wrong choice and try again.

492
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,858
It must be nice to be so simple.

493
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,859
You called me over to discuss something so simple?

(Letter of Resignation)

499

I can't let her talk.

500
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,138
- I... - If you want to talk,

501
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:04,300
how about you wait until this case is done?

502
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,109
Wouldn't it be too late then?

503
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,480
Why would it be late?

504
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,878
- It's better than being premature. - What?

505
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,080
What is she talking about?

506
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,850
You asked what I told the defending counsel...

507
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,590
after the previous hearing.

508
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,919
Was that an attempt to settle?

509
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:27,859
I mentioned the assemblyman father.

510
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,399
I should hope the attorney got the message.

511
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,799
It was my way of suggesting he spend a little more...

512
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,969
on the settlement to preserve his honor.

513
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,810
There could be a custody battle,

514
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,780
so I don't think they'll bargain with money.

515
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,550
Is there anything that money can't solve?

516
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,520
What money can't solve...

517
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,550
is human emotion.

518
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,859
She'll quit even if I give her a raise?

519
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,030
Okay. Point taken.

520

Are you Kim Min Jeong?

521
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,339

523
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:19,609
Right.

529
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,169
Okay.

530
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,080
The couple's assets amount to about 500,000 dollars.

531
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,379
They were married for less than ten years,

532
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:56,019
and Ms. Choi had no income for the duration of the marriage.

533
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,188
The contribution of household labor is valued at 20 percent,

534
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:01,689
so we're willing to give her about 100,000 dollars.

535
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,958
The father will have custody...

536
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:05,060
and he wants 500 dollars in child support a month.

537
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,189

538

Well...

539
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,259
I didn't earn anything,

540
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,030
but I can't leave with just 100,000 dollars.

541

542

other women got at least half.

543
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,739
You weren't married for that long,

544
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,178
and you lived in the house that Mr. Kim's parents got him...

545
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:23,878
when he married...

546
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:26,208
which went up in value. You didn't actually contribute,

547
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,280
so you don't get half.

548
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,649
Does this even make sense?

549
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,119
And I want custody of our child.

550
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,030
You had an affair with the dad of your son's best friend...

551
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,429
and you want custody?

552
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,000
Could you...

553
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,139
face Seung Woo after what you did?

554
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,540
I raised him.

555
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,239
He can't live without me.

556
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,709
You can't live without him.

557
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,750
(Defendant)

558
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:03,280
Excuse me.

559
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,119
Will you hear our offer?

560
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,060
- Let's do that. - Okay.

561
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,060
As mentioned in court during the previous hearing,

562
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:14,888
My client Mr. Park wants to raise...

563
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,760
all three children,

564
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,529
the children of both couples.

565
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,699
You lunatic.

566
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,070
You're saying that again?

567
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,309
Why would you raise my kid?

568
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,340
Will you hear me out first?

569
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:34,510
In return, Park Min Seok will give plaintiff Kim Min Jeong...

570
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,249
thirty percent of his assets,

571
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,590
which is about two million dollars,

572
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:43,419
and Kim Jun Hui won't have to give Choi Mi Jin anything.

573
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,020
That's the condition.

574
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,800
That means he doesn't need the 100,000 dollars...

575
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,830
Ms. Cha offered.

576
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,929
You psycho.

577
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:58,139
Are you saying you'll buy my kid?

578
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,908
I knew you were a nutcase,

579
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,179
but you're worse than I thought.

580
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,209
That's a no.

581
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,050
Speak up. Say no.

582
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,879
Let me think.

583
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,799
Did you stop to think about...

584
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:26,429
how confusing it would be for the kids who'll have to call...

585
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,569
a family friend "Mom" and "Dad?"

586
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,440
This is child abuse.

587
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,940
The court should not allow this.

588
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,909
Think realistically.

589
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,250
You can work your whole life and never make two million.

590
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:45,619
The international school you mentioned.

591
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,350
I'm thinking about it.

592
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,258
You made an unexpected counter offer,

593
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,359
and we need time to think about it.

594
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,629
Give us a few days, and we'll have a response.

595
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,199
- Yes, let's do that. - Sure.

596
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Thanks.

597
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,789
We're colleagues on the same side.

598
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,219
How dare you glare at me in front of the mediators?

599
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,060
Ms. Cha. This isn't right.

600
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,960
What do you mean? Elaborate.

601
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:34,000
It won't be a normal environment for their kids to grow up together.

602
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,669
Their case might set a precedent...

603
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,369
as a special case regarding child abuse law.

604
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,770
I see. Go on.

605
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,508
Shouldn't that absurd settlement...

606
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,739
have been dismissed immediately at the mediation?

607
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,040
Are you a police officer?

608
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:46,549
A social worker?

609
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,718
You're an attorney for the plaintiff.

610
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,880
That's precisely why I'm bringing this up.

611
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,049
You heard when Mr. Kim Jun Hui said he couldn't accept the settlement.

612
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,489
What about Ms. Kim Min Jeong?

613
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:00,959
There's no way she would give up...

614
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
on her children for two million dollars.

615
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,159
Everything must seem simple to you. Good for you.

616
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Pardon?

617
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,299
You think whatever you like and act as if that's the truth.

618
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,638
If Ms. Kim chooses the money,

619
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,080
does it mean she's abandoning her children?

620
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,778
Did it not cross your mind...

621
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,210
that she might choose the money for her children's sake?

622
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,850
Do you know the cost...

623
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,079
of the annual tuition for an international school?

624
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,480
It's higher than your annual salary.

625
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,819
No parent would choose...

626
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,989
money over their children.

627
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,528
We're their representatives.

628
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:33,860
Because we are their representatives,

629
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,499
we're obligated to inform them...

630
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,428
about the pain the children will feel...

631
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,369
and the implications of agreeing to the settlement.

632
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,169
Ms. Kim will know better than anyone...

633
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,810
about the pain her children will face, not you.

634
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,080
Cha Eun Kyung is getting weirder with each passing day.

635
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Gosh. Seriously.

636
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,790
- Hello. - Hello.

637
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,488
Is she that blinded by the incentive?

638
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:02,559
(Law Firm Daejeong)

639
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Hello.

640
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,289
If she's getting a huge incentive,

641
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,130
it means her clients are getting a big incentive too.

642
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,459
Isn't that a win-win situation?

643
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,199
No! It's not a win-win situation or anything like that.

644
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,899
They're trying to make her choose between her children and money.

645
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,400
Ms. Han. Don't get emotionally involved.

646
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,169
You're overstepping your boundaries.

647
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,509
If you keep this up, it will only burden you.

648
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
I'm serious.

649
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,178
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

650
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,179
Come here for a second.

651
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,318
- Hello. - Did you eat?

652
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,350
- Yes. - Hi.

653
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,020
- Did you eat? - Yes.

654
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,690
- Did you eat? - Yes.

655
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,330
Well, I had a question.

656
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,060
Let's say you saw the spouse of your acquaintance...

657
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,969
having an affair.

658
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,899
Then would you tell your acquaintance...

659
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
about the affair or not?

660
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Is this about a case?

661
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,339
No, I was just curious about your answer.

662
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,838
I would have told my acquaintance right away.

663
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,779
But I was wondering how you would handle it.

664
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,179
I've got this.

665
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,779
I would pretend to be clueless.

666
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,449
What?

667
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,690
Why should I get myself involved in someone else's business?

668
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,360
Well, I would wait and see until my acquaintance handles it...

669
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,060
on their own.

670
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,460
It's completely different from what I would do.

671
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:18,699
By the way,

672
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,169
Director Kim Ji Sang doesn't come to the firm every day, right?

673
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,269
No. He works at an internal medicine clinic in his neighborhood.

674
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,469
He comes to the firm from time to time as an advisor.

675
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,710
I see.

676
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,679
I never got to say hello.

677
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:36,679
I'll introduce him to you soon.

678
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,380
Okay.

679
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,960
If I have to give her...

680
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,529
some of my assets, then I'll do it.

681
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,488
He wants to cover up what he did with money.

682
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:50,460
So I don't want to be a part of that or feed his arrogance.

683
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,670
I'm glad to hear that.

684
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,600
Let's fight for custody until the end...

685
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:59,238
and ensure the ruling states that he committed adultery.

686
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,239
He must bear that label...

687
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,839
- for the rest of his life. - Right.

688
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,080
At best, the alimony will be 20,000 dollars.

689
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,249
If you accept the settlement they offered,

690
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,420
you'll have saved 100,000 dollars. Do you understand that?

691
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,119
Yes. I've made up my mind.

692
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:19,690
I think your wife might get custody of your child.

693
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,959
Pretending to be generous and agreeing to the settlement...

694
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,360
might be a more cost-effective way for you to save some money.

695
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,529
No.

696
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,670
Let's say you were in my shoes.

697
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,000
Your husband cheated on you.

698
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,810
But he tried to throw money at you to avoid getting the ruling.

699
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,969
Could you forgive him?

700
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,539
I'm not saying you should forgive her.

701
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,380
I'm advising you to face reality.

702
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:42,179
You may think like this because it's only 100,000 dollars.

703
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,420
But things must be different for two million dollars.

704
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,089
Ms. Kim?

705
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,339
Hey. Gosh.

706
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,710
Could I get one more drink?

707
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,110
Sure.

708
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,810
I'll just be a piece of trash.

709
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,279
Hey.

710
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,659
Will you take the money instead of your children?

711
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,259
It's 2 million dollars, not 200,000 dollars.

712
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,929
Park Min Seok will justify his adultery...

713
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,499
and think he's not guilty anymore by paying you that amount.

714
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,569
You can only say that because you have a good career.

715
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,579
My children go to English kindergarten...

716
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,540
and wear designer clothes. That's the only life they know of.

717
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,810
If they come with me, I can't give them the same life.

718
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,549
My parents run a restaurant in the countryside.

719
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,650
They have no time to help me with my children.

720
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,919
All of his assets belong to his father.

721
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,960
So if I were to take it to trial, I wouldn't get much anyway.

722
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:58,119
I have 2 children, not 1.

723
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:01,360
I can't raise them.

724
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,528
Handing over the custody rights...

725
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,600
doesn't mean you're giving up being their mother.

726
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:08,198
It can be the contrary.

727
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,838
Non-custodial parents miss their children even more,

728
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,270
so they become more loving and get along with their children.

729
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,009
You've made the right decision.

730
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,880
Even if you don't have a fancy career,

731
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,250
your children will want to live with their mother.

732
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,889
They wouldn't want to live with their father's lover.

733
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,719
The kids are very good friends.

734
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,789
They will think of it as going camping every day.

735
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,429
Won't they be happy together?

736
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,969
That's just absurd. Don't try to justify your decision.

737
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,869
Then that jerk won't lose anything.

738
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,279
Why do you think Park Min Seok offered that much money?

739
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:57,778
Mr. Kim. Just like you said, do you think he was being arrogant?

740
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,219
He had always been arrogant.

741
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:03,060
He's trying to use his money to walk all over us.

742
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,889
Perhaps, he understands...

743
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:07,429
the seriousness of his mistake.

744
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,600
He probably wants to forgive himself by paying a fortune.

745
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:13,969
You don't think Park Min Seok is losing anything?

746
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,869
Money.

747
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,739
He will lose two million dollars.

748
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,778
He will become a man who has his wife, his family,

749
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:24,339
and his money, two million dollars.

750
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,210
He will have lost the most from this lawsuit.

751
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,250
So don't think of it as losing to him.

752
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,949
You're winning it.

753
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,520
When her children grow up,

754
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:39,489
they might think their father took care of them until the end...

755
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,029
while they remember their mother as someone who left them.

756
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:49,040
Ms. Han.

757
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,500
Why are you judging her?

758
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,810
You've crossed the line.

759
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,679
Apologize to her.

760
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I'm sorry.

761
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,889
I kept thinking about it from your children's point of view.

762
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,659
So I overstepped.

763
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:23,739
Whatever decision you make,

764
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,469
the decision you make is the best decision.

765
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,509
Don't feel guilty.

766
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,610
Only focus on how to make the best of...

767
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,549
both of your situations.

768
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,150
We will represent you in whatever direction you set.

769
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,170
(Seoul Family Court)

770
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:00,710
The defendants offered a settlement the last time we met.

771
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:04,178
Plaintiffs, what have you decided?

772
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,710
(Judge)

773
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:15,619
I will accept it.

774
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,719
Ms. Kim Min Jeong. What about you?

775
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,560
Yes. I'll accept it too.

776
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:45,679
Once the four of you sign it,

777
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,449
the case will be closed.

778
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,859
Plaintiff Kim Min Jeong and Defendant Park Min Seok...

779
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,860
will divorce.

780
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,900
Defendant Park Min Seok will be the custodial parent.

781
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,568
The defendant will give the plaintiff...

782
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:02,000
two million dollars as a division of assets.

783
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,899
Plaintiff Kim Jun Hui...

784
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,670
and Defendant Choi Mi Jin will divorce.

785
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,509
Defendant Choi Mi Jin will be the custodial parent.

786
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,408
The plaintiff will not pay her child support...

787
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,850
or divide his assets with the defendant.

788
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:18,049
(Plaintiff)

789
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,690
(Kim Jun Hui)

790
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:46,750
All right. All the proceedings have been finalized.

791
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,318
Thank you, everyone.

792
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,949
Wait.

793
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,060
Hold on.

794
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,960
Mi Jin.

795
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,130
Our son...

796
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,540
Raise him well.

797
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,170
If he asks...

798
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,679
why I'm not living with him anymore,

799
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,619
tell him I'm living near my office...

800
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:30,719
because I have to make a lot more money.

801
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,489
Don't tell him about your affair.

802
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,699
Okay?

803
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,069
Let him have some soda. Okay?

804
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,779
Okay. I'll do that.

805
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,489
I'm sorry.

806
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,400
It's my fault.

807
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,199
Right here,

808
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,670
I see another pair of women crying.

809
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:03,779
How will they live their lives after this point?

810
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,119
When...

811
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,989
did their once-happy lives veer onto...

812
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:12,520
this miserable path?

813
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,040
Mr. Kim was completely against it.

814
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,500
Why did he have a change of heart?

815
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:27,739
I sent him the household investigation report.

816
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,250
Did you check it?

817
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,119
Did my son...

818
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:39,389
really say these things...

819
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,690
to the household investigators?

820
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,360
Yes.

821
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,060
It seems he's already figured out what's going on.

822
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,699
Even before they asked him anything,

823
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,000
he said he would like to live with his mother.

824
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,469
He said his mother needed him.

825
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,539
I still think it's a crazy idea that all of their children...

826
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,009
will live together.

827
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,880
You're so naive. Why did you let yourself get fixated on that idea?

828
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,880
Do you really think they'll move in together?

829
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,419
That's what all cheating spouses say in court.

830
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,819
That they will have a life together.

831
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,730
Do they think saying that will make them look less evil?

832
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,230
They won't move in together. Just watch.

833
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,369
But still. Ms. Kim lost her children to him.

834
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,710
She didn't lose them. She let him hold onto them.

835
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,380
Ta-da.

836
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:39,880
This is my new house.

837
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,409
- Mom. - Yes?

838
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,979
With her visitation right, she'll get to see them often.

839
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,319
The kids will slowly start saying they want to live with their mom.

840
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,690
Can you call Dad?

841
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,789
Park Min Seok...

842
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,489
became the custodial parent to justify what he did.

843
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,560
He'll be busy pretty soon. He'll want to send the kids to her.

844
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,369
- Hey, my daughter. - Dad.

845
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:03,500
I didn't get to see the glow-in-the-dark stairs again.

846
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,409
Could I sleep over at Mom's house?

847
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:08,669
So we can see them before we come back?

848
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,610
Sure. Okay. I'm in the middle of an important meeting.

849
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,508
Spend a few more nights at your mom's house.

850
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:15,079
Okay. I love you, Dad.

851
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,849
I love you too.

852
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,079
He enjoys taking down people.

853
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,619
Once the referee leaves, his passion will subside.

854
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,159
The custody battle to change the custodial parent is tough.

855
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,560
Just because the kids want to live with their mom,

856
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:30,028
they can't change the custodial parent immediately.

857
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:31,130
Come on.

858
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:34,500
What could the legal system do if the kids just moved in with her?

859
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,699
As you know, by law, she can't be forced to hand over the kids.

860
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:42,008
Right.

861
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:44,139
She will have her own property...

862
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,940
and get the kids back.

863
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,880
This is a complete victory for her.

864
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,850
Well, it was inevitable that the kids...

865
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,690
were bound to be hurt by this.

866
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,118
Our job is to maximize...

867
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,630
our clients' profits in the given situation.

868
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,658
Ms. Kim got her own house.

869
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,730
Ms. Han.

870
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,500
You'll get a new bag.

871
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,230
- Pardon? - Drive us to a shop.

872
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:09,469
What?

873
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,210
Am I going to buy a new bag?

874
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:15,039
We closed Ms. Kim's case with the two-million-dollar settlement.

875
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,679
Do you know how much we're getting for our incentive?

876
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:20,109
It will be a hard number to beat...

877
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,909
for the rest of your career as an attorney.

878
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:28,088
No. I'm happy with the bag I have now.

879
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,589
No. I'm not happy with it.

880
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,219
Let's see.

881
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:35,190
(1,500 dollars, 1,300 dollars)

882
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:38,900
She asked me to show you bags that can fit A4 computer paper.

883
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,699
Try this on.

884
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,630
I see. Thank you.

885
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,150
I'm double-booked.

886
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:56,920
(Wedding anniversary)

887
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:09,730
One, two, three.

888
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,900
- Happy wedding anniversary. - Happy wedding anniversary.

889
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,798
My gosh. I can't believe I'm celebrating...

890
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:19,139
a wedding anniversary. It's all thanks to you.

891
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,769
I wanted to come sooner.

892
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,579
No. I know you work at a law firm. It's not easy to get off work early.

893
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,380
I'll make partner soon. So be more patient.

894
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:29,250
- Things will get better. - Yes.

895
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,719
Of course, it will. Here's to my cool wife.

896
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,650
- Cheers. - Cheers.

897
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,859
I'll make a lot more money and buy you the watch...

898
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,560
I couldn't buy when we got married.

899
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:47,400
Gosh. I'm good.

900
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:50,040
Spending time with you like this is the best gift.

901
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:53,909
And...

902
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:56,380
Ta-da.

903
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,880
- Open it. - What is it?

904
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:02,610
What is it?

905
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:10,920
Do you like it?

906
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,159
You check the watch often.

907
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,429
Every time you check, you'll think of me.

908
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,170
Thank you.

909
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,369
Thank you so much.

910
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,080
Hello.

911
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,750
Is there anything you're looking for?

912
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,119
I'm here to pick up my order.

913
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,388
Are you Attorney Cha Eun Kyung?

914
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,389
- Yes, I am. - No way.

915
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,900
One second.

916
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:53,630
Is this right?

917
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:57,400
- Yes. - I'm a big fan of yours.

918
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,539
I love "All About Divorce."

919
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,969
I watched the recent episode too.

920
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,440
How can that jerk have an affair with his wife's friend?

921
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,678
I'm sorry, but can I have your autograph?

922
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,420
- Sure. - One moment, please.

923
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,350
(To Hye Rin)

924
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,429
(Have a happy family!)

925
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,400
(Cha Eun Kyung)

926
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:31,569
Thank you.

927
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,270
Ms. Cha.

928
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:36,980
- Are you done? - Yes.

929
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,909
Thank you.

930
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,429
Ms. Han.

931
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,569
I'm sorry, but were you with Ms. Cha?

932
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,900
- Yes. - Did she go home?

933
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:10,040
Yes, she went home. Why do you ask?

934
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Nothing.

935
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,629
Is it common for one to be unaware...

936
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,429
when the spouse is having an affair with someone close?

937
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,100
Your spouse's affair is always someone around you.

938
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,080
(Attorney at law, Han Yu Ri)

939
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,060
The 16th floor CCTV footage?

940
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:01,389
We can only open it to partner lawyers.

941
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:04,400
This is Ms. Cha Eun Kyung's order.

942
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:06,670
Okay.

943
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,389
(Wedding Anniversary)

944
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:35,060
I'm home to get changed.

945
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,229
Are you coming to the hotel?

946
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,330
(I'm home to get changed. Are you coming to the hotel?)

947
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:44,569
Mom.

948
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:46,770
Are you still up?

949
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,339
When is Dad's conference going to end?

950
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,810
What's taking him so long?

951
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,040
I'll ask him.

952
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,850
Dad always says he'll be home soon.

953
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,549
I miss Dad.

954
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,949
Yes. Go to bed.

955
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,089
I'm going out for a second.

956
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,580
I'll see you at the hotel.

957
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,819
Last Monday...

958
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,420
Here.

959
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,400
(Monday, March 11, 2024)

960
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,789
So, Yu Ri wants japchae?

961
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,829
- A lot of mushrooms, please. - Get them.

962
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,630
You can add any mushroom.

963
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,060
Hello.

964
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:23,699
Oh, honey. That's Ms. Kim from my work.

965
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,699
- You know her, right? - Oh, hi.

966
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:27,408
She moved to our neighborhood recently.

967
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:29,310
- Hello. - Hello, ma'am.

968
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:31,039
We should meet more often.

969
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,540
Yes, you should come over.

970
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:33,850
Thank you.

971
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,020
- See you tomorrow. - Yes, see you at work.

972
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,520
Anything else? Did you say you were buying meat?

973
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,019
Yes.

974
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,489
- Sure. Let's go. - Yes.

975
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,940
I contemplated whether I had to tell him.

976
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:02,040
I didn't know if I should inflict that on my friend as well.

977
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,080
But not telling him...

978
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:06,380
was even worse.

979
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,669
Did you have to...

980
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,069
come all the way to my house at this hour?

981
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,810
Yes, I've always wanted to tell you this.

982
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,580
Sure. Go ahead. Say it now.

983
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:39,810
I have a place to go. Hurry.

984
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,219
Your husband.

985
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,020
Dr. Kim Ji Sang.

986
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,330
He's having an affair.

987
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,270
So?

988
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,810
What?

989
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:13,880
Your husband...

990
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:16,949
is having an affair.

991
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:18,949
I know.

992
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
What?

993
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,319
Then...

994
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:25,489
do you know with whom he's having an affair?

995
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,290
I know that too.

996
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:30,130
Choi Sa Ra.

997
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:41,409
There's no way a wife doesn't know her husband's having an affair.

998
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,179
They can tell with all their senses.

999
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,679
There are only people who failed to obtain the evidence.

1000
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:25,548
(Good Partner)

1001
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:26,649
You had a boyfriend?

1002
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,949
I'll introduce him to you when I get a chance.

1003
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:30,989
Are you not going to divorce him?

1004
01:01:31,259 --> 01:01:32,860
What do I get out of it?

1005
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,230
How can you let them get away with it?

1006
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:39,029
When he called to say he was going to die,

1007
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,730
did I...

1008
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,100
have to take action?

1009
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:47,310
I can no longer work on the divorce team.
