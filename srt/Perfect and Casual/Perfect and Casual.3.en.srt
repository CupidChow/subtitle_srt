when will my grandpa wake up?

184
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,320
Maybe tomorrow.

Okay.

You know about your grandpa’s temper.

187

When he wakes up,

188

to him in every aspect.

Cousin, what are you doing here?

195
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,660
I was going to ask you the same question.

196
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,530
Why are you here?

197

The house you bought is in the opposite.

198

Why are you here?

199

So this isn't the house I bought?

200

The house I bought is next door?

You went to the wrong place.

202

You can forget where your house is.

203

During your stay here,

275
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,640
I'll divide the public area

276
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,980
equally into two parts

277
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,080
for mutual convenience.

278

while I use the right half.

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,030
I won't cross this line.

281
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,250
And I hope you can
keep the agreement, too.

Right half.

284

Come with me.

285
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,810
I made a rule
about the bathroom hours.

286
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,360
Every morning from seven to eight

287
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,060
and from eight to nine in the evening,

288
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,210
I need to use the bathroom.

289
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't go into the
bathroom during this time.

290
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,010
In addition,

291
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,190
remember to change the
slippers used in the bathroom

292
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,730
whenever you enter the bathroom.

293
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,190
Why do we observe time

294
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,430
for the use of bathroom?

295
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,410
Am I being taken in or held custody?

296
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,610
Is there something wrong with it?

297
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,780
No, Mr. Zhang.

298
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,010
Well, may I ask

299
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,770
if you have any other requirements?

300
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,640
I noticed

301
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,170
you don't usually use perfume.

302
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,060
This is quite good.

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,280
I don't like it.

304
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,400
That's the rule in general.

305
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,910
Is there anything to add?

306
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,710
Nothing! Nothing!

307
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,380
Mr. Zhang, I've forgotten about

308
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,850
what you said.

309
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,770
It doesn't matter.

310
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,210
I'll print a copy

311
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,660
of residential rule for you later.

312
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,210
You’ll sleep in the study in the future.

313
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,860
Mr. Zhang,

314
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,380
can I take a nap now?

315
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,120
I'm a little...

316
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,080
Sorry, I haven't finished yet.

317
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,130
During your stay,

318
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,510
I still need to use the study.

319
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,730
So we need to split up

320
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,130
the hours of use of the study.

321
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,330
It's your bedroom from
nine o'clock in the evening

322
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,320
to ten next morning.

323
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,040
It's my study room

324
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,250
from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.

325
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,020
Then... Then do I need to go out now?

326
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,580
Today we'll make it an exception.

327
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,730
You just moved here.

328
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,120
You can settle yourself down first.

329
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,850
But I hope you can strictly observe

330
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,460
hours of use from tomorrow.

331
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,270
OK! Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

332
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,970
Is there anything else to add?

333
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,780
Mr. Zhang,

334
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,310
thank you very much for taking me in.

335
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,960
Actually, I should pay you

336
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,880
accommodation expense or rent.

337
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,850
But I really have no money.

338
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,180
So.

339
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,680
How about

340
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,180
I do all housework

341
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,670
and cook in the future?

342
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,170
Is it all right with you?

343
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,380
Sounds good.

344
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,530
But don't worry.

345
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,520
I'll pay you the relevant fees.

346
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,310
Have I just become a housekeeper?

347
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,180
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang.

348
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,400
What's the matter?

349
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,010
Excuse me, I want to go to the bathroom.

350
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,130
What time is it now?

351
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,660
Half past seven.

352
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,280
The hours of use is on the door.

353
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,760
I know.

354
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,340
But I'm in an emergency.

355
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,950
Can you allow me in?

356
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,160
Just two minutes.

357
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,230
You said no problem

358
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,670
when I made this request.

359
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,590
How did I know before

360
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,140
there would be such a situation now.

361
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,450
You should promise me

362
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,710
after having prediction
about this in advance.

363
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,810
Mr. Zhang, listen.

364
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,130
I really can't hold it in.

365
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,890
If you don't open the door now, I’ll…

366
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,980
You have three minutes.

367
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,990
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

368
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,650
Mr. Zhang, can you step away?

369
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,670
Or three minutes is not
going to be enough.

370
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,230
Stop for a second.

371
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,410
Let me do it.

372
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,880
The production time is four minutes.

373
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,210
Preparation time is half a minute.

374
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,780
Cleaning the kitchen is half a minute.

375
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,480
It adds up to just five minutes.

376
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,190
Today, the delay is

377
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,990
because you aren't used to the
operation process. I understand.

378
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,580
But I hope you'll strictly
follow my operation process

379
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,320
from tomorrow

380
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,640
and won't waste time.

381
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,050
Mr. Zhang, won't you eat breakfast?

382
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,440
As some time was wasted today,

383
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,930
I'll cancel my breakfast time.

384
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,920
Just enjoy

385
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,030
this breakfast.

386
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,420
Okay.

387
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,640
Morning, Professor Zhang.

388
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,610
Morning, Miss Shen.

389
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,100
Today's teaching plan
hasn't changed, has it?

390
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,390
Do you want a change?

391
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,370
What do you mean?

392
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,320
I mean...

393
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,680
I know about
what happened to your grandpa.

394
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,880
Anytime if you're in need,

395
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,200
I can adjust the course arrangement

396
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,250
for you.

397
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,570
That's not necessary for the time being

398
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,860
I've already made arrangements.

399
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,700
There won't be a problem. Thank you.

400
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,080
Miss Yun.

401
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,310
After listening to your description,

402
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,610
I think these houses

403
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,810
are quite suitable for you.

404
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,780
Please have a look.

405
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,630
Actually, I think it's all quite good.

406
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,570
It's just the price...

407
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,580
Miss Yun.

408
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,260
Think about it first.

409
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,340
I'll get you a glass of water.

410
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,300
Thanks.

411
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,110
[My asset 1,357.23]

412
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,980
Miss Yun.

413
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,040
Have you thought it over yet?

414
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,920
Actually, I'd like to ask

415
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,170
if there are houses around
1000 yuan?

416
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,490
One thousand yuan?

417
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,320
Yeah.

418
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,900
There is indeed.

419
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,040
But it's not suitable for little girls.

420
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,390
In fact, it doesn't matter.

421
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,460
I can live anywhere.

422
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,100
How about this?

423
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,800
You can come back in a week.

424
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,210
Then

425
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,390
we’ll introduce a set of shared rent.

426
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,840
That's great. Thanks
for your hard work then.

427
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,320
I'll come back in a week.

428
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,180
Okay.

429
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,060
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

430
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,510
[Professor Zhang, where are you now?]

431
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,160
[Your grandpa woke up early.]

432
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,510
[But he's in very unstable mood.]

433
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,920
I'm on my way to the hospital.

434
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,810
Navigation shows that
I'll arrive in half an hour.

435
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,250
[If your grandpa continues
to be in an unstable mood,]

436
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,030
[we may need to inject some sedatives.]

437
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,170
[I'll permit it. Thanks for your trouble.]

438
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,680
Dr. Zhang.

439
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,130
Professor Zhang.

440
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,130
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

441
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,680
Did my grandpa take a sedative?

442
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,600
No. When she came,

443
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,820
your grandpa cooled down immediately.

444
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,530
Who came here?

445
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,550
Your girlfriend.

446
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,320
Too fast.

447
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,990
Lift your hand a little.

448
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,610
I’ll put a warm water bag under your wrist

449
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,460
to make you feel more
comfortable during the fluid infusion.

450
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,300
Yun Shu, how can you even know this?

451
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,880
Before my dad passed away,

452
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,800
he was hospitalized for
more than eight months.

453
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,070
My sister and I took
care of him at that time.

454
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,690
So I know how to do these things.

455
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,570
Mr. Zhang.

456
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,860
Yun Shu, why are you here?

457
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,660
I always said I wanted
to come and see grandpa.

458
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,610
So I came.

459
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,320
Coincidentally, Grandpa woke up.

460
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,250
Do you feel better now?

461
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,730
I want to drink water.

462
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,470
Water?

463
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,580
Water.

464
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,660
There's no water.

465
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,970
I'm going out to get water.

466
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,560
Let me do that. You stay with Grandpa.

467
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,720
I'll be right back.

468
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,590
Are you feeling better now?

469
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,770
When I was anaesthetized
during the operation,

470
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,400
I seemed to have had a dream.

471
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,410
What dream?

472
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,180
Quantum entanglement.

473
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,470
I dreamed of two quanta.

474
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,570
One was in forward rotation and
while the other was in reverse rotation.

475
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,850
Even if they were far apart,

476
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,980
they were closely linked together

477
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,650
in the unseen world

478
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,980
due to some principles

479
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,000
which cannot be explained
by modern science.

480
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,060
In the same trajectory

481
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,500
and same frequency,

482
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,880
they formed a pair.

483
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,010
Academician Zhang,
what are you trying to say?

484
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,320
I think

485
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,510
those two quanta in my dream

486
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,450
were you and Yun Shu.

487
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,770
I hope you'll get married soon.

488
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,160
Get married?

489
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,920
Your request is ridiculous.

490
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,240
I can't promise.

491
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,400
Calm down.

492
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,760
Grandpa, calm down.

493
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,030
Your blood pressure is a little high.

494
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,660
Academician Zhang, please cool down.

495
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,430
Look,

496
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,890
although there’s the kind
of relationship you said

497
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
in the physical world,

498
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,110
the logic of organisms

499
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,660
is quite different.

500
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,840
Grandpa.

501
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,270
Can you promise me?

502
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,200
Academician Zhang,

503
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,950
I really can't help with what you said.

504
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,920
Grandpa.

505
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,380
As long as you take good care of yourself,

506
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,100
we'll do whatever you say, okay?

507
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,170
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

508
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

509
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,850
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

510
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,570
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

511
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,370
♫ You predict and plan ♫

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,860
♫ But you can't solve the problem
called love ♫

513
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,090
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫
