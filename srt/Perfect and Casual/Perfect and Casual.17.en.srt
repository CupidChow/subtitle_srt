00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,170
Yun Shu.

5
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,780
Cousin Huo Qi?

6
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,340
Yun Shu.

7
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,940
I'll explain to you later.

8
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,820
Go to meet someone with me now.

9
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,440
Let's go.

10
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,560
Mei.

11
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,900
This is the evidence we found.

12
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,030
All invoices of fake VAT
your husband bought

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,730
are here.

14
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
Si Nian.

15
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,080
Sorry for interrupting you.

16
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm in a hurry.

17
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,420
Please excuse me.

18
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,380
Go ahead.

19
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,520
What are you doing here?

20
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,420
Where is Yun Shu?

21
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,730
Why isn't she in the company?

22
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,090
Didn't she go to confess to you?

23
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,970
Confess?

24
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,280
I waited for her downstairs

25
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,410
for half an hour.

26
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,180
But I didn't see her
and couldn't contact her.

27
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,490
That's impossible.

28
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,780
She left forty minutes ago.

29
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,210
Forty minutes?

30
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,320
Forty minutes.

31
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,990
Huo Qi.

32
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,200
I have to call the police.

33
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,170
Don't be hasty.

34
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,740
I know Yun Shu doesn't
want to call the police.

35
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,290
But what do you say we do
if we don't call them?

36
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,560
In the surveillance video,

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,720
we saw Huo Qi came to find Yun Shu.

38
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,250
It's only been three hours
since they left.

39
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,030
The police won't make it a case.

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,940
In addition,

41
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,090
if you rush to the police,

42
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,180
it's likely to threaten

43
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,440
Yun Shu's safety.

44
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,260
I get everything you just said.

45
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,540
So, what do you propose then?

46
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,720
I think I've seen these two people.

47
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,620
They seem to be Mr. Tu's men.

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,450
Who is Mr. Tu?

49
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,270
Hey, girl.

50
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Have some tea.

51
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,720
Why is he kneeling?

52
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,400
Huo Qi.

53
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,600
Why are you kneeling?

54
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,690
Sit.

55
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,110
Have some tea.

56
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,140
It's okay. Thanks.

57
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,270
I don't often drink tea.

58
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,340
Didn't you bring me to see my uncle?

59
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,490
Who is he?

60
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,330
Where are we?

61
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,670
Everyone calls me Mr. Tu.

62
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,510
We

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,570
run short-term financial business

64
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,350
in the market.

65
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,960
Your cousin

66
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,650
borrowed from me

67
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,640
a small sum of 500,000 yuan.

68
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,390
According to the contract,

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,990
he should pay

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,550
the corresponding interest every month.

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,730
After the expiration of three months,

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,120
he should pay everything together
with the principal amount.

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,100
But

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,900
your cousin didn't obey the rules.

75
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,030
He didn't pay interest

76
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,200
but went out to travel.

77
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,460
Was it fun?

78
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,760
Was it fun?

79
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,280
I’m not an unreasonable person.

80
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,480
But everyone

81
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,900
should obey the rules.

82
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,900
You're right.

83
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,800
All debts

84
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,360
should be paid.

85
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,830
Your cousin brought you here today

86
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,930
because he expects you to help him

87
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,330
clear his debt.

88
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,460
You cheated me out of
more than two million yuan.

89
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,620
You still borrowed
money from a loan shark?

90
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,010
How did you spend the money?

91
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,790
What did you do with it?

92
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,360
You cheated such a lovely cousin.

93
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,460
You're such a scum.

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,710
I have nothing to explain.

95
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,430
It's all my fault

96
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,710
for what happened.

97
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,520
Yun Shu.

98
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,900
I just want to tell you I'm sorry

99
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,850
from the bottom of my heart.

100
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,720
I was greedy.

101
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,040
I wanted to make some
easy money in real estate.

102
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,330
So that my parents can
move to live with me early.

103
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,350
But due to real estate
purchase restrictions,

104
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,860
I lost all my money.

105
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,150
I owed a lot of debts.

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,260
And I had to make every endeavour
to borrow money to pay.

107
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,350
Yun Shu.

108
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,200
I just wanted to use your money

109
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,850
to speculate in the stock
market to get all money back.

110
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,260
But then the stock prices fell.

111
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,040
So I lost all my money again.

112
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,790
I had no way out.

113
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,140
-So I went to...
-The truth is,

114
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,300
he took the money to Macao, China

115
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,630
and lost it all.

116
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,690
I was wrong. It was my bad.

117
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,840
That's enough!

118
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,280
You don't have to pay back

119
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,490
the money I gave you.

120
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,150
I'm done dealing with him.

121
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,000
You can deal with him

122
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,020
how you want.

123
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,590
I'm leaving.

124
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,580
Yun Shu.

125
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,180
Yun Shu.

126
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,560
Yun Shu.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,560
Shu.

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,760
What will I do if you leave?

129
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,800
You don't have to pay
back the money you owe me.

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,510
Deal with your own affairs.

131
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,700
Yun Shu.

132
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,820
Yun Shu, don't go.

133
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,110
Yun Shu.

134
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,980
Don't go.

135
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,950
Help me to pay a small sum,
please?

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,060
I know you don't have too much.

137
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,350
But your husband does.

138
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,600
If you two won't save me,

139
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,030
I'll be killed.

140
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,800
How could you hit him?

141
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,590
How could you hit him?

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,560
Dude, please.

143
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,120
Stop. Please.

144
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,730
Just do that to me, okay?

145
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,510
Yun Shu, I'm fine.

146
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,400
I despise men

147
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,490
who don't respect women the most.

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,380
Right here.

149
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,250
Go.

150
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,420
Does it hurt?

151
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,010
Sorry, Yun Shu.

152
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,640
I brought bad luck to you.

153
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,630
No.

154
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,720
It's alright.

155
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,640
I'm really sorry.

156
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,920
What are you doing?

157
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,120
Stop!

158
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,650
Mr. Zhang.

159
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,550
Yun Shu.

160
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,910
Are you injured?

161
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm fine.

162
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,620
She's fine.

163
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,970
It's me who's hurt.

164
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,130
This is illegal imprisonment, okay?

165
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,840
Don't talk nonsense.

166
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,630
We didn't stop this girl from leaving.

167
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,230
It's her cousin.

168
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,960
It's her cousin

169
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,610
who is reluctant to let her go.

170
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,790
Wait for me for a moment.

171
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,770
You must be

172
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,510
Yun Shu's husband, right?

173
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,380
Everybody calls me Mr. Tu.

174
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,390
How should I address you?

175
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
People call me Mr. Zhang.

176
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,420
Mr. Zhang.

177
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,090
What do you teach?

178
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,350
Statistics.

179
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,060
We're both teachers.

180
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
Nice to meet you.

181
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,560
What do you teach?

182
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,060
Social Science.

183
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,630
Yun Shu, let's go.

184
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,830
Wait.

185
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,060
Wait a minute. Things
haven't been made clear yet.

186
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,360
Is it inappropriate

187
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,490
for you to leave, no?

188
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,930
Don't you know the business
you're running?

189
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,760
Private lending with annual
interest rate exceeding 15 percent

190
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,040
is illegal.

191
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,490
I can call the police now.

192
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,990
Who are you?

193
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm Yun Shu's lawyer.

194
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,800
Talk to me

195
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,570
about her problems.

196
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,010
Lawyer?

197
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,240
That's good.

198
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,320
My peer.

199
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
You.

200
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,730
Bring Huo Qi's loan contract here

201
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,150
to let the lawyer help us improve it.

202
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,290
What's wrong with you?

203
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,500
You didn't answer my calls.

204
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,640
Have you eaten?

205
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,960
I can take you for barbecue.

206
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,400
No, thanks.

207
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm a little tired.

208
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,200
Honey.

209
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,850
What's wrong with you recently?

210
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,410
Every time I ask you
out, you'd say you're tired.

211
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,140
Are you deliberately avoiding me?

212
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,190
I've been too busy at work recently.

213
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,350
Maybe another day.

214
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,020
Honey, what's wrong?

215
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,360
I haven't...

216
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,710
I haven't made any mistakes recently.

217
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,710
Are you going to push me for the truth?

218
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,560
Yes.

219
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,520
Lu Yu.

220
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
I kind of like you indeed.

221
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,490
But I'm not prepared to
fall in love with a celebrity.

222
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,950
Acting is my job.

223
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,490
Just like you're a lawyer.

224
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,750
What difference does it make?

225
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,150
The difference is that
I'm an ordinary person.

226
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,490
I won't be surrounded by people.

227
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,450
I don't have to put on disguises.

228
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,180
-People won't give...
-Give what?

229
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,970
If you don't like it, I'll take it off.

230
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,730
Lu Yu, that's not what I mean.

231
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,700
What do you mean?

232
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,510
Hello, Mr. Han.

233
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,800
No problem.

234
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,640
Send me the address.

235
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,000
Where are you going?

236
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,350
To work.

237
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,640
Let me send you there.

238
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,450
You don't have to.
I can go myself.

239
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,870
The contract is fine.

240
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,630
No illegal terms.

241
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,340
The annual interest rate of this contract
is 35%.

242
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,900
Although it exceeds the
stipulated 24% by law,

243
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,550
the range from 24% to 35%

244
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,830
belongs to natural lending
range according to the law.

245
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,250
The court neither
supports it, but it isn't illegal.

246
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,870
Usury is illegal in private lending.

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,950
But the identification of usury

248
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,400
lies in whether the
lender includes interest

249
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,010
in principal compound interest.

250
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,180
And this contract clearly states

251
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,950
the interest shall not be included
in principal compound interest.

252
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,230
So this contract is valid

253
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,660
legally.

254
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,430
That's not true.

255
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,970
Then I just borrowed it
for more than half a year.

256
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,260
Why should I pay back
more than one million?

257
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,610
Because you’re stupid.

258
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,150
They made a security service contract

259
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,800
according to the extra interest.

260
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,140
325,000 yuan of the interest

261
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,640
is made as security service fee.

262
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,660
The last page of the contract

263
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,980
includes the video evidence
of their security services

264
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,170
during his gambling in Macao, China.

265
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,220
So this contract
is also valid legally.

266
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,830
I cannot believe

267
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,690
you actually signed it.

268
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,880
A real insider.

269
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,190
You're really professional.

270
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,220
Yun Shu.

271
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,680
What shall I do

272
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,470
in this situation?

273
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,400
Is there any other way?

274
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,610
Mr. Tu.

275
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,860
There's nothing wrong with the contract.

276
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,730
But can I use the whiteboard?

277
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,210
Sure.

278
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,960
It's my honour

279
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,130
to have dinner with Miss Yun Lan.

280
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,860
You flatter me.

281
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,330
Mr. Han, may I ask
if you have anything urgent?

282
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,300
No.

283
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,960
I just want to thank Miss Yun Lan

284
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,960
for your hard work

285
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,670
on the recent merger
of our company.

286
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,780
Now our company

287
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,880
is about to sign the contract.

288
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,990
So I want

289
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,300
to thank

290
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,400
Miss Yun Lan properly.

291
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,740
Let me take a picture for you.

292
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,910
Let me do it...

293
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,960
[Give my husband, Lu Yu, back!]

294
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,760
Miss Yun Lan?

295
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,210
Sorry, Mr. Han.

296
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,980
What did you just say?

297
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,180
I said

298
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,400
I have a private activity next week.

299
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,230
And I want to invite you to join me.

300
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,560
Would you like to?

301
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,910
Miss Yun Lan,

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,410
you seem a little absent-minded today.

303
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,940
Does the food taste bad?

304
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,070
No.

305
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,360
No problem.

306
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,580
Mr. Han.

307
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,280
Let me know when you set the time.

308
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,620
I'll pick you up myself then.

309
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,140
Mr. Tu, as a businessman,

310
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,780
you must attach importance to

311
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,330
"harmony brings wealth", right?

312
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,140
Cut to the chase.

313
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,270
Okay.

314
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,110
Huo Qi is temporarily unable to repay

315
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,760
the one million yuan.

316
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,660
You can freeze his account

317
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,410
through civil proceedings.

318
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,770
But in this case,

319
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,530
you'll get nothing in the short term.

320
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,170
Your expected revenue value

321
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,800
will be infinitely close to zero.

322
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,610
But don't forget

323
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,220
we got a variety of dunning methods.

324
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,490
If you're sure to choose those methods,

325
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,610
we won't just stay idle.

326
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,110
We'll go to the police.

327
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,470
And the police will be
involved in the investigation.

328
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,370
Or

329
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,320
we'll report you to the
China Banking Regulatory Commission.

330
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,520
They will surely investigate the matter.

331
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,600
What do you want to say?

332
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,730
According to your business model,

333
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,690
10 million will reap a daily profit

334
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,620
of 54,600 yuan.

335
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,380
Whether we go to the police,

336
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,980
or report to the CBRC and
other relevant departments,

337
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,920
your loss

338
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,040
will exceed the income from his loan

339
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,930
as long as you cooperate with
the investigation for ten days.

340
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,730
So

341
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,010
Mr. Zhang, do you
want to repudiate a debt?

342
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,080
Of course not.

343
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,820
It is only right to pay one's debt.

344
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,010
But I suggest a compromise.

345
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,250
I'll pay, on Huo Qi's behalf,

346
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,410
the normal principal
and interest of the debt

347
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,680
of 587,500 yuan.

348
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,150
Meanwhile, you will give up
the 412,500 yuan,

349
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,900
which is compound interest creditors get.

350
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,260
Under such circumstances,

351
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,460
you can get

352
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,590
the normal principal and
interest of 587,500 yuan.

353
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,930
According to your business model,

354
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,920
the normal interest of only 35%

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,540
can make you

356
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,510
yield a normal principal and interest

357
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,570
of 998,700 yuan within 24 months.

358
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,150
Go on.

359
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,500
As a practitioners in
the financial industry,

360
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,140
I think Mr. Tu

361
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,770
must know about Soros' words.

362
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,820
Taking risk

363
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,130
is above reproach,

364
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,140
but...

365
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,470
But you can't

366
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,250
put all your eggs in one basket,

367
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,410
right?

368
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,670
That's right.

369
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,319
I have always respected cultured people.

370
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,440
Okay,

371
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,230
we'll do as you said.

372
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,280
You are welcome.

373
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,640
Please give me an account number

374
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,410
and you'll receive the money

375
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,080
by 12 noon tomorrow.

376
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,290
You're quite frank.

377
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,370
If you can trust me,

378
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,750
then I will

379
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
be taking Huo Qi with me.

380
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,220
Sure.

381
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,500
We're friends now.

382
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,360
Don't worry. It's okay.

383
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,440
How can it be okay?

384
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,040
In this case, it's never okay.

385
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,370
Mr. Zhang.

386
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,580
I was wrong.

387
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,870
I really don't know
what you were thinking.

389
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,970
How could you get into his car
so casually?

390
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,960
Because he mentioned uncle at that time.

391
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,990
So I...

392
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,430
Then why didn't you answer my phone?

393
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,200
At that time, I didn't have my phone.

394
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,000
Mr. Zhang.

395
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,750
It will never happen again.

396
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,170
Next time?

397
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,200
Si Nian.

398
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,770
You were so worried and anxious

399
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,440
when you tried to find her just now.

400
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,620
Now you've found her,

401
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,870
why are you angry?

402
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,980
I just hope

403
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,050
she can learn from this.

404
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,290
Yes, I've learned my lesson.
Absolutely.

405
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,500
Get in the car.

406
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,470
Let's go home.

407
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,510
It's alright.

408
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,780
I can go by myself.

409
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,400
Tu,

410
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,030
how could you let them go?

411
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,000
That's not your style.

412
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,860
I can only say

413
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,010
you don't know my style.

414
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,800
We don't deserve money

415
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,210
from the people of this realm.

416
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,200
What are you doing with a knife?

417
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,050
Come on.

418
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,380
What are you doing?

419
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,580
I'm going to get revenge
on that scum!

420
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,040
Let go.

421
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,600
Let me go. Now!

422
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,340
What's the use of going to him now?

423
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,780
You should just let it go.

424
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,680
Look at yourself.

425
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,440
You look terrible.

426
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,460
It's not that I can't let go.

427
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm bitter!

428
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,740
So you want to go?

429
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,480
I'll go on your behalf.

430
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,440
Wait.

431
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,650
I won't go.

432
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,020
Wait, I won't go.

433
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,990
I won't go. So you can't go either.

434
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,030
Gu Xiao is not good for you.

435
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,670
There are better men out there.

436
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,920
You have me...

437
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,950
I mean

438
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,870
I can help you to find a better man.

439
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,000
What kind of man do you want?

440
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,050
I'll help you.

441
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,570
I want a boyfriend

442
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,400
who comforts me like friends do

443
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,530
when I'm sad,

444
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,320
take care of me

445
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,870
like my father does when
I'm feeling helpless

446
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,400
and protect me

447
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,570
like a brother does when I'm bullied.

448
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,160
Can you find one like that?

449
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
I can definitely help you find

450
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,840
a man who really loves you.

451
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,780
Thank you, Mr. Han.

452
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,270
We're friends.

453
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,560
You don't have to say that.

454
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,410
I'll walk you up.

455
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,670
You don't have to.

456
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,920
I can go by myself.

457
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,020
Who was that?

458
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,360
Mr. Han from Xin Da company.

459
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,430
I was wondering why
he looked so familiar.

460
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,890
Why haven't you gone back yet?

461
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,720
I'm waiting for you.

462
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,910
I'm not in the mood today.

463
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,630
You might as well go home.

464
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,710
Yun Lan.

465
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,300
That's enough.

466
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,710
I'm really leaving if you keep doing this.

467
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,090
Lu Yu.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,030
-Yes?
-We are from different walks of life.

469
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,480
It's an unavoidable problem
between you and me.

470
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,490
Think it over when you go back.

471
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,290
What's going on?

472
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,920
Tell me,

473
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,520
why did you bring me here?

474
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,450
I... I said I'd find you
a boyfriend, right?

475
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,530
Are you really going to
find one on the street?

476
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,850
What's wrong with it?

477
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,680
It's rare to find a three-legged toad

478
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,980
but easy to find a two-legged man.

479
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,960
Alright.

480
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,510
I'll help you find a girlfriend today.

481
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,550
Okay.

482
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,970
Let's help each other.

483
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,180
How about this one wearing a shirt?

484
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,850
Oh, come on.

485
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,110
Just one glance

486
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,690
and I can tell he's the worst.

487
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,220
But the girl next to him is not bad.

488
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,490
She looks refined.

489
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,690
Refined?

490
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,400
She's revealing too much
in that short skirt.

491
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,010
It's not that bad.

492
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,090
I think it's fine.

493
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,120
Why is it so difficult

494
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,960
to find a good man?

495
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,440
It's the same case with

496
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,010
finding a good woman.

497
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,840
How about

498
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,850
we go to a karaoke for entertainment?

499
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,760
Does it still hurt?

500
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,150
No.

501
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,590
Are you not finished?

502
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,650
Keep still.

503
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
When I was a kid,

504
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,030
my sister and I got injured often.

505
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,260
So,

506
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm very good

507
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,200
at treating wounds.

508
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,130
Yun Shu.

509
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,090
There's something I want to tell you.

510
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,480
[Meng Ran]

511
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,530
I'll answer it later.

512
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,420
Hello, Mr. Meng.

513
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,670
Si Nian and I are fine.

514
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,940
Thank you for your help today.

515
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,900
Yun Shu.

516

518

529

Umm...

530
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,900
This is a little awkward.

531
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
Right.

532
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,190
How about....

533
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,600
How about....

534
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,610
How about....

535
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,450
we don't do it?

536
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,020
No.

537
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,470
No.

538
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,350
I probably haven't
been in love for too long.

539
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,610
I probably haven't
been in love for too long.

540
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,130
I probably haven't
been in love for too long.

541
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,860
So I feel a little rusty.

542
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:19,910
So I feel a little rusty.

543
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,220
Why don't we try again?

544
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,650

550
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,990
Mr. Zhang.

551
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,010
Let's have breakfast.

552
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,570
Morning.

553
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,900
Morning.

554
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,060
Mr. Zhang.

555
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,420
Why are you...

556
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,380
I can enjoy the better scenery from here.

557
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,510
And

558
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,750
the field of vision will be wider.

559
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,910
Can I?

560
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,920
Left half and right half.

561
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,190
Why do we observe time
for the use of bathroom?

562
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,780
Am I being taken in or held custody?

563
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,030
Mr. Zhang.

564
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,310
Excuse me, I need the bathroom.

565
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,890
The hours of use is on the door.

566
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
[07:00-08:00 20:00-21:00]

567
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,460
[Oh, my gosh.]

568
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,170
[It's so sweet.]

569
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,720
[But, Yun Shu,]

570
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,930
[from today on,]

571
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,050
[you don't need to watch
these love dramas anymore.]

572
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,580
[Because Mr. Zhang and you]

573
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,940
[will have your own sweet,
love drama.

574
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,010
You two made up again?

575
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,720
Come on.

576
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,490
What's going on with you two?

577
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,710
You got back together

578
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,460
or you unilaterally made the worst choice?

579
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,470
I wasn't in good mood

580
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,150
and wanted him to drink with me.

581
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,560
But the result was that

582
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,970
we both got in the mood.

583
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,160
So what are you two going to do now?

584
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,230
I think

585
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,170
the man

586
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,370
who cares about me most

587
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,130
is still Lin Nuo after so many years.

588
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,820
Yi Yi,

589
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,010
you need to know

590
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,300
that we like a person

591
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,000
because he is the man.

592
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,200
Not because he cares about us most.

593
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,570
I don't know what I'm thinking either.

594
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,850
I think I like him.

595
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,480
But we've been friends for two years.

596
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,510
I'm really not used
to the new relationship.

597
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,590
Anyway.

598
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,270
You must think it over

599
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,210
and don't hurt Lin Nuo.

600
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,560
Okay. Don't talk about me.

601
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,960
Tell me about your story.

602
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,700
How was it going

603
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,940
between Professor Zhang and you?

604
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,770
When I got up

605
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,140
this morning. I set an alarm clock.

606
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,440
I brushed my teeth

607
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,960
and applied a new lipstick.

608
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,210
I wanted to stand in
front of Professor Zhang

609
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,000
and let him give me a morning kiss.

610
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,570
Do you know what happened?

611
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,560
What?

612
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,800
Mr. Zhang.

613
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,050
Morning.

614
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,690
Morning.

615
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,720
Your bag.

616
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,540
Don't you go to work at ten o'clock?

617
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,860
Why did you get up so early?

618
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,480
I couldn't sleep.

619
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,910
Then read a book.

620
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,160
It's efficient for you
to read during the day.

621
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,590
Your lips are a little red.

622
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,810
Does it look good?

623
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,880
Did you get excessive internal heat?

624
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,400
There’s bitter chrysanthemum
in the cupboard.

625
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,600
Infuse it with hot water.

626
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,730
And you should drink more water.

627
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,790
And this.

628
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,910
It works well.

629
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,380
Drink more bitter chrysanthemum tea.

630
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,570
I'm going to work.

631
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,730
Tell me why a man goes out
with a lipstick?

632
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,250
I was so angry.

633
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,760
The cute Professor Zhang

634
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,650
is really an indifferent,

635
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,610
mysterious and strong-minded straight man
as people say.

636
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,820
Yi Yi.

637
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,400
When can the sweet love story in TV series

638
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,850
come to me?

639
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,120
I'm still doubting

640
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,680
if the kiss last night

641
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,600
was for real or not.

642
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,600
In order to deal with
such straight man,

643
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,580
we must

644
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,120
take the initiative to grab him.
