[Episode 5]

4
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,180
Mr. Zhang.

5
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,220
Why did you give in?

6
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,970
You mean the marriage?

7
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,350
Because I feel like

8
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,650
what Grandpa said

9
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,780
made some sense.

10
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,700
And if we get married,

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
we'll both get what we need

12
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,990
and

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,050
overcome all the difficulties we have.

14
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,070
Mr. Zhang, you're confusing me.

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,590
From what you just said,

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,380
marriage sounds more
like some partnership.

17
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,760
Right.

18
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,170
The marriage I'm talking about

19
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,980
is not a marriage in
the traditional sense,

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,990
but a contractual relationship.

21
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,170
Contractual relationship?

22
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,670
Yun Shu.

23
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,360
You’re having a hard time.

24
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,670
Trusting your cousin

25
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,910
[Trusted cousin wholeheartedly]
led to your parents inheritance being cheated away,

26

[Trusted cousin wholeheartedly]

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,930

which caused your survival crisis.

29
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,210
As for me,

30
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,910
my biggest problem

31
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,720
is to satisfy my grandpa's wish

32
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,750
to marry you.

33
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,910
So we have something

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
in common.

35
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,220
If you sign a contract with me,

36
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,720
I'll give you the title.

37
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,660
So if

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,210
you figure out,

39
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll prepare the contract right now

40
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,930
I can't.

41
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,390
Why?

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,490
Is there anything wrong with my words?

43
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,490
Mr. Zhang.

44
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,350
I've never been in love

45
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,140
but you want me get
married because of a house.

46
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,950
It's not the way my mind works.

47
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,079
But don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

48
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,530
I'll take care of

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,930
your grandpa at any time.

50
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,230
Okay.

51
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,040
You can refuse it.

52
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,600
I can understand that.

53
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,730
It's a scandal!

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,960
A scandal? So why are you yelling?

55
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,760
No, Yun Shu. Listen to me.

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,960
If a man talks to you
for something like this,

57
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,340
he doesn’t really like you.

58
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,720
A marriage without real feelings

59
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,520
will never work.

60
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,250
Yes.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,710
Yun Shu, tune him out.

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
Mr. Zhang is a nice man.

63
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,560
He's kind to you,

64
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,800
even giving you the house.

65
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,620
That's all well and good.

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,680
Of all the boyfriends I’ve had,

67
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,060
no one has ever treated me like this.

68
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,550
Gao Zhiyi, what do you mean?

69
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,620
You mean I don't own a house?

70
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,380
Then why did you date me?

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,860
I was blind.

72
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,010
Come on.

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,710
It was because we love each other.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,190
So in short, Yun Shu.

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,070
A marriage without real feelings

76
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,050
means a no.

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,000
Why are you so sure
they won't develop true love later?

78
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,920
As she said, Mr. Zhang is so kind

79
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,800
and considerate.

80
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,970
They are sure to have
a good result in a year.

81
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,820
Gao Zhiyi.

82
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,790
I really think there’s something
wrong with your values.

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm wrong?

84
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,640
Lin Nuo, do you know what love is?

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,540
Why don't I know what love is?

86
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,730
Then tell me what love is.

87
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,220
Love, at least the two...

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,720
Enough.

89
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,270
Stop yelling.

90
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,870
It’s making my head spin.

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,750
Let me think.

92
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,890
Come on, come on.

93
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,930
Feng Qi, come on.

94
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,350
Come on.

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,870
Hello.

96
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,810
OK, I'll be right there.

97
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,350
Thanks.

98
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,910
Who's that? Mr. Zhang?

99
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,820
Real estate agency.

100
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,170
He said he's found

101
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,420
a house I could afford.

102
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,540
You're moving out?

103
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,410
At this point,

104
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,250
I can’t stay there.

105
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,890
Come on.

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,990
Qi Qi is so cool.

107
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,440
So handsome!

108
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,630
Feng Qi is cool.

109
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,950
Qi Qi is so cool!

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
Here.

111
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,270
The price of joint rent

112
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,340
is five hundred yuan.

113
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,760
If it's five hundred yuan,

114
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,240
may I pay it one to one?

115
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,340
One to one?

116
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,680
Please.

117
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,300
Great view.

118
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,490
If I could smoke,

119
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,820
that would be perfect.

120
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,630
Academician Zhang.

121
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,720
The doctor said

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,460
you can only be out for half an hour.

123
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,770
Now it's time.

124
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,400
Tune them out.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,780
When I was young,

126
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,560
the doctors set the rules for me.

127
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,190
But few of them are alive now.

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,970
When you were young,

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,830
how old were they?

130
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,670
Not very old.

131
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,790
About seventy.

132
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,230
Anyway,

133
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,120
why hasn't Yun Shu
come to see me recently?

134
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,560
If she’s not that busy,

135
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,110
tell her to come and see me.

136
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,970
Yun Shu...

137
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,090
She should have her own arrangements.

138
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,280
What do you mean?

139
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,730
You don't care much

140
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,220
about her daily life.

141
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,550
If you are so indifferent,

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,409
your marriage won't last long.

143
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,360
Academician Zhang.

144
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,440
You don't have to worry about it.

145
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,060
Should I just look on?

146
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,320
You don't have much experience in love.

147
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,409
You need to learn from me.

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,270
Do you know

149
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,270
how I wooed your grandma?

150
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,410
Grandpa, I don't want to know.

151
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,480
Your heart is far from your lips.

152
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,110
You

153
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,060
need one thing now.

154
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,030
What?

155
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,990
Where are you going?

156
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,440
Mr. Zhang.
It's been too much trouble for you,

157
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,140
so I'm going to move out.

158
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,310
I've found a place to live.

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,310
I bought you something.

160
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,550
It's being delivered.

161
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,440
Just a gift for you.

162
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,800
I have a present for you, too.

163
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,280
It's inside.

164
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,420
Hi, where do I put your bed?

165
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,409
Please put it in the study.

166
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,730
Mr. Zhang, this bed...

167
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,610
I hope

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,230
it can help you sleep better.

169
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,440
Excuse me.

170
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,500
I put away the bed.

171
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,300
Thanks.

172
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,740
It's okay.

173
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,080
The bed can be taken back.

174
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,580
That's kind of you.

175
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,910
In all this time,

176
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,860
thank you for your care.

177
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,660
I'm leaving now.

178
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,460
Yun Shu.

179
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,750
I'll walk you out.

180
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,460
Okay.

181
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,830
Mr. Zhang.

182
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,140
Just here.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,890
Thank you very much.

184
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
I’m sure we’ll meet again

185
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,270
for my thesis defense next year,

186
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,290
right?

187
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Okay.

188
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,000
The contract I offered you

189
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,860
will be valid for a month.

190
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,300
Okay.

191
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,610
Mr. Zhang.

192
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,940
This is the access card.

193
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Now I give it back.

194
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,900
Well.

195
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,770
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang.

196
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,410
Mr. Zhang.

197
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,950
Is it next year already?

198
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,070
No.

199
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,630
Yun Shu.

200
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Sister.

201
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,020
Sister?

202
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,380
What are you up to here?

203
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,620
Sis, why are you back?

204
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,740
I'll take the case.

205
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,820
Shouldn't I be back?

206
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,240
I told you I was coming back.

207
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,900
Sorry.

208
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,710
Who's that?

209
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,080
-I am...
-He is... is...

210
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,010
This is my boyfriend.

211
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,890
Hello, I'm Zhang Si Nian.

212
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,320
I am...

213
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,940
I'm her boyfriend.

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,430
This is my sister, Yun Lan.

215
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,040
Boyfriend?

216
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,740
When did you get a boyfriend?

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,760
Two months ago.

218
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,980
Then why are you carrying a suitcase?

219
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,030
You broke up?

220
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,610
No, no, no.

221
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,080
This is... We’re taking out the garbage.

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,120
Garbage?

223
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,530
Yeah! The garbage.

224
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,580
It's done.

225
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,020
Let's go up.

226
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,270
Slippers.

227
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,730
You can have my slippers.

228
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,310
So big.

229
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,520
Big slippers are comfortable at home.

230
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,840
Where's the bathroom?

231
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,100
I'll take you there.

232
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,070
Over there.

233
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,890
In the middle.

234
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,610
What's this?

235
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
This is my health date.

236
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,840
From seven to eight,

237
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,020
it's best time to get up.

238
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,910
From eight to nine in the evening,

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,130
it's best time to sleep.

240
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,410
Go to the bathroom.

241
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,280
Mr. Zhang, help me!

242
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,230
With what?

243
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,100
Pretend to be my boyfriend.

244
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,220
If my sister knows

245
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,820
the house is not mine, I'll...

246
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,820
When did she get a boyfriend?

247
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
She didn’t tell me.

248
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,770
Mr. Zhang, what are you doing?

249
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,300
You told me to take off the tape.

250
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,940
Can you do it a little faster?

251
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,230
That’ll stick to the table.

252
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,780
Your sister’s in the back right now.

253
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,670
I know.

254
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,090
Mr. Zhang.

255
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,580
Thank you for helping me.

256
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,650
Sis.

257
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,150
You're here.

258
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,740
Are you hungry?

259
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,140
I'll get you something to eat.

260
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,950
Go inside.

261
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,450
I have something to ask your boyfriend.

262
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,050
Just ask me, Sis.

263
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Go to your room.

264
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,360
I'll ask you later.

265
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,330
Okay.

266
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,180
Have a seat.

267
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,040
Mr. Zhang.

268
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,510
May I ask you some questions?

269
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
What do you do?

270
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,550
I’m an associate professor of
mathematics at Zheng Ben University.

271
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,300
Zhang Si Nian and you...

272
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,880
You fell in love in school?

273
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,370
No.

274
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,790
When we were at school,

275
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,940
he actually kind of disliked me.

276
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,910
Really?

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,540
Yes.

278
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,850
How did you fall in love?

279
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,570
It is because...

280
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,280
of the house.

281
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,610
I bought his house.

282
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,070
And who confessed first?

283
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,920
Why?

284
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,350
You don't even remember this.

285
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,800
No, let me see.

286
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,030
It was Yun Shu.

287
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,710
Yeah, somewhat

288
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,020
I cornered him in the park that day.

289
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,940
What about your first date?

290
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,190
In the cafe.

291
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,900
Our first date

292
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,710
[was at the cafe.]

293
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,820
[We didn't do anything that day.]

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
[I just told her a lot]

295
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,320
[about coffee.]

296
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
As for who confessed first,

297
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,190
that was me.

298
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,530
I told her.

299
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,620
I want us

300
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,160
to be more than friends.

301
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,390
Any more questions?

302
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,510
Sorry, I've got a call.

303
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,150
Hello.

304
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,820
Quantity check?

305
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,980
OK, I'll be right there.

306
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,230
When do you want it?

307
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,470
[At the trial tomorrow morning.]

308
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,510
Tomorrow morning?

309
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,510
There's no time.

310
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,660
[But this report is our]

311
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,020
[only hope to win the lawsuit.]

312
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,020
Statistics is not my expertise.

313
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,010
I can't do anything
if you're in such a hurry.

314
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,820
[But you're a professional lawyer.]

315
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,790
Maybe

316
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,070
I can help.

317
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I need you to tell me

318
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,430
the site and route data of the truck.

319
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,000
-Look, is this it?
-Yes.

320
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,470
I also need to know
the capacity of each car

321
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,110
and the weight of the goods
together with the packing case.

322
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,740
Hello.

323
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,470
Send the capacity of each car and...

324
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,110
And the weight of the goods and packaging.

325
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,230
...and the weight of the
goods and packaging to me.

326
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,970
Here.

327
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,360
That's the data you need.

328
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,090
Thanks.

329
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,130
Sis, the room is ready.

330
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,329
You can sleep here today.

331
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,579
Professor Zhang also read love novels.

332
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,650
Where are you going to sleep?

333
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,500
I... I sleep in the bedroom opposite.

334
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,150
You two...

335
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,310
No, no, no, Sis.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,510
Watch what you say.

337
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,700
He sleeps on the floor.

338
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,180
Enough. All right, go to sleep.

339
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,960
Good night.

340
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,620
Nighty-night.

341
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Hey, what are you doing?

342
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,700
Going to the bathroom.

343
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,420
What are you doing?

344
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,940
I'm going back to my room.

345
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,000
What's the matter?

346
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,440
Sis.

347
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,390
You rarely come back.

348
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,630
I miss you so much.

349
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,810
How about

350
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,130
sleeping with you tonight?

351
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,410
I don't want to sleep on the floor.

352
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,940
Then I'll go to bed.

353
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,500
Goodnight.

354
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,390
That kid.

355
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,310
Mr. Zhang.

356
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,370
Sorry.

357
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,320
Are you dressed?

358
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,400
You should have knocked.

359
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,350
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

360
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,320
Because of

361
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,340
my sister...

362
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,060
So tonight, I

363
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,570
have to share a room with you.

364
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,090
But there is

365
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,450
only one quilt.

366
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,410
It's fine.

367
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,110
I can sleep on the floor without a quilt.

368
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,330
I have an idea.

369
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,300
This method

370
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,170
can perfectly merge

371
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,470
your thoughts with mine.

372
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,700
Mr. Zhang.

373
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,310
Thank you for today,

374
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,770
for doing me such a big favor.

375
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,820
You're welcome.

376
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,630
But I suggest,

377
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,260
under such condition,

378
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,600
you had better think about

379
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,280
the offer I made earlier.

380
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,180
It's a perfect solution

381
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,190
to all your problems.

382
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,170
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang.

383
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,780
I can't do that.

384
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,750
Alright.

385
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,510
Goodnight.

386
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,710
What's the matter?

387
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,170
Mr. Zhang, you sleep first.

388
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,280
I have something to do.

389
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
What are you doing?

390
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,240
Mr. Zhang.

391
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,010
Well...

392
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,930
This morning,

393
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,700
I threw a white luggage over there.

394
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,800
That's my suitcase.

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,770
But I can't find it now.

396
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,470
I've been looking for it all around.

397
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,270
What are you doing?

398
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,270
The case.

399
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,170
What suitcase?

400
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,070
I haven't seen it.

401
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,940
What did he say?

402
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,100
He said what case?

403
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,260
He didn't see.

404
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,140
Well, we’d like to
look at the surveillance video.

405
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,860
Because that case
is important to us.

406
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,200
-Yes, yes.
-We want to know who took it.

407
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,920
Yeah, I see.

408
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,410
You want to see

409
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,290
the surveillance video.

410
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,320
No problem.

411
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,570
But recently,

412
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,720
the whole surveillance
system has broken down.

413
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,160
The repairing is under way.

414
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,130
What did he say?

415
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,710
He said the surveillance
system doesn't work.

416
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,560
It wasn't recorded at all.

417
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,790
So we can't see it at all.

418
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,770
Yes.

419
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,550
It's broken?

420
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,280
What should I do?

421
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,900
How about

422
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,810
going to

423
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,180
the property management office?

424
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,790
If it's expensive,

425
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,770
it can’t be lost.

426
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,980
The cleaner probably
sent it to the management office.

427
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,360
Okay.

428
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,290
I see. Go to the management office.

429
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,090
Is this your case?

430
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,940
Yeah, it's mine.

431
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,740
The sanitation workers put it on the car

432
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,130
to take it away.

433
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,540
I could tell it's not garbage.

434
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,550
So I brought it back.

435
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,540
Thank you.

436
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,930
I didn’t make a mess of it.

437
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,750
The sanitation worker is to blame.

438
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,220
I packed everything up

439
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,520
and brought it back.

440
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,670
Alright.

441
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,380
Let me see.

442
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,840
You sure this is everything?

443
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah, they're all here.

444
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,710
I haven't taken anything.

445
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,330
Okay, Mr. Zhang.

446
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,720
Alright.

447
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,790
I'll go back and check it.

448
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,270
Thanks.

449
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,730
Is the toy so important to you?

450
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,690
Yes.

451
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,020
What does it look like?

452
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,880
Wuqian

453
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,750
is about this big.

454
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,100
And it's white.

455
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,470
Actually, it's creamy white.

456
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,710
That’s not very specific.

457
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,750
Are there any photos?

458
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,720
Yes.

459
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,900
This is your father?

460
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,750
Okay, I see.

461
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,490
According to

462
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,510
the cleaner,

463
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,370
it's probably in the sanitation truck.

464
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,170
The truck carries the garbage,

465
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,310
which will be transported
to a nearby sanitation station.

466
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,680
From 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.,

467
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,180
the garbage will be loaded away.

468
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,380
So you'd better go back and get some rest.

469
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,480
Tomorrow morning,

470
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,690
before 8:30 a.m,

471
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,440
you can go to the sanitation station.

472
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,420
There's a high chance you can find it.

473
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,610
Let's go.

474
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,130
Without Wuqian,

475
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,210
you can't sleep?

476
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,340
No.

477
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,200
I’m just not used to it.

478
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,510
Since you can't sleep,

479
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,900
let's talk about your thesis.

480
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,320
My thesis?

481
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,890
Because I was late,

482
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,900
you failed me.

483
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,090
Although you were late,

484
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,890
you still handed in the paper.

485
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,210
Whether you pass it or not,

486
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,530
I’m obligated to check it.

487
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,320
I'll tell you the problem.

488
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,040
But I have

489
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,100
forgotten what I wrote.

490
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,380
It's okay.

491
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,440
I haven't.

492
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,720
There is nothing wrong
with the overall structure.

493
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,890
But there are many small mistakes.

494
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,040
In Chapter One,

495
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,470
the data you chose

496
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,330
is from 2003.

497
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,270
So the data coverage time

498
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
is too short.

499
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,010
The data fails to support

500
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,030
your final conclusion.

501
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,480
In Chapter Two,

502
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,970
if you

503
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,100
choose the right data, some
volatility will be eliminated.

504
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,860
That will also make the data

505
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,490
more stable.

506
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,550
The model is wrong.

507
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,860
You should use the VAR model.

508
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,100
In Chapter Five,

509
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,110
you made the same mistake
as Chapter One.

510
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,920
Your data is selected from 1990

511
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,930
to 2000.

512
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,380
Such a period

513
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,050
for today's society

514
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,520
is really insufficient.

515
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,100
If I get a chance,

516
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,090
I’ll help you choose the right books.

517
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,020
That's about it.

518
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,830
I hope that next year
before the thesis defense,

519
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,120
you can review the key knowledge

520
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,690
and systematacially...

521
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,220
take lessons.

522
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,980
Yun Shu.

523
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,460
Yun Shu.

524
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,510
You two are liars.

525
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,430
You use the most despicable means

526
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,800
to cover up the truth.

527
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,070
What you did is against the law.

528
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,780
You invaded other's
right to learn the truth.

529
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,830
Wait.

530
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,340
What's the matter?

531
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,120
As far as I know,

532
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,410
in the company law of China and overseas,

533
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,480
the definition of shareholders'
right to know is different.

534
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,980
So you shouldn’t say that.

535
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,910
I see.

536
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,190
It seems that
I need to be more familiar

537
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,220
with the articles both at home and abroad.

538
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,190
Sis.

539
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,540
What are you doing?

540
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,740
I'm doing the laundry,

541
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,520
while asking Professor Zhang

542
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,020
to help me with the court debate.

543
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,140
I didn’t know he's good at the law.

544
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,160
Thanks.

545
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,690
When I was in college,

546
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,830
math is easy for me,

547
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,750
so I minor in theoretical physics and law

548
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,220
to kill time.

549
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,710
It's ten past seven.

550
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,090
You have to go at eight.

551
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,680
I'm off.

552
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,640
I have something to do, Sis.

553
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,540
I'll be back soon.

554
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,680
Stop!

555
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,290
What's the matter?

556
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,390
What's this?

557
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,740
[Certificate of Incompletion]

558
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,490
Incompletion?

559
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,800
I never asked you to excel

560
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,730
in four years of your college.

561
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,290
But you can't even graduate.

562
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,440
You failed to fulfil your promise.

563
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,760
Anyhow, I have double degrees

564
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,040
in Finance Law and Business Law of Walton School.

565
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,150
Why could I have such a

566
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,250
stupid sister like you?

567
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,900
You can't say that about her.

568
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,720
Professor Zhang,

569
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,390
this is between me and my sister.

570
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,810
Please stay out of it!

571
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,580
I was just saying a fact.

572
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,610
And I don't agree with you
calling her stupid.

573
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't need your approval.

574
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,200
Even her thesis is a mess.

575
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,770
What is she if not stupid?

576
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,990
Professor Zhang,

577
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,870
I'd really like to know

578
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,530
how you can tolerate such a girlfriend.

579
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,500
First of all.

580
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,180
My educational background and hers

581
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,590
are irrelevant to our relationship.

582
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,710
It is your one-sided view
forcefully imposed on us.

583
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,680
Secondly.

584
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,410
I have read

585
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,850
the paper written by Yun Shu.

586
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,300
It isn't a mess.

587
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,820
Thesis,

588
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,880
talking points,

589
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,780
and frame structure

590
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,020
are all right.

591
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,430
At least,

592
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,580
all of these are above the passing score.

593
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,830
But her paper didn't pass
due partly to her own account

594
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,600
as well as mine.

595
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,840
She was late that day

596
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,030
which affected my subjective judgment.

597
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,660
Thirdly.

598
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,180
None of us is perfect.

599
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,730
Yun Shu has got her own problems.

600
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,240
But at least,

601
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,090
she has many good points too.

602
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,270
So,

603
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,990
what should she do this year?

604
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,960
I will take charge.

605
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,530
I'll help her

606
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,270
for the remainder of the year

607
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,570
so as to ensure that she can successfully
complete the defense next year.

608
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,250
And I'll also ensure that

609
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,580
nobody ever calls her stupid again.

610
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
I'm heading to school.

611
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,170
Then you'll help me pack up.

612
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,400
I want to move out.

613
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,220
Because the public
display of affection just now

614
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,740
made me mad.

615
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,890
Sis, are you still angry with me?

616
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,220
You even didn't consult me

617
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,180
before you picked your boyfriend.

618
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,600
Should I be mad

619
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,750
or happy for you?

620
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,730
What do you mean?

621
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,240
Yun Shu.

622
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,920
There is a big difference between you two.

623
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,900
I recognize

624
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,610
you may be happy with him.

625
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,550
But you may also be hurt badly.

626
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,890
Sis, rest assured.

627
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,320
I've already got the picture.

628
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,040
I don't think so.

629
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,090
In future, don't hide your relationship

630
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,120
from me any longer.

631
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,500
Also,

632
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,240
you must tell me before
you make any decision.

633
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,280
Got it?

634
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,340
Yes, madam.

635
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,680
I have to go.

636
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,920
Goodbye.

637
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,140
Yeah, it's quite important to me,

638
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
so I have to search for it carefully.

639
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,040
Please take a look again.

640
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,190
Is it in the box inside?

641
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,590
Mr. Zhang.

642
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,690
Nothing here.

643
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,100
Why are you here?

644
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,160
You weren't going to make it in time,

645
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,420
so I came here first.

646
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,280
There is no class in the morning anyway.

647
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,210
Your clothes are all dirty.

648
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,540
It's okay.

649
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,330
I've just searched through all the garbage

650
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,140
in the neighborhood,

651
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,420
but I haven't found it yet.

652
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,010
I'll search for it again.

653
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,250
It's fine.

654
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,480
Let's go home.

655
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,740
Can you accept a newly-bought bunny?

656
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,470
Forget it.

657
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,350
Wuqian is gone.

658
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,750
I don't need others.

659
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,790
Your logic really confuses me.

660
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,870
You can

661
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,030
turn down a house

662
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,030
but loath to give up a plush toy.

663
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,110
Because in my mind,

664
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,230
Wuqian is more valuable than a house.

665
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,130
So, what's your measure of value?

666
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,190
Maybe Wuqian has been with me
since childhood,

667
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,310
so I have affection towards it.

668
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,550
Then, your rejection of my offer...

669
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,630
Mr. Zhang.

670
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,180
Maybe too many things happened recently.

671
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,080
So I might not have come to my senses

672
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,910
and figured out what to do yet.

673
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,980
Wuqian?

674
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,030
Hold on, good girl.

675
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,680
This bunny is not yours, right?

676
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,840
So what?

677
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,010
This is mine.

678
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,910
Will you give it back to me?

679
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,780
No, I won't.

680
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,690
How can you take someone else's stuff?

681
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,980
So what?

682
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,350
Let me try.

683
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,280
Little girl.

684
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,980
You said this bunny isn't yours.

685
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,490
You are holding someone else's bunny

686
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,080
but refuse to give it back.

687
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,320
Instead, you insist on keeping it.

688
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,490
This is encroaching on
someone else's property.

689
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,000
So what?

690
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,450
Here is some money for you.

691
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,070
Go and buy a better and newer bunny, okay?

692
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,040
No.

693
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,350
What?

694
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,840
Wait for me.

695
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,320
May I exchange this bunny for the

696
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,800
one in your hand?

697
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,880
No, I don't want it! It's too ugly!

698
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,580
Too ugly?

699
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,350
Girl.

700
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,820
Can you hold it for me?

701
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,590
Here you are.

702
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,020
And this.

703
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,060
Hold it for me.

704
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,880
Yun Shu.

705
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,250
Here you are.

712
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,780
This is the last word my father

713
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,530
left to me.

714
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,030
He has passed away.

715
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,460
Thank you

716
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,830
for your helping me to find it back.

717
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,010
I think I understand now.

718
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,820
My previous calculation

719
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,290
was wrong.

720
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,220
In my original formula,

721
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,780
you need a house,

722
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,440
but I need you to sign a contract with me

723
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,140
for meeting my grandpa's demand.

724
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,950
I always believed that this house

725
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,140
was the common point we appealed to.

726
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,130
Now,

727
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,760
after knowing about Wuqian,

728
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,300
I realise we actually do not have

729
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,510
a shared common point.

730
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,820
It was too hasty of me

731
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,770
to give the suggestion previously.

732
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,320
No, I don't think so.

733
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,670
It does exist.

734
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,040
Your attachment to your grandpa

735
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,110
is just like

736
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,560
mine to my father.

737
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,640
So...

738
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,290
Thank you for helping me to find

739
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,570
my memories with my father.

740
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,890
You're welcome.

741
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,770
Here's your jacket.

742
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,120
Thanks.

Now, I need to

744
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,020
take a shower.

Mr. Zhang.

746
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,960
Why did you help me so much?

747
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,010
Mr. Zhang.

748
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,110
Why are you so kind to me?

749
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,890
Because you deserve it.

750
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,010
I... I'm willing to fulfill grandpa's
wish with you.

751
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,200
