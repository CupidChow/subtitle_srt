4
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,410
Get in the car.

5
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,510
I will drive you there.

6
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,750
Won't you be late for class?

7
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,870
If you get in the car now,

8
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,370
we won't be late.

9
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,740
Mr. Zhang.

10
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,440
What to do?
There's a traffic jam.

11
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,400
There's indeed been an accident ahead.

12
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,210
This is not part of my plan.

13
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,620
We will be late for work.

14
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,980
Or I can get off

15
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,010
and walk down the congested street.

16
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,400
Then I'll take a taxi.

17
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,829
That's a good idea.

18
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,890
Well, watch your step when you get off.

19
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,860
Okay.

20
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,950
Wait a minute.

21
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,990
Someone is behind.

22
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,640
Ignore him.

23
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,840
Motorcycle robbery
often uses these tactics.

24
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,810
It's dangerous.

25
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,300
Yun Shu.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
It's me.

27
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,250
-Lawyer Meng?
-Mr. Zhang.

28
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,550
Mr. Zhang.

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,960
Stuck in the jam?

30
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,250
Yun Shu.

31
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,340
You'll lose your full
attendance bonus this month

32
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,010
if you're still here.

33
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,890
Mr. Zhang.

34
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,579
I'm getting off.

35
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,410
Mr. Zhang, hey.

36
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,520
Wait a minute.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,660
How can you?

38
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,200
Why did you step on the gas?

39
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,440
Look, your car crashed into my car.

40
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,570
Sorry.

41
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,970
Lawyer Meng?

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,150
I just got into an accident.

43
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,520
As my attorney,

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,530
I now demand that you

45
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,860
deal with this.

46
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,310
Don't you have insurance?

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,640
Besides, it's not office hours.

48
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,579
I won't take it.

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,740
According to our contract,

50
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,250
you need to provide 24/7 services.

51
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,300
Do you need me
to show you the terms?

52
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,870
What are you doing?

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,750
Yun Shu, get on.

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,350
You can ride a motorcycle?

55
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,450
Is there anything I can't do?

56
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,350
Go on.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,000
Hold on.

58
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,150
Sir.

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,190
It's alright.

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,110
Nothing serious.

61
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,820
If you call me for such
trivial matters again,

62
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,530
I'll raise my agency fee.

63
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,610
Do I care?

64
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,790
Next year's consultant

65
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,860
may not be you.

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,040
Did you know?

67
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,370
I heard from Mei

68
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,230
that she saw Lu Yu holding Yun Lan

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,790
and twirling in the office.

70
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,040
By the way, was that Lu Yu who we saw

71
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,750
at the entrance last time?

72
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,950
It should be.

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,210
But I think

74
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,870
there was something between them.

75
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,110
That's why

76
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,200
Lu Yu is now an intern in our company.

77
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,750
And he is Yun Lan's assistant.

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
So clever.

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,040
Yun Lan has some brilliant tricks.

80
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,310
She just played

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,070
a cat-and-mouse game.

82
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,940
Well,

83
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,560
we really need to study from her.

84
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Learn such tricks.

85
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,260
I think you should learn more than that.

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,130
Stop!

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,240
You should work harder

88
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,830
instead of gossiping.

89
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,790
Nevertheless,

90
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,990
I can also understand both of you.

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
After all, any woman would
be jealous and resentful.

92
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,720
Because Yun Lan is better than you.

93
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,430
You should indeed learn from her

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,580
in the aspects of self-motivation
and dedication.

95
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,930
She doesn't waste time
gossiping about others.

96
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,090
I'm indeed pursuing her.

97
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,370
I'm sincere about it.

98
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,530
It's not because of tricks
like cat-and-mouse

99
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,760
as you said.

100
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,570
Who said I didn't use tricks?

101
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,700
Yun Lan.

102
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,300
If not,

103
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,320
how could I have become
Lu Yu's girlfriend?

104
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,690
Why are you still here?

105
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,630
Where's our privacy?

106
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,330
Sorry, Miss Yun.

107
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,880
Sorry!

108
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,850
It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,430
I would like to thank you

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,020
for giving me the courage.

111
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,450
My dear,

112
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,650
you have accepted me.

113
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,620
Why?

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,010
Are you regretting it?

115
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,910
No, of course not.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,790
Yes, I have received it.

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm so sorry to have
troubled you this time.

118
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,800
Okay.

119
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,960
No problem.

120
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,350
Yun Shu.

121
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,750
By the way.

122
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,470
If you are free,

123
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,270
I would like to take my client with me.

124
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,830
Okay.

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,130
Then, see you tonight.

126
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,240
Yun Shu,

127
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,900
I have something to tell you.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,040
I made a decision

129
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,210
without consulting you.

130
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,480
Do you mind?

131
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,590
Mr. Meng.

132
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,470
Are you going to sack me?

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,740
Why would I?

134
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,330
You are the lucky star of our company.

135
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,590
Why would I fire you?

136
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
You scared me.

137
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,000
This is the latest info on Huo Qi.

138
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,800
My cousin's?

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,060
Last time you told me that you
were cheated by your cousin,

140
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,700
I asked someone
to look into him in secret.

141
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,470
But I didn't tell you this matter

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
until I found his whereabouts recently.

143
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,679
Do you

144
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,940
think that I'm being nosey?

145
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,440
No, I don't.

146
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,580
That's good.

147
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,179
I was afraid you would be angry.

148
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,150
No.

149
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,070
Mr. Meng.

150
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,260
Thank you.

151
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,300
Are you free this evening?

152
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm meeting the person
in charge of the investigation.

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,010
You can go with me

154
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
if you are free tonight,

155
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,850
as you have more
information than I have.

156
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,090
This can help us to find the
person we have been looking for.

157
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,220
Okay.

158
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,640
Just like what she said just now.

159
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,540
For this house, she was cheated out of
two million yuan or so by her cousin.

160
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,490
And I have also

161
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,360
prepared some materials today,

162
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,830
including

163
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,800
the personal information of her cousin,

164
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,850
the latest records of his communication

165
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,450
and the invoice for purchasing
the house at that time.

166
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,560
Okay. I have a rough idea of the case.

167
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,440
I will contact you
if there is any update.

168
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,370
Okay.

169
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,950
Thank you for your hard work, Cui.

170
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,550
-Thanks.
-Bye.

171
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,310
Mr. Meng.

172
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,180
Thank you very much for today.

173
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,030
You've thanked me enough.

174
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,420
No need to be so polite.

175
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,490
Regarding this matter,

176
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,270
I will have to thank you
over and over.

177
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,780
Because it's really important for me

178
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,110
to find my cousin.

179
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,130
I know.

180
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,880
I can understand your feeling.

181
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,060
Because

182
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,730
I had a similar experience before.

183
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,190
I was deceived by a person I trusted.

184
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,400
Then?

185
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,260
Then, later on, I began studying law.

186
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,580
I told myself

187
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,650
to believe in the evidence

188
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,450
instead of believing in myself blindly.

189
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,350
Mr. Zhang,

190
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,810
why are you still up?

191
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,520
You are back.

192
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,770
Have you had dinner yet?

193
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,970
I left some dishes for
you in the refrigerator.

194
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,940
I had dinner.

195
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,210
You came back so late.

196
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,610
Worked overtime again?

197
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,180
No,

198
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,170
I went along with Lawyer Meng
to meet a person.

199
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,170
Lawyer Meng?

200
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,880
Lawyer Meng was on purpose.

201
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,300
The Labour Law has clearly defined

202
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,400
the working hours per day

203
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,570
shall not be more than eight hours

204
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,550
Mr. Zhang.

205
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,380
It was Lawyer Meng who helped me

206
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,820
and went with me to meet the person.

207
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,790
He...

208
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,670
accompanied you?

209
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,790
Who did you meet?

210
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,220
Lawyer Meng found an investigator

211
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,520
to look into my cousin's affairs.

212
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,770
I went to meet him

213
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,230
to exchange news and information.

214
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,020
Yun Shu.

215
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,000
If you want to find your cousin

216
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,130
in a fastest manner,

217
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,790
the most effective and quickest way is

218
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,980
to report him to the
public security bureau,

219
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,400
rather than try to solve it
on your own.

220
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,000
I really don't want to send my cousin

221
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,210
to the public security bureau.

222
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,570
But you can't deny

223
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,060
this is the most effective way.

224
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,930
Mr. Zhang,

225
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,020
the guy Mr. Meng found
is also efficient.

226
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,830
Maybe there will be news in a few days.

227
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,480
He just tried to get close to you
on purpose.

228
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,590
Get close to me?

229
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,350
Why?

230
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,070
It doesn't matter.

231
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,230
I just don't want you

232
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,140
to be disappointed.

233
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,400
Mr. Zhang.

234
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,140
Lawyer Meng is quite reliable.

235
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,230
He didn't tell me the truth
before he got the result

236
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
because he was worried
I'd get disappointed.

237
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,190
So what's the result?

238
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,190
Here.

239
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,320
This is information about my cousin.

240
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,250
[You have changed yourself
so much for Wu Suo Wei,]

241
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,440
[and have done so much for him.]

242
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,590
[If you are still unhappy,]

243
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,800
[I, Nan Tian,]

244
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,200
[will not be happy either.]

245
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,420
Cheers!

246
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,160
I could tell,

247
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,930
you got drunk on purpose

248
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,140
that time when you had a drink abroad.

249
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,940
Those few days were the worst
during my time abroad.

250
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,480
They were more difficult than
when I first arrived.

251
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,820
To live a splendid life

252
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,240
in the rush of reality

253
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,140
is what we need to do most.

254
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,230
What nonsense are you talking about?

255
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,300
It's an old Chinese saying.

256
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,340
Your worst days

257
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,250
are also my happiest days.

258
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,320
Happy?

259
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,010
Yeah.

260
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,510
If you hadn't had the bad luck,

261
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,040
we wouldn't have been
acquainted with each other.

262
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,010
Maybe it is.

263
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,280
Cheers!

264
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,090
From today on,

265
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,020
I will help Yun Shu

266
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,070
to find her cousin.

267
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,370
You don't worry about it.

268
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,730
Don't forget,

269
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,190
it was you who let Yun Shu

270
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,880
ask me to help her look
into the affairs of Huo Qi.

271
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,410
It seems that I haven't
made it clear enough.

272
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,590
So, I'm now giving you a
formal notice, Mr. Meng.

273
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,070
You need not concern yourself
with this matter.

274
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,740
Sorry.

275
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,000
This matter is now a personal one.

276
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,250
You have no right to decide it.

277
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,930
Then, I guess I need to remind you

278
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,470
to not cross the line.

279
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,510
Cross the line?

280
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,410
Whose? Yours?

281
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,350
Or Yun Shu's?

282
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,650
It is the line between you and me.

283
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,970
You needn't worry about that.

284
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,030
I will establish a new
relationship with Yun Shu

285
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,670
after your contract with her ends.

286
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,220
How dare you!

287
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,520
Why don't I dare?

288
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,350
The relationship between you and Yun Shu

289
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,240
only stands when in front of your grandpa.

290
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,320
So?

291
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,600
Why can't I help Yun Shu

292
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,240
in private?

293
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,280
Let me take care of Huo Qi's matter.

294
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,430
As a lawyer, I should

295
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,660
help my client solve the problem.

296
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,110
What did you say just now?

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,000
Investigation?

298
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,030
Trace?

299
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,740
Didn't you hear anything I said?

300
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,310
Were you ever in a suspense play before?

301
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
Share your experience with me.

302
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,400
Suspense play?

303
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,230
No, I didn't.

304
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,130
Aren't you a popular actor?

305
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,620
Our company once
tried to recommend me a suspense play,

306
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,080
but the story was too complicated.

307
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,280
I didn't understand it,

308
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,390
so I turned it down.

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,470
I have really overestimated you.

310
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,120
Back to the point.

311
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,770
Why are you doing an investigation?

312
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,780
I'm just trying to help
Yun Shu find her cousin.

313
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,850
Cousin?

314
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,420
It is the cousin who acted as a
matchmaker

315
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,810
and deceived Yun Shu into buying a house?.

316
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,460
Watch your wording.

317
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,400
Matchmaker?

318
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,480
Isn't he a matchmaker?

319
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,750
Without him, could both of you
have gotten married?

320
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,870
Are we not talking about the point?

321
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,510
Go ahead with your story.

322
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,680
According to some information

323
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,130
of Huo Qi provided by Meng Ran,

324
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,250
in the past ten days,

325
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,860
Huo Qi often visited a branch of
Yikang Pharmacy

326
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,600
on Juxian Road to shop.

327
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,210
He went there every three days

328
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,190
and the amount spent each time

329
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,400
was almost the same.

330
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,120
Therefore, according to my analysis,

331
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,850
Huo Qi is most likely injured.

332
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,210
Oh, Nian Nian,

333
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,470
you are so awesome!

334
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,120
You're really a modern-day
Sherlock Holmes!

335
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,940
Stop!

336
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,210
Today happens to be the day
for changing dressings.

337
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,250
I'm going to stake out

338
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,560
and catch Huo Qi.

339
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,290
And then?

340
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,400
And then...

341
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,320
I will persuade him to turn himself in.

342
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,110
I thought Yun Shu didn't want
to involve the police.

343
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,120
Now that he has broken the law,

344
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,160
he should be punished by the law.

345
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,120
This is also my principle.

346
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,570
As a legal worker,

347
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I support you.

348
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,630
But

349
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
the law is no more than human nature!

350
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,370
It seems to make some sense.

351
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,600
Put it this way.

352
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,710
This depends on

353
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,950
what you deem more important,

354
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,520
Yun Shu or your principle?

355
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,350
By the way.

356
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,110
Tell you a piece of happy news!

357
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,630
I'm now your brother-in-law.

358
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,760
An elder?

359
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,390
At your age,

360
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,820
you've been considered

361
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,120
an old artist long ago.

362
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,410
I have been officially upgraded to

363
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,910
Yun Lan's boyfriend.

364
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,670
Yun Lan's boyfriend?

365
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,170
It's true.

366
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,420
Sure enough, Yun Lan

367
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,110
only looks smart.

368
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,830
What are you saying?

369
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,579
Dong Ge, go and eat.

370
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,369
The dishes today are really yummy.

371
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,720
Alright. I'll go and eat then.

372
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,690
Bye.

373
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,069
Could you please
order less dishes next time?

374
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,990
Since I always sponge off your lunch,

375
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,349
I feel kind of bad about it.

376
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,030
Only twin sets

377
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,569
get a discount.

378
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,990
If you feel embarrassed,

379
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,970
you can return the hospitality.

380
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,530
Okay. Then I will treat you next time.

381
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,640
I know a restaurant with...

382
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,640
Gu Xiao?

383
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,670
You know him?

384
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,050
Mum, this is Gu Xiao.

385
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,330
How are you feeling today?

386
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,340
Take good care of yourself.

387
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,290
You needn't worry about
other things.

388
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,110
You're really something.

389
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,180
You have the aunty under control.

390
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,620
You can come here at any time.

391
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,320
Well, being lovable is also a gift,

392
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,290
so I can't help it.

393
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,180
I met Gu Xiao in the hospital yesterday.

394
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,230
He has a relative who is
going to have surgery.

395
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,810
So he has been busy with this matter.

396
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
Relative?

397
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,880
Do you know what relative?

398
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,960
Just a relative.

399
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,730
Why would I ask about that?

400
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,830
No, I mean...

401
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,880
Oh no,

402
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,650
I'm going to be late.

403
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,770
Remember to close the door
when you leave.

404
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,310
Hey, what's the hurry?

405
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,500
Didn't you make an appointment at 11:30?

406
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,270
I want to go Gu Xiao's company
in advance

407
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,500
to give him a surprise.

408
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,600
I will drive you there.

409
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,650
I...

410
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,790
I happen to be going that way.

411
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,550
Really?

412
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
Yes.

413
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,270
[Metro, Railway station]

414
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,930
Why is it so jammed?

415
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,460
Maybe you'd better not go.

416
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,200
Give up eating for fear of choking?

417
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,460
Miss the appointment
due to a traffic jam?

418
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,440
Are you crazy?

419
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,610
Yeah.

420
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
If I wasn't crazy,

421
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,340
would I send you to your date?

422
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,530
If Gu Xiao really wanted
to have a date with you,

423
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,200
he should pick you up.

424
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,390
I'm not that hypocritical.

425
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,660
Forget about it. I'd walk there.

426
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,620
Gu Xiao's company is just ahead.

427
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,220
Sir, drop me off here.

428
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,810
But what's the rush?

429
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,220
Your makeup will run.

430
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,650
Sir, drop me here.

431
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,090
How much?
I'll scan the QR code.

432
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,370
Yi Yi, wait!

433
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,370
Hurry up!

434
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,560
-Yi Yi.
-What's the matter?

435
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,710
Your hair is a mess.

436
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Why not look at yourself in the mirror?

437
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,950
Flawless!

438
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,710
Yi Yi.

439
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,080
Now what?

440
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,510
Can I have a word with you?

441
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,280
Go ahead.

442
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,000
Let me go first.

443
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,480
Gu Xiao will see us.

444
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,450
Um...

445
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,300
Go ahead.

446
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,530
I... Um...

447
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,240
We broke up a long time ago,

448
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,930
but there is always a
place for you in my heart.

449
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,940
I don't want to...

450
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,300
I don't want to make you sad.

451
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,420
I...

452
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,580
I'm not sad.

453
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,300
Actually I'm living a happy life now.

454
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,200
Can you just let me go?

455
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,960
Don't let Gu Xiao see us!

456
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,810
Hurry up!

457
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,590
No, I mean...

458
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,350
Just in case.

459
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,320
What if?

460
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,930
What if you get hurt again?

461
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,600
No way.

462
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,950
I won't let you go.

463
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,620
Lin Nuo.

464
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,840
If you dare,

465
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,510
I will slap you, believe it or not?

466
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,670
Please, don't do that!

467
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,120
Hey.

468
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,570
Don't go to meet him today.

469
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,540
Lin Nuo,

470
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,470
I'm going to lose my temper.

471
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,460
If you continue to behave like
this, we can't even be friends.

472
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,250
Finally.

473
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,210
Excuse me?

474
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,740
I said you can finally go.

475
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,480
I was just kidding.

476
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,050
What's wrong with you today?

477
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,760
Yi Yi.

478
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,670
Why are you here?

479
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,010
Didn't we arrange to meet
at the restaurant?

480
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,780
I wanted to surprise you!

481
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,120
-What do you think of my dress?
-Gu Xiao.

482
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,090
Very nice!

483
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,630
I left my mobile phone in your pocket.

484
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,670
Mobile phone.

485
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,800
Hello, I'm Gu Xiao's girlfriend.

486
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,820
I'm sorry, but

487
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,200
I need to talk to her.

488
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,080
Yi Yi.

489
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,740
You already knew about this, right?

490
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,460
I...

491
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,520
So you came here
to laugh at me, didn't you?

492
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,670
Yi Yi, that's not true.

493
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,710
Just leave me alone.

494
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,540
[Yun Shu, I'm terribly sorry.]

495
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,120
[I was held up by something just now.]

496
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,000
[I will be home at eight.]

497
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,180
[No problem, Mr. Zhang.]

498
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,580
Yun Shu.

499
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,390
Could you do me a favour?

500
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,390
Today I'm going to meet

501
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,460
a very important guest.

502
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,890
Would you please
help me fix up a place for the meeting?

503
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,140
Here is the address.

504
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,370
You need to grab something first

505
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,620
before you go to the restaurant.

506
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,820
The restaurant manager will help you.

507
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,250
Huachu House, Flaubert Western Restaurant.

508
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,550
What do you mean by important guests?

509
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,890
Those vital to the
development of our law firm.

510
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,910
Okay.

511
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,690
I'll see it done.

512
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,270
Hello.

513
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,040
[Hello.]

514
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,140
[Hello, Mr. Zhang.]

515
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,230
[Your cake is ready.]

516
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
[Do you need delivery?]

517
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,850
Yes, please deliver it.

518
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,770
[Will do.]

519
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,300
-I will send you the address later.
-[Okay.]

520
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,480
Please be sure to arrive before 8:00 p.m.

521
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,450
[Got it.]

522
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,330
Okay. Thanks.

523
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,280
Hello.

524
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,820
Miss Yun Shu, right?

525
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,800
Yes.

526
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,840
Leave it to me.

527
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay.

528
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,340
Here you go.

529
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,840
It looks expensive.

530
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,150
Okay, please rest assured.

531
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,350
Mr. Meng has a message for you.

532
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,500
Wait here.

533
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,500
He will be here soon.

534
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,230
Okay.

535
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
Also, Mr. Meng has booked
the whole restaurant

536
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,690
so we cleared the place.

537
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,920
Only one attendant will be left.

538
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,100
After a while, I will leave.

539
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,960
If there is any problem,

540
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,160
you can turn to him.

541
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,140
Thank you.

542
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,830
Okay.

543
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,120
Then please follow me.

544
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,320
-Okay.
-This way.

545
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,110
Huo Qi.

546
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,320
Hello, Sis.

547
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,830
Tonight let's have dinner together.

548
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,560
But tonight...

549
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,630
Mr. Zhang will wait for me at home.

550
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,030
You guys enjoy.

551
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,740
I have a meeting to attend later.
I‘ll hang up.

552
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,720
Okay.

553
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,740
By the way,

554
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,510
I have been busy these days.

555
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,890
I'll give you your birthday
present in a few days.

556
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,860
Thank you, Sis.

557
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,530
Bye.

558
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,010
[Mr. Zhang, sorry! I'm still working.
I'll be home a bit late]

559
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,670
Huo Qi.

560
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,980
Stop!

561
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
[Police]

562
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,490
Since young,

563
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,760
aside from my sister,

564
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,580
he has been the closest person to me.

565
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,110
I just don't want him

566
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,440
to be ruined because of this.

567
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,510
You're here, Mr. Meng.

568
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,430
Sorry, Yun Shu.

569
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,430
I was held up by something.

570
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,220
You had to wait.

571
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,250
It's okay.

572
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,080
I have delivered the item
to the restaurant.

573
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,710
I also decorated the place.

574
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,710
Looks good.

575
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,750
Yun Shu.

576
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,710
What do you say?

577
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,300
It's nice.

578
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,510
Cosy and low-key.

579
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,410
I'm glad you like it.

580
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,070
If there's nothing else,

581
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,330
I'm going to go.

582
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,540
♫ Why are two persons from
different worlds intertwined? ♫

583
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,580
♫ What kind of endings
will the different melody scores bring ♫

584
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,380
♫ Trying to find the secret of the fall ♫

585
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,260
♫ Who can differentiate
between reality and dream? ♫

586
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:49,290
♫ Listening to your footsteps,
getting closer ♫

587
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,730
♫ That is love, slowly,
gradually fermenting ♫

588
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,810
♫ Unsure how to express it,
choosing to be bold ♫

589
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,850
♫ This time, it will be
the most wonderful decision ♫

590
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,360
Happy birthday, Yun Shu.

591
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,970
[Yun Shu, happy birthday]

592
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,330
[Mr. Zhang.]

593
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,780
[Sorry!]

594
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,860
[I'm still working.
I'll be home a bit late.]

595
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,770
Yun Shu.

596
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,650
I like you.

597
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,180
Mr. Meng.

598
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,380
I'm married to Mr. Zhang.

599
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,730
I know.

600
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,720
You and Mr. Zhang have a
contractual marriage lasting one year.

601
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,810
But Yun Shu,

602
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,370
you shouldn't be bound by it.

603
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,620
You're entitled to be loved.

604
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,620
You're entitled to choose who to love.

605
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,000
But...

606
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,380
Zhang Si Nian knows everything.

607
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,990
Before I confessed my love to you,

608
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,540
I told him everything.

609
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,320
Then...

610
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,340
What did Mr. Zhang say?

611
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,530
What did he say?

612
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,850
It doesn't matter.

613
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,270
No.

614
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,110
It is important to me.

615
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,080
Why?

616
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,070
Because I like him.

617
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,600
Yun Shu.

618
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,830
During human interaction,

619
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,600
we develop different affections

620
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
like family ties,

621
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,270
friendship,

622
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,310
love

623
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,410
or

624
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,220
even gratitude.

625
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,730
Gratitude?

626
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,900
When you were at your worst,

627
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,960
you met Zhang Si Nian.

628
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,500
He helped you get out of trouble

629
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,860
and overcome difficulties.

630
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,280
Then,

631
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,130
you held a wedding

632
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,070
and have been together since.

633
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,950
It's not surprising you have
developed feelings toward him.

634
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,300
But you need to know,

635
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,880
this feeling

636
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,440
is not necessarily love.

637
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,540
Then, Mr. Meng.

638
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,330
What is love?

639
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,180
There is no exact answer.

640
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,420
But I know

641
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,440
your affection towards him

642
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,750
is anything but love.

643
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,270
I trust my own feelings more.

644
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,400
Yun Shu.

645
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,170
I truly

646
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,470
hope you can think about it

647
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,660
seriously.

648
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,810
You and Zhang Si Nian.

649
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,890
What exactly is your relationship?

650
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,540
I really have to go.

651
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,130
Then let me see you off.

652
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,100
It's okay.

653
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,000
Bye.

654
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,990
Sir.

655
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,930
Excuse me, can you drive a little faster?

656
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,080
I'm really in a rush.

657
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,750
Girl, this is a taxi,

658
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
not a plane.

659
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,160
Yun Shu.

660
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,600
Yun Shu.

661
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,570
Mr. Meng?

662
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,980
Sorry.

663
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,590
I was too selfish just now

664
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,130
and didn't consider your feelings.

665
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,060
Love.

666
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,210
There has never been a
standard answer to that question.

667
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,690
Yun Shu,

668
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,450
I respect your feelings.

669
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,650
But meanwhile,

670
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,580
I also respect my own feelings.

671
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,360
Every year,

672
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,650
how many times will you
replace your phone?

673
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,880
Each year, I...

674
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,850
Professor Zhang.

675
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,970
Where are you going?

676
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,980
I'm going to pick up my wife.

677
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,360
You've forgotten your phone.

678
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,350
Thank you.

679
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,720
Go up.
